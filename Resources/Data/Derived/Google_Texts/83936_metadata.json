The Fraser Valley, with its Winter Park ski area, slipped into the shadow of rapid resort development over in Dillon, Silverthorne and Eagle Vail.\n\nNow that\u2019s changing back in favor of the proximity of Fraser and Grand County, according to brokers involved in Fraser Valley resorts. \u201cWinter Park and Fraser have been there a long time, but their time is coming,\u201d says Dale Schossow, broker associate with Fuller Sotheby\u2019s International. \u201cSummer recreation is exceptionally strong there, and you can get there in a much shorter commute.\u201d\n\nThose assets start with the scenery \u2013 wide vistas of the craggy Indian Peaks, and broad areas of rugged national forest that are very accessible. \u201cThere\u2019s a rural agricultural ambience that you don\u2019t see in Summit or Eagle,\u201d adds Schossow, pointing to wide expanses of grazing land along the valley, opening up vistas of the back ranges.\n\n\u201cThis is a great place,\u201d Schossow notes, adding that he sees properties being comparatively more affordable in Grand County, as opposed to areas further west. \u201cAnd all the amenities are there.\u201d\n\nThose include four golf courses, boating on Granby Reservoir, the Fraser River, and the unpretentious resort flavor of Grand Lake \u2013 gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park. Those aren\u2019t to mention Winter Park and Mary Jane ski areas, along with the family-styled ski experience offered at Ski Granby Ranch, 15 miles beyond Winter Park.\n\nAs with many mountain properties following the 2009 downturn, agents see the market in the Fraser Valley as transitional \u2013 but showing signs of life now, particularly in their relative lack of new home inventory this summer, something that\u2019s important to buyers who are lured by the recreation and want something right away.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of old stuff and not a lot of new,\u201d says Dana Keller, director of sales for Rendezvous, the master planned resort in Winter Park, sponsoring a Run for Independence in Winter Park at 8 a.m. tomorrow, and the Rendezvous Rock-n-Ride bike tour and music festival next weekend. At Rendezvous, buyers can find two offerings that can be ready soon: a ProngHorn triplex with 2-car garage from the low $400s, available by Labor Day; and a new \u201cchalet\u201d single-family product, 2,150 square feet with three bedrooms on individual levels, and what Keller calls \u2018amazing\u2019 views of Byers Peak. Chalets are from $650,000 \u2013 add a $20,000 lot premium on the one available late this month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an active market now,\u201d adds Janet Mitchell, director of marketing with Village Homes, which sold two of its new cabins with walkout lower levels to buyers at Granby Ranch this past week. Village has two more of those homes on ski-in ski-out lots under way now.\n\n\u201cWe saw a burst of activity in ski season that cleared inventory out,\u201d says Houston at Ten Mile Creek, just off Highway 40 at the entrance to Granby Ranch. He has six condos that buyers could find ready this summer from $187,000 \u2013 providing four-season amenities of Granby Ranch as part of its HOA agreement. \u201cFront Range families are coming to view this as their backyard,\u201d had added, noting that the parking lot at Ten Mile Creek was already filling this week.\n\n\u201cWe probably get a few more purchasers in ski season, but people want to be here in summer, and there\u2019s no tunnel traffic.\u201d To reach the Fraser Valley, head west on I-70 past Idaho Springs to U.S. 40 and continue west 28 miles to Winter Park, 43 miles to Granby Ranch.\n\nFraser Valley in Grand County, including resort areas of Winter Park, Fraser, Granby Ranch and Grand Elk; four-season recreation including trout fishing, mountain biking, boating & mountaineering. From Denver, head west on I-70 past Idaho Spgs to U.S. 40, west 28 miles to Winter Park, or 43 miles to Granby\n\nFrom $180s to $800s\n\nRendezvousColorado.com\n\nVillageHomes.com\n\n10MileCreek.com\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him at mark@samuelsonassoc.com.You can see all of Mark Samuelson\u2019s columns at DenverPost.com/RealEstate.
