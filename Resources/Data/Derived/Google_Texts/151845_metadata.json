Terry Branstad and Iowa\u2019s largely Republican-controlled legislature have blocked efforts to raise it to a more realistic level. With the state gridlocked, the Johnson County Board of Supervisors did what cities and counties across the US are doing: It voted last month to raise the county\u2019s minimum wage to $10.10 by 2017 \u2014 and other counties are likely to follow.\n\nThe increase is smart policy for addressing the needs of the county\u2019s workforce \u2014 and contrary to suggestions by some opponents \u2014 is well within the county\u2019s legislative powers.\n\nIn the past year, almost one-fifth of Johnson County residents had an income below the poverty level. More than 80 percent of Johnson County families with incomes below the poverty level have children, and over 4,000 County households receive government-funded food assistance. Nationally, real median wages declined for workers by 4 percent from 2009\u20132014 despite growth for the economy, as a whole, and low-wage workers were hit hardest. Workers whose real median wages fall in the bottom 20 percent saw the value of those waged drop 5.7 percent.\n\nAs the wage crisis deepens for workers, especially in high-cost areas, cities and counties are raising the minimum wage for their residents. Almost 30 cities or counties, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Kansas City, Chicago, and Louisville, have successfully adopted local minimum wage laws in the last four years. Cities and counties are also increasingly calling for a minimum wage of $15 or more.\n\nThis nationwide trend is not surprising given state and federal inaction, as well as mounting evidence that raising the minimum wage boosts earnings and employment without hurting businesses. In San Jose, for example, the Wall Street Journal reported that employment gains in the city exceeded gains in the entire state of California.\n\nThe recent evidence confirms what economists studying minimum wage increases for 20 years have concluded: Higher city minimum wages have boosted earnings without significant evidence of job losses. One explanation is that the bulk of minimum wage jobs are in fields such as home health care, restaurants, and child care that serve city-based customers.\n\nThe Johnson County ordinance marks the first time that a city or county in Iowa has raised the minimum wage, but opponents of the law \u2014 like Iowa Labor Commissioner Michael Mauro \u2014 have suggested that localities in Iowa may not have the legal power to raise wages. However, careful analysis shows that the Legislature granted Iowa counties broad police powers to address local needs \u2014 powers that comfortably include the power to adopt a higher local minimum wage when local conditions so warrant.\n\nThe Iowa Supreme Court has made clear that such local authority is broad, and, except where local action is barred by state law, localities may adopt legislation to set standards for their communities. As the Iowa Legislature has not acted to restrict local authority around minimum wages, localities remain free to adopt local minimum wages that are higher than the state-wide wage. Lawmakers and experts in many other states have reached this same conclusion.\n\nThe Johnston County\u2019s Board of Supervisors estimates that the minimum wage increase could affect as many as 10,000 workers. Ultimately, Johnson County has every reason (both legal and policy-wise) to stand by its efforts to step in where the state and federal governments have failed to help its poorest residents. A higher minimum wage in the county will bring many workers one important step closer to economic recovery and security.\n\nLAURA HUIZAR is a staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project.
