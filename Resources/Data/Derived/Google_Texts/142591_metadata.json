Twelve new episodes are on the schedule with Nugent\u2019s appearance slated for the third show. Nugent is not the only big draw for the upcoming season. Like she did in last year\u2019s inaugural season, Palin will take viewers across the United States to share inspiring stories of outdoor enthusiasts, personalities, craftsmen, and other Americans who go out of their way to help others.\n\nAmazing America will visit the Warrior Games in Colorado Springs, featuring archery, shooting, and wheelchair basketball competition for injured veterans; discuss \u201cOperation Home,\u201d a program that builds houses for veterans, with former Army infantryman and Dancing with the Stars winner JR Martinez; travel to Maine to learn training techniques from a Wilderness Rescue team; and go behind-the-scenes at the Bristol Motor Speedway and the city\u2019s bomb squad, as well as many other adventures.\n\nIn addition to Palin serving as the host, comedian Jerry Carroll, a season one co-host, returns as well. Miss USA 2006 Tara Conner will join Carroll this time around as a co-host in the field.\n\nThe first season of Amazing America with Sarah Palin helped propel Sportsman Channel to triple-digit growth among households and key male demographics. The lineup for season two looks poised to grow the audience for the show and the network as a whole even further.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Season of Sarah Palin's Show Features Ted Nugent, Wheelchair Basketball, and Miss USA", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "New Season of Sarah Palin's Show Features Ted Nugent, Wheelchair Basketball, and Miss USA", "title": "New Season of Sarah Palin's Show Features Ted Nugent, Wheelchair Basketball, and Miss USA - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Sara-Palin-Amazing-America-Graphic.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2014/12/19/new-season-of-sarah-palins-show-features-ted-nugent-wheelchair-basketball-and-miss-usa/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Season of Sarah Palin's Show Features Ted Nugent, Wheelchair Basketball, and Miss USA", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Sara-Palin-Amazing-America-Graphic.jpg", "title": "New Season of Sarah Palin's Show Features Ted Nugent, Wheelchair Basketball, and Miss USA - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart Sports, Sarah Palin, Tea party,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Sports", "published_time": "2014-12-19T11:16:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Sports,Tea party,Sarah Palin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4dbb\"", "article_summary": "The first season of Amazing America with Sarah Palin helped propel Sportsman Channel to triple-digit growth among households and key male demographics.\nLike she did in last year\u2019s inaugural season, Palin will take viewers across the United States to share inspiring stories of outdoor enthusiasts, personalities, craftsmen, and other Americans who go out of their way to help others.\nThe lineup for season two looks poised to grow the audience for the show and the network as a whole even further.\nIn addition to Palin serving as the host, comedian Jerry Carroll, a season one co-host, returns as well.\nMiss USA 2006 Tara Conner will join Carroll this time around as a co-host in the field."}
