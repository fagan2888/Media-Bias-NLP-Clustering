CHICAGO (AP) â€” Malachi Richardson scored 21 of his 23 points in the second half, and Syracuse extended its improbable run to the Final Four with a 68-62 victory over top-seeded Virginia on Sunday.

The Orange (23-13) were on the NCAA Tournament bubble after a rough closing stretch, but slipped in as a 10 seed before storming to its first Final Four since 2013 and No. 6 overall. It comes at the end of a challenging season for coach Jim Boheim, who was suspended for nine games as the result of an NCAA investigation.

Michael Gbinije and freshman Tyler Lydon each scored 11 points for Syracuse, and Tyler Roberson finished with 10 points and eight rebounds.

London Perrantes scored 15 of his 18 points in the first half for Virginia (29-8), which blew a 16-point lead in the second half.
