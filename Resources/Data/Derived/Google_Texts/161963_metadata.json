Consider what administration officials announcing the new exemption for medium-sized employers had to say about firms that might fire workers to get under the threshold and avoid hugely expensive new requirements of the law. Obama officials made clear in a press briefing that firms would not be allowed to lay off workers to get into the preferred class of those businesses with 50 to 99 employees. How will the feds know what employers were thinking when hiring and firing? Simple. Firms will be required to certify to the IRS \u2013 under penalty of perjury \u2013 that ObamaCare was not a motivating factor in their staffing decisions. To avoid ObamaCare costs you must swear that you are not trying to avoid ObamaCare costs. You can duck the law, but only if you promise not to say so.\n\n[\u201cThat's the good thing about being president. I can do whatever I want.\u201d \u2013 President Obama joking about getting a restricted-access tour of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello.]\n\nWar of words - With millions of insurance cancellations and workers dumped from employer-based policies due to ObamaCare, a relatively narrow exemption for medium-sized employers might sound like a trifling thing. But to Obama Democrats desperate to hold the Senate in the face of simmering anger over the botched rollout and false promises of the law, any little bit helps. And having the IRS serve as the talking-point enforcer for businesses tempted to speak out about firings under the law will sure help message discipline. Remember, the administration wants to focus on Americans being \u201ctransitioned\u201d to ObamaCare not dumped from existing policies, and \u201cfreed\u201d from having to work in order to get insurance rather than quitting their jobs in order to get free coverage.\n\nWatch Fox: Chief National Correspondent Jim Angle considers what the delay could mean for those who have seen and may face policy cancellations this year.\n\n[WSJ: \u201cChanging an unambiguous statutory mandate requires the approval of Congress, but then this President has often decided the law is whatever he says it is. His Administration's cavalier notions about law enforcement are especially notable here for their bias for corporations over people. The White House has refused to suspend the individual insurance mandate, despite the harm caused to millions who are losing their previous coverage. Liberals say the law isn't harming jobs or economic growth, but everything this White House does screams the opposite.\u201d]\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., discusses ObamaCare\u2019s latest delay in the 10 a.m. ET hour]\n\nObamaCare pumps up taxes on gym-goers - WNYW: \u201cSome people who are members of the health club Planet Fitness are finding their membership costs have gone up because of [ObamaCare]\u2026A sign posted at a Falls Church, Va. location says \u2018Holders of Black Card memberships will be required to pay a tax on these memberships Starting January 1, 2014 as required by the implementation of provisions of [ObamaCare]\u2026This is not a change in your membership fee but rather a tax required by the government. The reason these accounts are forced to charge the new tax is because they include the option for members to tan at the clubs. Obamacare has a tax on tanning salons. It doesn't matter if the member uses or does not use the tanning facilities.\u201d\n\nDEBT LIMIT VOTE ON HOUSE DOCKET\n\nPushed by a winter storm forecast for Washington, the House will vote as early as today on a so-called \u201cclean\u201d bill to raise the federal borrowing limit. A source familiar with House Republican discussions told Fox News a plan floated by the GOP to include restoration of funds cut from military pensions in an earlier budget deal simply didn\u2019t have the votes, so they will deal with the pensions in a separate measure. Republican sources say that they will provide some votes for the \u201cclean\u201d bill to raise the debt limit, but expect Democrats to pick up the bulk of the yeas.\n\nTake this phone and shove it - Breitbart\u2019s Jonathan Strong offers this curtain-lifter on the debt limit vote: \u201cAfter storming out of the GOP's debt ceiling meeting and pacing furiously 100 yards down a hallway deep the bowels of the Capitol, South Carolina Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan wheeled around to face a couple reporters that had managed to keep up with him. \u2018Why don\u2019t you talk to my son?\u2019 Duncan asked, pointing angrily at his black iPhone. \u2018Tell him about the debt that he\u2019s going to pay. $17.3 trillion right now. This is him on the phone. He's a Clemson student, I\u2019d be glad for you to explain how he's going to pay that back,\u2019 Duncan added, his voice full of sarcasm.\u201d\n\nBAIER TRACKS: LOSING FOCUS IN AFGHANISTAN\u2026\u201cA new video from the Wall Street Journal would suggest that the Obama administration is as adrift and uncertain about its Afghanistan policy as it is about the changing rules for the president\u2019s health law. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif., posed a simple question for three of the Obama administration\u2019s top Afghanistan specialists: How many American troops have been killed in Afghanistan this year? None of the witnesses at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Afghanistan had an answer. This is pretty stunning.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.\n\nSENATE PANEL DIVES DEEPER ON TARGETED KILLINGS\n\nAs controversy builds over reports that President Obama may order the killing of an American citizen with links to al Qaeda, two of the nation\u2019s intelligence chiefs will testify this morning before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will be pressed on the administration\u2019s policies on the use of drone aircraft for killing citizens without trial.\u2014Watch Fox: National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the drone debate.\n\n[\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary that this story is leaked by, I think, four American officials. If I were the administration, if I were the president I would be very concerned that four American officials are talking about this to the press off the record. That\u2019s a serious breach of, you know, protecting our national security. If this guy has any brains he\u2019s already figured out who he is and he\u2019s hiding somewhere.\u201d\u2014 Former N.Y.

In that regard, he gives us a valuable look into ourselves \u2013 we the hollow men, the stuffed men of dry voices and whispers.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

From KATU: \u201cEarly in its life, Cover Oregon was given a $48 million \u2018early innovator\u2019 grant from the federal government. That amount would later grow to $59 million\u2026. To keep the money flowing, the website would have to hit specific benchmarks between 2011 and 2013. The state needed to show the feds it had picked a company to provide software and technical assistance; it had to demonstrate that the website was safe from hackers; and, most importantly, it had to show that people could actually sign up for insurance on the website\u2026. Despite the fact the website still doesn\u2019t work today, the KATU Investigators found evidence [state contractors] reported to the federal government that the project was going well.\u201d The deepening troubles could prove to be a problem for Gov. John Kitzhaber, D-Ore., and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., both running for re-election in November.\n\nTEAM CHRISTIE HAULS IN CASH\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s second full month at the helm of the Republican Governors Association was a cash bonanza, despite his wrestling with political scandal. RGA communications director Gail Gitcho told Fox News that in January, Christie and company \"raised $6 million... more than twice as much that has ever been raised during the same month in RGA history, and twice as much that was raised in the last comparable cycle (2010) in the same month.\"\n\n[USA Today: \u201cChristie\u2019s latest attempt to recapture his pre-scandal prominence as a top fundraiser and potential 2016 presidential candidate is taking him to Chicago on Tuesday for a prestigious economic group summit followed by private meetings with donors and a fundraising dinner\u2026\u201d]\n\nMore, more, more - AP: \u201cA New Jersey legislative panel intensified efforts Monday to force two key aides to Gov. Chris Christie to turn over documents related to traffic gridlock near the George Washington Bridge as it authorized 18 more subpoenas. Recipients in the third round of subpoenas include executives at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that runs the bridge; a failed Supreme Court nominee who Christie later named to the bridge agency; and the state police aviation unit, which could provide information about Christie\u2019s helicopter travel during the time the lanes were blocked for four days in September.\u201d\n\nCRUZ HEADING BACK TO THE HAWKEYE STATE\n\nWaPo: \u201cSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a tea party favorite, will speak at a homeschooling rally in Iowa next month, signaling his continued interest in a possible 2016 presidential bid. The event, which will take place on March 18 at the Iowa state capitol in Des Moines, will be hosted by the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators (NICHE), a politically-engaged group that has previously hosted presidential contenders\u2026 Cruz traveled to Iowa several times last year, including a stop in October, when he headlined the Iowa GOP\u2019s Ronald Reagan dinner. During that visit, he also traveled to western Iowa, where he went on a pheasant hunt with Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a key political figure in the run-up to the Iowa Republican caucuses, the first nominating contest of the presidential race.\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen.

From the committee: \u201cThe truth is that Democrats slashed Medicare Advantage to pay for ObamaCare. Nearly 15 million seniors nationwide (close to 30% of all Medicare beneficiaries) rely on Medicare Advantage plans for their Medicare coverage. Many of these are low-income seniors who choose these options because they can\u2019t afford the Medigap policies that more financially secure seniors use.\u201d Targets include Sens. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Kay Hagan, D-N.C., Mary Landrieu, D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., Mark Udall, D-Colo., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Mark Warner, D-Va., and Reps.

Marco Rubio came to support the man he called Pinellas County's next congressman on Monday, and David Jolly responded that \u2018it's the highest honor of my life to have your endorsement\u2019\u2026 State Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp said it showed Jolly \u2018is siding with the most dysfunctional fringe and opposing bipartisan, common sense solutions to the most pressing challenges facing our country\u2019\u2026 Mail ballots already have been sent out in the race. Election Day is March 11. The special election was called after the death in October of Republican U.S. Rep. C.W.

Bossie said he also wished he had made more of an issue of Hillary\u2019s support of a government-run health insurance regime. \u201cIf you know anything about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health- are policies back then, single payer \u2013 using Medicare to expand single payer \u2013 that is what she believed.\u201d Watch the full interview from \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d\n\nGOP: GRIMES MUST RETURN CASH FROM SEX SCANDAL FIGURES\n\nThe Republican Party of Kentucky called on Democratic Senate frontrunner Alison Lundergan Grimes to return campaign donations from former Democratic state Rep. John Arnold, who resigned last year amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment, as well as actor and director Woody Allen, now at the center of allegations of sexual abuse. \u201cIf Alison Lundergan Grimes really cares about standing up for Kentucky women, she should return both former Representative John Arnold\u2019s and Woody Allen\u2019s donations to her campaign,\u201d said Kelsey Cooper, spokeswoman for the state GOP. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t return the donations, we can only assume she either condones sexual harassment and disgustingly inappropriate behavior in the workplace, or she\u2019s more concerned with her liberal allies\u2019 campaign cash than the women of Kentucky.\u201d Grimes is slated to receive former President Bill Clinton for a campaign visit later this month.\n\nUNIONS SPEND BIG TO PICK FILNER REPLACEMENT\n\nVoters in San Diego today will pick a replacement for ousted Mayor Bob Filner, a former Democratic congressman forced from city hall for gross sexual misconduct.

Her obituaries have mostly focused on her wildly successful pre-World War II career as a child star, but Americans have also been reminded of Black\u2019s second career as a conservative politician and diplomat. Her twenty years of service included her appointment in 1969 as delegate to the U.N. General Assembly, and ambassadorships to Ghana under PresidentGerald Ford and Czechoslovakia during the first Bush administration. Her trajectory follows that of another actor turned politician, Ronald Reagan. In fact, both had a miserable flop of a movie to thank for their success in later life. \u201cThat Hagan Girl\u201d was supposed to cement Black as an adult star following her success as a love-sick teenager opposite Cary Grant in \u201cThe Bachelor and the Bobbysoxer.\u201d Eager to make it a hit, studio bosses strong-armed Reagan into accepting his role as role as Black\u2019s character\u2019s putative father/benefactor/lover (yuck). Reagan, not wanting to play a part that might give even Woody Allen the creeps, sought mercy in the form of a re-write, but to no avail. Filming was a nightmare, with Regan catching viral pneumonia and missing the birth of his child with then-wife Jane Wyman. The movie was such a famous flop that it sealed Reagan\u2019s reputation as a b-list actor, rather than the a-lister he seemed to be in films like \u201cSana Fe Trail\u201d and \u201cKings Row.\u201d Reagan would later cite the box-office debacle as a turning point in his life and career, beginning his pivot away from acting and toward politics. The terrible film also derailed Black\u2019s hopes of becoming a leading lady, and she retired from Hollywood soon after. Twenty years later, both Reagan and Black had new spouses and new careers in politics, him as a candidate for California governor and her running for a House seat.\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cGenerally speaking, you get past the next election by changing your polices, by announcing new initiatives \u2013 but not by wantonly changing the law lawlessly.
