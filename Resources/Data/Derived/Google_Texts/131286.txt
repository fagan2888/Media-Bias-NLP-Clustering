As the pres­id­ent pre­pares to sign an ex­ec­ut­ive or­der rais­ing the min­im­um wage for some fed­er­al con­tract­ors, an­oth­er of his sig­na­ture ini­ti­at­ives is quietly clos­ing the in­come dis­par­ity in Amer­ica, a new study finds.

The Af­ford­able Care Act will boost the av­er­age in­comes of the bot­tom fifth of wage earners, ac­cord­ing to a Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion re­port, by nearly 6 per­cent in 2016.

Health in­sur­ance premi­um as­sist­ance and ex­pan­ded Medi­caid cov­er­age are two primary factors con­trib­ut­ing to the rise, the re­port says. Both pro­vi­sions tar­get low wage earners, and the cost of the pro­grams are off­set by taxes dis­trib­uted across the pop­u­la­tion.

Such a “re­dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth” has been de­mon­ized by Re­pub­lic­ans, but more than $1 tril­lion will be col­lec­ted from high- and middle-in­come earners to be made avail­able as sub­sidies for people earn­ing be­low 400 per­cent of the fed­er­al poverty line — a big step to­ward mak­ing in­come more equal in the U.S. Payroll taxes and the “Ca­dillac” tax on ex­pens­ive health in­sur­ance plans are two Obama­care pro­vi­sions that tar­get the highest wage earners in the coun­try.

But low-in­come, eld­erly, and minor­ity Amer­ic­ans will also be ad­versely af­fected by cuts to the Medi­care pro­gram, as well as by the de­cision by roughly half of states to opt out of Medi­caid ex­pan­sion. It’s partly why the bot­tom tenth of wage earners will only see an av­er­age in­come rise of roughly 7 per­cent as the law takes ef­fect.

“The Af­ford­able Care Act does not do a lot for the bot­tom decile be­cause we’ve already taken care of the bot­tom decile,” said Mar­ilyn Moon, dir­ect­or of the non­profit, non­par­tis­an Amer­ic­an In­sti­tutes for Re­search Cen­ter on Aging. “What it does is fill in the be­ne­fits for more Amer­ic­ans at the bot­tom.”
