Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas is reportedly dropping its preferred provider organization plans for customers who obtain insurance outside of an employer.

The Dallas Morning News reports that close to 367,000 Texans will be affected because the state’s largest insurer paid out $400 million more in claims in 2014 than it brought in for premiums. BCBSTX has already announced a planned 19.97 percent hike in rates for plans purchased through Obamacare during the next enrollment period—The News reports dropping PPO plans was an attempt to avoid a larger rate increase in 2016.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas will continue providing HMO plans, which included a more limited network of providers selected by the insurer.
