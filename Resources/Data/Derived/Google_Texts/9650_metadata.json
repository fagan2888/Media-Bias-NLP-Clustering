The schedule includes two-a-day practices for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and also a scrimmage on Saturday.\n\nMacIntyre said the players seem to be holding up through it all.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing a good job of that,\u201d he said. \u201cOur nutrition is good \u2014 the way we\u2019re feeding them, giving them Gatorade and some other supplements morning and night. So they\u2019re in good shape.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a mental aspect to two-a-days. You have to mentally fight through it.\u201d\n\nThe morning practice was highlighted by senior defensive lineman Juda Parker screaming at teammates to get focused. Parker is a team captain.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a leader does,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThere are different ways to motivate at different times. I think they responded to that.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs football players fighting through dog days of preseason camp", "title": "CU Buffs football players fighting through dog days of preseason camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/12/cu-buffs-football-players-fighting-through-dog-days-of-preseason-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140731__mike-macintyre-training-campp1.jpg", "height": 506}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140731__mike-macintyre-training-campp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T14:49:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:10:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b97\"", "article_summary": "BOULDER \u2014 The dog days of preseason camp may be taking their toll a bit on the Colorado football team.\n\u201cThen (the defense) got it going \u2014 they had to run a few laps and woke up,\u201d MacIntyre said.\nCU coach Mike MacIntyre acknowledged Tuesday that the defense was \u201csluggish\u201d early during the morning practice.\n\u201cWe should have run them earlier.\u201dThis week could be considered the most demanding portion of the month-long camp.\n\u201cOur nutrition is good \u2014 the way we\u2019re feeding them, giving them Gatorade and some other supplements morning and night."}
