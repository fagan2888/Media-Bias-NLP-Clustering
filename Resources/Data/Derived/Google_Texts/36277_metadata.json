(AP) - Two candidates deeply rooted in Appalachia - one a retired school teacher and state lawmaker, the other a bankruptcy attorney and political newcomer - are competing in the down-ballot campaign to become Kentucky\u2019s next state treasurer.\n\nDemocrat Rick Nelson of Middlesboro touts his experience in the classroom and in Kentucky\u2019s Capitol as a state representative. Republican Allison Ball of Prestonsburg says her background helping people through bankruptcies has prepared her to be a watchdog of state finances.\n\nIf elected, Ball also wants to be more assertive in a job she says has been underutilized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just been a rubber stamp position for a long time,\u201d she said.\n\nNelson wants to reach out more to Kentuckians to promote financial literacy and reconnect people with their lost property.\n\n\u201cMost people will never get to go to Frankfort, so I think we need to take Frankfort to the citizens,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nThe treasurer balances the state\u2019s checkbook, collects and returns unclaimed property and handles other financial duties.\n\nThe office has about 30 employees and an annual budget of $3.1 million. The treasurer also serves on the state lottery board, the State Investment Commission and the Kentucky Teachers\u2019 Retirement System board of directors.\n\nThe incumbent state treasurer, Democrat Todd Hollenbach, is finishing his second term and can\u2019t serve again because of term limits.\n\nNelson and Ball won competitive primaries in the spring to set up their election contest on Nov. 3.\n\nTheir differences are generational as well. Nelson is 61; Ball is 34.\n\nNelson taught school in Bell County for nearly 30 years. He is a 15-year state lawmaker and chairman of the House Labor and Industry Committee. Ball is a former Floyd County prosecutor now practicing bankruptcy law in eastern Kentucky.\n\nAs part of the treasurer\u2019s watchdog role, Ball said she would be willing to block disbursement of improperly spent funds.\n\n\u201cI think there are times when a state treasurer might not write a check if it\u2019s not appropriated correctly,\u201d she said. \u201cI think somebody needs to take that constitutional obligation seriously.\u201d\n\nBall pointed to the state\u2019s use of $32 million from settlements with two pharmaceutical companies to expand drug treatment as an example. Ball said her complaint was with the process, not the use of money to combat drug abuse.\n\nGOP lawmakers have complained the decision bypassed the legislature\u2019s authority to decide how money should be spent.\n\nThe case against the drug companies was handled by state Attorney General Jack Conway\u2019s office. Conway, now the Democratic nominee for governor, has said he was complying with a court order to spend the money for public health purposes, specifically for substance abuse treatment.\n\nNelson called that an \u201coutstanding\u201d use of the money.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do? Are you going to say, \u2018Judge, I\u2019m overruling you,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAs a lawmaker, Nelson has promoted efforts to emphasize financial literacy in schools and said he would continue that campaign if he reaches the treasurer\u2019s office. Nelson said he would like to venture back into classrooms occasionally to teach high school students how to manage their money.\n\n\u201cEverything we can do to help our high school students with money matters, I think that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.\n\nNelson also wants more of a grassroots effort to help people reclaim lost property. The state holds more than $300 million worth of unclaimed property. Ball also promised to emphasize that part of the treasurer\u2019s job.\n\nBall said she wants to make it easier for people to track spending of public funds through greater transparency.\n\nNelson said his teaching background would bring an important perspective to the teachers\u2019 retirement system board, as state officials grapple with the state\u2019s teacher pension woes. \u201cThat\u2019s right down my line of work,\u201d he said.\n\nBall had more campaign cash heading into the final weeks before the election. Ball had nearly $68,000 on hand, while Nelson had $13,188, according to campaign-finance reports. Nelson spent more leading up to the final weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two candidates deeply rooted in Appalachia - one a retired school teacher and state lawmaker, the other a bankruptcy attorney and political newcomer - are competing in the down-ballot campaign to become Kentucky's next state treasurer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two candidates deeply rooted in Appalachia - one a retired school teacher and state lawmaker, the other a bankruptcy attorney and political newcomer - are competing in the down-ballot campaign to become Kentucky\u2019s next state treasurer.", "title": "Treasurer\u2019s race pits lawmaker vs. political newcomer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/17/treasurers-race-pits-lawmaker-vs-political-newcome/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/17/2b1a0b96ae64142e850f6a70670000b7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/17/2b1a0b96ae64142e850f6a70670000b7.jpg", "description": "Two candidates deeply rooted in Appalachia - one a retired school teacher and state lawmaker, the other a bankruptcy attorney and political newcomer - are competing in the down-ballot campaign to beco", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Treasurer\u2019s race pits lawmaker vs. political newcomer"}, "Author": "BRUCE SCHREINER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc126\"", "article_summary": "Nelson wants to reach out more to Kentuckians to promote financial literacy and reconnect people with their lost property.\nThe incumbent state treasurer, Democrat Todd Hollenbach, is finishing his second term and can\u2019t serve again because of term limits.\n\u201cI think there are times when a state treasurer might not write a check if it\u2019s not appropriated correctly,\u201d she said.\nLOUISVILLE, Ky.
