When we gutted the bottom of the building, I had my sons pull copper, wood, nails etc. and we took everything to be recycled or reused in some way. The employees also embrace the conservation mentality. They are onboard and several of them voluntarily take items like glass and cans to the convenience centers rather than putting them in the trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy goal is to offer the residents of our community an alternative to driving to Nashville for organic and other healthy choices,\u201d she added.\n\nTree of Life Center also recycles cardboard, plastic and paper with Bi-County Solid Waste Management. Some of the food is donated to local hunger relief organizations like Loaves and Fishes and Manna Caf\u00e9. They also compost for chickens owned by one of the employees. In addition, energy efficiency and using reclaimed materials was a major part of the remodeling process.\n\nThe Tree of Life Center is located at 30 Crossland Avenue. They offer a variety of local farm fresh produce, grass fed beef, chicken and duck, hand crafted artisan teas and organic foods as well as weekly cooking classes.\n\nFor more information, visit them on Facebook or at www.treeoflifeclarksville.com\n\nFor information on how your business can participate in the Green Certification Program, contact Michelle Newell at manewell@mcgtn.net.\n\nSections\n\nTopics", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montgomery County, TN \u2013 The latest business to earn Clarksville-Montgomery County Green Certified and host a Green Ribbon Cutting is the Tree of Life Cente", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Clarksville, TN Online", "description": "Montgomery County, TN \u2013 The latest business to earn Clarksville-Montgomery County Green Certified and host a Green Ribbon Cutting is the Tree of Life Center.
