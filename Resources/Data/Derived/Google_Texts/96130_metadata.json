The decrease includes plans sold on and off the federal marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act, Highmark officials said.\n\n\u201cOur share in the market was considerably higher than we had anticipated in 2014 and 2015, and I think now what you're seeing is a market adjustment,\u201d said Alexis Miller, Highmark's senior vice president of individual and small group markets.\n\nAcross all its commercial insurance products, including employer-based and Medicare Advantage plans, Highmark lost about 5 percent of its members in 2015, the insurer announced. Highmark is Pennsylvania's largest insurer and the fourth-largest Blue Cross Blue Shield-affiliated company in the country, said Tony Benevento, Highmark's senior vice president of regional markets.\n\nTo help cut the losses, Highmark increased premiums by an average of 20 percent for 2016, officials said. UPMC Health Plan offered lower premiums and grew its share of the individual market on and off the federal exchange to about 123,000 people, according to UPMC Health Plan spokeswoman Gina Pferdehirt.\n\nUPMC last month said the rapid growth of its insurance plans signals there is no longer a dominant insurer in Western Pennsylvania. Instead, UPMC Health Plan, Highmark and other insurers share equal parts of the market. UPMC has said that's partly because of the steady growth of its health plan, which grew from about 813,000 members in 2014 to 1.095 million members in 2016.\n\nAbout 1.4 million people living in Western Pennsylvania have commercial Highmark insurance, according to Highmark.\n\nHighmark's enrollment total included changes from the Affordable Care Act's second open enrollment period, which ended Jan. 31.\n\nHighmark has taken aggressive actions to cut losses related to its federal marketplace plans, shrinking networks of hospitals and doctors, reducing or eliminating commissions for brokers who sell the plans, and reducing by 4.5 percent what it pays doctors to treat patients with the plans.\n\nHighmark's total commercial enrollment, including people who live in West Virginia and Delaware and those who live in other states but are employed by a business based in Highmark's geographical region, was about 5.2 million people, Benevento said.\n\nJames McTiernan, area vice president for national consulting firm Arthur J. Gallagher, said consumers' selection of insurers other than Highmark could help the regional market settle after two tumultuous years.\n\n\u201cI think the market will eventually figure this out, but my concern is that if all carriers are sustaining large underwriting losses, how long will they sustain those? How long will they stay?\u201d\n\nWes Venteicher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
