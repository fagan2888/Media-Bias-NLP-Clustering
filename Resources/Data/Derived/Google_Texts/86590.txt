STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. â€“ Rep. Daniel Donovan has gotten support from the Conservative Party in his bid for re-election against a liberal Democrat in the November election.

Donovan (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) will run for his first full term against Democrat Richard Reichard, a retired city employee and former president of the Staten Island Democratic Association.

Donovan was the only candidate who interviewed with the Conservative Party.

"We endorsed Dan Donovan in last year's special election and believe his work over the past ten months more than justifies his election to a full term," Conservative Party Chairman Harold J. Wagner. Jr. said on behalf of the executive committee. "We are especially impressed with his voting record thus far, including his opposition to the dangerous Iran nuclear deal and the Affordable Care Act and his support for the Zadroga Act to extend healthcare for 9/11 responders."

Donovan said in a statement, "As I have been in the past, I am proud to once again have the endorsement of the Conservative Party of Richmond County. I applaud the leadership of Chairman Wagner and the party's executive committee, and I look forward to continuing to work with him and the entire Conservative Party in advancing the conservative agenda we share in common."
