Employees can participate in a high-deductible health plan that includes an HSA. Honeywell only deposits money into the HSAs of employees who participate in the wellness program, which educates employees about their health status and promotes healthy behavior.\n\nEmployees who give a blood sample and provide other information receive the HSA contribution and don\u2019t have to pay a surcharge.\n\nThe EEOC asked for a temporary injunction to stop the program, arguing that under the ADA, the testing is an illegal, nonjob-related medical test. It said the penalties punish refusal to participate in an illegal test.\n\nHoneywell claimed that the ACA clearly allows medical testing and authorizes penalties for those who refuse as part of its medical cost-reduction provisions.\n\nThe court denied the EEOC\u2019s request for an injunction, concluding that it isn\u2019t at all clear which law should prevail. Until that is settled, Honeywell can continue to penalize those who won\u2019t participate and reward those who do. (EEOC v.
