But when Republicans offer to vastly expand every woman\u2019s access to birth control by making it available over-the-counter, they\u2019re suddenly in favor of less options for women.\n\nSens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Kelly Ayotte, (R-NH) have introduced a bill asking prescription birth control companies to file for the FDA\u2019s permission to sell over-the-counter. (This was a signature issue in Gardner\u2019s campaign to defeat former Democratic Sen. Mark Udall.)\n\n\u201cMost other drugs with such a long history of safe and routine use are available for purchase over the counter, and contraception should join them,\u201d Gardner said in a statement reported by The Huntsville Times. \u201cMaking this medication available over the counter would increase access in rural and underserved areas, save consumers money by increasing competition and availability, and save women time by increasing the ease of getting the safe contraception they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to allow women the ability to make their own decisions about safe, effective, and long-established methods of contraception.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood has already rushed to condemn the legislation, claiming that it would reduce access to birth control, since it would no longer be covered under Obamacare\u2013even though Gardner\u2019s bill would also repeal Obamacare\u2019s ban on using health savings accounts for non-prescription drugs.\n\nAnd other forms of birth control will remain prescription-only and covered by insurance, even should the bill move forward\u2013including, in all likelihood, some oral contraceptives.\n\nJezebel lambasted the move as \u201ca sneaky way to effectively end Obamacare\u2019s mandatory contraception coverage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Liberals lose their minds when one business declines to offer just a few forms of birth control.", "title": "When Republicans propose over-the-counter birth control, liberals...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 573, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/05/birth-control-573x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/05/27/republicans-propose-counter-birth-control-liberals-suddenly-oppose-womens-choice/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "over-the-counter", "published_time": "2015-05-27T18:10:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T18:17:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Liberals lose their minds when one business declines to offer just a few forms of birth control.\nBut when Republicans offer to vastly expand every woman\u2019s access to birth control by making it available over-the-counter, they\u2019re suddenly in favor of less options for women.\nCory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Kelly Ayotte, (R-NH) have introduced a bill asking prescription birth control companies to file for the FDA\u2019s permission to sell over-the-counter.\nAnd other forms of birth control will remain prescription-only and covered by insurance, even should the bill move forward\u2013including, in all likelihood, some oral contraceptives.\nJezebel lambasted the move as \u201ca sneaky way to effectively end Obamacare\u2019s mandatory contraception coverage.\u201d"}
