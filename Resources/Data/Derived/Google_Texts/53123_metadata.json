I place the word libertarian in quotes to avoid associating libertarian thought with Haugh\u2019s nihilistic high jinks.\n\nI set out to find out what Haugh thinks about handing the election \u2013 and potentially the Senate \u2013 to a statist. This question led me on a rollicking journey into the imagination of a candidate who is not serious, not informed, and not concerned about the outcome of the upcoming election.\n\nReaching out to Haugh on Twitter, I asked him how much of the libertarian agenda Hagan would advance if he tilted the election in her favor. After a series of evasions (see below), Haugh ended up tweeting that fracking, offshore drilling, and the construction of the Keystone pipeline would require \u201cbig government protectionism,\u201d which he opposes:\n\nThis is where Haugh went out to left field:\n\nAnd there we have it. Haugh opposes private business activity that would bring jobs to the state of North Carolina. In Haugh\u2019s mind, private businesses are somehow unable to drill or build a pipeline without \u201cbig government protectionism.\u201d Of course, those who support fracking, offshore drilling, and the construction of the Keystone pipeline simply want government regulation to be removed. Yet, by some bizarre mangling of logic, Haugh labels the removal of regulation \u201cbig government protectionism.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, this baffling perspective comes from a candidate who could tilt control of the U.S. Senate to an avowed statist party.\n\nHaugh holds other questionable positions. On immigration, he is admittedly in favor of \u201copen borders.\u201d Informed libertarians \u2013 as opposed to purely ideological ones \u2013 recognize that open borders plus the welfare state equals a disintegrating society. As Milton Freidman said, \u201c[i]t\u2019s just obvious that you can't have free immigration and a welfare state.\u201d Haugh also favors Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\n\nThe NC Senate race, according to which poll you look at, is tied, or Democrat Kay Hagan is ahead by one or two percentage points. Recent polls show Haugh with between four and seven percent of the vote, far more than the margin separating Republican Thom Tillis and Hagan.\n\nAt this point, Haugh can accomplish nothing but the hijacking of a Senate election. Haugh\u2019s unintelligible agenda would be amusing if it weren\u2019t for the lasting harm he could do to the cause of limited government. He could trash the efforts of countless NC voters and citizens.\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking whether someone like Haugh is in the race for principle or for self-promotion. Haugh seems to be as ill-informed as he is self-centered, and it is one of the sad oddities of our time that a supposedly liberty-loving candidate could be such a willing tool of statists.\n\nJohn Bennett is a writer whose work has appeared in The Daily Caller, Townhall.com, Newsmax, Human Events, The Jewish Press, World Net Daily, Liberty Unyielding, Accuracy in Media, and FrontPage Magazine, among others.
