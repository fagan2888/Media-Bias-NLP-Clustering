(AP) - When Hollywood films a hit movie or TV show in Georgia, hardcore fans can bring in millions of tourism dollars when they come to get a firsthand look at the places they\u2019ve seen on the screen.\n\nLee Thomas, the deputy commissioner in charge of the film division of the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said a boost in tourism is one of the greatest economic bonuses the state gets from providing scenery and backdrops to projects from \u201cDeliverance\u201d to \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nThe biggest hits not only attract fans from overseas, Thomas said, but often route them to small-town locales that wouldn\u2019t see many tourists otherwise. The state doesn\u2019t track the impact in dollars, but some local communities have estimates. In Newton County, where \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d is filmed, direct spending by tourists shot from $47 million in 2002 to $107 million in 2012, according to the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the case for every film or TV show,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know which ones are going to do it, but that can be something that carries a town for years and years.\u201d\n\nHere are five of the most popular Georgia movie locations fans can see up close.\n\n- \u201cFORREST GUMP\u201d PARK BENCH\n\nOK, so the actual park bench on which Tom Hanks sat comparing life to a box of chocolates in the 1994 film \u201cForrest Gump\u201d was just a prop. But the picture-postcard backdrop was the very real Chippewa Square in the center of Savannah\u2019s downtown historic district. The square\u2019s gnarled oaks hung with Spanish moss and towering monument to Georgia\u2019s founding father, Gen. James Edward Oglethorpe, make it instantly recognizable to fans of the Oscar-winning movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. It\u2019s still sought out by movie buffs 20 years later.\n\n- \u201cWALKING DEAD\u201d MAIN STREET\n\nBeyond the apocalyptic ruins of Atlanta, survivors of the zombie-infested countryside in AMC\u2019s TV series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d find a refuge where a fragile society has walled itself off inside the small town of Woodbury. The town\u2019s Main Street thoroughfare seen on TV is actually downtown Senoia, a city of 3,750 located 35 miles south of Atlanta. Undead fan-demonium has spawned a thriving tourism trade in Senoia, where officials say the number of storefronts has grown from six to 47 since the zombies arrived. The new businesses include a Woodbury Shoppe that sells \u201cWalking Dead\u201d souvenirs.\n\n- \u201cDELIVERANCE\u201d STILL DELIVERS\n\nIn many ways, the story of Georgia\u2019s long-distance romance with Hollywood starts with the filming of \u201cDeliverance\u201d in the north Georgia mountains. The 1972 movie starring Burt Reynolds has been criticized for embracing hillbilly stereotypes. But the film\u2019s stunning views of the Chattooga River are credited with helping spawn a $20 million rafting and outdoor sports industry that still draws visitors four decades later. \u201cDeliverance\u201d had such an impact, then-Gov. Jimmy Carter created a state film office in 1973 to ensure Georgia kept landing movie roles.\n\n- \u201cHUNGER GAMES\u201d HOUSE\n\nSet amid dystopian squalor and sci-fi opulence, the \u201cHunger Games\u201d series wasn\u2019t exactly geared toward depicting recognizable landmarks from present-day Atlanta, where the sequels \u201cCatching Fire\u201d and \u201cMockingjay - Part 1\u201d were filmed. The Swan House is one big exception. The 1923 Atlanta mansion gets screen time in both movies as the home of President Snow, played by Donald Sutherland. Filmmakers shot scenes both inside and outside the Swan House, which is located on the 33-acre campus of the Atlanta History Center. The historic home\u2019s museum and grounds are open for tours daily.\n\n- \u201cVAMPIRE DIARIES\u201d DINER\n\nHardcore fans of \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d TV series on The CW know that landmarks in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, are actually filmed in the small city of Covington, Georgia. One of the supernatural series\u2019 most recognizable locations has been the Mystic Grill, an office building transformed into the exterior of a restaurant for the show. Damage from a 2012 fire left the building vacant until a couple bought it and turned it into a real eatery named - you guessed it - the Mystic Grill. It opened in early 2014, a few months before the fictional Mystic Grill was blown to smithereens in an explosion at the end of the show\u2019s fifth season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Hollywood films a hit movie or TV show in Georgia, hardcore fans can bring in millions of tourism dollars when they come to get a firsthand look at the places they've seen on the screen.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When Hollywood films a hit movie or TV show in Georgia, hardcore fans can bring in millions of tourism dollars when they come to get a firsthand look at the places they\u2019ve seen on the screen.", "title": "Movie locations a tourism draw for Georgia communities", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/1/movie-locations-a-tourism-draw-for-georgia-communi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/01/ab2d59c12c95ff00690f6a7067002d21.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/01/ab2d59c12c95ff00690f6a7067002d21.jpg", "description": "When Hollywood films a hit movie or TV show in Georgia, hardcore fans can bring in millions of tourism dollars when they come to get a firsthand look at the places they've seen on the screen.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Movie locations a tourism draw for Georgia communities"}, "Author": "RUSS BYNUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce30d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t know which ones are going to do it, but that can be something that carries a town for years and years.\u201dHere are five of the most popular Georgia movie locations fans can see up close.\nJimmy Carter created a state film office in 1973 to ensure Georgia kept landing movie roles.\nSAVANNAH, Ga.
