Dallas Fire-Rescue and city crews were attempting to stop a water main break that occurred shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday.

The main broke at Olive and North Field streets at Victory Park. A dislodged electrical pole at the scene complicated matters because crews could not tackle the break until Oncor inspected the pole, Dallas Fire-Rescue dispatch said.

The main break is likely due to ground shifting from the amount of rain water, dispatch said.
