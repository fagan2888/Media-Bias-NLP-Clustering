South Korea, Kim said, is \u201calways looking for opportunities to apply pressure upon North Korea.\u201d\n\nThe diplomats outlined an array of steps that could be taken, including engagement with North Korean citizens, containment of its weapons exports, additional international sanctions on Pyongyang and \u201cawakening the international conscious,\u201d Ambassador Ho-Young Ahn of Korea said.\n\nOnce the world becomes fully aware of the human rights violations in North Korea, then leaders can move toward concrete actions in concert with not just regional partners but countries from around the world.\n\n\u201cRaise the awareness of the world that we need to more seriously be looking at this issue,\u201d said H.E. Ambassador Kenichiro Sasae, ambassador of Japan to the U.S.\n\nAhn also said it\u2019s necessary to look at the current situation with North Korea in historical context to prevent becoming discouraged. While it has developed nuclear weapons and threatened on numerous occasions to use them against South Korea, Japan and even the United States, so far, it has fired nothing but test rockets into the Sea of Japan.\n\n\u201cWe should be putting into perspective what we have been doing before we move ahead,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cIf we try to put all of these issues into perspective and then think about what has been going on in North Korea the last five years, there is less reason to be frustrated.\u201d\n\nEven so, Kim said he is optimistic about the U.S. and South Korea combating any challenges that may arise concerning North Korea, primarily because the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea is particularly stable and prepared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s robust in every aspect,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI\u2019m quite confident that we have the capability to deal with any actions at stake.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Japanese and South Korean ambassadors discuss potential areas to target concerning the U.S. and Asian allies\u2019 relationship with North Korea.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Japanese and South Korean ambassadors discuss potential areas to target concerning the U.S. and Asian allies\u2019 relationship with North Korea.", "title": "Ambassadors Identify Strategies to Combat North Korea\u2019s Growing Power", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Kim2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-09T12:41:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1J6kn1U"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Japanese and South Korean ambassadors discuss potential areas to target concerning the U.S. and Asian allies\u2019 relationship with North Korea.", "title": "Ambassadors Identify Strategies to Combat North Korea\u2019s Growing Power", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Kim2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "human rights,Japan,North Korea,south korea", "published_time": "2015-07-09T12:18:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T12:41:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Human Rights, International"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3295\"", "article_summary": "Ambassador Kenichiro Sasae, ambassador of Japan to the U.S.Ahn also said it\u2019s necessary to look at the current situation with North Korea in historical context to prevent becoming discouraged.\nThrough its continuous work to build, deploy and sell nuclear weapons and its general belligerence toward the rest of the region, North Korea is putting pressure on nearby democracies.\n\u201cPressure is a very critical part of our approach to dealing with North Korea,\u201d said Ambassador Sung Kim, deputy assistant secretary for Japan and Korea and special representative for North Korea Policy at the U.S. Department of State.\nOnce the world becomes fully aware of the human rights violations in North Korea, then leaders can move toward concrete actions in concert with not just regional partners but countries from around the world.\nThat was the top takeaway from an event Wednesday at The Heritage Foundation that featured the ambassadors to the U.S. of both South Korea and Japan as well as a State Department official and others."}
