In the meantime, House and Senate \u201cleaders\u201d promise to appoint representatives to a conference committee to address \u201cbroader budget issues\u201d \u2013 such as whether to replace the current across-the-board spending cuts known as \u201csequestration\u201d with other purported \u201csavings.\u201d\n\nThis is bankruptcy on the installment plan, both moral and fiscal. The United States government is the political equivalent of an alcoholic who insists that he will sober up next month if the bartender will only increase his credit limit yet again and keep buying him drinks on the house until a week from next Tuesday. In the meanwhile the bartender\u2019s children are in danger of missing meals and the bar\u2019s own creditors are threatening foreclosure because the mortgage loan is nearly in default.\n\n\u201cFurloughed\u201d federal workers will as usual be paid for the time that they weren\u2019t at work, meaning an additional two weeks or so of (albeit stressful and unplanned) vacation on the tab of the same taxpayers who, if vacationing at their own expense the past two weeks, were shut out of the national parks and presidential libraries, also through no fault of their own. Congressional staff will still get huge Obamacare subsidies that the rest of the citizenry does not and the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d of Obamacare remains in place even though the administration has delayed, waived, or gutted every other significant portion of the law for purely partisan political purposes.\n\nWhat Republicans up for re-election in 2014 have to show for all this are a memorable reading of \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d by Canadian-born Texas Senator Ted Cruz \u2013 who ultimately refused to block the legislation that he initially pretended to filibuster \u2013 and a popularity rating lower than the keel of the Titanic on April 16 of 1912. Meanwhile President Obama quickly signed the bill and, of course, proclaimed victory. Although also taking a temporary hit in popularity but not subject to re-election, he wisely remained largely above the fray and accordingly felt free to lecture the nation this morning that the only things standing between the people and the nirvana of cradle-to-grave government are citizenship and voting rights for people who have entered the nation illegally, \u201cclosing corporate tax loopholes that don\u2019t create jobs\u201d and \u2013 in our post-industrial information technology-based economy \u2013 a new farm bill.\n\nOn the whole, the country is worse off than back where we started, having been subjected to further abuse by a non-responsive and irresponsible government and a few steps further down Friedrich von Hayek\u2019s fabled road to serfdom.\n\nAs Tennessee Ernie Ford once plaintively lamented, \u201cYou load sixteen tons, and whaddya get?
