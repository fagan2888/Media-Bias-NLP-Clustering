That\u2019s true, but it is misleading to compare Boehner with the \u201cmany Americans seeing their costs go up,\u201d as his spokesman Brendan Buck has put it.\n\nBoehner\u2019s experience with the Affordable Care Act is extremely atypical compared to most Americans. His rates \u2014 which include the cost of insuring his wife \u2014 are doubling because of the couple\u2019s age and high income, and a special provision in the law that forced members of Congress out of their employer-sponsored plans.\n\nAs a result of an amendment by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, Boehner is barred from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. He must buy insurance on the exchange created by the law. But that\u2019s a costly switch for Boehner, who is 64 years old. The exchange plans charge higher premiums based on age \u2014 unlike his current employer-sponsored plan.\n\nAs we have long cautioned, some Americans may pay more and some may pay less on the exchanges \u2013 depending on factors such as age, tobacco use and home state. The same is true for those in Congress.\n\nConsider Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas. We reached out to Castro to see how his experience on the exchange stacked up to Boehner\u2019s. Castro selected the same plan as Boehner. But Castro \u2014 who is 25 years younger than Boehner \u2014 will pay about half of what he is now paying. Castro\u2019s new plan has a higher deductible, but he could have selected a plan with no deductible and still saved money.\n\nThe difference between Castro\u2019s and Boehner\u2019s premiums is mostly due to age. But there are other variables in play as well \u2014 as we will explain below \u2014 including the fact that Boehner\u2019s wife is now eligible for Medicare, and her higher-than-average Medicare premium is based on the couple\u2019s high income.\n\nBoehner\n\nIn his weekly press conference on Dec. 5, Boehner bemoaned the cost of his new insurance. \u201cMy health insurance premiums are gonna double,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cMy co-pays and deductibles tripled under Obamacare.\u201d He added, sarcastically, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to death as you can tell.\u201d\n\nWhen Boehner signed up for insurance on Nov. 24, the press was provided photos of Boehner struggling with computer glitches on the federal website HealthCare.gov. Boehner reported that it took him several hours to navigate the system and shop for a new plan for him and his wife. Politico wrote about his experience in a story headlined, \u201cJohn Boehner\u2019s premiums spike under Obamacare.\u201d Fox News also ran a story about it under the headline, \u201cBoehner seeing his premiums double, deductibles triple under ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nBoehner reported that, under his current plan, he pays premiums of $433 a month for him and his wife, with a $700 deductible. But Boehner doesn\u2019t need a joint health plan next year because his wife just turned 65, and is therefore eligible for Medicare. Fox News reported that Boehner\u2019s wife, Debbie, had already applied for Medicare Part A, the premium-free hospital care program. Boehner\u2019s office reported that in order to enroll in Medicare Parts B and D \u2014 to make the switch comparable \u2014 she\u2019d have to pay up to $400 per month.\n\nThat left Boehner shopping for a plan just for himself. He selected a Blue Cross PPO plan with a $1,000 deductible \u2014 one described by Care First Blue Cross as the one \u201cthat most closely matches the benefits\u201d in the current federal employee plan. It\u2019s got the same network of doctors. The plan has a monthly premium of $875.32 for someone 64 years old, like Boehner. The federal government picks up 75 percent of the premium (up to a maximum of $426 per month) \u2014 so the cost to Boehner is $449 per month.\n\nTo sum up, Boehner is paying $433 a month now. His new plan will cost $449 a month plus up to $400 a month for his wife\u2019s Medicare plan, for a total of $849 \u2014 nearly twice his current premium of $433.\n\nThe couple\u2019s combined cost is comparable, Boehner said, to what he would have paid for a joint plan on the exchange that is similar to the one he has now. He said that would have cost $802 per month in premiums, with a $2,000 deductible.\n\nThe bottom line could have been worse for Boehner. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can charge smokers, such as Boehner, up to 50 percent more \u2014 unless a state expressly prohibits charging higher premiums based on tobacco use. Washington, D.C., happens to be one of the few that does not allow insurance companies to charge extra for smokers. There are seven states with a similar policy, according to WebMD.com, including: California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.\n\n\u201cThe Boehners are fortunate enough to be able to afford higher costs,\u201d Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck told Politico. \u201cBut many Americans seeing their costs go up are not. It\u2019s because of them that this law needs to go.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a big caveat with the Medicare cost for Boehner\u2019s wife.\n\nAs columnist Michael Hiltzik explained in the Los Angeles Times, Medicare premiums are based on income. Boehner\u2019s office declined to tell us the married couple\u2019s combined salary, only that their income would result in Medicare premiums of around $400 per month. In order to have to pay that much for Medicare Part B and D next year, a couple would have to earn more than $428,000 a year. If a couple had a combined income above $428,000, they\u2019d have to pay $336 per month for Medicare Part B and another $69 per month for Part D (the drug premium) in 2014.\n\nCouples filing jointly, and with an income below $170,000, would pay $105 a month. In other words, the high cost of Medicare for the Boehners is largely due to the fact that their high income requires them to pay close to, or at the maximum amount. To put their income in perspective, only 2.4 percent of households in 2012 had an income above $250,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If Boehner and his wife made less than $170,000 \u2014 as more than 93 percent of the population did in 2012 \u2014 Boehner would only be paying $105 a month, which means he would be paying about 28 percent more for health insurance next year.\n\nNonetheless, Boehner is paying more for his insurance, and he has a higher deductible. There\u2019s no denying this is a bad switch for him. But, again, that\u2019s mostly because he\u2019s an anomaly. He\u2019s paying more for his wife\u2019s Medicare because the Boehners earn far more than most Americans. And he pays more for his premium because he\u2019s 64 years old.\n\nThe current federal group plan that covers Boehner does not distinguish rates based on age. That\u2019s pretty typical in employer-based plans. However, the Affordable Care Act (section 2701) allows insurers on the individual market to charge more based on a customer\u2019s age, though it can\u2019t be more than three times more. As we shall soon see with Castro\u2019s example, there are large differences between the rates offered on the individual market based on age.\n\nCastro\n\nAs a 39-year-old freshman congressman, we reached out to Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas, to see how his age affected his experience shopping on the Washington, D.C., exchange. And as we previously noted, it was much different than Boehner\u2019s.\n\nCastro is married, but his wife is not currently on his federal insurance plan. So, he shopped for a plan just for himself next year as well. (Castro has no children, but his wife is expecting).\n\nLike Boehner, Castro selected the Blue Cross PPO plan with a $1,000 deductible. It carries a monthly premium of $376.46 \u2014 nearly $500 a month less than Boehner for the same plan. Again, the federal government picks up 75 percent of the cost, so Castro will pay $94.12 a month. His previous monthly payment was $186.14. That\u2019s a savings of $92.02 per month, or roughly half of what he was paying before.\n\nAs with Boehner, Castro will be able to keep his same doctor, but his deductible will climb from $350 a year to $1,000. But just for fun, we looked at a Blue Cross PPO plan with a zero deductible. That plan would cost Castro $110 per month. In other words, Castro could have selected a plan that saved him about $76 a month, and carried no deductible at all. As a freshman congressman, Castro makes $174,000 a year, so he\u2019s not eligible for any subsidies. The bottom line: the switch has been a good deal for Castro.\n\nAnd that gets to the crux of this comparison exercise: when it comes to whether you will pay more or less on an exchange \u2014 it depends.\n\nAs we wrote previously:\n\nFactCheck.org, Sept. 16: Are you uninsured and have a preexisting condition? You\u2019ll likely pay less than you would have otherwise. Are you uninsured but young and healthy? You\u2019ll likely pay more (without accounting for any subsidies you may receive). Are you insured through your employer? You likely won\u2019t see much change either way.\n\nWe could have added: \u201cAre you an older member of Congress with a high household income and a wife who just joined Medicare? You\u2019ll definitely pay more.\u201d\n\nBut Boehner\u2019s experience is not representative of what most Americans will face.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans get their insurance through their employer. Among those who shop on the individual market, most coming to the exchanges currently have no insurance, or their plans were cancelled because the plans did not comply with the new minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOnly individuals whose employers decide to drop insurance and instead pay their employees a stipend to seek insurance on their own through the exchange \u2014 and there are some who fit that bill \u2014 would face a situation comparable to Boehner\u2019s. Even then, their experience could result in higher or lower premiums, depending on their age and tobacco use, as we\u2019ve been saying all along.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1339\"", "article_summary": "As with Boehner, Castro will be able to keep his same doctor, but his deductible will climb from $350 a year to $1,000.\nBut Castro \u2014 who is 25 years younger than Boehner \u2014 will pay about half of what he is now paying.\nLike Boehner, Castro selected the Blue Cross PPO plan with a $1,000 deductible.\nWe reached out to Castro to see how his experience on the exchange stacked up to Boehner\u2019s.\nCastro selected the same plan as Boehner."}
