Well played, Next Galaxy.

The New York-based virtual-reality company put out a press release this week touting a deal with Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami to build VR educational content for both patient and medical professional education.

We were going to write a full story, but then we discovered that this release was a rehash of news announced in March. That’s a no-no when you are trying to report actual news. (The new release didn’t correct the hospital name. Miami Children’s Hospital was recently renamed in honor of golf legend Jack Nicklaus because the foundation run by Nicklaus and his wife donated $60 million to the hospital.)

But then we took another look at this photo from Next Galaxy and decided it was too cool not to share. If this is the future of medical education, bring it on!
