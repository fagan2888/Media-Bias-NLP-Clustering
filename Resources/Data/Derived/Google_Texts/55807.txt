Lt. Gov: Critz Announces 54 Endorsements

Written by Nick Field, Contributing Writer

Anything Brad Koplinski can do, Mark Critz can do better. At least that’s what the Critz campaign would like you to believe.

Earlier today the Koplinski campaign trumpeted the backing of 20 Democratic state officials, now just hours later the Critz campaign unveiled 54 officials and organizations that are endorsing his candidacy. Both men are fighting to become the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor.

“I am honored to be endorsed by a diverse group of leaders and activists,” Critz said. “They know that I have a record of fighting to strengthen the middle class and working to create jobs that pay a livable wage.”

It should also be noted that these campaign releases are likely targeted towards the annual PA Society weekend which begins tonight. The PA Society events provide a prime venue for leading politicos to gossip about and chew over the latest political news. For instance, this morning Attorney General Kane made headlines by expressing her interest in a 2016 race for the Senate against incumbent Pat Toomey.
