The official Mardi Gras celebration may still be a few weeks away, but that didn't stop Walton County residents and visitors from celebrating this weekend.

Saturday was their third annual Mardi Gras parade hosted by the Krewe de Yak.

The fun started at 9 a.m. with food, games and a car show.

Then at 3 p.m. hundreds lined Circle Drive around Lake DeFuniak for the main event.

"It was wonderful, explained Samantha Graves, the 2016 Queen of the Krewe de Yak. "We are very excited that DeFuniak allows us to have a parade. It really engenders a lot of community support and spirit. It's been a growth process and to be able to put on an event like this is wonderful. It's a sign of progress and such a symbol of community."

More than a dozen floats were in the parade, including the Krewe of St. Andrews and other krewes coming from Mobile and Tallahassee.
