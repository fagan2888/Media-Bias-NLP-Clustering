Out of six games I managed an impressive\u2026 2-4. The good news of course was that the Jets started the season with a win. The closest I came to denting Ed\u2019s pristine picks was when the Giants led the Cowboys all through the game until the last fifteen seconds. At that point they suddenly realized that I had picked them to win and decided to give the game to Dallas out of pure spite. But hey\u2026 it\u2019s only one week. (Which I believe is exactly what I said in week one last season.) This week I\u2019m going to do better for sure though!\n\nEd: Well, well, well \u2026 look what utter ignorance can do for predictions! I\u2019ve been buried in a project all summer, and ended up paying no attention to the NFL at all in the preseason. And yet \u2026 a 6-0 start to the season. It\u2019s all downhill from here, though, I\u2019m pretty sure, so I\u2019m going to enjoy it while I can. Oh \u2026 and I paid no attention to last week\u2019s games, save for a few minutes of the Steelers loss and the Dallas Chokers Club. 12-0, here I come???\n\nJazz: This week the Jets visit the Colts in the Monday night match-up. Indianapolis is a seven point favorite, but they\u2019re playing another AFC East team here. They got stomped by the Bills last week and the home town fans should get ready for a similar beatdown by Gang Green. The Jets will shock the world and carry the day 31 \u2013 24. Meanwhile, the Steelers host the 49ers who took down the Vikings last week. Pittsburgh is a seven point favorite as well and I really can\u2019t argue the odds on that one. I\u2019ll throw Ed a bone and pick his team in a higher scoring romp, 35 \u2013 27. And finally the Vikings are hosting the Lions in what\u2019s predicted to be a tight match. Minnesota is the favorite by a slim margin but I have a feeling that Detroit learned their lesson from not getting any use out of Calvin Johnson last week and they\u2019ll beat the Vikings 24 \u2013 13.\n\nEd: All right, I\u2019m done resting on my laurel. The Steelers get the 49ers in their home opener, and they\u2019d better take care of business, especially on defense. They didn\u2019t look good in Week 1, but they started figuring it out later in the game. I\u2019ll go with momentum and pick Pittsburgh, 24-17. The Colts flopped on the road while the Jets soared at home, but it\u2019ll go the other way around this week. Colts over the Jets, 27-17. The Vikings may not be a good road team, but they play pretty well at home, and the Lions won\u2019t have a dome today either. Vikings in a scoreboard thriller, 35-31.\n\nJazz:Here we go with the rest of the picks.\n\nPatriots at Bills (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 The game is rated in Vegas as a tossup but I can\u2019t pick the Pats. Not that I want the Bills to go 2-0 but I\u2019ll take them anyway in a high scoring, defense free match, 34 \u2013 31.\n\nThe game is rated in Vegas as a tossup but I can\u2019t pick the Pats.

Rams at Redskins 1:00 pm, FOX) \u2013 Washington\u2019s ground game just isn\u2019t looking very good even if Cousins has potential. I think the Rams take this one 24 \u2013 13.\n\nWashington\u2019s ground game just isn\u2019t looking very good even if Cousins has potential. I think the Rams take this one 24 \u2013 13. Cowboys at Eagles (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 The Eagles were all about the passing game last week. They looked good in that regard, but I don\u2019t think it plays against the Cowboys. I\u2019ll go with Dallas 30 \u2013 24.\n\nThe Eagles were all about the passing game last week. They looked good in that regard, but I don\u2019t think it plays against the Cowboys.

Seahawks at Packers (8:30 pm, NBC) \u2013 The Packers are at home and find themselves a 3.5 point favorite in Vegas, but the Seahawks aren\u2019t the defending champs for nothing. Aaron Rogers will go big in the air but Seattle will wind up stuffing some of those down his throat. I\u2019ll go with the Seahawks in an upset, 20 \u2013 17.\n\nEd:\n\nPatriots at Bills (1:00 pm, CBS) \u2013 Buffalo is favored at home, but I\u2019m going to take an angry Tom Brady here and the Patriots. Should be a good game, 31-28.\n\nBuffalo is favored at home, but I\u2019m going to take an angry Tom Brady here and the Patriots. Should be a good game, 31-28.

Cowboys at Eagles (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 Let\u2019s face it \u2014 Dallas was lucky to get the W at home last week, and the Eagles played tough on the road. If the Cowboys play as sloppy in Philly, they\u2019re doomed, and \u2026 they probably will. Eagles 35-27.\n\nLet\u2019s face it \u2014 Dallas was lucky to get the W at home last week, and the Eagles played tough on the road.

Seahawks at Packers (8:30 pm, NBC) \u2013 The defending Super Bowl Chumps lost on the road to the Rams, while the Pack won on the road over the Bears. Going home to Lambeau makes Green Bay look even stronger. Packers 37-24 over the Seahawks.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Rebound time", "title": "NFL week 2 open thread", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/20/nfl-week-2-open-thread-7/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T16:31:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-08T21:27:59+00:00"}, "keywords": "Jets, New York Jets, NFL, predictions, Steelers,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "This week I\u2019m going to do better for sure though!\nThe Vikings may not be a good road team, but they play pretty well at home, and the Lions won\u2019t have a dome today either.\nCowboys at Eagles (4:25 pm, FOX) \u2013 The Eagles were all about the passing game last week.\nLet\u2019s face it \u2014 Dallas was lucky to get the W at home last week, and the Eagles played tough on the road.\nShould be a good game, 31-28."}
