Smartphone users, however, are quite happy with their devices.\n\nConsumer satisfaction with information services on whole \u2013 including subscription TV, Internet, wireless, fixed land line and computer software, has dropped to its lowest point in seven years, according to the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) study.\n\nWhile customer satisfaction in other areas has been dropping, satisfaction with cell phones remains unchanged and is the highest for the industry.\n\nACSI found that satisfaction with information services on the whole has dropped 3.4% to a score of 68.8. That is the lowest level in seven years.\n\nMany industries that make up the sector are also seeing individual declines in satisfaction.\n\nCable companies are on shaky ground as customer satisfaction decreases.\n\nTime Warner and Comcast faced significant drops after their failed merger. Comcast\u2019s customer satisfaction levels decreased by 10% to a score of 54 while Time Warner earned the lowest score in the study, plummeting 9% to a score of 51.\n\nVerizon\u2019s FiOS, however, took the top position from DIRECTV with a score of 71 compared to Direct\u2019s 68.\n\nAT&T U-verse kept the same score (69). DISH Network and Cablevision Systems tied at 67.\n\nOverall, customer satisfaction for ISPs did not change over the year. Consumers report being frustrated with slow, unreliable broadband service and ever-rising prices.\n\nEven so, some ISPs did improve their standings with AT&T scoring a 69, a 6% increase. Bright House Networks scored a 63 while Frontier Communications and Cablevision Systems scored a 61.\n\nLosers in this year\u2019s study included Cox, down 9% to 58; Charter, down 7% to 57; and Comcast, down 2% to 56.\n\nOverall satisfaction with cell phones was unchanged at 78, which is the highest score for the industry.\n\nApple and Samsung tied for the lead at 80 with Apple enjoying a 1% rise and Samsung experiencing a 1% decline.\n\nIn regard to specific phones, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 took the lead at 86. The Galaxy S5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and a few others tied at 82.\n\nResearchers also found that fixed-line phone service is no longer much of a focal point with customer satisfaction dropping 5.5% to 69.\n\nIn regard to computer software, satisfaction dropped 2.6% to 74 overall. Microsoft still dominates this market at 75.\n\nThe overall declines for many segments of the industry are likely prompted by the alternatives available and some industry areas may indeed see downward trends continue, Claes Fornell, ACSI\u2019s chairman and founder says.\n\nGet Free Updates!
