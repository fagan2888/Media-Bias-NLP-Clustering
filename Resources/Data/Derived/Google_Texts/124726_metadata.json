David Perdue, R-Ga., to burnish his \u201coutsider\u201d credentials even more brightly.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t mention was that Perdue now has become part of a conservative rebellion against a bipartisan criminal justice package that could loosen some minimum mandatory sentences.\n\nPolitico reports of a movement involving Perdue and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton that is raising fresh concerns about the legislation.\n\nIn the U.S. House, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, has been deeply involved in negotiations. On the state level, an ambitious set of changes to the state criminal justice code have become Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s calling card, earning overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle.\n\nBut others worry it could lead to a wave of new crime. And Perdue as far back as October raised concerns about the changes leading to a wave of released \u201carmed career criminals.\u201d\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nGOP tensions over a bill that would effectively loosen some mandatory minimum sentences spilled over during a party lunch last week, when Cotton (R-Ark.), the outspoken Senate freshman, lobbied his colleagues heavily against the legislation, according to people familiar with the closed-door conversation. The measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall with bipartisan support. \u201cIt would be very dangerous and unwise to proceed with the Senate Judiciary bill, which would lead to the release of thousands of violent felons,\u201d Cotton said later in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cI think it\u2019s no surprise that Republicans are divided on this question \u2026 [but] I don\u2019t think any Republicans want legislation that is going to let out violent felons, which this bill would do.\u201d Cotton isn\u2019t alone. Other Senate Republicans, including Sens. Jim Risch of Idaho and David Perdue of Georgia, also registered their strong opposition during the lunch, even as Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) vigorously defended the bill, which he helped negotiate. Risch stressed this message, according to one Republican source: Shouldn\u2019t the GOP be a party of law and order?\n\nThe New Yorker lamented that the opposition could scuttle one of the few bipartisan efforts that stand a chance of getting to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk this year. From the piece:\n\nIf sentencing reform does succumb to Cotton & Co., it\u2019s hard to figure when the next green shoots of hope for bipartisanship might appear. Right now that spring feels far away.\n\n***\n\nBill Clinton is coming to Atlanta \u201cshortly.\u201d That\u2019s what Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed told our AJC colleague Katie Leslie.\n\nReed, a top surrogate for Hillary Clinton, urged her supporters to focus on Iowa, \u201cquit acting alarmed\u201d about her struggles in New Hampshire \u2013 and that he will \u201ceviscerate\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in South Carolina.\n\n***\n\nThis paragraph in the New York Times soon good be getting more attention:\n\nAuburn, in Auburn, Ala., is one of 17 universities in the South that include broad questions on their admissions applications about any contact with the legal system or the police that applicants might have had \u2014 even an arrest, with no conviction \u2014 according to the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an advocacy group. The universities are now the focus of an inquiry by the organization, which says such questions unfairly penalize minorities, who tend to face arrest more frequently and, as a result, could face higher admissions hurdles.\n\n***\n\nNow playing in Carroll County:\n\nCarroll Co.
