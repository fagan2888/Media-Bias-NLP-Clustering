Davis stated last month that she would not shy away from President Obama\u2019s visit to Texas, yet in another flip-flop, she instead decided to meet with him in secret \u2013 away from the public and refusing to mention what they discussed,\u201d said spokesman Matt Hirsch.\n\n\u201cWe can only assume President Obama and Sen. Davis bonded over their shared support of Obamacare and limiting Second Amendment rights. Texans want a governor who shares there values, not someone who wants to bring Obama\u2019s big government agenda and failed liberal values to our great state,\u201d Hirsch said.\n\nBo Delp, spokesman for the Davis campaign, said the president and Democratic nominee briefly discussed the importance of the Voting Rights Act and its legacy in Texas.\n\nOn limiting gun rights, both Obama and Davis have supported expanded background checks, a position favored by a majority of Americans and Texans, according to recent polls.\n\nDavis is supportive of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nORIGINAL POST 11:40 am: Democratic candidate for governor Wendy Davis has arrived to listen to Barack Obama at the LBJ Library.\n\nObama is politically unpopular in deeply red Texas and GOP opponent Greg Abbott already has worked to link her politics to those of the president.\n\n\n\nWhile Davis did not go to Houston, where Obama attended two high-dollar Democratic fundraisers last night, her campaign made no secret that she would appear at the civil rights summit.\n\nSome Democratic candidates running in conservative states have avoided association with Obama. On a previous presidential trip to Dallas, Davis was in South Texas and made no effort to meet with Obama.\n\nThe summit is reflecting on the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s signing of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nIn addition to Obama, former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush are speaking at the conference.\n\nDavis also attended the speech Clinton gave Wednesday night and the dinner that followed.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wNC80MTkxOS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christy Hoppe", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "UPDATE 2:35 pm: Wendy Davis had a private meeting with President Obama after his speech at the summit.
