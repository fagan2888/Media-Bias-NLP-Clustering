Scott Applewhite This Feb. 4, 2014 file photo shows Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) promised to shield certain provisions of Obamacare from repeal during the only televised debate with opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes on Monday, adopting a position that appears to be at odds with his long-standing support for eliminating the law.\n\nDuring the brief exchange, McConnell reduced Kynect, a state-run insurance marketplace where Kentuckians can purchase policies that meet minimum benefit standards and qualify for subsidies, to a website and promised that it \u201ccan continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cKentucky Kynect is a website. It was paid for by a grant from the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe website can continue, but in my view the best interests of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare root and branch.\u201d McConnell explained that Kentucky officials can also maintain the state exchange \u201cif they\u2019d like to.\u201d \u201cStates can decide whether or to expand Medicaid or not,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a state decision.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has tried to carve a new position on a law he has repeatedly voted to repeal throughout his re-election bid. In May, the senator wouldn\u2019t tell reporters whether the state\u2019s exchange should be dismantled, saying only, \u201cI think that\u2019s unconnected to my comments about the overall question [of repealing the law].\u201d Jesse Benton, his then-campaign manager, later told the Washington Post that Kentucky should also maintain Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. \u201cThese people would remain eligible even after a repeal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government does allow states flexibility in setting requirements and Kentucky could be able to keep many of the newly enrolled in the program if we decided to.\u201d\n\nHowever, if McConnell succeeds in eliminating the law, Obamacare\u2019s subsidies would likely disappear, as would federal funding to maintain the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid programs.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s muddled message and growing push to embrace key parts of reform, comes as more than 8 million people have singed up for coverage under the law. Kentucky has been a model for effective implementation, enrolling some 500,000 people in coverage since October.\n\nFor her part, Grimes promised to \u201cfix the Affordable Care Act\u201d floating a proposal that would allow individuals to remain enrolled in Obamacare policies that don\u2019t meet the requirements of the law. \u201cWe have over a half a million Kentuckians who for the first time ever are filling prescriptions, they\u2019re going to the doctor, they\u2019re getting checkups,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not be a senator that rips that insurance from their hands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A growing trend within the GOP.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A growing trend within the GOP.", "title": "McConnell Wants To Get Rid Of Obamacare, But Keep The Obamacare Website His Constituents Love", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/14/3579337/gop-leader-embraces-portions-of-obamacare-during-high-stakes-debate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP748234155546.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A growing trend within the GOP.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP748234155546-321x214.jpg", "title": "McConnell Wants To Get Rid Of Obamacare, But Keep The Obamacare Website His Constituents Love", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP748234155546.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP748234155546.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-14T09:30:31+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health McConnell Wants To Get Rid Of Obamacare, But Keep The Obamacare Website His Constituents Love CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\nScott Applewhite This Feb. 4, 2014 file photo shows Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.\nDuring the brief exchange, McConnell reduced Kynect, a state-run insurance marketplace where Kentuckians can purchase policies that meet minimum benefit standards and qualify for subsidies, to a website and promised that it \u201ccan continue.\u201d\u201cKentucky Kynect is a website.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a state decision.\u201dMcConnell has tried to carve a new position on a law he has repeatedly voted to repeal throughout his re-election bid.\nKentucky has been a model for effective implementation, enrolling some 500,000 people in coverage since October."}
