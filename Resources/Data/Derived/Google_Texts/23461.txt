Tavis Smiley has written a new book on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but on HuffPost Live today, he also weighed in on the current state of black America under President Obama. And while Smiley had no interest in “demonizing” Obama, he did say that black people have to start demanding more of the president because as a whole, African-Americans have not fared well economically in the past few years.

Smiley said that black people, frankly, have “been at the back of the bus” when it comes to petitioning the president. He noted while the Hispanic community and other demographics and interest groups have made demands of the president (not all of which have come to fruition), the black community has made no demands of Obama.

And to Smiley, that’s a problem because of the serious problems facing the black community under Obama:

“I don’t celebrate this. I don’t say it as a way of demonizing the president or casting an aspersion on him––but the data is going to indicate… that black people lost ground in every single leading economic category during the Obama years.”
