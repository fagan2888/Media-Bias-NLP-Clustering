Experts told CNBC.com that they would be surprised if the federal government even matches Kentucky, much less surpasses it, in the level of detail in its enrollment data, given widespread expectations that very few people have actually enrolled in Obamacare insurance through the federal marketplace.



Federal authorities to date have refused to reveal that data since the Oct. 1 launch of the Obamacare marketplaces—even under pressure from Congress—and have not committed to breaking down the enrollment data to the extent Kentucky has.

The Wall Street Journal late Monday, citing two unnamed sources, said the federal government's marketplace has enrolled fewer than 50,000 people in private insurance since October, well below its initial target of 500,000 for just the month of October.

Kentucky's Kynect health insurance exchange has been cited as one of Obamacare's few bright spots for its apparently smoothness of operation, while the federal HealthCare.gov site has been a technological train wreck.

Because of those tech troubles, and the fact that it is handling enrollment for 36 states, HealthCare.gov likely "won't be able to parse the numbers" like Kentucky has, said James Brasfield, professor of management and health services for the Walker School of Business & Technology at Webster University, and author of the 2011 book "Health Policy: The Decade Ahead."
