Because East Carolina University (ECU) and the University of North Carolina (UNC) are state schools, abortion opponents don\u2019t want any of their instruction time to be spent on the procedure. But this complicated effort to separate taxpayer money from abortion services could have huge implications for the medical field.\n\n\u201cIt takes several steps to get to the point of the regulation,\u201d Elizabeth Nash, the senior states issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that closely tracks abortion-related legislation, told ThinkProgress. \u201cIt takes you a couple steps to understand that this would eliminate \u2014 or, at the very least, drastically reduce \u2014 the abortion training programs that are in place.\u201d\n\nThat would have particularly big consequences for UNC, which is ranked as one of the country\u2019s top five OB-GYN residency programs. UNC\u2019s medical school is currently home to a Ryan Program \u2014 a national initiative intended to address the growing shortage of abortion providers by providing more opportunities for doctors to be trained in pregnancy termination. Residents can also pursue a separate family planning fellowship that includes opportunities for abortion training and research. If HB 465 is enacted into law, both of those programs could be placed into jeopardy.\n\n\u201cIt raises a very serious issue: Who\u2019s going to be training the OB-GYNs at UNC to do abortions, if faculty can\u2019t do them?\u201d Dr. David Grimes, a retired abortion doctor and researcher who completed his own residency at UNC, told ThinkProgress.\n\nThe experts at UNC have been pioneering medical advances in abortion care for decades. Back in 1970, researchers at UNC published perhaps the first reliable study estimating the prevalence of illegal abortion procedures in the United States. In the years since, the institution has continued to provide, teach, and research abortion.\n\nGrimes, who later returned to Chapel Hill to serve as a faculty member, called the proposed legislation to restrict abortion training \u201coutrageous\u201d and an \u201cunwarranted intrusion\u201d into doctors\u2019 professional lives. \u201cSome religious groups are also opposed to blood transfusions. So should the state legislature in North Carolina pass a law that would close down the blood bank at the university hospital?\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, the proposal in North Carolina goes against the consensus in the medical field. The accreditation bodies for OB-GYN programs stipulate that abortion training must be included in residency education, except among religiously-affiliated schools with moral objections to the procedure.\n\nAnd comprehensive reproductive health training for future OB-GYNs can hardly afford to be further limited. Thanks to the political opposition to abortion, the procedure has already been effectively isolated from the rest of women\u2019s health care. The vast majority of hospitals have shied away from pregnancy terminations, worried about sparking protests from anti-choice groups that target any professional institutions that enter into partnerships with abortion providers. So doctors getting trained in obstetrics often face significant barriers to learning more about abortion \u2014 particularly if they\u2019re completing their residency in a Catholic-affiliated hospital, where abortion services are totally banned. That makes it difficult for reproductive health providers to offer their patients the full range of services related to pregnancy.\n\nIt also threatens to influence the care that women may receive in emergency situations. Pregnancies sometimes go wrong, and the so-called \u201cmiscarriage management\u201d that takes place in a hospital often isn\u2019t any different than abortion in a practical sense. But if doctors haven\u2019t been trained in that area, where does that leave women who need immediate medical attention?\n\n\u201cWe hear abortion opponents argue that they want to protect women\u2019s health. The last thing in the world you want to do, then, is restrict opportunities to provide training for safe abortion,\u201d Nash pointed out.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s records, only a handful of very conservative states \u2014 the states that often serve as testing grounds for extreme abortion restrictions \u2014 have previously attempted to prevent medical schools from providing their students with any training about pregnancy terminations.\n\nIn 2011, Arizona enacted a similar law that has since forced some of the state\u2019s Planned Parenthood clinics to stop offering abortion services because they can\u2019t find enough qualified doctors to hire. Texas and Kansas have also passed laws going after medical schools; under an omnibus anti-abortion law enacted in 2013, for instance, instructors at the University of Kansas Medical School are only allowed to teach their students about abortion is they do it after business hours and off campus.\n\nIn North Carolina, the abortion training restriction is accompanied by somewhat of a more mainstream anti-choice provision: An extended abortion waiting period that would require patients to wait 72 hours before ending a pregnancy. Nash believes that gives HB 465 a better chance of passing this session, particularly since North Carolina\u2019s legislature has recently proven itself eager to enact abortion restrictions.\n\nGOP legislators in the state are also currently attempting to restrict other types of education about reproductive rights. A separate bill introduced last week, HB 596, would prohibit public schools from including any information about emergency contraception in their sex ed classes.\n\nPlanned Parenthood South Atlantic has come out against the legislation, releasing a statement declaring that \u201cthese bills have nothing to do with patient safety, and are just attempts by politicians to insert their own political agendas into medical care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "And it could have big consequences for future doctors.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "And it could have big consequences for future doctors.", "title": "Abortion Opponents Are Quietly Going After One Of The Top Medical Schools In The Country", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/04/07/3643669/north-carolina-abortion-training/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And it could have big consequences for future doctors.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unc-321x214.jpg", "title": "Abortion Opponents Are Quietly Going After One Of The Top Medical Schools In The Country", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unc.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unc.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-07T13:17:42+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Because East Carolina University (ECU) and the University of North Carolina (UNC) are state schools, abortion opponents don\u2019t want any of their instruction time to be spent on the procedure.\nBut this complicated effort to separate taxpayer money from abortion services could have huge implications for the medical field.\nResidents can also pursue a separate family planning fellowship that includes opportunities for abortion training and research.\nSo doctors getting trained in obstetrics often face significant barriers to learning more about abortion \u2014 particularly if they\u2019re completing their residency in a Catholic-affiliated hospital, where abortion services are totally banned.\nThe accreditation bodies for OB-GYN programs stipulate that abortion training must be included in residency education, except among religiously-affiliated schools with moral objections to the procedure."}
