That is his agenda. He falls in line with the KKK. Every single fucking thing that they do, he\u2019s doing to do. Absolutely. He\u2019s \u2014 and no global warming? Come on, son, really?\u201d\n\nEarlier in the program, Wilmore crudely suggested that Cruz\u2019s denial of climate change was similar to a husband cheating on his wife with a babysitter where \u201cin the middle of having sex, you whisper to her, \u2018monogamy is very important to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nIntroducing the audio clip of Cruz telling a private audience about his strategy to \u201cbear hug...and smother\u201d Trump and Ben Carson \u201cwith love\u201d so he can eventually inherit their supporters, Wilmore floated the idea that Cruz is mentally incompetent: \u201cSomething's just off about this guy, though. Even behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nWilmore also played video of Cruz shooting a machine gun with bacon wrapped inside before eating it to which the liberal late-night host denounced the \u201ccreepy\u201d presidential candidate and questioned his manhood: \u201cWow. Do you know how small your dick has to be to do something like that? I don't know, guys. I mean, I don't know. He's just creepy. You know, it's his whole vibe, right?\u201d\n\nFor a sampling of other attacks by the liberal media against the Texas conservative, my colleague Geoffrey Dickens complied some of their worst attacks in the lead-up to the announcement of his presidential campaign on March 23.\n\nThe relevant portions of the transcript from Comedy Central\u2019s The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on December 14 can be found below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "In what may be the worst series of attacks by the liberal media on Ted Cruz, Monday\u2019s Nightly Show on Comedy Central featured host Larry Wilmore declaring that the \u201ccreepy\u201d Cruz may be mentally disturbed with guest Aida Rodriguez firmly asserting that, if elected, Cruz\u2019s agenda would be to \u201cdo everything the KKK does.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Nightly Show\u2019 Smears \u2018Creepy\u2019 Cruz; Will \u2018Do Everything the KKK Does,\u2019 Has Mental Problems", "url": "http://social.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2015/12/15/nightly-show-smears-creepy-cruz-will-do-everything-kkk-does-has", "image": "http://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/2015-12-14-CC-NightlyShow-WilmoreCruz1.JPG", "video": {"width": 640, "type": "text/html", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In what may be the worst series of attacks by the liberal media on Ted Cruz, Monday\u2019s Nightly Show on Comedy Central featured host Larry Wilmore declaring that the \u201ccreepy\u201d Cruz may be mentally disturbed with guest Aida Rodriguez firmly asserting that, if elected, Cruz\u2019s agenda would be to \u201cdo everything the KKK does.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Nightly Show\u2019 Smears \u2018Creepy\u2019 Cruz; Will \u2018Do Everything the KKK Does'", "url": "http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2015/12/15/nightly-show-smears-creepy-cruz-will-do-everything-kkk-does-has", "image": "http://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/2015-12-14-CC-NightlyShow-WilmoreCruz1.JPG", "creator": "@CurtisHouck", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "In what may be the worst series of attacks by the liberal media on Ted Cruz, Monday\u2019s Nightly Show on Comedy Central featured host Larry Wilmore declaring that the \u201ccreepy\u201d Cruz may be mentally disturbed with guest Aida Rodriguez firmly asserting that, if elected, Cruz\u2019s agenda would be to \u201cdo everything the KKK does.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd315c\"", "article_summary": "The relevant portions of the transcript from Comedy Central\u2019s The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on December 14 can be found below.\nHe's just creepy.\nDo you know how small your dick has to be to do something like that?\nHe falls in line with the KKK.\nEvery single fucking thing that they do, he\u2019s doing to do."}
