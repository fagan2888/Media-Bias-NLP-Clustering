Featuring comprehensive care services, including heart and vascular care. More at cayugamed.org\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople forget about us down here,\u201d Dan Ramer, chief operator at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility (IAWWTF) said in an interview last week. \u201cBut these facilities allow for advanced civilization.\u201d\n\nThe IAWWTF, in operation since 1987, treats between 6 and 7 million gallons of sewage per day, coming from the City of Ithaca, the Town of Ithaca and some of the town of Dryden (the part along Rt. 13, before NYSEG). Water processed by the plant gets sent a half mile out into the middle of Cayuga Lake.\n\nThe plant is currently undergoing major renovations - the first since the plant was commissioned 27 years ago. The changes and updates, which include improvements to the plant\u2019s digesters, biogas storage and biogas utilization (explained further down) are all geared towards improving the efficiency and sustainability of the plant.\n\nRamer said it\u2019s about investing money to save money.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re community owned,\u201d Ramer said. \u201cAnybody who owns a home or pays rent in Ithaca owns a part of this plant. And so when I invest your - as a rate-payer - your money, I do it based on two concepts. One: efficiency. Two: reliability.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny dollar we save is an immediate savings to the community,\u201d Ramer said.\n\nThe Process\n\n1. Primary, secondary, tertiary treatment of sewage.\n\n2. Sludge Digestion\n\n3. Biogas utilization\n\n4. Trucked Waste\n\nGetting water ready for \u201cprime-time\u201d\n\nAfter the sewage from the three municipalities hits the IAWWTF, it\u2019s pumped up to a higher height. This creates a gravity gradient so that the water can flow downward through the plant. This pumping is one of the plant's main energy sinks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 120 horsepower motors running 24/7 to move about 50 million pounds of water per day.\u201d\n\nAfter the water is pumped to the necessary height it flows through primary, secondary, and tertiary tanks. Primary tanks are just for settling - waste settles out the bottom or froths up to the top, and is collected.\n\nThe (still very dirty) water which leaves the primary tank runs in to the secondary tank, where it is further cleaned by what\u2019s called an \u201cactivated sludge\u201d process. Basically, to \u201cactivate\u201d the sludge, the plant just adds oxygen.\n\nSeveral large blowers (to be upgraded in renovations) located in a gallery below blow dissolved oxygen up into the secondary treatment tanks. The oxygen in the water boosts the metabolic processes of organisms which are either already present in the sewage, or which fall down into the tanks out of the air.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re natural organisms,\u201d Ramer said. \u201cWe just give them an optimal engineered environment.\u201d\n\nOnce the organisms have eaten up much of the waste in the secondary treatment phase, the water is sent on to tertiary treatment tanks where more waste settles out. Added iron and polymers speed the settling process.\n\nThen, once water has left tertiary treatment, a bit of bleach is added as a disinfectant.\n\nAfter disinfection is complete, the water is \u201cready for prime time,\u201d as Ramer puts it, and is sent out into the lake.\n\nThe fruits of our waste\n\nThroughout the process, the \u201cwaste\u201d which is taken out of the water is largely repurposed. Organisms which collect at the bottom of the secondary treatment tank are either pumped back to the top of the tank \u201cto do more work,\u201d or are pumped out into thickening tanks.\n\n\u201cWith every growing system you\u2019ve got to trim the hedges,\u201d Ramer said, \u201cso we send some of these organisms to thicken in tanks, and then we send them on to the digesters.\u201d\n\nThe digesters - two massive round tanks - are where all of the waste and organisms are sent to collect.\n\nInside the digesters is an anaerobic (de-oxygenated) environment where the sludge festers and breaks down. In the first tank, a massive \u201cscotch yoke\u201d churns the waste. In the other tank, the waste is simply left to settle.\n\nThe anaerobic breakdown of waste produces methane gas.\n\nRamer said that the plant has simply optimized a natural process. In swamps, the slow breakdown of organic matter beneath the water creates bubbles of flammable methane gas. Ramer said that if you stirred up the muck in a swamp and placed a funnel where the gas bubbles up, you'd be able to replicate the process which occurs at the IAWWTF.\n\n\"Pop the cork, light it, you\u2019ll get a flare that comes up,\" Ramer said. \"That\u2019s the same process that happens in our digesters.\u201d\n\nHarnessing Swamp Gas\n\nAt the IAWWTF, the gas isn\u2019t just set alight and wasted in the open air. It is harnessed.\n\nThe biogas, as Ramer calls it, which is produced in the digesters is sent to high-tech \u201cco-generating\u201d microturbines. These machines, which have been installed as part of the new renovations, harness the energy of the biogas to \u201ccogenerate\u201d electricity and heat. The heat is used to warm the digesters and the energy is used to fuel the plant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re generating about 30-50% of our own electricity,\u201d Ramer said.\n\nThe microturbine machines look more like computer servers than engines. The turbines inside spin at about 95,000 RPMs and they generate 182 Kilowatts of power.\n\n\u201cWe will never work on these,\u201d Ramer said. \u201cThey are \u2018other\u2019 to us.\u201d\n\nThe installation of new microturbines, along with other improvements to the plant, have been made possible by a $10 million \u201cperformance contract\u201d with Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls has guaranteed that the improvements will pay for themselves in 15-20 years.\n\n\n\nFor Fear of the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d\n\nAlthough the IAWWTF does a good job of repurposing most of its waste, there are still materials that it cannot, at this point, put to good use. One crucial challenge for the plant is figuring out what to do with 45,000 wet tons of \u201cbiosolids\u201d waste which the plant produces annually.\n\nAlthough these materials tend to be very nutrient rich (and might thus be safe to compost or use as fertilizer) there is some question about their ecological safety. The biosolids which the plant produces contain what are called \u201cemerging contaminants,\u201d and there is a worry that these contaminants might pollute the environment if they are simply laid down on the soil.\n\nRamer said that the risks associated with emerging contaminants remain largely unknown.\n\n\u201cAre they dangerous? We don\u2019t know. Are they deadly? We know they\u2019re not deadly,\u201d Ramer said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Love Canal. This isn\u2019t PCBs. This is endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, flame retardant which comes off of furniture - weird stuff at very low levels.\u201d\n\nAlthough the state does not task the IAWWTF to look for these materials in their biosolids, Ramer and his staff are doing it anyway. They are working with the United States Geological Survey to develop ways of determining the risks associated with emerging contaminants.\n\n\u201cThis is not a national priority,\u201d Ramer said. \u201cBut it needs to be.\u201d\n\nUntil they know the risks associated with emerging contaminants, the IAWWTF will continue to send truckloads of biosolids - about 5 a week - to a landfill in Geneva.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is that this community does not have a landfill. That\u2019s not one of our local options. If we want to solve our problems locally we have to come up with other ways of doing it,\" Ramer said.\n\nTrucking biosolids to Geneva costs the plant about $300,000 per year and is a black-eye for the plant\u2019s sustainability goals.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at that from a greenhouse gas perspective,\u201d Ramer said, \u201cit\u2019s a big negative. It\u2019s not trivial.\u201d\n\nRamer said that improvements currently being made to the IAWWTF are a big step in the right direction, but that they are continuing look for ways to make the plant more sustainable, ecological and affordable for the community.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inside the Ithaca area's wastewater treatment facility", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Ithaca Voice", "description": "Inside the Ithaca area's wastewater treatment facility", "title": "Inside the Ithaca area's wastewater treatment facility", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://ithacavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-10-27-10.49.48.jpg", "height": 1536}, "updated_time": "2014-11-14T14:01:10-04:00", "url": "http://ithacavoice.com/2014/11/wastewater-treatment-plant-gets-upgrades-pursues-sustainability-goals/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2014-11-09T09:12:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-14T14:01:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Several large blowers (to be upgraded in renovations) located in a gallery below blow dissolved oxygen up into the secondary treatment tanks.\nMore at cayugamed.org\u201cPeople forget about us down here,\u201d Dan Ramer, chief operator at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility (IAWWTF) said in an interview last week.\n\u201cThey\u2019re natural organisms,\u201d Ramer said.\n\u201cWe just give them an optimal engineered environment.\u201dOnce the organisms have eaten up much of the waste in the secondary treatment phase, the water is sent on to tertiary treatment tanks where more waste settles out.\nOrganisms which collect at the bottom of the secondary treatment tank are either pumped back to the top of the tank \u201cto do more work,\u201d or are pumped out into thickening tanks."}
