The office is led by industry veteran Steve Tutwiler with the goal of tapping into the Front Range region\u2019s high-impact healthcare workforce, one of the largest, fastest growing and most talented in the nation.\n\n\u201cThe year 2014 is critical for healthcare payers and providers, and the Denver market is poised for national leadership in the areas of business management, finance and administration,\u201d said Tutwiler. \u201cWith our full-services ranging from contract to contingency, we\u2019re a principal-driven firm with the entrepreneurial spirit and small-town values that are the right fit for our region\u2019s growing healthcare infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado healthcare market is growing exponentially with three major hospital systems, thousands of health and wellness companies, and more than 169,150 healthcare workers. With the Affordable Care Act (ACA) now in effect, it is estimated that 500,000 Coloradans will have insurance that were previously uninsured, creating the need for more healthcare professionals on both the clinical and administrative sides. Another milestone in 2014 affecting all organizations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) including healthcare systems, hospitals, clinics and insurance companies is the required migration to ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases) coding procedures by October 1.\n\n\u201cThe JRP Group places high-impact finance professionals who specialize in the ACA and ICD-10 to help healthcare organizations mitigate risk and reduce the instance of compliance penalties,\u201d said Tutwiler, who was recently named vice president of staffing services and will lead the new healthcare division of the JRP Group.
