But Marshawn Lynch has finally spoken about the final play.\n\nAt the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line with 26 seconds remaining and one timeout left, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson opted to throw instead of handing off the ball to Lynch. The pass, intended for Ricardo Lockette, was picked off by New England rookie Malcolm Butler, sealing the Patriots\u2019 victory.\n\nThe call baffled seemingly everyone who watched the game, as well Richard Sherman and many other Seahawks players.\n\nAfter the game, Lynch told Jim Trotter that he wasn\u2019t surprised he didn\u2019t get the ball on the final play \u201cbecause we play football. It\u2019s a team sport.\u201d But in an interview with Turkish sports network NTV Spor, he admitted he was among the millions who expected a different outcome:\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I would be lying if I didn\u2019t tell you that I was expecting the ball. Yes, I was expecting the ball. But in life, these things happen. Like I told a reporter after the game, it\u2019s a team sport. \u201cI had no problem with the decision of the playcalling. I mean, you know \u2026 I think it was more of a \u2026 how do I say this? When you look at me, and you let me run that ball in \u2026 I am the face of the nation. You know, MVP of the Super Bowl \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much the face of the nation at that point of time. I don\u2019t know what went into that call. I mean, maybe it was a good thing that I didn\u2019t get the ball. I mean, you know, it cost us the Super Bowl. I mean, I have full \u2026 I have full confidence in my teammates to execute that plan because we\u2019ve done it so many more times. But would I love to had the ball in? Yes, I would have. \u201cBut the game is over, and I am in Turkey.\u201d\n\n(via Yahoo Sports)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Marshawn Lynch,Patriots,Seattle Seahawks,Super Bowl XLIX", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Marshawn Lynch appeared on Turkish TV and admitted he was surprised he didn't get the ball in the Seahawks' final play of the Super Bowl.", "title": "Marshawn Lynch finally opens up about Seahawks' final play in Super Bowl", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/03/01/marshawn-lynch-finally-opens-seahawks-final-play-super-bowl/32761/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/03/GettyImages_463697882-495x311.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Marshawn Lynch appeared on Turkish TV and admitted he was surprised he didn't get the ball in the Seahawks' final play of the Super Bowl.", "title": "Marshawn Lynch finally opens up about Seahawks\u2019 final play in Super Bowl", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/03/01/marshawn-lynch-finally-opens-seahawks-final-play-super-bowl/32761/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/03/GettyImages_463697882-495x311.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Marshawn Lynch appeared on Turkish TV and admitted he was surprised he didn't get the ball in the Seahawks' final play of the Super Bowl."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s been a month since the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX.\nAfter the game, Lynch told Jim Trotter that he wasn\u2019t surprised he didn\u2019t get the ball on the final play \u201cbecause we play football.\nYou know, MVP of the Super Bowl \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much the face of the nation at that point of time.\nI mean, you know, it cost us the Super Bowl.\nBut Marshawn Lynch has finally spoken about the final play."}
