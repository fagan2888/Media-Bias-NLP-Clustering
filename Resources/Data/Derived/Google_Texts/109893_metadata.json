He has multiple sclerosis, which has spread through his 6-foot-4 frame, stranding him in a wheelchair, slurring his speech and contorting his hands into claws.\n\nFlare-ups of the disease and related bladder infections sent Smolen, 46, to the hospital 17 times between April 2012 and March 2014. Then he enrolled in a research project run by Essentia Health, where nurse Sandi Kari coordinates all his medical care and personal needs.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s sought treatment at the hospital just twice. \u201cShe\u2019s my medical advocate,\u201d Smolen said, smiling.\n\nThe project that helped Smolen is just one of 290 research ventures and clinical trials underway at Essentia as it tries to analyze and solve the distinct problems of medical care in the rural Midwest, where poverty is high, specialists are scarce and many people are uninsured.\n\nNearly six in 10 of Minnesota\u2019s hospitals are in rural areas and have no more than 25 beds. Rural residents share the health problems of their urban counterparts, but have less access to medical specialists and mental health workers, according to the National Rural Health Association. They also tend to be poorer, to rely more heavily on food stamps and to have high blood pressure and other chronic conditions.\n\nDr. Joe Bianco, who oversees Essentia\u2019s primary care practice, captures the challenges with the story of a young Ely patient who was being treated for diabetes. When the boy\u2019s condition worsened, Bianco checked his medical record and noticed that he\u2019d been skipping appointments with diabetes specialists in Duluth, a two-hour drive away.\n\nSandi Kari, an R.N. in Ely, Minn., sees to Matt Smolen\u2019s medical needs through a community care program developed by Essentia.\n\nThe diabetic center had described the patient as \u201cnoncompliant, which is a word we don\u2019t use at Essentia,\u201d Bianco said. He called on Heidi Favet, a care team leader, who found the boy\u2019s household in distress. The parents, who were poor, were about to split up. The mother lacked basic financial and cooking skills.\n\nIf a patient can\u2019t heat their home, \u201cdiabetes is not in the conversation,\u201d said Laurie Hall, the Ely Clinic\u2019s administrator.\n\nFavet tapped her sources in the community, helping the boy\u2019s mother get counseling, learn to manage a checkbook and arrange telemedicine consults with the diabetes clinic.\n\n\u201cWe treated his blood sugars not with medicines \u2014 we treated them by dealing with all of this other stuff,\u201d Bianco said.\n\n70 ER visits\n\nFounded just five years ago, the Essentia Institute of Rural Health has received more than $3.7 million in federal and state grants, plus $870,000 in industry funds, to research topics as diverse as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, human genetics, chronic illnesses, palliative care and rural health disparities. In August, it was selected as one of 34 collaborators nationwide for a five-year study of cancer treatment in underserved communities, including people in rural areas.\n\nIts parent company, Duluth-based Essentia Health, has about 900,000 patients spread across 66 clinics and 17 hospitals in mostly rural areas in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Idaho.\n\nBianco says coordinated care makes business sense in addition to helping patients.\n\n\u201cWe had one patient who had 70 visits to our ER last year,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cBecause we intervened with her, we cut that down by 60 percent.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, the landmark federal law now before the U.S. Supreme Court, was designed to reward clinics and hospitals for quality and efficiencies. Essentia, with its robust research program, is prepared to prove that its methods benefit patients at bargain prices.\n\nTo succeed, however, Essentia must overcome obstacles not found in urban areas. Rural patients, for instance, are far more likely to see primary care doctors than their urban counterparts, and today much of the country faces a shortage of primary care physicians.\n\nEssentia\u2019s Ely Area Community Care Teams, established in 2011, allow primary care docs to work with other professionals \u2014 advanced nurse practitioners, social workers, educators and others \u2014 to look after patients.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that if we can free up the doctor, the doctor will be so much more effective,\u201d Favet said.\n\nHall said Favet was hired because of her connections with community groups like the Girl Scouts and Outward Bound. She lacks industry preconceptions, Hall said, and can see fresh ways to help patients.\n\n\u201cI definitely walk in the door and say, \u2018Why do you do it this way?\u2019 \u201d Favet said.\n\nCassie Eggebraaten, 29, is one of her success stories. Eggebraaten suffers from a psychiatric disorder and severe anxiety. She returned to Ely from Arkansas about 18 months ago and had difficulty getting her Social Security disability payments transferred to Minnesota. Favet helped resolve the problem and connected her with community resources.\n\nEggebraaten now does volunteer work and has gained enough confidence to enter her artwork in juried shows. She called Favet \u201cmy rock.\u201d\n\nEssentia\u2019s primary care doctors also use computerized tools that help them diagnose cases and prompt them to collect research data. One, for example, prompts them to administer a quick, three-minute dementia test in older patients as part of another study. The sooner dementia patients can set up community services, the better they will fare, said Steve Waring, a senior research scientist at Essentia who formerly worked at Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cEarly on we recognized that probably 90 percent of what a person with dementia needs isn\u2019t provided by the health care system,\u201d he said.\n\nChurch and brunch\n\nFrances Brin, 81, moved to an Ely nursing home in September with her husband, Robert, 80. They had been living in a memory care unit in Wichita, Kan., but their children grew concerned after a psychiatrist prescribed powerful, expensive antipsychotic medications for Frances.\n\n\u201cWe felt like she was disappearing,\u201d said their daughter, Becca Brin Manlove. She said the doctor in Kansas was so busy that the family could never discuss their concerns with him.\n\nNow Peggy York-Jesme, an Essentia nurse practitioner, coordinates \u201cwraparound\u201d care for the retired schoolteacher. Simply by reassuring her and surrounding her with memorabilia from home, the care team has reduced her bouts of agitation, while weaning her from most of the powerful drugs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s emerged is this really delightful lady,\u201d York-Jesme said.\n\nFrances Brin and her husband of 59 years now get out to church and brunch regularly.\n\nBrin Manlove said that despite the shortage of experts like geriatric psychiatrists, she\u2019s thrilled to have her parents in Ely.\n\n\u201cYou have more experts [in the urban areas], but you don\u2019t have these people that know you, like Peggy,\u201d she said. \u201cShe sees my parents at church.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Essentia seeks to improve care when services are few and far between.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Essentia seeks to improve care when services are few and far between.", "title": "Minnesota's Essentia discovers that, in rural medicine, creativity is often the cure", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/in-rural-medicine-creativity-is-often-the-cure/296330911/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_1426370435827.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_1426370435827.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Essentia seeks to improve care when services are few and far between.", "title": "Minnesota's Essentia discovers that, in rural medicine, creativity is often the cure", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/in-rural-medicine-creativity-is-often-the-cure/296330911/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_1426370435827.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_1426370435827.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "NIH"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Essentia Health,Rural doctors,medical research,HealthPartners,NIH"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb027\"", "article_summary": "Rural residents share the health problems of their urban counterparts, but have less access to medical specialists and mental health workers, according to the National Rural Health Association.\nRural patients, for instance, are far more likely to see primary care doctors than their urban counterparts, and today much of the country faces a shortage of primary care physicians.\n\u201cEarly on we recognized that probably 90 percent of what a person with dementia needs isn\u2019t provided by the health care system,\u201d he said.\nThen he enrolled in a research project run by Essentia Health, where nurse Sandi Kari coordinates all his medical care and personal needs.\nIts parent company, Duluth-based Essentia Health, has about 900,000 patients spread across 66 clinics and 17 hospitals in mostly rural areas in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Idaho."}
