The promise the Chinese government made to Britain and to the world as Hong Kong reverted to Chinese control at midnight on June 30, 1997, that China would abide by the "one country, two systems" plan, which would afford Hong Kong greater autonomy, except in matters of foreign relations and defense, was to last 50 years.

That promise is falling 33 years short of fulfillment.

Any erosion of Hong Kong's freedom, I wrote in '97, was likely to be gradual and so it has been. With America in retreat around the world, lacking a definable foreign policy, and with the British a mere shadow of their former empirical selves, what's to stop China from escalating that erosion?

As for the broken promise of one country, two systems, it should surprise no one that communists and other dictators lie.
