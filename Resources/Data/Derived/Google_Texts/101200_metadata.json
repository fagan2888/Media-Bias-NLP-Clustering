For more than a decade, she was an elementary school teacher. But in 1999, she finally had to step away from her career because she had so many health problems, including bone degeneration and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like so many times I couldn\u2019t move or having trouble getting up and down once I get straight up, I could move for a while but with the bones and the knee, those are things that need attention,\u201d she says.\n\nLaracuente\u2019s at the Social Security office in Bloomington because her health has gone downhill since she quit her job because she can\u2019t afford the medications and treatment she needs. When she quit her job she also lost her insurance. She tried to apply for healthcare through the state\u2019s Medicaid program, but was denied.\n\nNow, Laracuente can\u2019t get coverage through the Affordable Care Act either.\n\nThe irony, if you make above the 100 percent of federal poverty then you can buy insurance on the exchanges and get a subsidy to help pay for your premiums but if you fall below 100 percent of poverty then you\u2019re too poor and you don\u2019t get any help at all,\u201d says Dr. Rob Stone, the founder of Hoosiers for a Commonsense Healthcare Plan.\n\nAs many as 400,000 Hoosiers are in the same boat as Laracuente.\n\nHow The Healthy Indiana Plan Plays Into Medicaid Expansion\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid to 138-percent of the poverty level, but Indiana Governor Mike Pence said no. And he wanted to expand the system using the Health Indiana Plan Model.\n\nIn August he announced the state had gotten a waiver from the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary to continue the program through 2014.\n\nBut after 2014 it\u2019s up in the air.\n\nThe program which has been in effect since 2008 requires Hoosiers to- as Pence likes to say \u2013 have skin in the game. People have to help pay for their first $1,100 of care. The number of people who can enroll in it is capped.\n\n\u201cA single person with no dependents essentially can\u2019t get on so that\u2019s a huge issue,\u201d Stone says. \u201cBut even a family of four in Indiana right now has a hard time getting on the Healthy Indiana plan because they keep capping the enrollment. And for traditional Medicaid, a family of four can only make 24 percent of federal poverty, it works out to $11.39 a day. If a family of four makes $11.40 a day, they make too much money for Medicaid. It\u2019s incredible. Those are third world numbers.\n\nHe adds that with a Medicaid expansion, which would include people up to 138 percent of poverty level, a family of four can have two people each working 40 hours a week at $7.25 an hour minimum wage, and they would qualify for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a decision in this state to pretty much cover females with dependents,\u201d says health care expert Chris Schrader, the president of Schrader and Associates human resources firm. \u201cSo that\u2019s really what the HIP plan is. So if you were an adult who was poor with no children, male or female, it didn\u2019t matter, there was pretty much no room for you at the inn.\u201d\n\nAbout 38,000 people are currently enrolled in the state\u2019s Healthy Indiana Plan. Another 52,000 Hoosiers are on the waiting list.\n\nBut that number could change because eligibility requirements for the Healthy Indiana Plan are being reduced from 200 percent of the poverty level to 100 poverty level.\n\nMore than 10,000 Hoosiers who had coverage through the Healthy Indiana Plan are losing it at the end of the month.\n\nA spokesperson for the Family and Social Services Administration, which is in charge of the Healthy Indiana Plan, wouldn\u2019t agree to an on camera interview but in an e-mail said \u201cby reducing the income standard for the Healthy Indiana Plan, it allows more people to be covered and eliminates the potential for duplication of coverage.\u201d\n\nBut Schrader says that does not fundamentally change the nature of the uninsured.\n\n\u201cSo the penalty Indiana had to pay to get the waiver extended was to actually throw people off the plan and that was unfortunate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that throwing people off the plan didn\u2019t create capacity. So perhaps some poorer people who had been in line for many months might not be able to get on. But that\u2019s just moving cups and balls, right?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how it breaks down:\n\nIn other words, starting in 2014, if you make up to 24 percent of the poverty level, you could qualify for Medicaid. If you make between 24 percent and 100 percent of the poverty level, you could qualify for the Healthy Indiana Plan. If you make between 100 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level, you should qualify for subsidies under the health exchange.\n\nWeighing The Cost Of Medicaid Expansion\n\nIn this past legislative session, lawmakers set aside $250 million for potential costs associated with the Affordable Care Act. Stone says he would like to ask Governor Pence why he says there\u2019s money to expand Medicaid when that money is just sitting.\n\nThrough 2016 the federal government has agreed to pay 100-percent of the cost to expand Medicaid. It would go down incrementally after that to 90-percent in 2020. Stone says Indiana has the money to pay its share of the cost.\n\nThere are estimates of what it would cost to expand Medicaid in Indiana through the ACA and they range from a low of $50 million and a high of $150 million a year,\u201d he says.\n\nLaracuente agrees.\n\n\u201cI think we spend plenty of money on a lot of other things that could wait. Let\u2019s make our people healthy,\u201d Laracuente says.\u201d\n\nWith few exceptions, everyone is required to have health insurance in a year or face tax penalties.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great but some people won\u2019t be able to pay for it at all,\u201d Laracuente says. \u201cI know what I\u2019ve heard among the extremely poor and those of us who\u2019ve been at the very bottom and even below, it\u2019s like, we have our deadline date or you\u2019re going to jail and it\u2019s like, well, I guess we\u2019re going to have to build more jails.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely people will actually go jail if they fail to sign up for insurance.\n\nFor states that do not expand Medicaid program, people who fall below 100 percent of the federal poverty level will not be penalized for failing to obtain insurance.\n\nFor people with incomes above 100 percent of the poverty level, the penalty in 2014 for not having coverage is either 1 percent of a person\u2019s income or $95, whichever is greater. Those fees increase every year.\n\nBut the IRS says if you can\u2019t afford to pay the fine with the tax return, it will take it out of any refund you might owe, and the law prohibits the IRS from seizing your property as a penalty for failing to have health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana has declined to expand Medicaid, but state officials say they still could expand coverage through the Healthy Indiana Plan.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Indiana has declined to expand Medicaid, but state officials say they still could expand coverage through the Healthy Indiana Plan.", "title": "Up To 400,000 Hoosiers Fall Into Medicaid Coverage Gap | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/400000-hoosiers-fall-medicaid-coverage-gap-59635/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/12/stethescope-940x626.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/12/stethescope-940x626.jpg", "description": "Indiana has declined to expand Medicaid, but state officials say they still could expand coverage through the Healthy Indiana Plan.", "card": "summary", "title": "Up To 400,000 Hoosiers Fall Into Medicaid Coverage Gap"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe027e\"", "article_summary": "More than 10,000 Hoosiers who had coverage through the Healthy Indiana Plan are losing it at the end of the month.\nAnd he wanted to expand the system using the Health Indiana Plan Model.\nHow The Healthy Indiana Plan Plays Into Medicaid ExpansionThe Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid to 138-percent of the poverty level, but Indiana Governor Mike Pence said no.\nBut that number could change because eligibility requirements for the Healthy Indiana Plan are being reduced from 200 percent of the poverty level to 100 poverty level.\n\u201cBut even a family of four in Indiana right now has a hard time getting on the Healthy Indiana plan because they keep capping the enrollment."}
