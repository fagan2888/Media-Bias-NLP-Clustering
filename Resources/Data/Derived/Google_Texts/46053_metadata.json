He had 51 pop chart singles in seven years, produced \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d with Van Morrison, watched \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d get recorded by the Beatles and \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d and \u201cCry Baby\u201d would later be recorded by Janis Joplin.\n\nBut the music world has largely overlooked Berns, even while glorifying his contemporaries including Carole King, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and Cynthia Mann and Barry Weill. Diagnosed with rheumatic fever as a child, he died at 38 in 1967, leaving three children under two and a 24-year-old widow.\n\nNow, two of his children, Cassandra and Brett (who, along with their brother Mark, own their father\u2019s catalogue in partnership with Sony), are trying to get their dad in the limelight. A book by rock writer Joel Selvin, \u201cHere Comes The Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm & Blues,\u201d came out in April, a documentary with interviews with Van Morrison and Paul McCartney will open next year, and a new musical, \u201cPiece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story,\u201d opens at Signature Center on Monday.\n\nIn the musical, written by playwright Daniel Goldfarb, (who was commissioned by Brett and Cassandra to write the piece) audiences learn that Berns, a kid from the Bronx, used his bad heart as a reason to live hard: hanging out with mobsters, running drugs and guns in Castro\u2019s Cuba, and writing songs that take on a new meaning in light of his condition. (The line \u201cTake another piece of my heart\u201d sounds a lot sadder if he\u2019s talking about his own.)\n\nHe also fought to control the songs he wrote and produced, forming Bang Records with partners Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun and Jerry Wexler (the heads of Atlantic Records.) When Mr. Wexler tried to buy him out, Mr. Berns used his mob connections to threaten Mr. Wexler, according to the play. In the show, Mr. Wexler (who had mob connections of his own, according to the play) backs down but threatens: I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure the name Bert Berns is nothing more than a footnote.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldfarb says he believes that\u2019s exactly what happened, and that Berns\u2019 children are trying to undo the Wexler curse through the musical, book and documentary projects.\n\nThe play includes 24 songs \u2014 only ten of which are well known to audiences. The actor who plays Mr. Berns, Zak Resnick, sings like a cross between Justin Timberlake and Mel Torme, says Mr. Goldfarb, who adds that that regard, Mr. Berns\u2019 forgotten voice was a benefit: \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to find someone who sounded like him, because no one knows what he sounded like,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A new play sheds light on the career of songwriter Bert Berns, who penned a number of famous 1960s tunes but has been largely overlooked by the music world.", "title": "Musical \u2018Piece of My Heart\u2019 Examines Bert Berns\u2019 Songwriting Career", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/18/musical-piece-of-my-heart-examines-bert-berns-songwriting-career/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DT374_berns_G_20140718111505.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Musical \u2018Piece of My Heart\u2019 Examines Bert Berns\u2019 Songwriting Career", "description": "A new play sheds light on the career of songwriter Bert Berns, who penned a number of famous 1960s tunes but has been largely overlooked by the music world.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Stefanie Cohen", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "A new play sheds light on the career of songwriter Bert Berns, who penned a number of famous 1960s tunes but has been largely overlooked by the music world.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-18T17:00:58-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/18/musical-piece-of-my-heart-examines-bert-berns-songwriting-career/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-82341", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A new play sheds light on the career of songwriter Bert Berns, who penned a number of famous 1960s tunes but has been largely overlooked by the music world.", "title": "Musical \u2018Piece of My Heart\u2019 Examines Bert Berns\u2019 Songwriting Career", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/18/musical-piece-of-my-heart-examines-bert-berns-songwriting-career/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DT374_berns_G_20140718111505.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-82341", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-07T14:14:18-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb90\"", "article_summary": "When Mr. Wexler tried to buy him out, Mr. Berns used his mob connections to threaten Mr. Wexler, according to the play.\nBert Berns, the songwriter who penned hits out of the Brill Building has gone largely ignored since climbing the charts in the 60s.\nThe actor who plays Mr. Berns, Zak Resnick, sings like a cross between Justin Timberlake and Mel Torme, says Mr. Goldfarb, who adds that that regard, Mr. Berns\u2019 forgotten voice was a benefit: \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to find someone who sounded like him, because no one knows what he sounded like,\u201d he says.\n(The line \u201cTake another piece of my heart\u201d sounds a lot sadder if he\u2019s talking about his own.)\nA book by rock writer Joel Selvin, \u201cHere Comes The Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm & Blues,\u201d came out in April, a documentary with interviews with Van Morrison and Paul McCartney will open next year, and a new musical, \u201cPiece of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story,\u201d opens at Signature Center on Monday."}
