Then there\u2019s Samuel L. Jackson who\u2019s 65 and Morgan Freeman who just turned 77.\n\nAs if to prove THR\u2019s point, just a day or two after this lamentation about the lack of new black stars, Jamie Foxx, who will turn 47 this year, has been signed to play Mike Tyson in a new biopic.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThere\u2019s no word on what part of Tyson\u2019s life the film will focus on, but if it touches on any part of Tyson\u2019s fight career (which ended when Tyson was 39), especially his early fight career, a pushing-50 Foxx is likely to look as ridiculous as Robert Redford did playing a rookie baseball player in \u201cThe Natural.\u201d\n\nBut Hollywood needed a star in that role and all they got is an undeniably talented but still middle-aged Jamie Foxx.\n\nMissing from THR\u2019s analysis is the fact that Hollywood has a star-star problem. The problem isn\u2019t just black stars, it is white stars, male stars, female stars \u2014 all stars. Too few actors these days can open a film based on their name alone.\n\nIt would appear moviegoers still want to see Sandra Bullock, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Seth Rogen, and Will Ferrell in the right vehicle. But that\u2019s about it. Last year I might have added Adam Sandler and Will Smith to that list, but both have had pretty tough years. The problem is getting worse, not better.\n\nAs far as the why of all this, I\u2019m as tired of running down that list as you are of reading it. Suffice to say, Hollywood has no idea how to fix the problem now that they have painted themselves into the fanboy/tentpole/all-in corner.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "As good as Chadwick Boseman is in the new James Brown biopic", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "As good as Chadwick Boseman is in the new James Brown biopic", "title": "THR: Hollywood Has No New Black Stars - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/08/04/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/08/04/new-black-stars-hollywood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As good as Chadwick Boseman is in the new James Brown biopic", "title": "THR: Hollywood Has No New Black Stars - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/08/04/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Adam Sandler, Hollywood Reporter, Twitter,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-08-04T11:48:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d7b\"", "article_summary": "The problem isn\u2019t just black stars, it is white stars, male stars, female stars \u2014 all stars.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs good as Chadwick Boseman is in the new James Brown biopic \u201cGet On Up\u201d \u2014 and he\u2019s very good \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter correctly notes that Hollywood has no black stars warming up in the bullpen to replace Will Smith (45), Denzel Washington (59), or Eddie Murphy (53).\nSuffice to say, Hollywood has no idea how to fix the problem now that they have painted themselves into the fanboy/tentpole/all-in corner.\nMissing from THR\u2019s analysis is the fact that Hollywood has a star-star problem.\nAs if to prove THR\u2019s point, just a day or two after this lamentation about the lack of new black stars, Jamie Foxx, who will turn 47 this year, has been signed to play Mike Tyson in a new biopic."}
