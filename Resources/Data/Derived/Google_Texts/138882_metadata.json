But if it helps, he did it in a nice way.\n\nCarter made the observation during an interview this week with Parade Magazine.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done the best he could under the circumstances,\u201d Carter said of Obama. \u201cHis major accomplishment was Obamacare, and the implementation of it now is questionable at best.\u201d\n\nThe two presidents\u2019 management styles are polar opposites. Carter was so hands-on, he reportedly kept track of who was using the White House tennis court. Obama often appears disengaged to the point of indifference. But the result is the same \u2014 ineffectiveness.\n\nJohn Fund wrote in a 2010 Wall Street Journal op-ed:\n\nBut within a few months, liberals were already finding fault with [Obama\u2019s] rhetoric. \u201cHe\u2019s the great earnest bore at the dinner party,\u201d wrote Michael Wolff, a contributor to Vanity Fair. \u201cHe\u2019s cold; he\u2019s prickly; he\u2019s uncomfortable; he\u2019s not funny; and he\u2019s getting awfully tedious. He thinks it\u2019s all about him.\u201d That sounds like a critique of Mr. Carter.\n\nMaureen Dowd said on a New York Times column:\n\nAs one Democratic senator complained: \u201cThe president veers between talking like a peevish professor and a scolding parent.\u201d (Not to mention a jilted lover.) Another moaned: \u201cWe are watching him turn into Jimmy Carter right before our eyes.\u201d\n\nAlthough both men assumed the presidency during a recession, each only made matters worse. Carter\u2019s government spending program created a new term in the lexicon of economists \u2014 \u201cstagflation,\u201d the state where inflation is high but growth is sluggish. Obama\u2019s $800 billion stimulus did little but add another $800 billion to the national debt.\n\nThe Carter interview led to the inevitable question of how he hopes history will remember him. He chose to ignore his time in the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be judged primarily by our work at the Carter Center for the last 32 years,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to exclude the White House. But in my more self-satisfied moments, I think about our unwavering promotion of peace and human rights.\u201d\n\nH/T The Daily Caller.\n\n[poll id=\u201d134\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Jimmy Carter, the man considered by Republicans and Democrats alike as the most incompetent U.S. president in modern history, made comments that sure sounded like he called President Barack Obama incompetent over his handling of the Affordable Care Act.
