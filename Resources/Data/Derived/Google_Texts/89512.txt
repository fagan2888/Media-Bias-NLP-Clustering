Butler Health System's director of emerging payment reform — a newly established position — said she is not concerned about taking on the job in the shadow of a federal penalty for returning patients with hospital-acquired conditions.

“It just becomes more of a challenge,” said Donna Haid, 51, who has 30 years of nursing experience. “I believe there are really good people here who want to do the right thing for patients. This gives me an opportunity to help us move in the right direction.”

She said hospital officials were looking for someone to dig into the complexity of reimbursements, something that now ties directly to hospital care.

Provisions in the Affordable Care Act allow the federal government to cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals because of complications patients acquire in the hospital. Butler Memorial will incur a 1 percent reduction from its Medicare discharge payments for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.

Haid will work with physicians as regulations and standards change, and implement teams to look at ways to improve an existing process — or implement a new one — to streamline work.

“Over the years, things have been moving more toward quality and efficiency,” Haid said. “It's gone from treating illness to helping patients become well and maintaining that wellness.”

She will work with physicians' offices to make sure certain benchmarks are hit, such as scheduling immunizations and screenings such as mammograms and colonoscopies on time.

Haid has been at Butler Memorial for nearly 16 years. She has a bachelor's degree in nursing from Penn State and a master's in informatics from Walden University, an online university based in Minneapolis.
