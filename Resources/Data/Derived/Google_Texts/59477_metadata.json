Tami Chappell for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMonths after the Affordable Care Act became law, employment benefits lawyer Thomas Christina paced in his Greenville, S.C., office with its oil portrait of a greenhouse. He was reading the statute to learn its impact on clients.\n\nBy his reading, the wording only allowed health insurance subsidies to be provided through state exchanges. It began to dawn on him that he\u2019d stumbled on something big.\n\nHis 2010 discovery ultimately spurred a legal battle that on Tuesday resulted in two conflicting rulings from U.S. Appeals courts regarding the government\u2019s authority to provide consumers with subsidies on the federal insurance exchange. The continuing legal dispute now threatens the subsidies provided to more than four million Americans.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like lightning struck,\u201d said Mr. Christina, 59, a shareholder at the labor and employment law firm Ogletree Deakins. \u201cIt was a gradual process. But I knew this was a significant enough issue that it would end up in the courts.\u201d\n\nThe bearded and bespectacled Mr. Christina, an avid gardener and father of three grown children, is a relatively obscure figure behind the litigation. But the Harvard University graduate has been a central figure in a legal standoff that is likely to wind up at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the person who came up with this,\u201d said Thomas Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cHe deserves full credit.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the authority for the subsidies on the federal exchange used by up to 36 states. It held that a regulation by the Internal Revenue Service allowing the subsidies nationwide wasn\u2019t a permissible interpretation.\n\nBut that same day, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va. came to the opposite conclusion, ruling that consumers in states using the federal marketplace could get subsidies.\n\nMr. Christina is reluctant to discuss his reasons for scouring the law. \u201cIt\u2019s not really that I was looking for anything in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cMy role at the firm was to be the person keeping up with the statute.\u201d\n\nHe also declined to discuss his view of this week\u2019s contrasting opinions, saying diplomatically that \u201ceach opinion explains its own reason for reaching the opposite conclusion.\n\nMr. Christina had previously played a role in other conservative causes. He submitted an amicus brief to the Eleventh Circuit for the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce in Florida, v. the Department of Health and Human Services, urging the court to invalidate the individual mandate. Asked if he\u2019s opposed to the health law, Mr. Christina says it is so vast that he\u2019s not sure anyone can say they are for or against it.\n\nContinue reading at WSJ.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "Meet the Lawyer Whose Eagle Eye Led to This Week\u2019s Health Law Rulings", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/07/24/meet-the-lawyer-whose-eagle-eye-led-to-this-weeks-health-law-rulings/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Meet the Lawyer Whose Eagle Eye Led to This Week\u2019s Health Law Rulings", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Stephanie Armour", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-24T23:08:43-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/07/24/meet-the-lawyer-whose-eagle-eye-led-to-this-weeks-health-law-rulings/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-48699", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/07/24/meet-the-lawyer-whose-eagle-eye-led-to-this-weeks-health-law-rulings/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "title": "Meet the Lawyer Whose Eagle Eye Led to This Week\u2019s Health Law Rulings"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-48699", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-24T23:09:12-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Asked if he\u2019s opposed to the health law, Mr. Christina says it is so vast that he\u2019s not sure anyone can say they are for or against it.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like lightning struck,\u201d said Mr. Christina, 59, a shareholder at the labor and employment law firm Ogletree Deakins.\nTami Chappell for The Wall Street JournalMonths after the Affordable Care Act became law, employment benefits lawyer Thomas Christina paced in his Greenville, S.C., office with its oil portrait of a greenhouse.\nEmployment benefits lawyer Thomas Christina in his Greenville, S.C., office.\nMr. Christina had previously played a role in other conservative causes."}
