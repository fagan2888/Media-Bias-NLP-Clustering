Since Hillary Clinton formally announced her plans to run for the White House in April, her campaign has been anything but ideal.

From having her private email server in the hands of the FBI, losing support from white women (a key voting demographic for the former Secretary of State) to Bernie Sanders now beating her in New Hampshire, Clinton’s problems continue to pile up.

There’s also been a lot of speculation that Clinton won’t be the Democrats’ nominee.

Here are 3 other maybes who could choose to enter the 2016 presidential race.

1. Vice President Joe Biden:

Biden ran for president unsuccessfully in both 1988 and 2008. As VP, he’s probably best known for his gaffes than actually influencing policy in the Obama administration. After Obama signed The Patient Affordable Care Act, Biden referred to the moment as a “big fu**** deal.”

With Hillary’s popularity taking a major hit recently, people close to the Vice President have reportedly been approaching donors.

Biden’s son, Beau, had a dying wish for his dad to make another run for the White House. GOP contender Donald Trump thinks Biden is going to enter the race, and that he’ll face him in the general election.

2. Al Gore:

Gore ran for president in 1988 and in 2000. He managed to win the popular vote, but failed to secure the electoral one. With what’s turning out to be a rough campaign for Clinton, there is rumor that Gore might give things another go.

According to BuzzFeed, Gore supporters are discussing the possibility of the former vice president running again. In 2010, the majority of Americans had an unfavorable view of him.

As of now, he hasn’t shot down the suggestion to run. Maybe third time will be the charm.

3. Michael Bloomberg:

The former New York City Mayor hasn’t even hinted at presidential ambitions. However, some people on Wall Street want him to give it a shot. The New York Post reported that many Democrats feel Bloomberg could bridge the gap with independent voters.

It’s hard to say how well Bloomberg could do. When he tried to ban large sugar-filled beverages in New York City, the move was struck down by the state’s courts.

But people in New York City generally viewed Bloomberg’s time while mayor as a positive one. While Bloomberg has re-branded himself as an independent, the majority of his policy positions align with the Democrats’ platform. Interestingly enough, he’s also worth several billion dollars more than GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
