Mark Dayton heads into re-election with the highest job approval rating of his term, according to a new Star Tribune Minnesota Poll.\n\nThe poll found that 58 percent of Minnesotans think Dayton is doing a good job as governor, with 29 percent saying they disapprove. Those numbers come after the governor orchestrated an income tax increase on the wealthy and after the troubled rollout of the state\u2019s health care exchange that opponents hoped would diminish his popularity.\n\n\u201cGiven that it\u2019s been a challenging couple of months with MNsure and the light-rail line and the like, I think it shows people are looking at the big picture of how the state is doing overall,\u201d Dayton said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly gratified by these numbers, but there\u2019s a lot more work ahead. I think Minnesota has made excellent progress in jobs and education but we have a lot more to do in those and other areas as well.\u201d\n\nDayton is preparing for a legislative session later this month and a re-election campaign where Republican rivals will try to put a dent in those ratings.\n\nThe task may be formidable. More than half of independents give Dayton high marks, along with a fourth of Republicans and 64 percent of those with no political affiliation. Nearly 90 percent of Democrats say that, more than three years since he took office, they like the job Dayton is doing.\n\nHis job rating has also proved durable. Dayton is up 1 percentage point from June, when he was at 57 percent and his disapproval stood at a slightly higher 31 percent. He has fallen below 50 percent only once during his term, last February, but rebounded over the summer.\n\nHow the poll was conducted Today\u2019s Star Tribune Minnesota Poll findings are based on interviews conducted Feb. 10-12 with 800 Minnesota adults via landline (75 percent) and cellphone (25 percent). The poll was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. Results of a poll based on 800 interviews will vary by no more than 3.5 percentage points, plus or minus, from the overall population 95 times out of 100. Margins are larger for groups within the sample, such as Democrats and Republicans. The self-identified party affiliation of the random sample is: 39 percent Democrat, 30 percent Republican, 26 percent independent or other party and 5 percent who said \u201cnone\u201d or declined to cite a party affiliation. Sampling error does not take into account other sources of variation inherent in public opinion surveys, such as nonresponse, question wording or context effects. In addition, news events may have affected opinions during the period the poll was taken. Readers can e-mail questions to djmcgrath@startribune.com.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised. I think he\u2019s doing quite well,\u201d said Joan Sims, an 84-year-old from Prior Lake. Sims said she didn\u2019t have very high expectations for Dayton, who, she recalled, gave himself a failing grade when he served as a U.S. senator.\n\n\u201cI like the fact that he sticks to his guns,\u201d she said.\n\nThe poll surveyed 800 Minnesota adults between Feb. 10 and 12 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Three-fourths were reached through a land line, one-fourth by cellphone. It included 39 percent Democrats, 30 percent Republicans and 26 percent of Minnesotans who said they were independent or identify with a third party. Those numbers track with recent Minnesota voting trends.\n\nDayton has moved up in Minnesotans\u2019 estimation since he won the governorship with just 42 percent of the vote and after a monthlong recount. However, solid approval ratings are no guarantee of easy election. Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty scored a 58 percent approval rating in July 2006, but barely survived a three-way election that November, with a victory margin of 1 percent over his Democratic opponent.\n\nRepublican Ben Golnik, president of the Minnesota Jobs \u00adCoalition, said Republicans will have many issues with which to hit Dayton in coming months. The full brunt of the health exchange rollout, the potential for rising property taxes and the effect of broader tax increases all will hurt the DFL governor in November, he said.\n\n\u201cThe national mood will continue to benefit Republicans,\u201d Golnik said.\n\n\u2018A good place to start\u2019\n\nDayton, too, anticipates that his ratings will go down, once the campaign against him starts in earnest.\n\nHe said his 29 percent statewide disapproval rating \u201cwon\u2019t last long once the independent expenditures start savaging me. But it\u2019s a good place to start.\u201d\n\nSo far, Dayton appears to have escaped being linked to President Obama in a way that damages his political credibility. Minnesotans have soured on the Democratic president, but still approve of their Democratic governor. The president\u2019s job approval rating slipped below 50 percent in the Minnesota Poll for the first time since he took office.\n\nAsked whether they had a favorable, unfavorable or neutral opinion of Dayton \u2014 a slightly different gauge of popularity than job approval \u2014 36 percent of Minnesota adults said they thought favorably of Dayton. An equal percentage said they were neutral about him. Only 24 percent said they had unfavorable opinions of him, giving him the lowest \u201cunfavorable\u201d opinion percentage of any political figure the Minnesota Poll surveyed.\n\nIn the poll, Dayton received far higher marks than Obama, who won Minnesota by 8 percentage points just 15 months ago. According to the poll, fully half of Minnesotans disapprove of the job Obama is doing and only 43 percent give him high marks.\n\nThose bad grades for Obama stretch across most demographic groups the Star Tribune surveyed. In contrast, almost all groups gave Dayton approving job marks.\n\nFor Dayton, the exceptions were among Republicans, men, and outstate Minnesotans.\n\nRichard Lacher of Dora Lake is among those who think Dayton is doing a \u201cterrible\u201d job.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing about as well as he did as senator and he gave himself an F grade,\u201d he said. Lacher, 72, said he likes to think of himself as in the middle politically, but finds himself leaning more conservative all the time.\n\nLacher said he doesn\u2019t like that Dayton raised taxes. He said the governor will likely oppose the PolyMet mining project planned for northern Minnesota, although the governor has been publicly neutral on it. And he is frustrated with MNsure, the Minnesota health exchange ushered in by the federal health care overhaul.\n\n\u201cMNsure \u2014 $160 million for a website? Excuse me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a perfectly good health care system going into it.\u201d\n\nBut Dayton has a fan in Roger Golby, 64.\n\n\u201cI think he is doing a fine job,\u201d said Golby, a DFL Senate district chair from Annandale in Wright County. He said he likes the fact that under Dayton, all-day kindergarten is now free, and that his wife has been able to find affordable health insurance through MNsure. He particularly appreciates that \u00adDayton has reached out to places outside the Twin Cities.\n\n\u201cSome of the former governors, you know who were they were but you\u2019d never see them,\u201d Golby said.\n\nRachel E.
