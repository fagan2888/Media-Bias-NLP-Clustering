Investigations last year revealed the VA had engaged in cover-ups over hidden wait lists that kept veterans\u2019 from getting the medical attention they needed for months\u2014sometimes longer.\n\nWhile the VA chief says his agency is turning around, two federal auditors have issued new reports blasting the VA health system for huge gaps in oversight, serious management issues and IT failures that put facilities \u201cat risk of not fulfilling their mission.\u201d\n\nRelated: VA Wastes Millions, But Still Wants More as Vets Wait for Care\n\nThe auditors voiced their concerns during a hearing this past week before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, where they explained why the VA\u2019s health system was placed on the Government Accountability Office\u2019s annual \u201chigh risk list\u201d that flags the most troubled federal programs.\n\n\u201cRisks to the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality and safety of veterans' healthcare, along with other persistent weaknesses GAO and others have identified in recent years, raised serious concerns about VA's management and oversight of its healthcare system,\" GAO Healthcare Director Debra Draper said.\n\nShe went on to describe the most troubling areas that she said put the VA health system at \u201crisk of failing to serve its mission\u201d including inconsistent management policies and processes, inadequate oversight, major problems with its information technology systems and inadequate training for staff.\n\nThe VA\u2019s own inspector general had a very similar assessment to the GAO\u2019s, which stands in stark comparison to the VA chief\u2019s outlook on his agency.\n\nJohn Daigh, the assistant inspector general for the VA echoed Draper\u2019s concerns before the committee: \"Too often management decisions compromise the most important mission of providing veterans with quality healthcare.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Latest Outrage from Veterans Affairs\n\nHe described findings from a recent probe of smaller hospitals with specialty units and said that it was very challenging for his team to find accurate and unbiased peer reviews of cases and patient care assessments. Because of that, it was very hard to determine whether veterans at these hospitals were receiving quality care.\n\nThat probe comes nearly a year after Congress approved a $16 billion VA reform bill to help the embattled agency serve more people and improve oversight and accountability in care at facilities across the country.\n\nVA Secretary McDonald told reporters last week that the VA is improving and has hired about 800 more doctors and 2,000 nurses to accommodate the increasing demand for treatment as more veterans reach older age and require more care.\n\nStill an independent analysis from the Associated Press said the VA hasn\u2019t improved in meeting that demand. The AP study says between August and February, almost 900,000 appointments nationwide failed to meet the agency\u2019s required timeliness standards, and that it took longer than 30 days to see a doctor.\n\nThough auditors acknowledge that it\u2019s going to take more than a year to get the VA back on track, the reports call into question whether Congress\u2019s massive bill \u2013essentially throwing billions of dollars at the program\u2014will succeed.\n\nLast week, McDonald announced the agency is creating an 11-member advisory board\u2014the Special Medical Advisory Group\u2014that will be tasked with the overall reform efforts. The board will be comprised of doctors and health experts familiar with what works best in private, nonprofit and public facilities. McDonald told reporters that the advisory board will \u201creturn the VA to pre-eminence.\u201d\n\nTop Reads at The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald is trying desperately to convince the public t", "title": "Veterans Affairs Department Makes the Government\u2019s \u2018High Risk\u2019 List", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/03/Veterans-Affairs-Department-Makes-Government-s-High-Risk-List", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06222014_Veterans_Affairs_Building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/03/Veterans-Affairs-Department-Makes-Government-s-High-Risk-List", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06222014_Veterans_Affairs_Building.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald is trying desperately to convince the public t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald is trying desperately to convince the public that his embattled agency is on the road to reform.\nLast week, McDonald announced the agency is creating an 11-member advisory board\u2014the Special Medical Advisory Group\u2014that will be tasked with the overall reform efforts.\nBecause of that, it was very hard to determine whether veterans at these hospitals were receiving quality care.\nMcDonald told reporters that the advisory board will \u201creturn the VA to pre-eminence.\u201dTop Reads at The Fiscal Times:\nInvestigations last year revealed the VA had engaged in cover-ups over hidden wait lists that kept veterans\u2019 from getting the medical attention they needed for months\u2014sometimes longer."}
