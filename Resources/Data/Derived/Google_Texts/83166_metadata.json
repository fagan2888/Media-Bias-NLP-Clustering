So familiar is he to the state\u2019s voters, the clip seems to imply, that he doesn\u2019t need to actually say anything. Stock footage of him rambling in front of crowds set to generic music is enough to goose his numbers. But there\u2019s a flaw in that theory: What\u2019s with the shots at the beginning of McConnell smiling vacantly? He looks afflicted. Is he going for a sympathy vote?\n\nOne of the weirdest ads I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 but as it turns out, there\u2019s a rational explanation.\n\nBut the video isn\u2019t about pitching McConnell\u2019s candidacy \u2014 at least not directly. It\u2019s about coordinating with super PACs in plain sight. Candidates and the super PACs that support them aren\u2019t allowed to share videos, or any other information, in private. So campaigns have increasingly gone public, posting b-roll clips of their candidate shaking hands with all sorts of constituents in hopes that the images wind up in future TV ads. Hence, the McConnell montage includes clips of fellow Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul standing behind him, McConnell shaking hands with students and veterans, sitting beside his wife, standing in front of a \u201cWomen for Mitch\u201d sign, working in his office and sauntering down local streets. The Democrats do this too, as Roll Call\u2019s Nathan Gonzales described in detail last month.\n\nDemocrats do indeed do it too. When, not if, some outside group swoops in to attack Matt Bevin or Alison Lundergan Grimes on McConnell\u2019s behalf, they\u2019re going to need stock footage of the man himself for their ads. But they can\u2019t ask directly because of dumb campaign-finance rules; the vid below is thus Team Mitch\u2019s way of exploiting a mile-wide loophole, putting the stock footage on YouTube as an \u201cad\u201d so that those groups can grab it and edit it however they want. Need to counter a \u201cwar on women\u201d attack from the left? Why, coincidentally, here\u2019s Mitch standing with a bunch of women. Need to show that Mitch supports the middle class? Here he is chatting with workers on a factory floor. The goofy shots at the beginning of him staring Gump-ily into the camera are obviously designed to be kickers for those ads. After 27 seconds spent tearing Bevin or Grimes to shreds, they\u2019ll cut to one of those snippets of McConnell/Gump footage with the \u201cStand With Mitch\u201d tagline or whatever underneath. What you\u2019re watching here, really, is how the advertising sausage gets made. And it is so, so weird.\n\nIt\u2019s also a video windfall for McConnell\u2019s critics, though. If you wanted to turn, say, this Erick Erickson post into a mock Mitch ad, you\u2019ve now got everything you need. My advice: Use the shot of him turning towards the camera dramatically for the \u201cIt is time to back Matt Bevin against Mitch McConnell\u201d line. Until then, check out the second clip below. Takes awhile for the punchline to arrive, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "What?", "title": "Video: The freaky deaky Mitch McConnell b-roll ad", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/12/video-the-freaky-deaky-mitch-mcconnell-b-roll-ad/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "ad, b-roll, Mitch McConnell, smile,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-12T22:01:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-12T21:17:30+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffe8\"", "article_summary": "Stock footage of him rambling in front of crowds set to generic music is enough to goose his numbers.\nMy advice: Use the shot of him turning towards the camera dramatically for the \u201cIt is time to back Matt Bevin against Mitch McConnell\u201d line.\nVideo: The freaky deaky Mitch McConnell b-roll adposted at 6:01 pm on March 12, 2014 by AllahpunditThe first time I watched it, I thought this was some sort of statement about his name recognition in Kentucky.\nWhy, coincidentally, here\u2019s Mitch standing with a bunch of women.\nIf you wanted to turn, say, this Erick Erickson post into a mock Mitch ad, you\u2019ve now got everything you need."}
