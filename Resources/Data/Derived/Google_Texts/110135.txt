ANAHEIM, Calif. — Former Colorado Rockies pitcher Jamie Moyer got stuck on a ride at Disneyland and lived to tweet about it.

Moyer was briefly stuck on the California Screamin’ attraction Friday and tweeted a photo of himself waiting on the roller coaster. The caption says, “Not sure what is more difficult, pitching in a Major League game or this.”

Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown says the ride was shut down for an hour and no guests were stuck on it for longer than 30 minutes.

Brown says the ride stopped automatically due to a minor mechanical issue — a standard safety procedure.

Over a 25-year career, the 52-year-old Moyer pitched for eight teams, including the Rockies, Seattle Mariners and the Philadelphia Philllies. He was inducted into the Mariners’ Hall of Fame this year.
