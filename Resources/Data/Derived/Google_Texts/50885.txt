A family of four was killed on Saturday in a plane crash north of San Antonio, according to the authorities.

Capt. Tommy Ward, a spokesman for the Comal County Sheriff’s Department, said that local residents began calling 911 to report a crash in Spring Branch, Tex., at 12:32 p.m.

Captain Ward identified the passengers as Michael Galloway, 38, the pilot of the aircraft; his wife, Heather Galloway, 32; and their two children, Clayton, 10, and Cheyenne, 8.

“Deputies arrived on the scene and found the plane on the ground totally engulfed in flames,” he said. “The passengers all perished in the crash. They were dead on impact.”

The plane crashed into an area of fields and woods next to a feed store and along a major road, Captain Ward said. There was no damage or injuries on the ground.

Captain Ward said that the family lived in Spring Branch and described them as very involved in the community. The children attended school in the Comal County Independent School District, he said, where their mother was employed as a bus driver.

The Federal Aviation Administration said the aircraft was a single-engine Piper PA-24 that took off from nearby Kestrel Airpark, a residential community that includes a 3,000-foot runway.

Captain Ward said that the neighborhood was less than two miles from where the plane went down.

The F.A.A. and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash, spokesmen for each agency said.
