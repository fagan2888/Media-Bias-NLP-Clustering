(AP) \u2014 Pressing his economic case in an election year, President Barack Obama came to Michigan on Wednesday to praise the state\u2019s ongoing effort to raise the minimum wage \u2014 and to accuse Republicans who oppose that step in Michigan and in Congress of standing in the way of prosperity for millions of Americans.\n\nAn upbeat Obama struck a distinctly partisan tone at the University of Michigan, a day after his administration received an unexpected burst of good news when his health care law beat expectations for its first year of enrollment. Addressing a crowd of about 1,400 in a stadium crowd that included many students, Obama cracked jokes about his GOP foes as he touted his plan to raise federal wages to $10.10 per hour.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a choice. You can give America the shaft, or you can give it a raise,\u201d Obama said.\n\nAt Obama\u2019s side for his three-hour visit to this Midwest battleground state was Rep. Gary Peters, a Senate candidate embracing the chance to appear with the president before voters this year. Some other Democrats have shied away from Obama amid controversy over his health care plan, but Peters opted to appear with Obama as the president echoed his State of the Union affirmation that no American working full time should live in poverty.\n\n\u201cIt would lift millions of people out of poverty right away,\u201d the president said of his proposal. \u201cIt would help millions more work their way out of poverty right away.\u201d\n\nMichigan also has an effort to put a measure on the November ballot to increase the state minimum wage $7.40 to $10.10 an hour, an initiative that polling shows is popular among voters who have been hit hard by the economic downturn in recent years.\n\nNationally, Obama wants to increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 as part of an election-year economic agenda focused on working families. The White House says that would benefit more than 970,000 workers in Michigan.\n\nThe Senate could vote on a bill to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 as early as next week. The Senate\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said Wednesday that if Republicans block Democrats\u2019 efforts he would be open to negotiating a compromise.\n\nOne potential compromise could involve moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins. The Maine lawmaker, who is facing re-election this year, said she\u2019s talked to senators of both parties about a smaller minimum wage increase plus renewing tax breaks for small businesses that buy new equipment or hire veterans. She declined to provide details and said her plan could change.\n\n\u201cWhat we know for certain is $10.10 isn\u2019t going to get through the Senate, much less the House,\u201d she said, referring to the GOP-run chamber. House leaders have expressed opposition to that proposal. She said the choice was between trying to craft a bill that might pass, \u201cor do some members simply want one vote and a political issue?\u201d\n\nOn their way to the campus, Obama and Peters stopped at Zingerman\u2019s Deli, an Ann Arbor landmark, where they ordered Reuben sandwiches and were served by a Michigan graduate who makes $9 an hour \u2014 a rate above the current federal minimum wage. \u201cThat\u2019s worth celebrating,\u201d Obama said.\n\nPeters could benefit from the publicity that a presidential visit brings, since he has not been elected statewide and polls show many voters are unfamiliar with him. Asked whether he was concerned about absorbing backlash from Obama\u2019s unpopular health care law, Peters stressed the president\u2019s economic message.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be with the president. I work with the president on issues that are important to middle class families here in Michigan and families who aspire to be in the middle class,\u201d Peters said as Obama prepared to take the stage.\n\nMichigan voted for Obama in both his presidential campaigns and his bailout of the auto industry has been popular here. Still, appearing with Obama is not without risk.\n\nAn EPIC/MRA poll of voters in the state taken in February showed 61 percent of respondents have a negative view of Obama\u2019s job performance, verses 37 percent positive. The same poll found Peters and his Republican component separated by just a few points in a competitive race.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer, who supports a higher minimum wage and is challenging incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, also planned to meet with Obama while he was in Michigan, his campaign said.\n\nBefore returning to Washington, Obama also traveled Wednesday to his hometown of Chicago for two evening fundraisers benefiting the Democratic National Committee. The first is a private roundtable discussion being attended by about 25 supporters who contributed up to $32,400. The second, at the Lincoln Park home of Obama donors Grace Tsao-Wu and Craig Freedman, is a dinner reception with about 55 supporters contributing up to $10,000 apiece.\n\nWhile on the road Wednesday, Obama was informed about reports of a shooting incident at Fort Hood in Texas, spokesman Josh Earnest said, adding the president would continue to get updates from his staff.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram and Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nOn the web:\n\nPaul Isley, GVSU economics professor, discusses pros and cons of increase to federal minimum wage\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pressing his economic case in an election year, President Obama came to Michigan Wednesday to praise the state's ongoing effort to raise the\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "Pressing his economic case in an election year, President Obama came to Michigan Wednesday to praise the state\u2019s ongoing effort to raise the minimum wage.", "title": "At UofM, Obama calls for minimum wage hike", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2014/04/02/obama-to-talk-about-minimum-wage-in-michigan-visit/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/obama-in-michigan-ap-040214.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pressing his economic case in an election year, President Obama came to Michigan Wednesday to praise the state\u2019s ongoing effort to raise the minimum wage.", "title": "At UofM, Obama calls for minimum wage hike", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/obama-in-michigan-ap-040214.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@woodtv", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2014-04-02T09:48:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-02T09:48:30+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b3f\"", "article_summary": "Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer, who supports a higher minimum wage and is challenging incumbent Republican Gov.\nThe Senate could vote on a bill to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 as early as next week.\nNationally, Obama wants to increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 as part of an election-year economic agenda focused on working families.\nYou can give America the shaft, or you can give it a raise,\u201d Obama said.\nThe Maine lawmaker, who is facing re-election this year, said she\u2019s talked to senators of both parties about a smaller minimum wage increase plus renewing tax breaks for small businesses that buy new equipment or hire veterans."}
