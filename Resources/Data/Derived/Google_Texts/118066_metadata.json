That would push its total to 11.\n\nTenet has agreed to sell the five hospitals \u2014 its only facilities in Georgia \u2014 to WellStar. And an internal WellStar employee email, obtained by Georgia Health News, indicates the Federal Trade Commission has wrapped up its review of the purchase.\n\n\u201cWe are a step closer to finalizing of the purchase of Tenet Healthcare\u2019s five hospitals in metro Atlanta,\u201d the email said.\n\nThe email said the FTC granted an \u201cearly termination\u2019\u2019 of the agency\u2019s review of the acquisition.\n\n\u201cWith the conclusion of the FTC review,\u201d the email said, \u201cWellStar is moving forward with integration planning, with a close date expected in April.\u2019\u2019\n\nA WellStar spokesman Wednesday declined to comment on the Tenet situation.\n\nThe five Tenet hospitals being acquired are North Fulton Hospital in Roswell; Spalding Regional Hospital in Griffin; Sylvan Grove Hospital in Jackson; Atlanta Medical Center; and AMC\u2019s South Campus in East Point.\n\nThese hospitals would become nonprofit facilities under WellStar\u2019s $575 million acquisition.\n\n(Separately, Modern Healthcare reported this week that Tenet has offered to pay $238 million to resolve a False Claims Act lawsuit involving alleged kickbacks for maternity referrals by four of its hospitals \u2014 AMC, North Fulton and Spalding Regional in Georgia and Hilton Head Hospital in South Carolina.)\n\nThe two deals in the works for WellStar would make it easily the biggest health system in Georgia.\n\nEconomic factors have driven many Georgia hospitals to seek alliances or mergers to help withstand the sweeping changes in health care payments.\n\nGovernment and private insurers are increasingly emphasizing quality of care in reimbursements, instead of just paying for the quantity of services delivered. Medicare is paying bonuses and imposing penalties under the Affordable Care Act based on quality-of-care measurements.\n\nGetting bigger may help hospital systems cut costs and meet these new demands for improved quality, experts say.\n\nDave Smith, a consultant with Kearny Street Consulting, said Wednesday that the WellStar additions signal \u201ca new day\u2019\u2019 in the Georgia hospital consolidation trend.\n\nWellStar \u201chas got a lot on their plate\u2019\u2019 with the two deals, Smith said.\n\n\u201cWest Georgia is running pretty well\u2019\u2019 and will be easier to absorb than the Tenet hospitals, Smith added. Tenet\u2019s Atlanta Medical Center and South Campus have had financial problems over the years, he said. \u201cWellStar is not used to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019ve got to manage it.\u201d\n\nStill pending are other major Georgia hospital deals, such as Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta adding Athens Regional and Northside Hospital in Atlanta partnering with Gwinnett Medical Center in the big suburban Atlanta county.\n\nLeaders of West Georgia and WellStar said Wednesday that they were eager for their partnership to begin.\n\nJerry Fulks, president & CEO of West Georgia Health, said in a statement that \u201cTroup County and the surrounding West Georgia community will benefit immensely from this partnership. We look forward to tapping into WellStar\u2019s experience and innovative care models to help us achieve even greater success for our patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs not-for-profits, WellStar and West Georgia Health have similar missions and commitments to our communities,\u201d Candice Saunders, president & CEO of WellStar, said in a statement. \u201cOn a recent visit to LaGrange, I met with many civic and business leaders. I was encouraged by their support and commitment to ensuring the community continues to be a leader in high-quality health care. Working together, our physicians, nurses and team members will be able to improve the health and well-being of the LaGrange, Troup County and entire West Georgia Health community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "WellStar Health System announced Wednesday that it has received regulatory approval from the state attorney general to add West Georgia Health to its system.", "title": "WellStar closing in on major hospital deals", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/business/wellstar-closing-in-on-major-hospital-deals/article_9e894e28-dbc1-11e5-9f66-834f13466209.html", "image": {"width": 510, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/23/e23a0100-f524-50cb-8735-dc5b298ad4e5/526b5616256ab.image.jpg?resize=510%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "WellStar Health System announced Wednesday that it has received regulatory approval from the state attorney general to add West Georgia Health to its system.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "business,business,state", "news_keywords": "business,business,state"}, "article_summary": "WellStar Health System announced Wednesday that it has received regulatory approval from the state attorney general to add West Georgia Health to its system.\nJerry Fulks, president & CEO of West Georgia Health, said in a statement that \u201cTroup County and the surrounding West Georgia community will benefit immensely from this partnership.\nWest Georgia\u2019s flagship facility, West Georgia Medical Center in LaGrange, would become the nonprofit WellStar\u2019s sixth hospital when the deal closes.\nThe five Tenet hospitals being acquired are North Fulton Hospital in Roswell; Spalding Regional Hospital in Griffin; Sylvan Grove Hospital in Jackson; Atlanta Medical Center; and AMC\u2019s South Campus in East Point.\nDave Smith, a consultant with Kearny Street Consulting, said Wednesday that the WellStar additions signal \u201ca new day\u2019\u2019 in the Georgia hospital consolidation trend."}
