Chico >> While some circle Christmas, anniversaries and kids’ birthdays on the calendar, there aren’t so many with April 15 circled in red.

But it is an important day in almost everyone’s life: It’s the day income taxes are due.

Tax officials remind it’s not good to wait to the last minute, a message repeated by the U.S. Postal Service.

Post offices, including those in Chico, are open 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., but the last collection hours for those blue mail boxes that sprinkle the town is earlier. If you want your tax return filed on time and avoid a penalty, pay attention to the collection schedule posted on the box.

According to the Post Office, each box is marked with the latest pick up time that a postal worker swings by to empty the box.

Whether the tax return is sent to the government by postal mail or e-filed, midnight Wednesday is the important time mark.

Probably just as important to remember is that even if an extension is requested, taxpayers still have to send money to the government for their estimated tax payment. Remember the extension is the extension of time to file the paperwork, not of time to pay. Checks and credit cards are accepted.

The government offers some other reminders and suggestions:

• Consider filing electronically instead of using paper tax forms. Information regarding e-filing is at www.IRS.gov along with other forms and information.

• Put all required Social Security numbers on the return and your check.

• Double check figures and numbers.

• Attach all required schedules.

• Don’t forget to sign and date the return, and if you owe money, to write a check or use a credit card. Make sure all required signatures are included.

• Checks for federal tax payments should be made out to United State Treasury, or for California tax, the Franchise Tax Board.

For California returns, check the website for the California Franchise Tax Board www.ftb.ca.gov which contains forms and information, or call the toll-free assistance line at 1-800-852-5711.

The IRS warns if you use a web site to help or file, make sure the web address includes the .gov suffix. Other Internet sites using .com, .net or .org are not official IRS or FTB sites.
