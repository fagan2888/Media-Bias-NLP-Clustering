You are the people I fight for.\u201d\n\nKasich talked about the national budget facing a deficit in the trillions.\n\n\u201cIf you cater to small roots or those most noticeable, you get lost,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all win when the economy roars.\u201d\n\nKasich went on to say it is up to each individual person across the country to make the nation better.\n\n\u201cI believe everyone here was born unique,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cNo one is like you or will be like you. You were born special because the Lord made you special with a purpose.\u201d\n\nHe said if people want to find satisfaction in life, they need to find a purpose.
