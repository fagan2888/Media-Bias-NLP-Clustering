No one was hurt Sunday morning when a taxi cab and a car crashed at a downtown Milwaukee intersection.

The crash occurred about 10 a.m. at Water and State streets, near the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts. The car ended up hitting a sign in front of the Marcus Center, while the taxi cab hit a tree.

Authorities suspect an outage of traffic lights at the intersection and the surrounding area contributed to crash.

A power outage in Milwaukee's downtown and Third Ward was reported about 7:30 a.m. Sunday and affected the traffic lights and about 300 customers, a We Energies spokeswoman said.

Much of downtown is powered by underground cables and crews were able to trace the outage to a flooded basement in a Third Ward building, Cathy Schulze said.

Nearly all customers had power restored by 11:30 a.m. Sunday.
