FOX News Insider:

The GOP-controlled House today voted to define a full-time work week as 40 hours under ObamaCare.

FoxNews.com reported:

The House voted 252-172 for the ObamaCare bill, which tweaks the law's definition of full-time workers who must be offered employer-provided health care. Twelve Democrats sided with Republicans in approving the first Affordable Care Act-related legislation of the new Congress.

The bill changes the full-time worker threshold from 30 hours weekly to a 40-hour minimum. Critics claim defining full-time employees as those working at least 30 hours is pressuring firms to save money by cutting workers' hours below that and, in turn, the number of full-time jobs.

Utah Rep. Mia Love went “On The Record” to discuss why she “absolutely” voted for the bill.

“This is about making health costs as cheap as possible. And the more regulation we add, the more we put into this, the more difficult it is for people to be able to have some sort of health insurance,” she said.

Greta Van Susteren noted that President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill if it passes the Senate. Love said she wants to get this bill on his desk and have him make that hard decision.

“There’s a difference between threatening to veto something and actually being forced to veto a bill that helps people keep their jobs, that helps bring the cost of health care down,” Love said.

Love also discussed how she has joined the Congressional Black Caucus.
