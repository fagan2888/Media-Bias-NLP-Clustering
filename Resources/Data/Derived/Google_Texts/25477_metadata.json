What I\u2019ve never done is say that I require that it must have exceptions.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI recognize that in order to have consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America.\n\nThere is no doubt that a woman has a right to her own body, to make decisions about her own health and her future Marco Rubio\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the issue is so hard. There is no doubt that a woman has a right to her own body, to make decisions about her own health and her future. There\u2019s no doubt. And then there\u2019s this other right, and that\u2019s the right of a human being to live. And these rights come into conflict so you have to make a decision and it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s debate remark came amid efforts by Republicans in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, with some advocating a government shutdown. The women\u2019s health organization has been the subject of a number of videos released by a pro-life group, which purport to show staff members negotiating the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood has said its staff acted legally at all times.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have seized on the issue and others \u2013 including former Florida governor Jeb Bush appearing to question all federal spending on women\u2019s health and Donald Trump seeming to imply Kelly questioned him unfairly in Cleveland because she was menstruating \u2013 to suggest the Republican party is engaged in a \u201cwar on women\u201d.\n\n\n\nWomen make up 53% of the electorate and have leaned Democratic in every general election since 1992, when Bill Clinton unseated Republican incumbent George HW Bush.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump jab at Megyn Kelly may be beginning of end for GOP frontrunner\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio sought to stress his understanding of the issue.\n\n\u201cA rape is an act of violence,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a horrifying thing that happens, and fortunately the number of abortions in this country that happen due to rape are very small. Less than 1% of the cases but they happen and they\u2019re horrifying and a tragedy and I recognize that.\n\n\u201cI also recognize that because of the existence of over-the-counter morning-after pills, not to mention medical treatment that\u2019s now available immediately after the assault, we can bring that number down to zero.\u201d\n\nHe also said: \u201cI don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy. But when asked to make a decision between two very hard circumstances, I personally reached the decision, if I\u2019m going to err, I\u2019m going to err on the side of life.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Rubio spoke Sunday about criticism arising from his statement in Thursday\u2019s first Republican presidential debate that he never advocated for exceptions", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Martin Pengelly", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Rubio spoke Sunday about criticism arising from his statement in Thursday\u2019s first Republican presidential debate that he never advocated for exceptions", "title": "Marco Rubio defends record as opponent of abortion, even in rape cases", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/09/marco-rubio-record-opponent-of-abortion", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f296d4c35e0f20a6568c12808bdd2e22ea4003/0_192_4494_2700/master/4494.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=d28ac6b8fc4f18ab420a0e51f3401688", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/aug/09/marco-rubio-record-opponent-of-abortion?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/09/marco-rubio-record-opponent-of-abortion", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/aug/09/marco-rubio-record-opponent-of-abortion?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/55f296d4c35e0f20a6568c12808bdd2e22ea4003/0_192_4494_2700/master/4494.jpg", "creator": "@MartinPengelly"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/aug/09/marco-rubio-record-opponent-of-abortion?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Marco Rubio,Abortion,US elections 2016,US politics,Republicans,US news,Women,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-08-09T19:48:25.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-pengelly", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:51:18.000Z", "tag": "Marco Rubio,Abortion,US elections 2016,US politics,Republicans,US news,Women,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f296d4c35e0f20a6568c12808bdd2e22ea4003/0_192_4494_2700/4494.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=7a942128bf3470ab02724863338eff10", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marco Rubio,Abortion,US elections 2016,US politics,Republicans,US news,Women,World news"}, "article_summary": "And then there\u2019s this other right, and that\u2019s the right of a human being to live.\nLess than 1% of the cases but they happen and they\u2019re horrifying and a tragedy and I recognize that.\nIn fact, Rubio supported such exceptions when he co-sponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in 2013, which aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks.\n\u201cA rape is an act of violence,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a horrifying thing that happens, and fortunately the number of abortions in this country that happen due to rape are very small.\nRelated: Donald Trump jab at Megyn Kelly may be beginning of end for GOP frontrunnerOn Sunday, Rubio sought to stress his understanding of the issue."}
