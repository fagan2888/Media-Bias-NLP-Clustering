Since voting down the referendum in 2009, we have moved from being a city that is merely tolerant of changing demographics to one that proudly identifies as a welcoming community.\n\nNashville has one of the fastest-growing immigrant populations of any major city in the U.S., and under Mayor Karl Dean's leadership the city has increasingly seen this demographic change not as a challenge to be managed but as an asset.\n\nThat's not to say that there aren't urgent challenges for the next mayor to address.\n\nThe same year that Mayor Dean took office undocumented immigrants lost access to driver licenses and Davidson County began participating in the controversial 287(g) program.\n\nEight years later, undocumented immigrants still lack access to government-issued identification and still fear any interactions with law enforcement because of ongoing collaboration between federal immigration enforcement and our Sheriff's Office.\n\nDespite the fact that immigrants have high labor participation rates and are twice as likely as U.S.-born Tennesseans to open a business, almost a third of immigrant families with children younger than 18 are living in poverty, and nearly half of all immigrant households spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing.\n\nAs the mayoral forum showed us, continuing to build a welcoming and inclusive city must be a priority for any viable candidate. We need the next mayor to actively invest in the growing immigrant population, not only because our city will be stronger today when all residents are able to fully contribute and fully participate, but also because our future depends on it.\n\nAlready 20 percent of MNPS students are Latino, and a third come from homes where a language other than English is spoken.\n\nDespite the increased attention on English language learners, state data shows that from 2011 to 2014, the rate that these students are learning English has actually declined every year.\n\nThe next mayor needs to ensure accountability, equitable public education for immigrant children and commit to providing additional resources to support immigrant students.\n\nDuring the next administration, our city needs to move beyond just welcoming immigrants to actively investing in integration and working toward equity and inclusion. We have high expectations for our next mayor and are eager to partner with her or him.\n\nIt's clear that immigrant and refugees are among the winners of the August election, but as the next mayor of Nashville should know, that means our whole city is winning, too.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1MoIkVs", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The centrality of immigrants and refugees represents just how far we've come as a city.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The centrality of immigrants and refugees represents just how far we've come as a city.", "title": "Immigrants, refugees benefit in Nashville mayoral race", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/07/12/immigrants-refugees-nashville-mayoral-race/30055739/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The centrality of immigrants and refugees represents just how far we've come as a city.", "title": "Immigrants, refugees benefit in Nashville mayoral race", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1018987167a29ed85043434549545ae2e2f6f4e/c=0-89-534-623&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Karl Dean", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Karl Dean", "title": "Immigrants, refugees benefit in Nashville mayoral race", "author": "Renata Soto and Stephanie Teatro", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c7e6945626ebe0d253725263318a2e7c9389806c/c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68886e1d3b73e7ccc59253069a1d37b76fba6987/c=0-89-534-623/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa671b2e61320c603162e22f003c763f485eac88/c=0-156-534-556/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2fe2471184649d1cc217f2492ce28a57a087b856/c=0-206-534-506&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-12T17:58:14.950000-05:00", "shorthed": "Immigrants, refugees win in election", "articleid": 30055739, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ca1f55b3fb743e03597e9f17ac0b0eed27fbacd/c=0-206-534-506/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97206c2dcf4cd44619c7b05a62a6a93f53f3c482/c=67-0-467-712/local/-/media/2015/07/12/Nashville/B9318031784Z.1_20150712170434_000_GCHBAS9C4.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "immigrant, refugee, american, nashville, tennessee, america"}, "article_summary": "On June 22, the Nashville mayoral candidates sat on stage at Glencliff High School for the Immigrant and Refugee Mayoral Forum.\nThe centrality of immigrants and refugees and the elevated policy discussion in this year's race represent just how far we've come as a city.\nThe centrality of immigrants and refugees represents just how far we've come as a city.\nDuring the next administration, our city needs to move beyond just welcoming immigrants to actively investing in integration and working toward equity and inclusion.\nAs the mayoral forum showed us, continuing to build a welcoming and inclusive city must be a priority for any viable candidate."}
