But Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) took host Sean Hannity to task on Tuesday, defending previous remarks in which he called the Fox News host \u201cpolarizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you\u2019re a principled fellow, but I\u2019ve come to conclude that the Republican Party as a whole needs to knock off some of this stuff,\u201d Graham said on Hannity's show.\n\nLast week, Graham joked about political polarization in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd, asking Todd to imagine a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch of the Constitution being drafted in modern times.\n\n\u201cBen Franklin comes outside and Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity jump on him, \u2018Don\u2019t give in, Ben,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cJust think how hard it is in today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle. \u2026 There is a group telling you to say no about everything.\u201d\n\nWhile Graham maintains a hard conservative line on foreign policy and social issues, he has staked out a relatively moderate position in a number of other areas, such as immigration.\n\nHannity invited Graham on his program to address the comments, and argued that polarization was not necessarily a bad thing. \u201cYou\u2019re claiming that we\u2019re responsible for polarizing,\u201d Hannity told the senator. \u201cWasn\u2019t Martin Luther King polarizing in a good way, standing up for justice?\u201d\n\nGraham defended his remarks on Hannity's show, singling out immigration and the budget as two issues he and the host disagree on.\n\nOver the past decade, immigration reform has been stymied by partisan disagreements. Hard-line conservatives want the borders \u201csecured\u201d before the undocumented population in the U.S. is addressed, while Democrats and some Republicans want these issues dealt with in tandem. Hannity has taken the former stance, which Graham said on Tuesday was untenable.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying is that your solutions don\u2019t work,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t secure the border unless you tell the Democrats what\u2019s going to happen with the 11 million [undocumented].\u201d\n\nGraham also criticized Hannity\u2019s plan for balancing the budget, which he said didn\u2019t raise revenue sufficiently. The South Carolina senator asked Hannity if he would eliminate tax deductions to help pay down the national debt.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hannity countered. \u201cI would cut a penny out of every dollar and eliminate baseline budgeting and you can balance the budget in six years.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d Graham said flatly. \u201cYoung people have to work longer and people at our income level are going to have to take a little less, or we\u2019re going to destroy this country.\u201d\n\nGraham also seemed to take issue with Republicans\u2019 brinkmanship over budget issues and health care, which has led in the past to threats of government shutdown, as well as one actual shutdown.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get Obama to repeal Obamacare because we threatened to shut down the government,\" he said.\n\nGabriel Arana is senior media editor at The Huffington Post.
