The 22-year-old woman lived in a third-floor apartment at 9 W. Hampden Ave. that she shared with another bank employee, Darlene Heintz.\n\nHer roommate was at her own bank teller\u2019s window at work. She watched as Pamela walked to her apartment. She walked by a cabinet-making shop in her building. A man there saw the pretty young woman pass by.\n\nThat was the last time that anyone willing to talk about what became of Neal saw her.\n\nWhen she didn\u2019t return to the bank to work after lunch, co-workers, including her roommate, were worried. She was anything but irresponsible.\n\nHeintz called the apartment at 2:30 p.m. Heintz was beginning to worry.\n\nHeintz left work and went to look for her roommate. She found the door ajar. She called her boss at the bank, who called police.\n\nReliable\n\nPamela was not the kind of person who would just leave on a whim. She had a stable background. She loved her job and was a happy person. She was soft-spoken and somewhat shy. She was considerate of others.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "abduction,bank,Beth Miller,Brownie,Colorado lottery,detectives,disappearance,Englewood,Englewood police,Girl Scout,Key Savings and Loan,kidnapping,missing,Murder,Pamela Neal,Safeway", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Cold Cases", "description": "Pamela Lynne Neal was a bank teller at Key Savings and Loan at the intersection of Broadway and West Hampden Avenue in Englewood.
