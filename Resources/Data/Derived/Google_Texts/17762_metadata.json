It\u2019s a big deal for the world. It\u2019s a big deal for the state of Washington. This means that the world has pushed the 'go button' on the fight against climate change. And it means we in the state of Washington, and our grandkids, have a shot at what they deserve which is trees in the forest, snow in the mountains and water in the rivers.\n\n\"And we ought to be proud of our state. We\u2019re leading with the pacific coast with California, Oregon and British Columbia in the fight against climate change. And we know we can build a clean energy economy.\n\n\"So this is something that we ought to be proud of. We\u2019re leaders in the state of Washington. We\u2019re now going to lead the fight against climate change and now we know we\u2019ve got partners.\n\n\"Good day for the world. Good day for the state of Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "twitter": {"description": "Gov.", "creator": {"identifier": "@wastategov", "id": 1009489969}, "url": "http://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/video-statement-gov-jay-inslee-regarding-todays-historic-cop21-climate-agreement", "title": "[VIDEO] Statement from Gov.
