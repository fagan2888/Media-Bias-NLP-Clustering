The former financial officer of two nonprofit health clinics in Alabama will plead guilty to defrauding the federal government of $11 million, according to the U.S. District Attorney's office in Northern Alabama.

Former Birmingham Health Care Chief Financial Officer Terri McGuire Mollica, 48, diverted an estimated $11 million from the Birmingham clinic and Central Alabama Comprehensive Health, which was also under the fiscal control of BHC, according to the indictments.

Between 2008 and 2012, Mollica transferred federal grant money, assets and property from the nonprofit clinics to entities named "Synergy," and then took out about $1.7 million for herself and others, the charges state.

The community health clinics serve low-income residents and the homeless and receive the bulk of their funding from federal grants, according to authorities.

Mollica has agreed to forfeit $938,211 seized by the government last year from her investment and credit union accounts, according to her guilty plea agreement.

A federal grand jury indicted Mollica last year. In her agreement released April 10, Mollica is pleading guilty to fraud against the government, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, filing false tax returns and aggravated identity theft related to an insurance fraud, according to U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance.

She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on certain counts and fines of up to $500,000.
