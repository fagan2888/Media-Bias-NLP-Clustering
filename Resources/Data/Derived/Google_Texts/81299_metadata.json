The profession has survived many transformations with the unfailing commitment to maintaining and improving human health. Monday celebrates National Doctor\u2019s Day, and it\u2019s an opportunity to reflect on the evolution of medicine and appreciate the quality of physician care today.\n\nThe U.S. Senate and House officially declared March 30 as National Doctor\u2019s Day in 1990, however, it\u2019s been celebrated for decades longer, according to the National Doctor\u2019s Day website.
