An Arlington, Va. woman has filed a lawsuit against D.C.’s Fig & Olive restaurant after a salmonella outbreak closed the hotspot for six days.

Laura Donahue ate at the restaurant in Sept. 2. She ate a crostini that she shared with a friend, followed by a cucumber martini and a salad, then truffle mushroom risotto and a dessert crostini. In the days following she suffered from chills, fevers, a swollen belly and she fainted after running a half-marathon.

The D.C. Health Department shut Fig & Olive down on Sept. 10 to investigate the source of the outbreak, but reopened this week.

According to the Washington Post:

In a statement, confirming the reopening, the health department said the restaurant had passed inspection and had complied with all the food safety requirements the department had imposed. The outbreak caused more than 60 people to become ill — including residents of five states in addition to the District — and an additional 150 cases are being investigated, the agency said in a press release.

At least 10 diners have been contracted the salmonella illness.

“The people responsible need to be held accountable,” she said of the suit in a telephone interview Friday with the Post. “There’s myself and there’s the pain — this is what I can do. This is all I can do.”

NBC4 reported that the restaurant will offer every diner a complimentary dessert for the next month with lunch or dinner.

Donahue’s complaint was filed with the U.S. District Court and said she was seeking damages, but no specific amount was given.
