The parents of Berry "Tyler" Allen, the University of Colorado student missing since April 11, are enlisting the public's help as they expand the search for their son to neighboring states.

In the latest post on the Facebook page Find Tyler, Allen's parents, Berry and Sheryl thanked those who've helped search around Boulder and in the area of Western Springs, Ill., the Chicago suburb where Allen was raised.

Now, they turn their attention to the rest of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Seattle and Austin.

Police have suggested those involved in the search contact bus and train stations, youth hostels, Salvation Army posts, hospital, mental health centers and homeless shelters.

Allen's parents ask that anyone who wishes to help locate and call the above facilities and mention the missing 20-year-old, a communications major who transferred to CU from Clemson University in January.

A flyer with Allen's photo and description is available online, and those aiding in the search are encouraged to ask contacts out of state to post it, and to print and post it themselves in their respective areas.

"This would be a monumental task to micro-manage," Allen's parents wrote on Facebook. "Therefore, we are hoping that through your efforts it spreads organically and it leads to finding Tyler."

Questions about the search are being directed to Jenny Lancaster, who can be reached at lancasterj@comcast.net.

The Boulder Police Department also asks that positive leads be phoned in at 303-441-3333.
