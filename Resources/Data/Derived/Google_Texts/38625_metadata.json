Sun tell us today\n\n\u201cAmericans who face higher \u00adinsurance costs under President Obama\u2019s health-care law are angrily complaining about \u2018sticker shock,\u2019 threatening to become a new political force opposing the law even as the White House struggles to convince other consumers that they will benefit from it.\n\n\u201cThe growing backlash involves people whose plans are being discontinued because the policies don\u2019t meet the law\u2019s more-stringent standards. They\u2019re finding that many alternative policies come with higher premiums and deductibles.\u201d\n\nFor the moment let\u2019s forget (a) that those often are MUCH higher premiums and deductibles; and (b) it is patently false to flatly state (as the Obama Administration does) that \u201conly\u201d about \u201c12 million Americans, or 5 percent of the population\u201d who buy individual polices\u201d will be clobbered.\n\nVariations of this and other\u2026.misrepresentations\u2026are the staples of former and current Obama Administration staffers. I watched MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d this morning where Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, former White House advisor for Health Policy, told a series of bald-faced lies so outrageous that the co-host shook her head, Joe Scarborough, the host, said more than once, \u201cThis is so beneath you\u201d (worth noting is that Emanuel said \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t\u201d), and NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd offered a devastating rebuttal then rolled his eyes and smiled in utter frustration as Emanuel continued with the same talking points.\n\nAnd getting a word in edgewise was very hard to do\u2014because\u2013as he did Sunday on Fox News Sunday\u2013Emanuel would barely allow anyone else to speak. (You can watch part of the MSNBC exchange at www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP1TrsEiecg.)\n\nBut that\u2019s just a small sample of the trickeration on display over the past couple of days.\n\nThe New York Times ran an editorial yesterday that was bad enough, because it laid the blame for the fiasco on the Republicans, but went on to compound its egregious error by insisting that President Obama had \u201cmisspoke\u201d when (as the Times paraphrased him saying) \u201cif you like the insurance you have, you can keep it.\u201d Even by Times\u2019 standards, that\u2019s a whopper.\n\nFor his part Dr. Emanuel continued to recycle one of the more ludicrous talking points. After Todd pointed out what Obama had failed to say (and therefore left a radically inaccurate impression), Emanuel shrieked, \u201cThis is a political ad. You don\u2019t put fine print in a political speech, Chuck. Get serious!\u201d\n\nGet it? Even if the President said the same thing dozens and dozens and dozens of times, you can\u2019t expect him to get down into the political weeds, so to speak, and say what the health care exchange really means to countless millions of people. And if virtually everybody happens to come away with the exact WRONG interpretation of what would come to pass, hey, that\u2019s life.\n\nJust one other of many items that we could talk about today. We already know that the ObamaCare exchange was not tested carefully, let alone thoroughly or with plenty of time to correct errors. What we are getting more information about on an almost daily basis is they were warned they were headed into big trouble three years ago!\n\nHere\u2019s the lead from CBS News, quoting from an internal memo:\n\n\u201cCBS News is learning the Obama administration knew of the risks associated with the Obamacare rollout well before last month.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, a trusted Obama health care adviser warned the White House it was losing control of Obamacare. A memo obtained by CBS News said strong leadership was missing and the law\u2019s successful implementation was in jeopardy. The warnings were specific and dire \u2014 and ignored.\n\nDavid Cutler, who worked on the Obama 2008 campaign and was a valued outside health care consultant wrote this blunt memo to top White House economic adviser Larry Summers in May 2010: \u2018I do not believe the relevant members of the administration understand the president\u2019s vision or have the capability to carry it out.\u2019\n\n\u201cCutler wrote no one was in charge who had any experience in complex business start-ups. He also worried basic regulations, technology and policy coordination would fail.\n\n\u201c\u2019You need to have people who have understanding of the political process, people who understand how to work within an administration and people who understand how to start and build a business, and unfortunately, they just didn\u2019t get all of those people together,\u2019 Cutler said.\u201d\n\nPlease join those who are following me on Twitter at twitter.com/daveha.
