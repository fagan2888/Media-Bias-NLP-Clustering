Account and Membership Administration costs increased by 3.0%, the lowest since 2011. These comparisons eliminate the effects of product mix and universe changes. The median total costs before Miscellaneous Business Taxes was $33.37 per member per month.\n\nHowever, Miscellaneous Business Taxes increased by 369.1% to $6.08 per member per month because of taxes and fees associated with the Affordable Care Act, so total administrative costs per member increased by 18.4%.\n\nPer member, Corporate Services1 costs declined by 1.4%. The growth in Sales and Marketing and Medical and Provider Management declined to 2.0% and 1.6%, respectively.\n\nWhile Information Systems costs increased at low single-digit rates, Customer Services costs accelerated. Some participants call this a \u201csurge\u201d cost stemming from changes in the health insurance markets. Enrollment and Claims Processing costs also accelerated.\n\nAdditional information was published today in Plan Management Navigator, and is posted at www.sherlockco.com. We will discuss the results via free web conference on Wednesday, July 8 from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.

An express purpose of the MLR rule is to \u201ccreate incentives \u2026 to become more efficient.\u201d SEER provides the initial step in this process by helping health plans identify and prioritize cost variances.\n\nBesides the Blue Cross Blue Shield universe, other universes include Independent/Provider-Sponsored plans, Medicare plans and Medicaid plans. Collectively, these organizations serve more 40 million insured Americans.\n\nThis is the 18th consecutive year of the Sherlock Benchmarks.
