The line to open a medical marijuana store in Pueblo is getting longer.

Two more applications for pot stores were filed with the city’s planning office late last month.

Steven Montoya has applied to open a medical marijuana store at 21 Monarch Lane.

Don Pagano has applied for a site at 2729 Farabaugh Lane.

Both come on the heels of an application from Louis Longo to locate a store at 2630 W. Pueblo Blvd.

Longo’s application is further along in the city’s licensing process. His proposed site has been certified by city planners that it fits within the strict zoning restrictions set by City Council in 2010.

The other two applications are the initial requests to have their proposed sites checked for zoning conflicts.

The city has 90 days to give Montoya and Pagano answers. Pagano filed his application on Feb. 19 while Montoya filed his Friday.

If they are certified, they join Longo in needing to apply for a special-use permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals followed by a city licensing hearing before Municipal Court Judge William Martinez.

And all three applicants also would need state licenses to open their doors.

Even so, the three applications prove that people now want to open marijuana stores within the city limits. Council has relied on its tough medical marijuana zoning restrictions to thwart interest in the past but with recreational pot now being sold in the county, the focus on the city has intensified.

Right now, only medical marijuana store operators are being granted state licenses for recreational sales.

The city’s current moratorium on recreational pot stores expires March 31 and council is beginning to focus on whether to adopt zoning and licensing regulations for those businesses as well.
