When police reached him in the parking lot, Cmdr. Gene McCausey said, he struck an officer and drove away.\n\nIn the rain, officers pursuing the man westbound on Baseline Road lost sight of him.\n\n\"Louisville (police) got involved but they quickly lost sight of him, too,\" McCausey said.\n\nHe was ultimately arrested in Cottonwood Park in Louisville after a citizen called in to report she'd seen the man's car, a description of which was aired by radio.\n\nThe man was booked at about 7 p.m. on suspicion of first-degree assault, resisting arrest, obstructing a peace officer and a slew of traffic infractions.\n\nAs of 10:45 p.m., McCausey said, officers still had not identified the man because \"he's not being very cooperative with us.\" McCausey said the man had neither identification nor any ownership paperwork related to the car. Depending on whether the man is able to show that paperwork, he may be charged with not having a valid driver's license.\n\nThe injured officer, who McCausey didn't identify, has been released from the hospital and a full recovery is expected.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-04-18T22:59:12-0600", "byline": "By Alex BurnessCamera", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "description": "Around 6:45 p.m., Flatirons staff contacted Lafayette police to report a man who appeared to be intoxicated inside the church.
