Your world is on fire.\"\n\nEveryone laughed and Cruz added, \"But you know what? Your mommy's here and everyone's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better.\"\n\nThe media jumped all over the incident, which quickly became a headline grabber as well as a late-night talk show joke.\n\nCruz explained to Michelle Trant on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that everything had been blown out of proportion.\n\n\u201cFirst it was \u2018girl startled,\u2019 then it became \u2018girl terrified.\u2019 By the end of it, I\u2019m Freddy Krueger torturing this girl in her nightmares,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThe senator said he spoke to the mother of the little girl who asked him if the world was really aflame.\n\n\u201cI actually talked to the mother yesterday, called her, because she was very dismayed,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nMichelle Trant and her 3-year-old daughter Julie appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Tuesday to share their side of the story.\n\nOf her daughter's sense of what was actually taking place, Trant said, as reported in Politico, that the little girl thought Cruz was a firefighter.\n\n\u201cShe really did, she looked at him like he was a hero \u2026 that he was going to save her,\u201d said Trant.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Sen.
