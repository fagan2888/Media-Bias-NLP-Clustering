Senate District 33, the seat currently held by Sen. Stan Bingham, R-Davidson, who is not seeking re-election. Those candidates are Joe Kennedy, Eddie Gallimore and Cathy Dunn.\n\nThe other race is for N.C. House 81, which is currently held by Rep. Rayne Brown, R-Davidson, who is also not seeking re-election. The candidates include Tyler Forrest, Sharon Pearce, and Larry Potts.\n\nCandidates varied in their opinion when asked about the use of economic incentives to attract business. Gallimore openly opposed incentives, while Kennedy and Dunn said they felt they were necessary.\n\n\u201cWe have been unable to come up with incentives at the state level and they are so important,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cFor anyone to come here, it has to be an attractive package for them\u2026Our county commissioners have had their hands tied, they haven't had a lot of help from Raleigh.\u201d\n\nPotts and Pearce stated they were not pleased with using incentives but they had to be used to keep competitive with other states. Forrest said he opposed incentives in the way they are currently being used.\n\n\u201cWe are doing incentives all wrong,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cWho is here when big businesses leave? It is the little guys, the small business owners. That is where our focus needs to be. We can drive North Carolina forward by promoting small businesses versus large businesses. Let's think outside the box, let's do it differently than the other states are doing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about how they would help resolve funding for teacher's pay and to increase student achievement, all the candidates agreed the current system is flawed but differed in how to resolve the issue.\n\nPotts said he felt schools mirrored the community and there needs to be more vocational education. Forrest said he felt spending could be reduced by cutting the number of administrators within the educational system. Dunn said she felt educators should form a committee to identify the needs of the system and Kennedy said he felt education should go back to the basics to train students to be competitive in a global market.\n\nPearce said she feels low test scores and poor performance is mostly a reflection of the standards of the individual family and that parents should have a choice of what school their children should attend.\n\n\u201cThe money needs to follow the student,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cPeople need to have a choice about where to send their student to school. I do agree that a lot of (performance) comes from the home. Whenever I was growing up and I got in trouble at school, I got it twice as bad when I got home. Unfortunately a lot of it is the parents are more concerned about (how the child is treated). I understand this is a bigger conversation than we have time for, but the money should follow the child and parents should be able to choose.\u201d\n\nGallimore said he feels there is too much government involvement hindering the education process, including common core standards.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing wrong with the educational system, is like most huge businesses or big government, there are too many people on top taking way too much money,\u201d Gallimore said. \u201cIt never gets down to the people who need it, deserve it and are working for it. The government is holding money over our heads for us to teach the students the way they want them to be taught rather than the way children should be taught.\u201d\n\nAnother topic the candidates addressed was the rising cost and availability of health care. Most candidates agreed the state should not accept federal funding for Medicaid and called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGallimore said the problem was not the system, but misuse by the insurance companies. Kennedy said the funding was in the wrong place and could be spent better other places. Forrest said he favors reducing frivolous lawsuits to reduce insurance costs and Pearce said there needs to be a reduction in fraud and abuse of the health care system.\n\nDunn said she felt that health care on a statewide and national level is such a large issue that she was still trying to figure out all the working pieces.\n\n\u201cIt is really hard from me to form a valid answer to something that is so complex,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt is so involved and difficult, but we definitely need to revamp our health care system. Obamacare cost me one of my businesses and it almost killed me. Our entire health care system is all messed up right now.\u201d\n\nPotts said he feels there is too much regulation in the health care field and the government is hindering progress.\n\n\u201cI serve on the board at Lexington Medical Center and cost containment is something that is brought up every meeting we have,\u201d Potts said. \u201cOne thing we need to look at is healthcare regulation reform\u2026 The situation we are facing is similar to the educational condition. It's not the (medical professionals) who are causing the problems, it's the bureaucracy that gets in the way of them performing their jobs.\u201d\n\nSharon Myers can be reached at (336) 249-3981, Ext. 228 or at sharon.myers@the-dispatch.com.
