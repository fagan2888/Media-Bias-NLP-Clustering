But a judge ruled their terms were too short under federal law and ordered them back to prison for about four years each.\n\nThe decision has generated controversy in a remote part of the state where the Hammonds are well known for their generosity and community contributions. It\u2019s also playing into a long-simmering conflict between ranchers and the U.S. government over the use of federal land for cattle grazing.\n\nIn particular, the Hammonds\u2019 new sentences touched a nerve with far right groups who repudiate federal authority. The son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a standoff with the government over grazing rights, is organizing opposition.\n\nIn 2014, after the Bureau of Land Management sought to remove Bundy\u2019s cattle from public rangeland, armed militiamen confronted federal officials. Bundy stopped paying grazing fees over 20 years ago and owes more than $1 million.\n\nLast month, his son Ammon Bundy and a handful of militiamen from other states arrived in Burns, some 60 miles from the Hammond ranch.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Ammon Bundy criticized the U.S. government for a failed legal process. Federal lawyers prosecuted the Hammonds under an antiterrorism law that required a five-year minimum sentence, though they have declined to say why.\n\nAmmon Bundy wrote that the Hammonds are not terrorists and didn\u2019t commit any crimes. He also shamed the Harney County sheriff for not protecting the Hammonds. The sheriff didn\u2019t respond to calls from The Associated Press.\n\nAmmon Bundy and other right-wing leaders have called on armed militia around the country to come support the Hammonds. The groups will hold a rally and protest in town today.\n\n\u201cIf what is happening to the Hammonds is allowed, it will set a standard of what these powerful people will do to all of us,\u201d Ammon Bundy wrote in an email, referring to the federal government.\n\nThe Hammonds have not welcomed the Bundys\u2019 help.\n\n\u201cNeither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family,\u201d the Hammonds\u2019 lawyer W. Alan Schroeder wrote to Sheriff David Ward.\n\nDwight Hammond said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.\n\n\u201cWe gave our word that\u2019s what we would do, and we intend to act on it,\u201d he told the AP.\n\nNot about the fires\n\nProsecutors said the Hammonds\u2019 grazing leases didn\u2019t give them exclusive use of the land or permission to burn public property. The fire charred just under 140 acres.\n\nThough the family doesn\u2019t want confrontation, Dwight Hammond maintained their case isn\u2019t about fires: It\u2019s the climax of the government\u2019s efforts to take their land at a time when saving endangered species has gained in importance.\n\nDwight Hammond said he and his own father bought the ranch in 1964; the purchase price included several federal grazing allotments \u2014 the rights to lease public land for cattle grazing. But as the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge came to surround the Hammonds\u2019 property, the rancher said, the family had to stave off pressure from the federal government to sell the ranch.\n\nOver the years, the government chipped away at their grazing allotments, taking some and increasing fees on others, Dwight Hammond said. New federal rules made it harder to renew permits.\n\nAfter father and son were convicted of the arsons, the government declined to renew their grazing permit. The family is appealing that decision.\n\n\u201cWe paid hard dollars over 50 years ago for the right to graze. It isn\u2019t right for them to take it away from us,\u201d Dwight Hammond said, adding they\u2019ve had to rent pastures from other ranchers to keep their cows fed.\n\nAn attorney for the ranchers, Kendra Matthews, declined to discuss the case. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office also wouldn\u2019t comment. But in an opinion piece published this month in the Burns Times Herald, Oregon\u2019s U.S. attorney, Bill Williams, said the Hammonds received a fair trial and lawful sentences.\n\nWilliams said the government has never called the ranchers terrorists, and prosecutors acknowledged they were good people who contributed to their community.\n\nReferring to the militia, Williams said, \u201cAny criminal behavior contemplated by those who may object to the court\u2019s mandate \u2026 will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nAs for the Hammonds, they hope to keep the family business going with help from relatives. Maybe, Dwight Hammond said, when his son gets out of prison, \u201che can still have a family and a ranch to go back to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND \u2014 The father and son of a prominent Oregon ranching family plan to surrender at a California prison next week after a judge ruled they served too little time for setting fires that spread to government lands they leased to graze cattle.
