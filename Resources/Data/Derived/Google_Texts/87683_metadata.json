Instead the software issues an alarm and a TSA screening officer will physically screen the body area where an issue is detected. The software uses a generic image of a human body and not the person being screened, the TSA said.\n\nCopyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.
