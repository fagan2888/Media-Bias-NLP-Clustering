Doug Ducey has unveiled a plan to step up efforts to reduce the Arizona's Medicaid enrollment numbers. (Photo: Emmanuel Lozano/The Republic) Story Highlights Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s effort to change the way Arizona protects its most vulnerable is short-sighted\n\nHis proposal undoes almost every consequential part of the previous governor's Medicaid expansion\n\nLimits on program eligibility and mandatory payments into a health savings account jeopardize the health care that nearly 350,000 adults depend on\n\nOften, things sound much better in theory than in reality. That last piece of pizza. A timeshare in Hawaii. Josh Collmenter as an opening-day starter. And, of course, forcing people in poverty to pony up for health care.\n\nBut we know that theory is different than reality. We know that campaigning is different than governing. The proposal by Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s administration asking for federal waivers to change the way Arizona protects its most vulnerable is short-sighted and demonstrates either a deep lack of understanding or a willing indifference to those experiencing poverty.\n\nThere are dozens of reasons why this policy proposal is the wrong reform at the wrong time, but these are the three most glaring:\n\nPROBLEM 1: AHCCCS doesn't need to be fixed.\n\nFrom 2013 through the end of her term, Gov. Jan Brewer spent enormous amounts of energy and political will pushing the Legislature to pass important reforms and an expansion to the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. Ducey\u2019s proposal undoes almost every consequential part of that expansion.\n\nAHCCCS brings cost-effective health care to more than 1 1/2 million Arizonans by putting to use effective public-private partnerships and evidence-based practices.\n\nIf this waiver request were to proceed, it would put 350,000 Arizonans\u2019 health care at risk and weaken the integrity of the overall system. This is the wrong reform at the wrong time.\n\nPROBLEM 2: Opportunity for all?\n\nBoth Candidate Ducey and Gov. Ducey promised \u201copportunity for all,\u201d but this proposal ensures the exact opposite will be realized by nearly 350,000 of our neighbors. Individuals experiencing poverty face a bevy of challenges including access to transportation, healthy food, meaningful employment and safe housing.\n\nAccess to quality health care is another barrier to the independence that every Arizonan deserves, and AHCCCS is a key piece of the puzzle as individuals chart their path towards independence.\n\nEDITORIAL: Ducey's proposal makes sense (with big exceptions)\n\nHowever, the changes that Ducey proposes \u2014 lifetime limits on program eligibility, mandatory payments into a health savings account and so forth \u2014 puts the health care that nearly 350,000 adults depend on in serious jeopardy.\n\nHenry St. John, an 18th century English philosopher, said, \"Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man, without liberty no happiness can be enjoyed by society.\u201d\n\nIf liberty, defined by Ducey as \"opportunity for all,\" truly is the goal, this is the wrong reform at the wrong time.\n\nPROBLEM 3: This is a classic case of a solution in search of a problem.\n\nMandatory payments into a health savings account and lifetime limits on program eligibility are not policy solutions that lead to better health outcomes. These headline-grabbing soundbites are the stuff of campaigns, not responsible governance.\n\nSamuel Richard is the executive director of Protecting Arizona\u2019s Family Coalition. (Photo: handout)\n\nHaving \u201cskin in the game\u201d is one of the key rallying cries tied to the proposal. But this do-it-yourself boot-strapping prosperity is a dangerous fallacy. People experiencing poverty struggle to pay rent, put food on the table and pay for child care. Children, families and vulnerable adults need fewer barriers to independence, not additional challenges.\n\nFar from the picture our governor may want to paint, people experiencing poverty have thick skin and self-determination beyond measure. This proposal, however, creates more problems for individuals working hard to achieve the permanence and independence they desire.\n\nIt\u2019s time to tell Ducey this is the wrong reform at the wrong time. People experiencing poverty deserve dignity and a real opportunity to succeed. In short, Arizonans deserve more than hashtags and headlines..\n\nSamuel Richard is executive director of Protecting Arizona\u2019s Family Coalition, which advocates for fully funded health and human service programs.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1IDZ22k", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "My Turn: People living in poverty face enough challenges, and the governor wants to do this?", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "My Turn: People living in poverty face enough challenges, and the governor wants to do this?", "title": "Doug Ducey\u2019s Medicaid waivers: Wrong reform, wrong time", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/08/11/doug-ducey-medicaid-waivers-wrong/31480833/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "My Turn: People living in poverty face enough challenges, and the governor wants to do this?", "title": "Doug Ducey\u2019s Medicaid waivers: Wrong reform, wrong time", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bdb4b679338e56d4ebc37c2576b060fd7b2c06d9/c=526-0-3790-3264&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health care costs", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health care costs", "title": "Doug Ducey\u2019s Medicaid waivers: Wrong reform, wrong time", "author": "Samuel Richard", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4e5c322f451ee5b4deecbe73e925ae91fda6fbf/c=1010-0-3458-3264/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e5b18846b7709cbba798f9916ddc4bf442fc544/c=526-0-3790-3264/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6f64a33d5fa87eba29b5c7282a184661df6ececc/c=138-0-4479-3264/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6cf9033eab1cf3e53a22ffd22d7b4106f81ea75c/c=0-199-4890-2962&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-11T13:42:41.250000-07:00", "shorthed": "My Turn: Ducey\u2019s Medicaid waivers: Wrong reform, wrong time", "articleid": 31480833, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff421942567a68ebdc660e8d40e0748603a29d97/c=0-199-4890-2962/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6380ac3339ae6a2755a5d9d86b06784f89e41bf1/c=1408-0-3236-3264/local/-/media/2015/08/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635742377853731949--02B9743.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "doug ducey, doug ducey medicaid, doug ducey ahcccs, doug ducey medicaid reform, medicaid reform, medicaid reform arizona, ahcccs reform, medicaid waivers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3540\"", "article_summary": "Doug Ducey\u2019s administration asking for federal waivers to change the way Arizona protects its most vulnerable is short-sighted and demonstrates either a deep lack of understanding or a willing indifference to those experiencing poverty.\nFar from the picture our governor may want to paint, people experiencing poverty have thick skin and self-determination beyond measure.\nIndividuals experiencing poverty face a bevy of challenges including access to transportation, healthy food, meaningful employment and safe housing.\nAHCCCS brings cost-effective health care to more than 1 1/2 million Arizonans by putting to use effective public-private partnerships and evidence-based practices.\nDoug Ducey has unveiled a plan to step up efforts to reduce the Arizona's Medicaid enrollment numbers."}
