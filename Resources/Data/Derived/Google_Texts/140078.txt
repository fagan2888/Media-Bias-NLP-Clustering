Here's an additional tidbit from that recent Commonwealth Fund survey about Obamacare:

That's a lot of Republicans who are satisfied with their Obamacare coverage. They might not realize it's Obamacare—perhaps they know it as Kynect or Covered California—but they like it. And if you take it away, they're going to be unhappy. That's several million potentially unhappy Republicans if the national GOP continues its anti-Obamacare jihad. Just saying.
