(TRNS) – On Tuesday, the former secretary of state for defense of the UK said that the Islamic State would not draw distinctions between countries engaged in military action against it, adding that it presented a threat to anyone involved, regardless of what type of support was being provided.

In the aftermath of the recent bombing campaigns both by France, the United States and its allies, Dr. Liam Fox, who is currently a member of the parliament, said that it was important to remember that “the distinctions that we draw are not going to be recognized by ISIS.”

“The United Kingdom has not been part of military strikes, but has been dropping humanitarian aid into Iraq,” Fox said. “It didn’t stop ISIS from beheading a British hostage, because they regard the west, the outside, as all being the same.”

Fox said that ISIS and the West had fundamental differences in ideology which contributed to the conflict, and he also warned that these differences do not come from any action taken on the parts of the different countries.

The opposing ideologies come, not from anything that the West has done, but because of the identities of the different regions, Fox said.

“Everything we stand for, our desire to see equal rights across race, gender and religion, our quest for developing democracies, a secular rule of law, free markets and shared prosperity, all these things are an existential threat to their medieval, misogynistic and barbaric value set,” Fox said.

Fox went on to say that ISIS’s hate of the West’s value set contributes to its inability to distinguish between countries in the coalition that bomb and those that are giving humanitarian aid. He warned that it would ultimately come down to a battle of ideologies between the two regions.

“Only one of us can triumph, and it must not be them,” Fox said.
