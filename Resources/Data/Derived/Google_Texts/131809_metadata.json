The widespread rerouting has been occurring since Sunday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Finnish security firm F-Secure, users are being sent to two seemingly random pages \u2014 wpgk.org, an open-source software deployment site, and ptraverler.com, a Polish couple\u2019s travel blog.\n\nWhile the cyberattack is hijacking the Facebook Connect feature, which is quickly becoming ubiquitous on the Web, Facebook itself is not being affected. The world\u2019s most popular social network is officially banned in China.\n\nThe incident bears many similarities to the Chinese government\u2019s recently uncovered \u201cGreat Cannon\u201d cyberattack weapon. The tool allows Beijing to redirect Internet traffic worldwide toward pages it wants censored, overwhelming the website and hindering legitimate visitors.\n\nIn March, researchers said Chinese officials turned the Great Cannon on the popular coding site GitHub.\n\nThe Cannon rerouted massive amounts of traffic from Baidu, China\u2019s version of Google, toward specific sites hosted on the forum, including a Chinese-language New York Times page and a mirror site for Chinese digital censorship watchdog GreatFire.\n\nIn the last year, China has been ramping up its efforts to control digital information domestically.\n\nThe censorship campaign has increasingly irked foreign countries, including the U.S., as tools like the Great Cannon have started to hinder global Internet traffic.\n\nMozilla and Google now warn all Firefox and Chrome browser users who attempt to visit Chinese sites that they are no longer secure.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Chinese Internet users on websites with \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d buttons are being rerouted.", "description": "Chinese Internet users on websites with \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d buttons are being rerouted.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Chinese Internet users on websites with \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d buttons are being rerouted.", "title": "Report: China hijacking Facebook's login button", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/240338-report-china-hijacking-facebook-login-buttons", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/facebook_110713getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/240338-report-china-hijacking-facebook-login-buttons", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-28T15:14-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-28T15:14:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/240338-report-china-hijacking-facebook-login-buttons", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Chinese Internet users on websites with \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d buttons are being rerouted.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: China hijacking Facebook's login button"}, "dcterms.title": "Report: China hijacking Facebook's login button"}, "article_summary": "Chinese Internet users visiting websites with a \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d button are being redirected, according to numerous reports.\nThe tool allows Beijing to redirect Internet traffic worldwide toward pages it wants censored, overwhelming the website and hindering legitimate visitors.\nThe censorship campaign has increasingly irked foreign countries, including the U.S., as tools like the Great Cannon have started to hinder global Internet traffic.\nThe incident bears many similarities to the Chinese government\u2019s recently uncovered \u201cGreat Cannon\u201d cyberattack weapon.\nMozilla and Google now warn all Firefox and Chrome browser users who attempt to visit Chinese sites that they are no longer secure."}
