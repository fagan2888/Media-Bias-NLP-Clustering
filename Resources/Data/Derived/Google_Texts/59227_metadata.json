Yields shot up, futures dropped hard. Then as fast as that move hit, it went away.\n\nThough investors would love to forget it, the Greek topic keeps coming back and showing markets it can cause some damage.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the only thorn in the side. Bloggers at CrackedMarket are getting pretty frustrated with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.70% which has tried and failed to crack 2,120 resistance since late April. They say there\u2019s a \u201cfuzzy line separating a healthy consolidation from far less productive stalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile every selloff bounces because confident owners refuse to sell their stock for a discount, those with cash are proving just as stubborn,\u201d the CrackedMarket bloggers say. You might as well flip a coin if you want to figure out where this market is going next. More on that here.\n\nIt has been a fairly interesting overnight session at least. The dollar USDJPY, -0.42% popped above \u00a5125 in Asia \u2014 to a fresh 12-year high \u2014 until traders started piling in to take profits. One analyst expects it will only take a couple of upbeat pieces of economic data to move the buck solidly above that level. And we all know what\u2019s coming Friday.\n\nYen weakness is going to become a big deal, says Albert Edwards, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s bear in residence. While deflation fears are fading in the West, China\u2019s economic situation has become more precarious. An ever-weakening yen will force devaluations across Asia and send a tidal wave of deflation westward, he says in a note out today.\n\nEdwards, of course, is like a dog with a bone when it comes to deflation warnings, and he predicted a level of \u00a5145 against the dollar USDJPY, -0.42% by the end of March. But the dollar is an integral part to our \u201ccall of the day\u201d, as the behavior of the buck could be make or break for whether the S&P 500 corrects this year.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re thinking about the dollar, maybe thinking about gold breaking out of its slumber as well. Our \u201cchart of the day\u201d says boring gold is about to get less boring. But not in a good way.\n\nKey market gauges\n\nEurozone inflation and Greek worries are toying with this market. The latest? Greece\u2019s creditors have reached a deal, which now goes to the Greek government. It was a bit of a woolly ride early on this morning. Futures on the Dow US:YMM5 and the S&P US:ESM5 fell sharply, then recovered, and are now flat. Europe SXXP, +1.29% is in the red. Shanghai stocks SHCOMP, -0.97% gained more than 1.5%, but mild losses were seen elsewhere. Crude US:CLN5 has moved up above $61 on a weak dollar and upbeat comments out of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister. Gold US:GCN5 is up a hair.\n\nThe quote\n\n\u201cIn all of our schools it is illegal to have guns on campus, so again and again these guys go and shoot up these f***ing schools because they know there are no guns there. They are monsters killing six-year-olds\u201d \u2014 Actor Vince Vaughn in a British GQ interview on how firearms in schools will prevent mass shootings.\n\nThe economy\n\nFactory orders are coming at 10 a.m. Eastern, and figures on motor-vehicle sales will also be released.\n\nThe stat\n\nZeroHedge has crunched some numbers. So John Kerry falls off his bike in France, is flown to Geneva in a helicopter, then to Boston for surgery \u2014 via a \u201cspecially-equipped\u201d C-17 airplane \u201cused to carry over 100 combat troops and equipment into battle.\u201d Assuming roughly 10 hours flight time, that\u2019s at least a $250,000 bill for taxpayers.\n\nThe buzz\n\nDollar General DG, +0.85% is up after results. Check out more mentionables in Movers.\n\nApple AAPL, +1.76% TV may not be announced at next week\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference after all.\n\nThe chart\n\nSo far this year, gold prices are up less than 0.5%. Wow. Hence some have probably stopped looking at this commodity for thrills. But Tiho at The Short Side of Long blog says get ready, because a big move is coming.\n\nShort Side of Long\n\nUnfortunately for the gold bugs, it\u2019s not because of good news or anything like that. \u201cDespite awful performance, oversold price and persistent bearish sentiment, I believe that gold prices have not yet bottomed,\u201d says Tiho. And where gold goes, silver probably is headed, too. Read the full blog here.\n\nThe call\n\nA trio of weak commodities, dollar strength and a low 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.93% have been supporting the S&P 500, according to Stifel\u2019s Barry Bannister and Jesse Cantor. But we\u2019ve reached the end of the road on this line of support for equities, they say.\n\nHere\u2019s their worst case: \u201cUnless all three reverse, we see the S&P 500 correcting around 10% to 1,900 in the seasonally weak May to October 2015 period,\u201d said the strategists. Stock gains have been tightly correlated with the growth of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet (seen in chart below) and the market needs to break away from that, they note.\n\nBloomberg/Federal Reserve/Stifel\n\nA rebound in growth would help stocks pull free from that pattern, Bannister and Cantor say. And they are also upbeat about what they see lately: rising commodity prices, a dollar pullback and perking up of 10-year yields. They think oil will continue to recover and have set a first-quarter 2016 target for Brent at $80 a barrel, based on an expected 10% drop in the trade-weighted dollar. That could mean an S&P 500 at 2,350. That is, if that trio keeps reversing.\n\nRandom reads\n\nA ship carrying more than 450 people has sunk in the Yangtze River in China.\n\nDon\u2019t settle for Paris.
