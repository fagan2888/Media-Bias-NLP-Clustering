Soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid lamented the poor Obamacare rollout, blamed the president for Democrat losses in the midterm elections, and talked himself up in an interview published Wednesday, securing his status as the political equivalent of a “Rocky” villain.

“We never recovered from the [Obamacare] rollout because the election became one that was directed toward the president,” Reid told The New York Times. “We couldn’t overcome that.”

Reid also commented on his standing inside the Democratic Party, which can be described as IDGA[expletive]. Emphasis mine:

By the time Democrats returned to Washington after Election Day, an irascible few, like Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, were saying they could no longer support Mr. Reid as leader.

If this has humbled him in any way, he is not showing it. “They didn’t have anybody running against me,” he said. “So it made it kind of tough for them. It’s hard to lose an election when you don’t have anybody running against you.”

…

Mr. Reid, 75, said he would run again when his term is up in 2016, despite many predictions that this was his last in Washington. In defiance of his skeptics, he said he was going to start hiring a campaign staff in February. Republicans will be gunning for him, and they are hoping to recruit Nevada’s popular governor, Brian Sandoval, as an opponent.

This, too, does not ruffle Mr. Reid. “Brian, if he wants to run, more power to him. He’d make an excellent candidate,” he said, adding, “I’ve had a lot of excellent candidates, you know.”

Reid would seem to have a lot in common with Ivan Drago from “Rocky IV,” the Soviet boxer who exclaims to the crowd and the premier during a match, “I fight to win for me.”
