The engineers helped design the plane's \"sharklets.\" What Airbus calls sharklets are usually called winglets or the wing tips on U.S. built planes.\n\nAirbus Vice President of Engineering John O'Leary says those sharklets can typically increase the plane's fuel efficiency by about four percent which can save a great amount of fuel over the plane's lifetime.\n\nBut what the passengers arriving at gate six noticed were the improvements inside the cabin, such as, leather seats throughout. Each seat has its own entertainment screen with passengers being able to select their own entertainment.\n\nAmerican Spokeswoman Andrea Huguely says for now one A319 will fly daily in and out of Wichita. She says that can change as the airline takes more deliveries and replaces older planes.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "American Airlines debuted the Airbus A319 flight at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport and welcomed by Airbus employees.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "American Airlines debuted the Airbus A319 flight at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport and welcomed by Airbus employees.", "title": "American Airlines Airlines Debut Airbus Flight", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/American-Airlines-Airlines-Debut-Airbus-Flight--223993761.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/6DA/423/6DA423B49BEA49548F95E75818EF4ACC", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/13A/637/13A6378094744E2792591DE39243A80A.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "American Airlines debuted the Airbus A319 flight at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport and welcomed by Airbus employees.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/American-Airlines-Airlines-Debut-Airbus-Flight--223993761.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/airbus6.jpg", "title": "American Airlines Airlines Debut Airbus Flight", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "American Airlines Airlines Debut Airbus Flight", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "American Airlines Airlines Debut Airbus"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde639\"", "article_summary": "Monday's inaugural flight arrival here was also welcomed by 45 Wichita Airbus employees from the Airbus Engineering facility.\nMid-Continent's Safety department made a water canon salute for the American flight from Dallas to taxi under.\nMonday September 16, 2013Wichita's Mid-Continent airport welcomes American Airlines first flight here with American's new Airbus A319 jetliner.\nShe says that can change as the airline takes more deliveries and replaces older planes.\nThe engineers helped design the plane's \"sharklets.\""}
