Nathalie Emmanuel, who you may recognize as Missandei from Game of Thrones, is in the mix as well.\n\nThe trailer features the kind of over-the-top stunts you'd expect as well as a few subtle nods to Walker's role. \"One last ride,\" Vin Diesel's character says as the camera cuts to Walker's face.\n\nTake a look:\n\nIt should be no surprise that a film series that went from standard street races to city-destroying bank heists and highway tank battles is trying to up the ante again. This time, the crew drives their cars out of a cargo plane. (Don't worry. The cars have parachutes.)\n\nWhile we don't learn much of the plot outside of general themes of \"vengeance\" and \"family,\" it's the little things \u2014 Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson breaking his arm out of a cast, Michelle Rodriguez saving Paul Walker's life with her car's spoiler, Vin Diesel doing everything Vin Diesel does \u2014 that make this one look just as exciting as the past few.\n\nThe tribute: Walker's untimely death left some scenes unfinished, and the filmmakers decided to round it out with the use of CGI and his brothers as stand-ins. The release of the trailer sparked some emotional responses from his costars.\n\n\"Very emotional seeing Paul on screen, yet beautiful at the same time,\" Johnson posted on his Facebook page. \"I miss brother Paul. We all do\u2026\"\n\nDiesel simply posted this photo:\n\nFurious 7 will be released in April 2015.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "The new trailer is ridiculous ... ly awesome.", "language": "en", "title": "Watch the Long-Awaited First Trailer for 'Furious 7'", "og": {"site_name": "Mic", "description": "The new trailer is ridiculous ... ly awesome.", "title": "Watch the Long-Awaited First Trailer for 'Furious 7'", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/103062/watch-the-long-awaited-first-trailer-for-furious-7", "image": "http://thumbs.mic.com/MjQ0NWQ5ZWQ2MSMvR0JSZHJJZXpocXJwdF9SY3BnTjJHSHJrNV9BPS8xNjB4MDoxMTExeDU5OS8xMjAweDYzMC9maWx0ZXJzOnF1YWxpdHkoODUpL2h0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzLzkzNzE1NWRhMGRiMzM0YzIyZDY3OGIzZmYzNjJkYzc5ODQyYTYwMDc4OTJkMzhmZTBlOTdmZGI2MTJlY2NjZGMuanBn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"user_id": 139909832, "description": "The new trailer is ridiculous ... ly awesome.", "creator": "HeyMattConnolly", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/103062/watch-the-long-awaited-first-trailer-for-furious-7", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/policymic-images/937155da0db334c22d678b3ff362dc79842a6007892d38fe0e97fdb612ecccdc.jpg", "title": "Watch the Long-Awaited First Trailer for 'Furious 7'", "site": "@MicNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mic", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"pubDate": "2014-11-01T16:55:00.000Z", "isBlacklisted": "false", "modDate": "2014-11-01T16:43:41.000Z", "keywords": "watch, the, long-awaited, first, trailer, for, 'furious, 7', , paul walker, vin diesel, walkers, trailer, furious, Arts", "type": "evergreen", "id": 103062}, "fb": {"admins": "23342,215337,1410801,675670245,13000939,616963,1479330109,1267070071", "app_id": 141861192518680}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "original-image": "https://media3.mic.com/Y2E2M2Y4YWQyYSMvOWNCRG1MWjZMcDFHbDVCYnJhMkgwdE5jOUo0PS8xNjB4MDoxMTExeDU5OS8xOTEweDEwMDAvZmlsdGVyczpxdWFsaXR5KDg1KS9odHRwczovL3MzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20vcG9saWN5bWljLWltYWdlcy85MzcxNTVkYTBkYjMzNGMyMmQ2NzhiM2ZmMzYyZGM3OTg0MmE2MDA3ODkyZDM4ZmUwZTk3ZmRiNjEyZWNjY2RjLmpwZw==.jpg", "keywords": "watch, the, long-awaited, first, trailer, for, 'furious, 7',", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MicMedia", "tag": "watch, the, long-awaited, first, trailer, for, 'furious, 7',", "published_time": "2014-11-01T16:55:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-01T16:43:41.000Z"}, "news_keywords": "watch, the, long-awaited, first, trailer, for, 'furious, 7',", "msapplication-task": "name=Mic on LinkedIn;action-uri=http://www.linkedin.com/company/policymic;icon-uri=http://linkedin.com/favicon.ico", "identifier-URL": "http://mic.com/articles/74689/the-8-most-dysfunctional-families-in-tv-history"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ea4\"", "article_summary": "The trailer for the next installment in the Fast and the Furious series has been released \u2014 and it's glorious.\nThe trailer features the kind of over-the-top stunts you'd expect as well as a few subtle nods to Walker's role.\n\"Very emotional seeing Paul on screen, yet beautiful at the same time,\" Johnson posted on his Facebook page.\nThe release of the trailer sparked some emotional responses from his costars.\nNathalie Emmanuel, who you may recognize as Missandei from Game of Thrones, is in the mix as well."}
