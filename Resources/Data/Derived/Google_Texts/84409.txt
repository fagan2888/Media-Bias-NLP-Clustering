The multination health care product company Johnson & Johnson has issued yet another voluntary product recall after mold was found in the schizophrenia drug Risperdal Consta (risperidone). This past Friday, J&J announced the recall of 200,000 bottles of Motrin Infants formula due to a risk of plastic exposure.

Risperdal Consta is an injectable anti-psychotic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The company has advised all wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, and healthcare providers to send the drug back to their facilities after mold was discovered during a routine testing process, Reuters reported.

"We estimate that fewer than 5,000 dose packs remain in the market considering our current inventory levels and the usage of this product," company representative Robyn Reed Frenze told Reuters. "There have been no trends of adverse events of infection associated with this lot."

Just last week, Johnson & Johnson issued a voluntary recall for 200,000 bottles of its popular infant formula Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, tiny plastic particles were discovered in the product lot before it was released to the market.

"From our perspective, during the manufacturing process at the third party supplier, that's when the particles got into the ibuprofen," said McNeil Vice President Ed Kuffner to the Associated Press. J&J’s product recalls in recent years include Children’s Tylenol, contact lenses, and heart devices, the Wall Street Journal reported.
