The helicopter, which costs around $52 million apiece, features a combination of laser-guided precision Hellfire missiles, 70mm rockets, and a 30mm automatic cannon with up to 1,200 ammunition rounds, according to fact sheet from Boeing, its manufacturer.\n\nRelated: McCain: We\u2019re Not Paying for Anti-ISIS Program Unless There\u2019s a Real Plan\n\nThough the helicopters can fire their missiles from a distance, the aircraft could be at risk from ground fire when engaged in close combat situations, as happened during the previous U.S. military presence in Iraq. That raises the specter of American pilots being captured by ISIS or executed in graphic Internet videos like when the terror group put a Jordanian pilot in a cage and burned him alive.\n\nThus far, Baghdad has yet to take Washington up on its offer.\n\n\u201cIf the Iraqi government asks for Apache helicopters, and the mission is right, if we agree, then we'll use\u201d them, Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the military coalition, said during a Pentagon last week. The helicopters \u201care ready, so all we have to do is find an operation or a mission that they will be able to impact, and then agree with the Iraqis that it's the right time to use them.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that the Pentagon is offering the helicopters at all marks an important moment in the roughly 16-month campaign against ISIS as it draws the U.S. closer to greater involvement in the region.\n\nRelated: ISIS Is Winning the Recruitment War as Foreign Fighters Flow into Syria\n\nWhile President Obama has flatly refused to allow the country to be drawn into another open-ended commitment in the Middle East, polls show more Americans want boots on the ground to fight ISIS after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.\n\nOffering the Apaches does move the U.S. \u201cdeeper\u201d into the conflict, according to Lawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and former assistant secretary of Defense.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes is it a small step that will lead to larger steps?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d\n\nKorb predicted that should the Apaches be used to take Ramadi, it would open up Pandora\u2019s Box, with the Iraqi government wanting them to retake other population centers like Mosul, one of the country\u2019s largest cities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very easy thing to do a little bit more and a little bit more,\u201d he said.\n\nWashington would need to reassess its commitment to using the helicopter if one of them is shot down, says one of the snipers ISIS is known for, according to Korb. But, based on the rhetoric he\u2019s heard from officials in and out of government they are \u201cwilling to live with casualties.\u201d\n\nPutting the helicopters on offense \u201cis a way for Carter to fend off some of the critics (on Capitol Hill) who say you\u2019re not doing anything in response\u201d to the recent ISIS attacks, he added.\n\nKorb predicted the Apaches would be used, but might be accompanied by some kabuki theater, where Abadi \u201cwill play politics\u201d and denounce the action. But, \u201cwe\u2019ll do it and say it wasn\u2019t that many, or it was limited or something.\n\nThe topic is sure to be up for discussion on Monday when Obama pays a visit to the Pentagon for a National Security Council meeting about the anti-ISIS strategy.\n\n\"He wants us to continue to come to him for proposals with ways that we can strengthen the campaign consistent with our overall strategic approach,\" Carter said during a joint press conference at the Pentagon with British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "At a time when President Obama has come under persistent criticism for having an inade", "title": "Why Offering U.S. Apache Attack Helicopters to Iraq Is a Big Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/13/Why-Offering-US-Apache-Attack-Helicopters-Iraq-Big-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Boeing%20Apache.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/13/Why-Offering-US-Apache-Attack-Helicopters-Iraq-Big-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Boeing%20Apache.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "At a time when President Obama has come under persistent criticism for having an inade", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Their use would open up a new capability in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq.\n\u201cIf the Iraqi government asks for Apache helicopters, and the mission is right, if we agree, then we'll use\u201d them, Col.
