We take chocolate for granted as a common dessert in America, but it turns out that in other parts of the world, many aren\u2019t even familiar with chocolate. Specifically, that includes the Ivory Coast, a West African country responsible for producing a full third of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.\n\nHow is it that the people most responsible for chocolate haven\u2019t tried chocolate before? Fascinated by this bizarre scenario, Selay Kouassi, an international journalist, visited cocoa bean farmers in the Ivory Coast to give them their first bite of chocolate. The video shows that touching moment:\n\nThe first man Kouassi meets with, N\u2019Da Alphonse, admits that he doesn\u2019t know why people pay him for this crop in the first place. \u201cFrankly, I do not know what one makes from cocoa beans. I\u2019m just trying to earn a living with growing cocoa.\u201d Upon discovering the sweet taste for the first time, he declares, \u201cI did not know that cocoa was so yummy.\u201d Considering that cocoa beans are bitter until blended with butter and sugar, Alphonse\u2019s reaction is understandable.\n\nAfterwards, Alphonse takes Kouassi to meet fellow farmers who are also unaware of what happens to the beans they harvest. One of the growers is under the mistaken impression that cocoa beans are primarily cultivated to make wine. \u201cWe complain because growing cocoa is hard work,\u201d said one farmer upon trying chocolate for the first time. \u201cNow we enjoy the result. What a privilege to taste it.\u201d\n\nNot having tasted chocolate is possibly the least of these exploited workers\u2019 worries. The cocoa bean industry is flooded with claims of human trafficking and child slave labor.\n\nIn truth, there is a limited amount of chocolate available in parts of the Ivory Coast, but it retails for an unattainable $2.69. Considering that Alphonse makes just $9.40 per day and uses it to support 19 people, chocolate is a luxury that he could never realistically afford.\n\nThe video serves as a good reminder of the privileges American society has access to that people in other parts of the world can\u2019t even comprehend \u2013 despite being a part of the labor force that creates these products. Can you imagine working day in and day out to produce something that you don\u2019t even understand? Americans typically at least have a sense of what the end goal is at their jobs, but these cocoa bean farmers aren\u2019t even in a position to ask what people in other parts of the world do with their products.\n\nCocoa bean workers aren\u2019t alone in being clueless toward the end result of their labor. CNN has a video of an anonymous teenage Foxconn employee who spends extended hours each day constructing screens for iPads but had never seen the finished product before. After trying it out, she said she liked the gadget and hoped she could afford one one day \u2014 something that wouldn\u2019t be possible on her current sweatshop wages.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cocoa bean farmers in the Ivory Coast weren't even aware that their crop is used to make chocolate.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3104/3103615.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "chocolate,cocoa bean,ivory coast,food,farming,economics", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Cocoa bean workers aren\u2019t alone in being clueless toward the end result of their labor.\n\u201cWe complain because growing cocoa is hard work,\u201d said one farmer upon trying chocolate for the first time.\nSpecifically, that includes the Ivory Coast, a West African country responsible for producing a full third of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.\nFascinated by this bizarre scenario, Selay Kouassi, an international journalist, visited cocoa bean farmers in the Ivory Coast to give them their first bite of chocolate.\nThe cocoa bean industry is flooded with claims of human trafficking and child slave labor."}
