The problem was she had an asthma attack early in the day and didn\u2019t have any medicine.\n\nShe searched the Internet for quick help and found Franciscan Urgent Virtual Care.\n\n\u201cI dialed the number and got a person on the phone who was very helpful,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThey told me we could either connect by Skype or telephone in the next 30 to 40 minutes. About 20 minutes later I got a call, so the wait was hardly anything.\u201d\n\nArcher says the physician took the time to \u201creally get to know my situation.\u201d After 20 minutes, the physician wrote a prescription, which was phoned in to a pharmacy. By 9 that night, she was on the stage. \u201cAnd the show was great,\u201d she said.\n\nJust as important, Archer says, the virtual visit cost only $35.\n\nGrowing interest\n\nIncreasingly, health care providers are turning to telehealth \u2014 physician services provided over a video or telephone connection \u2014 to save dollars and deliver care to remote areas or to patients who may have difficulty getting to medical facilities.\n\nThe American Medical Association endorsed the use of remote monitoring and delivery of services at its annual meeting in June 2014. At the same time, the organization noted that the market for telemedicine is expected to grow from approximately $1 billion in 2016 to $6 billion by 2020.\n\nIn Washington state, for example, Premera Blue Cross, the state\u2019s largest insurer, began offering its telemedicine services this year.\n\n\u201cThe industry is moving toward offering people access to care at a place and time that is convenient to them,\u201d said Rich Maturi, senior vice president of Premera\u2019s Health Care Delivery System.\n\nCHI Franciscan Health has helped pioneer telemedicine in Washington state, offering virtual health services since October 2013.\n\nMatt Levi, director of virtual health services at CHI Franciscan Health, said his company\u2019s Virtual Urgent Care program \u2014 which allows consumers to receive care 24/7 via phone or video chat on smartphone, tablet or PC \u2014 has been a win-win for both the hospital system and consumers.\n\nSaving time and money\n\n\u201cWe put the cost of this at $35, thinking that was very similar to the coinsurance a lot of patients pay at a normal primary-care office,\u201d said Levi. \u201cAnd for us, without having the bricks and mortar, and all of the additional staff that go along with the visit, it\u2019s certainly a lower-cost alternative to emergency-room visits.\u201d\n\nTelemedicine has dramatically decreased the number of times patients page Franciscan Health\u2019s on-call providers, Levi said, adding that there\u2019s been a 50 percent reduction in the number of times Franciscan doctors are awakened by calls in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201cRight now (it) takes on average about 12 minutes from the time you tell us that you want to visit to the time you\u2019re on the phone with one of our providers,\u201d said Carena CEO Ralph Derrickson. \u201cThat visit is going to last about 20 minutes and when it is done, if you need a prescription, it will be phoned in to a pharmacy.\u201d\n\nThe first thing Carena care providers do during a virtual visit is to determine whether the consumer\u2019s issue is appropriate for virtual care.\n\n\u201cWe have clinical software and decision-support software that we\u2019ve developed that is rules-based,\u201d Derrickson said. \u201cWe start that visit with an assessment. If we can\u2019t help that patient, we\u2019re going to tell them right upfront that virtual care isn\u2019t an option and that they need to be seen.\u201d\n\nThe University of Washington School of Medicine has also turned to Carena for a telemedicine service. Starting in January, it began offering virtual visits via webcams on computers, tablets and smartphones. Consultations can usually take place within a half-hour of the initial call and cost $40.\n\nEasier access\n\nDerrickson says a number of factors have given a critical boost to telemedicine. First, rapid growth in bandwidth and availability of devices with built-in video have made the service feasible for consumers.\n\nSecond, changes under the Affordable Care Act have provided incentives for consumers. With more people having health insurance that often has higher deductibles than in the past, many consumers are responsible for the full amount of a doctor\u2019s visit instead of just paying a $20 to $25 co-payment, Derrickson said.\n\nStill, telemedicine services may not be covered by a consumer\u2019s insurance plans. \u201cMany self-insured companies build it right into their plans,\u201d Derrickson said. \u201cWith general insurance with third-party payers, it varies.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chelene Whiteaker, policy director of the Washington State Hospital Association, the uncertainty about insurance coverage for telemedicine has slowed its adoption.\n\n\u201cOur hospital members said to us that they would really like to explore providing services via telemedicine, but that they were running into significant barriers from insurance plans not wanting to pay for the services,\u201d Whiteaker said. \u201cHospitals and health systems are not making investments from this technology because of the payment uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWhiteaker said her organization has pushed for legislation in the past two legislatures requiring insurers to cover procedures delivered via telemedicine that were already covered for regular visits.\n\nState Sen. Randi Becker introduced such legislation in January as Senate Bill 5175.\n\nAt Franciscan\u2019s Virtual Urgent Care, the results have so far been positive, said Levi, the director of virtual health.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten a 96 percent satisfaction rate from our patients, which is really high even for our on-site clinic,\u201d he said.\n\nLevi sees telemedicine not only as a convenience, but also as a way to extend care to those who may not be within reach of a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nWhiteaker added that the Affordable Care Act will likely increase the need for telemedicine. \u201cWe are going to be seeing more people with insurance coverage and in some rural areas we know that they\u2019re not going to be enough specialists,\u201d Whiteaker said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SEATTLE \u2014 On New Year\u2019s Eve, singer Kim Archer was scheduled to perform at a party.
