Peak\u2019s 3-point attempt was blocked by Bullock.\n\nThe Hoyas cut what had been a 26-point first-half deficit all the way down to a point with just over a minute to play.\n\nThe Friars put the ball in the hands of Dunn and Bentil, and they accounted for 12 of Providence\u2019s final 14 points to help stave off Georgetown\u2019s comeback efforts.\n\nMarcus Derrickson led the Hoyas with 18 points and nine rebounds.\n\nD\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera, the Hoyas\u2019 leading scorer, knocked down a 3-pointer \u2014 his first basket of the game \u2014 to pull Georgetown within 70-67 with 2:42 left.\n\nIt was 71-67 when Dunn blocked a shot by Smith-Rivera, but Bentil missed a 3-point attempt on Providence\u2019s ensuing possession.\n\nGeorgetown got it back and cut it to a point on a 3-pointer by Trey Mourning with 1:08 left.\n\nBullock was fouled underneath and connected on two free throws to push the lead back up to three.\n\nOut of a timeout, Georgetown ran the shot clock down, and Isaac Copeland was fouled on a 3-point attempt by Junior Lomomba with 10 seconds left.\n\nCopeland got only two of the three free throws, forcing the Hoyas to foul Bentil.\n\nBentil made both, setting up Peak\u2019s final shot as time expired.\n\nThe Friars\u2019 offense was in sync early, and had an 11-0 run midway through the first half.\n\nGeorgetown fell apart on both ends of the court during the stretch, going without a field goal for nearly seven minutes, and turning it over five times as it fell into a 20-point deficit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Georgetown, once down 20 points in the first half, had a chance to tie the score as time expired on a 3-pointer by L.J.
