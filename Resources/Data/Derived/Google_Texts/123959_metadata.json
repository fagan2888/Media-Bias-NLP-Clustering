This incredible accomplishment, published in the journal Science on Thursday, could change the future of quantum communication.\n\nSo what does a single atom in motion sound like? It is one of the faintest sounds physically feasible. The sound is so incredibly soft, the researchers weren\u2019t able to actually hear it.\n\n\u201cThe sound amplitude, or strength, is very weak,\u201d the study\u2019s co-author G\u00f6ran Johansson told Motherboard. \u201cBasically, when you excite the atom, it creates a sound, one phonon at a time, according to theory. It\u2019s the weakest possible sound possible at the frequency [that it vibrates].\u201d\n\nSo how did the researchers even capture this sound? In an ingenious method, Johansson and his team used a semiconducting circuit to create an artificial atom, which they then excited.\n\nThen, using a chip, equipped with \u201clong metallic\u201d phalanges, the waves from the atom\u2019s vibration are measured. However, these waves are far too small to be viewed, so they are then transformed to microwaves and are detected from their microwave state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The future of quantum communication may be in quantum sound", "title": "Scientists have finally captured the sound produced by a single atom", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The future of quantum communication may be in quantum sound", "title": "Scientists have finally captured the sound produced by a single atom", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/12/scientists_have_finally_captured_the_sound_produced_by_a_single_atom/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_147996839-1000x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The future of quantum communication may be in quantum sound", "title": "Scientists have finally captured the sound produced by a single atom", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_147996839-1000x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atom, Discovery, innovation, laboratory, Physics, quantum sound, Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29ce\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s the weakest possible sound possible at the frequency [that it vibrates].\u201dSo how did the researchers even capture this sound?\nTopics: Atom, Discovery, innovation, laboratory, Physics, quantum sound, Science, Innovation News, Technology NewsScientists from Columbia University and Sweden\u2019s Chalmers University of Technology captured the sound of a single excited atom \u2014 a phonon \u2014 for the first time ever.\nSo what does a single atom in motion sound like?\n\u201cBasically, when you excite the atom, it creates a sound, one phonon at a time, according to theory.\nIn an ingenious method, Johansson and his team used a semiconducting circuit to create an artificial atom, which they then excited."}
