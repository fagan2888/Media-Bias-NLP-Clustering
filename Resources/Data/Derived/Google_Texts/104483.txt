St. Charles Community College will offer informational sessions on health insurance, as well as a two-day health care enrollment event Wednesday, January 27 and Thursday, January 28.

SCC is located at 4601 Mid Rivers Mall Dr. in Cottleville.

“The Affordable Care Act requires Americans to sign up for health insurance, but the process can be very confusing,” said Paul Roesler, professor of social sciences at SCC. “Many people have questions about signing up. This is why I’m excited to have these experts come to SCC for these events. This is an important service to our community.”

The first event, Health Insurance 101, is an informational presentation by Hana Hartman, an ACA navigator, at 10 a.m. Wednesday, January 27, in the auditorium of the Daniel J. Conoyer Social Sciences Building. Hartman will explain the ins and outs of Missouri’s health insurance exchanges, including how to sign up for insurance on the exchange.

ACA Enrollment Days will be held from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday, January 27 and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday, January 28, at SCC. At these full-day events Hana and other navigators will help students and community members individually sign up for healthcare plans. Students and other community members can sign up for available time slots at http://goo.gl/forms/xD8DJkAiuo

The deadline to enroll in a health insurance plan for 2016 is Sunday, January 31.

Individuals who know they want health insurance but cannot make this event should contact Hana Hartman directly at 314-412-4057 as soon as possible to make another appointment.
