A Catholic School in San Francisco has pulled a graduating senior’s picture from the yearbook because she opted to wear a tuxedo instead of a dress. Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory student Jessica Urbina will be excluded from the yearbook and will not have her photo shown during graduation because her choice of outfit violated the school’s dress code, according to a report from CBS 5KPIX.

A post on the school’s website said that it is “always regretful when a student portrait is omitted for any reason” and that “as a community we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all students are included in the future.” It is strange though, because school policy requires girls wear dresses in yearbook photos but gives them the option of wearing slacks during school hours. It’s hard to understand the difference between a tux and slacks, in terms of “appropriate” attire.
