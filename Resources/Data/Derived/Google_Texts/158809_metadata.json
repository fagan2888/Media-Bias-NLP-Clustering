Preliminary results from a multi-site, IRB-approved clinical study of the CheckedUp platform in high volume ophthalmic clinics. Source: 2013 CheckedUp Clinical Data\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CheckedUp\u2122, a New York City-based healthtech startup, announced today that it will be launching its first mobile health platform for ophthalmologists and ophthalmic patients in the first half of 2014.\n\nThe CheckedUp platform was designed to enhance the quality and efficiency of doctor-patient communication. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), affecting upwards of 30 million new patients, will place an unprecedented pressure on practices to provide high quality care under increasing time constraints. Busy doctors running high volume practices have less time to spend on individual patients, affecting clinical outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe demands on consultation and caregiving are rapidly increasing due to recent legislation, the growing tide of baby-boomers, and improved surgical options for patients,\u201d said Richard Awdeh, M.D., CEO and Founder of CheckedUp.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make the care process as transparent as possible. Mobile technology has revolutionized the way that we communicate within our communities, yet communication so crucial to modern healthcare continues to lag.\u201d\n\nCheckedUp supplements the patient\u2019s office visit by providing ongoing education and communication customized by a patient\u2019s doctor, at every step in the care process, from the initial consultation to postoperative follow-ups. The product\u2019s platform includes a proprietary suite including: Digital Healthcoach\u2122, Medical Alert\u2122, Patient Play\u2122, and Rx-Ready\u2122, in which patients can customize how they want to navigate their care and digital relationship with their healthcare provider. The software automatically alerts the patient\u2019s doctor about their preferences, so that in-person consultations can be more personal and productive.\n\nThe CheckedUp platform leverages the growing use of mobile technology among both older adults and doctors. \u201cThe use of mobile technology has made patients both more empowered and less anxious. With the troves of inaccurate information available online, it is more crucial than ever, that patients have access to their doctors\u2019 opinions and treatment recommendations. CheckedUp makes this possible for the first time,\u201d said Dr. Awdeh.\n\nCheckedUp\u2019sTM Clinical Trial: Examining the Use & Effectiveness of mHealth Technologies\n\nIn order to determine the adoption rates and effectiveness of mHealth platforms, for both doctors and baby boomers, CheckedUp is conducting a multi-site, IRB-approved clinical study of its platform in high volume ophthalmic clinics. Currently both quantitative and qualitative data have been collected from over 300 patients and physicians in order to demonstrate the value of mHealth technologies in the clinical setting.\n\nThe preliminary results indicate that not only are mHealth adoption rates higher than expected, but that the CheckedUp platform is strengthening the communication channel between physicians and their patients. \u201cOverall, this growing body of data confirms that patients who use CheckedUp are more informed about their condition, better equipped to make choices about their surgery options, and better able to adhere to care instructions in the postoperative period,\u201d said Dr. Awdeh.\n\nCheckedUp announced today plans to launch its mobile health platform in 50 ophthalmic clinics nationwide. The company\u2019s technology team will work closely with physicians and clinical staff to enhance their software, implementation strategies, and establish a best practice fit for each clinic.\n\nAbout CheckedUp:\n\nCheckedUp extends the doctor-patient relationship beyond office walls. This proprietary, educational platform facilitates and enhances communication between doctors and patients at each stage in the care process. CheckedUp empowers patients to play an active role in their care by providing them with customized content from their healthcare provider (HCP) on relevant procedures and products.\n\nCheckedUp was founded by Richard Awdeh, M.D., who is currently the Head of Executive Medicine at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, the US News & World Report\u2019s #1 ranked Eye Hospital in the U.S., and the CEO of Cirle, a health and biotech incubator based in Miami.\n\nCheckedUp\u2019s Medical and Strategic Advisory Board consists of some of the leading ophthalmologists in the country and the CEOs of several publicly traded Fortune 100 companies.
