They\u2019re confused. How could this hotbed of entrepreneurship and wealth creation be largely pro-Democrat? But Silicon Valley boasts a unique culture that emerges from an environment of competition, innovation, government involvement, and collaboration. As journalist Greg Ferenstein has written, these \u201chippies who dig capitalism and science\u201d \u2013 many of them millennials \u2013 are hard to label. They go with the public policies that make their ventures possible.\n\nSo what is the \u201cpolitical philosophy\u201d of Silicon Valley? And what do these tech leaders want from public policy? I sat down with Greg, editor of the Ferenstein Wire and author of The Age Of Optimists, a free book on Silicon Valley\u2019s political endgame, available on Medium. Here\u2019s some of our conversation, which you can listen at in full over on Ricochet.\n\nPethokoukis: You\u2019ve done interviews with some 130 Silicon Valley founders. What you\u2019ve found is that they donate overwhelmingly to Democrats, but they have some beliefs that don\u2019t necessarily align perfectly with Democrats or Republicans. You call them \u201chippies who dig capitalism and science,\u201d pro-business liberals.\n\nThey\u2019re big on globalization, free trade, open borders, and they\u2019re anti-labor union, but they\u2019re also pro-Obamacare, and believe that governments should act like a business. They have a meritocratic world view, prioritize individual creativity as a source of problem solving, yet also believe in collaboration and competition.\n\nWhy do all these free enterprise loving Silicon Valley folks vote for Democrats?\n\nFerenstein: The high level elevator pitch is that Silicon Valley and, broadly, urbanized professionals, represent an entirely new political category \u2014 not libertarian, not Democrat, and not Republican. I argue that they are pro-capitalism and pro-government and their belief is that the government should be an investor in citizens to make them more educated, entrepreneurial and civic, rather than act as a regulator of the two parties.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is the emergence of an entirely new thing\u2026 They\u2019re trying to race into a better future as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Democratic Party comes closest to this, and the people that they fund pretty heavily tend to author laws that focus on education and civics and making people healthier rather than regulations and labor unions. So that\u2019s the upshot: what we\u2019re seeing is the emergence of an entirely new thing, which I\u2019m tentatively calling optimists, because that\u2019s their basic philosophical output. They\u2019re trying to race into a better future as quickly as possible.\n\nAnd as part of that optimism, they\u2019re optimistic that government can do things that work where certainly on the right there\u2019s deep, deep pessimism on the ability of government to do much of anything.\n\nYeah, but the internet was created by a government lab. Much of Silicon Valley is based on government funding, whether it be basic research or education or outreach for free trade the internet requires pretty substantial government involvement.\n\nBut yet there are certainly parts of the Democratic Party that don\u2019t seem to fit very well: regulation, teachers\u2019 unions. Quite a bit in the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t seem to very forward looking, with a lot of economic nostalgia for the 1960s. But are the people in Silicon Valley who like Bernie Sanders, are they not like the founders, but they\u2019re the 23 year olds who work for the founders?\n\nThere\u2019s actually not a lot of support for Bernie Sanders in Silicon Valley, and Bernie Sanders does represent the old Democratic Party, the old populist Democratic Party. Hillary Clinton represents a little bit more of what are actually called the new Democrats, which her husband coined in the 90s, which tend to be this more Silicon Valley business-friendly liberal, although she\u2019s a pretty mild version of it. Michael Bloomberg was a much purer version. And Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t have a lot of fans out here. I did a poll of internet founders and found that Clinton was actually the most popular and Bernie Sanders was a distant second.\n\nBut what about the employees between the ages of 23 and 35, or something like that?\n\nSame thing; you go through Open Secrets right now and you look at donations of Google versus Facebook versus Apple and you type in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, and Clinton has way, way more donations.\n\nSo even on the employee level \u2014 people who aren\u2019t wealthy, who still probably have college loans to pay off \u2014 that isn\u2019t a hot bed of Bernie Sanders love in Silicon Valley.\n\nOh no, and even more fascinating, what I found was when I began to poll the entire spectrum of tech employs, I also found that gig economy workers \u2014 that is like Uber drivers \u2014 were much more pro-Hillary Clinton and high skilled immigrant than people who were in labor unions. So if you want to think of what the Silicon Valley demographic is, it\u2019s not just tech people \u2014 it\u2019s tech people plus people who are self-employed, the creative class, and anyone with a generally entrepreneurial or high skilled job, because all of that spectrum needs an entirely different role for government, regulation doesn\u2019t help them, neither do unions.\n\nI\u2019m looking at your e-book right now, and you list policy positions tech founders reject, for instance, the Keystone Pipeline because they\u2019re very worried about the environment, while they like the Obamacare healthcare mandate. They don\u2019t like unions, and they like free trade. If those are your positions, that seems like a movement without a party.\n\nSo they are a new thing and they\u2019re struggling to get into either party.\n\nIt is, which is why they\u2019re struggling. Which is why one billionaire investor said that he would shut down his entire operation if Mike Bloomberg were to run for president, and campaign for him. So they are a new thing and they\u2019re struggling to get into either party, although they\u2019re having quite a bit of success within the Democratic Party on a number of issues. Like high skilled immigration and charter schools, both of which the Obama administration supported. But you\u2019re right, they\u2019re a bit nomadic.\n\nHow much is being more culturally liberal a factor that overwhelms their economic perspective?\n\nWell, so there\u2019s two things. So one is, I can\u2019t stress this enough, they are not fans of libertarians. Libertarians have threatened to cut funding for economic studies, basic research in the sciences, education. These things are absolutely crucial to emerging industries and governments roll in it.\n\nHow did Rand Paul do out there when he visited?\n\nOh, I have a wonderful video of him, I\u2019ve shown it all over the internet much to his chagrin. Rand Paul did terrible. It\u2019s one of my favorite videos ever: Rand Paul getting up right after he announced and was running high on his top status. And he got up in front of a whole bunch of tech people and said, \u201cWho\u2019s a part of the \u201cLeave-me-alone\u201d coalition?\u201d And no one clapped. It was so awkward that he actually had to say something. I found crucial to what is distinct between libertarians and valley folk that Silicon Valley\u2019s ideology is pro-market but it is not pro-liberty. Liberty is not a value. They are highly, highly, collectivist. They believe that every single person has a positive obligation to society and the government can help people or coerce people or incentive into making a unique contribution.\n\nI just did a podcast with Kevin Kelly about his new book, \u201cThe Inevitable,\u201dand the big technological trends over the next generation, and he talked about something that he called digital socialism but what he meant was more collaboration. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at when you talk about how the Silicon Valley folks are pro-market, but they don\u2019t believe in atomistic individualism.\n\nYeah, and to give your readers a little flavor of how they differ from Democrats, equality is also not a value. So if you look at traditional Democrats, most of what they do on social justice or whatever is they try to make people more equal and give them stable lives.\n\nLiberty is not a value. They are highly, highly, collectivist\u2026 equality is also not a value. Silicon Valley is all about inequity and unpredictability.\n\nSilicon Valley is all about inequity and unpredictability. They really believe that some people are much more productive or inventive than others. One of the ways in which this manifests itself is performance based funding, where they will encourage competition among schools and will give some schools more money than other. Labor unions hate it.\n\nSo one of the tensions is that we have is between folks out there who are Democrats, who really believe in education and they believe in competition and meritocracy and charter schools. Yet one of the most powerful forces within today\u2019s Democratic Party are teachers\u2019 unions. Huge natural tension.\n\nLabor unions and Silicon Valley fight head to head on almost every single issue they care about. It is fascinating to watch literally every single emerging issue that comes up, whether it\u2019s housing and construction costs or teachers\u2019 unions and charter schools. It is civil war on every issue that tech cares about and is becoming more concerned with.\n\nAnd yet, despite that, teachers\u2019 unions aren\u2019t going away, public sector unions aren\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\nWell, kind of.\n\nYou think they are going away?\n\nSilicon Valley is literally creating the tools that wipe them off the face of the earth, whether it\u2019s through automation of manufacturing jobs or the rise of the gig economy which isn\u2019t unionized.\n\nBut do you see teachers unions becoming significantly less powerful force over the next, I don\u2019t know 15, 20 years?\n\nTeachers unions are a little strange. Silicon Valley has had a hard time disrupting education because it\u2019s so heavily regulated. Potentially with the rise of for profit vocational startups like Udacity and Coursera \u2014 what they do is that they\u2019re taught by actual businessmen. Someone from Facebook will teach you programming. These folks are not unionized, and they\u2019re just starting to qualify for federal funding, so you\u2019re starting to see nonunionized teachers creep into the educational establishment.\n\nThe Democratic Party seems obsessed by income inequality. Again, it seems like a strange fit that Silicon Valley, with this amazing amount of wealth being generated, likes a party which seems to have a problem with that kind of money, when it adds value to society. Is this an issue with the founders? Does this shake their allegiance to the Democratic Party?\n\nSilicon Valley is literally creating the tools that wipe [unions] off the face of the earth.I always find that kind of interesting, especially from folks who come from the Republican Party, where libertarians have teamed up with another political group that literally wants to tell people who to have sex with. Parties by their nature tend to team up between groups that really don\u2019t like each other very much, and in some cases vehemently disagree.\n\nbut Democrats tend to be more a collection of interest groups. Republicans too, but they\u2019ve tended to be more coherent ideologically.\n\nI have no idea what the Republican Party is going to be, maybe wandering in the desert for a long time. If any of you want to crash on my couch in San Francisco, you\u2019re welcome to\u2014all of you.\n\nI know there are Republicans who want more support from Silicon Valley, but now the presumptive nominee is someone I think who wants to break up Amazon, or sue Amazon, wants Apple to bring their jobs back to the United States\u2026 It feels like any progress that GOPers have made being more tech friendly has evaporated.\n\nI would say that\u2019s a diplomatic way of describing it. They think you guys are crazy. The night that Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee, many here just went to Twitter and started pledging their support for Hillary Clinton. It was just a wave.\n\nWere there any Republicans running this time around who could have attracted a larger amount of tech support than did Mitt Romney or John McCain eight years ago?\n\nThey didn\u2019t really like Ted Cruz. Marco Rubio got a decent amount of donations because he was like a mild technocrat who was okay with government and was mostly anti-regulation, which is as close an analog to Hilary Clinton as there is on the Republican side. So they would have liked some of the establishment candidates.\n\nAre the Republicans just dead out there for a generation now? Anything the Republicans can do to break through?\n\nBeyond the Trump thing, which seems to be ever present, I would say don\u2019t play to people\u2019s individuality; the whole \u201cleave me alone, get government out of my way\u201d shtick just doesn\u2019t play well here. When you start talking about the free market, and how government can be a friend to the free market by getting out of the way but also helping a bit, that\u2019s something completely within Republican principles. Decentralization of the welfare state, decentralization of anything, running government like a business, these are all things that are within the Republican philosophy and play well out here.\n\nWhen you start talking about the free market\u2026 that\u2019s something completely within Republican principles.\n\nRecently, one of the guys who started Politico, whose name is just escaping me, he wrote a long essay about the state of American politics, and he suggested his own ticket of Mark Zuckerberg and David Petraeus as a third party. Is there any talk of creating some kind of party, since maybe the Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t really fit perfectly into either party? Creating some third party which may be a neater fit with some of the issues that you talked about?\n\nNot a month goes by where someone doesn\u2019t say maybe we should just create our own party. There are just some realities that don\u2019t allow it to happen, because America is a first-past-the-post voting system, not a proportional system, so you pretty much always get two parties out of that. That\u2019s why no one takes it seriously.\n\nIt seems to me that Silicon Valley is trying to get involved in policy, talking about issues which aren\u2019t necessarily tech issues \u2014 like housing or creating universal basic income \u2014 so let\u2019s talk a little about the housing issue.\n\nIf anyone wants to make best friends immediately with Silicon Valley, say you\u2019re going to fix housing. It is a crisis out here; we\u2019re talking about median rents over $4,000, people are getting evicted left and right, and it\u2019s because the super-left progressive wing in San Francisco has basically made it impossible to build anything but single family homes, and it can take years to get anything approved. It is a regulation jungle.\n\nIt can take years to get anything approved. It is a regulation jungle.\n\nCan I get out there, say a house for $240,000, or an apartment for let\u2019s say $1,200 bucks a month?\n\nDo you ever get packages from Amazon?\n\nYes, on occasion I do.\n\nYou would get a larger package from Amazon.\n\nGood, that\u2019s about what I thought. Cozy.\n\nSo, there was a sign in SF that advertised houses for sale in the low millions, you pretty much cannot afford a home unless you\u2019re making $300,000 a year here. There are micro-apartments, these are like 150 square feet, going for $1500 a month.\n\nThese issues do spread; there are plenty of other cities that have very high housing costs, and that\u2019s bad for US productivity.\n\nHousing, actually, should probably be regulated at the national level. There is some jurisdiction to do it; actually HUD does it under the Obama administration. What they did is they started penalizing groups for not allowing more dense developments, which they say basically excludes minorities. So, yeah, housing could be a national issue and the Valley really, really wants it to. Everywhere they set up a tech hub, whether it\u2019s Austin or New York, or L.A., they bring a wave of new workers, and all of the NIMBYs, the people who don\u2019t want new housing, block them from creating homes.\n\nLet me ask you a question from Twitter from Richard Reeves over at Brookings. He writes, \u201dIs there support for basic income, the idea that everybody would get a check from the government that might replace all the other welfare programs, is there support for basic incomes based on guilt about the job loss potential of technology?\u201d\n\nWhat they want to do is they basically want everyone to live like they lived in college, where you get to play all day long, discover new things, you don\u2019t have to work much, maybe you have a part time job and you just get to chill. The working phrase for this is automated luxury communism. And the way for automated luxury communism to work, and this is a real thing that could be happening within our lifetimes, is that robots replace most work and you just get a check from the government every month that allows you to spend as you want. And it comes from a very, very high tax on the relatively few workers who do have economic value.\n\nIs it more fear that without this kind of broad redistribution policy, the alternative is Ludditism, ridiculous taxes, regulation?\n\nNo, I think what I described is, if you want to understand Silicon Valley, always think in the most radically optimistic terms possible. Your question discloses you live in D.C., and you\u2019re like, \u201cAre they doing this to stave off some political revolution or political backlash?\u201d That\u2019s part of it, but really it is a vision in which people don\u2019t have to work, that is what they\u2019re going for. They want to create that world. And basic income is a necessary step.\n\nA vision in which people don\u2019t have to work, that is what they\u2019re going for.\n\nAt AEI, we like the idea of work, something to do, contributing. But it sounds like what you\u2019re talking about is not that. Maybe you\u2019ll do something or maybe you\u2019ll float around in virtual reality all day. At least from my perspective, that doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re flourishing as a human being, as opposed to contributing in some way to society.\n\nYeah, no, it\u2019s a really important question and it\u2019s not just like sci-fi philosophy, this is actually happening to people right now. The labor force participation rate, the total labor force participation rate, has been dropping, and the amount of leisure time that the average American has been going up. If you look at what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re lounging around, sleeping in and watching TV. And so in some cases Silicon Valley got what it asked for, but it didn\u2019t give people something to do. We thought they would educate themselves and watch National Geographic and read Shakespeare, but they\u2019re not doing it\u2014it\u2019s a real problem.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t have an answer for that yet.\n\nBelieving that information alone can be a solution is a distinct ideology.\n\nNo, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. I love playing video games but you\u2019re right, people need to be productive; they need to feel like they\u2019re contributing. It\u2019s a discussion we need to start having right now because a lot of people are just never returning to the workforce, we don\u2019t need them to work\u2026 so what do they do?\n\nOne last question: At some point does the idea of a technology political ideology disappear because all companies are technology companies?\n\nNo. And the answer comes from Mark Zuckerberg. When the Atlantic\u2019s James Bennet asked Zuckerberg what his political ideology was, \u201care you a conservative or a Democrat\u201d, he said, no I\u2019m pro-knowledge economy. And the knowledge economy is a distinctly different beast. Boeing and the other things are also technology companies \u2014 missiles and planes. The act of creating information, and believing that information alone can be a solution is a distinct ideology. Most companies will not be information technology companies, and that is why it will remain a distinct way of life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently a lot has been made of tech\u2019s involvement in politics.
