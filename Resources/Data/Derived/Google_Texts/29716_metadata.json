Nathan Deal is in Las Vegas Sunday to address Republican National Lawyers Association. Left unsaid is whether he will also meet with one of his party\u2019s biggest benefactors, Sheldon Adelson.\n\nHis team won\u2019t confirm or deny whether the governor will huddle with the casino magnate or his representatives while at the conference at the Venetian Hotel, which Adelson owns.\n\nBut his allies have reason to believe that Adelson, who almost single-handedly floated Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, could chip in.\n\nThe billionaire has given tens of millions to pro-Israel groups over the years, and started a free daily newspaper in Israel known for hawkish views.\n\nDeal has meanwhile steadily stepped up his support for Israel, including a June trade mission to the Holy Land and a recent an op-ed he wrote with former U.N. ambassador John Bolton on Georgia\u2019s collaboration with the Israeli government. His office also said last week it was in the process of increasing the state\u2019s investment in Israeli bonds.\n\nBut Deal\u2019s allies privately say that an Adelson boost may hinge more on the governor\u2019s opponent. Democrat Jason Carter is the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, whose outspoken views on Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians have upset many in the Jewish community.\n\nThe elder Carter recently wrote that Hamas, a militant group at the heart of Israel\u2019s monthlong conflict with Gaza, should be recognized as a legitimate \u201cpolitical actor.\u201d His grandson has tried to distance himself from those positions by, among other moves, issuing a white paper that opposes boycotts or divestiture movements against Israel.\n\nWe are told, by the way, that no matter the outcome of this weekend\u2019s events, Deal is still opposed to the expansion of gaming.\n\nThe event is billed as the premiere training for Republican lawyers on election law and Deal is a keynote speaker. Meanwhile, Democrats poke fun at Deal\u2019s appearance at the conference \u2013 which offers attorneys ethics credit for their continuing education requirements \u2013 with this purported \u201cleaked\u201d copy of his speech.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/08/10/nathan-deal-goes-to-vegas-as-rumors-of-sheldon-adelson-meeting-swirl/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/101127_abelson_ap_328.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gov.
