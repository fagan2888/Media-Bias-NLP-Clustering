Infamous former Georgetown Law student and now social justice attorney Sandra Fluke is back in the news thanks to the Supreme Court agreeing to take up a case surrounding the employer contraception mandate in Obamacare. In case you need a reminder, Fluke is the woman who testified before Congress in 2012 about how birth control should be paid for by someone else because it can cost a female student "$3,000 during law school."

Last night on MSNBC, Fluke argued that employers cannot be exempted from the contraception mandate in Obamacare because that would mean they could also opt. out of paying for insurance that covers blood transfusions.

This isn't the first time Fluke has compared contraception to life saving medical procedures that have nothing to do with religious beliefs. She once said that companies opposing the contraception mandate in Obamacare on religious grounds is the same thing as opposing Leukemia coverage.
