Wind made battling a fire difficult out in Peyton Saturday afternoon, but firefighters eventually got the upper hand.

The fire started in a vacant home on Sahara Drive, not far from Falcon Highway and JD Johnson Road in eastern El Paso County. The Ellicott fire chief said the structure was made up of two mobile homes merged together under one tin roof.

A neighbor spotted smoke and flames while driving home and called for help.

“We were actually coming back from Elbert, from a Celtic festival, and as we were coming down Judge Orr, we saw the fire from over there," Alissia Hepperle said. "To be honest with you, we were afraid it was our own house and pulled in here...that was when we noticed what house it was.

"I'm just glad that nobody was in there," Hepperle added.

Chief Nellie Roop told 11 News the wind didn't just making fighting the fire difficult, but there were fears of it spreading.

"It was actually a very big concern, that’s why you see so many vehicles here...our first unit said that the flames were pretty high, they were jumping into the trees and spreading to the grass, so yeah, that was a big concern.”

By the time the flames were extinguished, the house was a total loss. The cause of the fire is still unknown.
