These policies are drawn from his website, statements made at debates and interviews.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nKasich has said it is \u201csilly\u201d to think the United States could round up more than 11 million undocumented immigrants and send them back to their home countries.\n\nWhile he does not support a path to full citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Kasich believes the focus of immigration policies should be keeping families together and creating a path to a legal status for those already in the country who are working and have not committed violent crimes, including establishing a guest worker program.\n\nKasich does believe this should be underpinned by sealing U.S. borders and has said he would support building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTRADE\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a free trader,\u201d Kasich said in a January presidential debate, saying he supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nHe has supported granting the president authority to fast-track trade deals in the past. He has opposed withdrawing from the World Trade Organization.\n\nECONOMY AND TAXES\n\nKasich\u2019s top priority is a balanced budget and he did a national \u201cbalanced budget tour\u201d last year; his presidential campaign events often have a clock with numbers ticking upward, tracking the level of national debt.\n\nKasich has pledged to cut taxes for individuals and families and increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, along with eliminating the estate tax. Kasich would also like to lower taxes and create incentives for those who create jobs, including by lowering the top business tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.\n\nUnder Kasich\u2019s tax plan, the highest individual tax rate would be lowered to 28 percent from 39.6 percent. He has said he would launch a \u201ctop-to-bottom review\u201d of the Internal Revenue Service to eliminate inefficiencies.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY\n\nKasich wants to increase defense spending by $102 billion. He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria and a \u201ccombat coalition\u201d to fight the Islamic State militant group.\n\nHe has said the Syrian refugee crisis is a fundamentally European problem, but the United States should play a role. He believes the United States should \u201cpause\u201d accepting Syrian refugees and that there should be stringent checks.\n\n(Reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kasich is challenging outsiders Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, and U.S.", "title": "Factbox: Increase defense spending, lower individual tax rate.
