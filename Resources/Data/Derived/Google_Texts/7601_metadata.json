Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican, said after Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware kicked off his hearing before the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\n\nThe \u201cNew Columbia Admission Act\u201d would reduce the federal District of Columbia to an enclave that includes the National Mall and White House while the remainder of the city would become the country\u2019s 51st state.\n\nSEE ALSO: D.C. resumes push for statehood\n\nDenizens of the nation\u2019s capital have long fought for statehood or at least some form of meaningful representation in Congress, noting they pay federal taxes and fight in wars on America\u2019s behalf.\n\nMr. Carper said it is important for the latest generation to understand that residents of the nation\u2019s capital have no vote in Congress, so he offered his bill as a stage for testimony from the District\u2019s top leaders and scholars on either side of the issue.\n\nBut Mr. Coburn, the top Republican on the committee, threw cold water on the notion that D.C. residents will enjoy statehood anytime soon.\n\nHe said the hearing could not be taken seriously, citing a lack of federal-agency testimony and dissenting views. And, he said, significant constitutional questions would not be answered.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s here to represent Virginia and Maryland?\u201d he said, noting Maryland ceded land to form the capital centuries ago.\n\nHe also said the capital was designed to be neutral territory, and that several federal agencies should have been called before Congress to describe how D.C. statehood would affect their operations.\n\nForging ahead on his own, Mr. Carper welcomed Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city\u2019s non-voting member of Congress, D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray and Council Chairman Phil Mendelson to testify on his statehood bill.\n\nEach of the officials are Democrats, as are the vast majority of voters in the city. And it is no secret that Republicans will resist any effort to add a pair of senators and a House representative that will surely be a member of the opposing party.\n\nBut Mr. Carper said the conversation about D.C. representation is worthwhile. The city\u2019s residents pay federal taxes and number more than 630,000, he noted.\n\n\u201cMore than both Wyoming and Vermont,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gray, a one-term mayor who lost the Democratic primary earlier this year, was scheduled to testify about the sacrifices his constituents make with no voice in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe District of Columbia is the only place in the United States of America where Americans serve in the military, fight and die in wars, serve on juries and are taxed, without voting representation in either house of Congress,\u201d he said in written testimony. \u201cThat is wrong.\u201d\n\nMr. Gray said foreigners are \u201castounded\u201d when they learn D.C. residents do not enjoy voting rights in Congress.\n\nHe also said the city is prospering and far beyond its woeful state in the 1990s, when a congressionally mandated control board took control of its finances.\n\nAlice Rivlin, chairwoman of that control board, condemned the District\u2019s lack of voting rights as an\u201danomaly and an anachronism.\u201d\n\nRoger Pilon, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, offered the lone dissenting view among the experts. He said the statehood bill would be both unconstitutional and \u201cimpractical,\u201d allowing the District to exert undue influence over the federal enclave it would surround and stripping Congress of its constitutional oversight of the capital.\n\nOver the past two decades, politicians have introduced legislation multiple times that would grant statehood to the District and congressional representation to the city\u2019s residents. Previous attempts have died in committee, and the last time such a bill got a public airing on Capitol Hill was in 1993.\n\n\u2981 Andrea Noble contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Democratic senator held the first congressional hearing on D.C. statehood in 20 years to \"restart the conversation\" about the city's lack of voting representation on Capitol Hill, but the discussion barely got off the ground before a top Republican quickly dismissed the summit as a one-sided look at a measure that's going nowhere.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Democratic senator held the first congressional hearing on D.C. statehood in 20 years to \u201crestart the conversation\u201d about the city\u2019s lack of voting representation on Capitol Hill, but the discussion barely got off the ground before a top Republican quickly dismissed the summit as a one-sided look at a measure that\u2019s going nowhere.", "title": "D.C. statehood hearing seeks \u2018thoughtful solution\u2019 to lack of voting rights", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/15/dc-statehood-hearing-seeks-thoughtful-solution-lac/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/12/13/20111213-201700-pic-927814893.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/12/13/20111213-201700-pic-927814893.jpg", "title": "D.C. statehood hearing seeks \u2018thoughtful solution\u2019 to lack", "description": "A Democratic senator held the first congressional hearing on D.C. statehood in 20 years to \"restart the conversation\" about the city's lack of voting representation on Capitol Hill, but the discussion", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Thomas R Carper, Tom Coburn, Vincent C Gray"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat is wrong.\u201dMr. Gray said foreigners are \u201castounded\u201d when they learn D.C. residents do not enjoy voting rights in Congress.\nBut Mr. Coburn, the top Republican on the committee, threw cold water on the notion that D.C. residents will enjoy statehood anytime soon.\nBut Mr. Carper said the conversation about D.C. representation is worthwhile.\nOver the past two decades, politicians have introduced legislation multiple times that would grant statehood to the District and congressional representation to the city\u2019s residents.\nThe city\u2019s residents pay federal taxes and number more than 630,000, he noted."}
