The one that received the most attention at the time stated that health plans that do not comply with the healthcare law may now remain in force through 2016 (and, in some cases, 2017), sparing Democrats the fury of millions of voters who would otherwise have received insurance cancellation notices just before the November elections.\n\nBuried in that document \u2014 and overlooked by news outlets until now \u2014 is a single paragraph stating that the \u201chardship exemption\u201d the administration extended in December to individuals whose policies had been canceled, originally slated to last through 2014, will now remain available through 2016. What\u2019s more, because the standards for receiving the hardship exemption are so lax, practically anyone can obtain such an exemption.\n\nThe hardship exemption, which allows individuals to escape the clutches of the individual mandate and even purchase low-cost catastrophic coverage that the ACA otherwise restricts to those under age 30, has always been a part of ObamaCare. Originally, however, it was only available to those who had experienced life-altering hardships such as divorce or eviction. Even then, the Journal noted in December, two of the hardship categories, homelessness and domestic violence, \u201cdon\u2019t require any documentation.\u201d\n\nBy December, with millions suddenly uninsured by the ACA and unable to get reinsured through Healthcare.gov, the administration added new categories. The first allows an individual whose policy was canceled to apply for an exemption by submitting \u201ca form attesting that your plan was cancelled and that you \u2018believe that the plan options available in the [ObamaCare] Marketplace in your area are more expensive than your cancelled health insurance policy\u2019 or \u2018you consider other available policies unaffordable,\u2019\u201d writes the Journal. This category at least requires the applicant to include a copy of his insurance cancellation notice, though no evidence that other plans are unaffordable is required.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d continues the paper, \u201cpeople can also qualify for hardships for the unspecified nonreason that \u2018you experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance,\u2019 which only requires \u2018documentation if possible.\u2019 And yet another waiver is available to those who say they are merely unable to afford coverage, regardless of their prior insurance. In a word, these shifting legal benchmarks offer an exemption to everyone who conceivably wants one.\u201d\n\nPut another way, with the extension of the expanded hardship exemption, until 2017 no one in America is required by federal law \u2014 or at least the Obama administration\u2019s unilateral amending of it \u2014 to have health insurance, nor need he pay a fine for not being covered. Thus, the individual mandate has become a \u201cpaper tiger,\u201d in the words of Breitbart.com\u2019s John Sexton. \u201cIf anyone can claim a hardship exemption,\u201d he avers, \u201cthe regulation doesn\u2019t mean much.\u201d\n\nOf particular interest is the fact that the Obama administration, not its opponents, is gutting the individual mandate. After all, the administration has argued that the mandate is absolutely essential to ObamaCare\u2019s success, as indeed it is. With insurers forced to cover those with costly pre-existing conditions at below-market rates, a large number of young and healthy people must be forced to purchase insurance at above-market rates to keep the system afloat. Without the individual mandate, the ACA\u2019s other provisions will \u201cmake matters worse, not better,\u201d Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the Supreme Court in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of the mandate,\u201d wrote New York Post columnist Mark Cunningham, \u201cmeans the administration has quietly given up on making the thing [ObamaCare] work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re left with,\u201d he adds, \u201cis a US health-care system whose engine has been partly disassembled \u2014 and a mechanic who doesn\u2019t know how to make his plan for rebuilding it actually work, even as he insists we\u2019re already better off.\u201d\n\nThe obvious question this raises is why President Barack Obama seems determined to tear down his own signature achievement even as he insists he will veto any bills that would delay or repeal it. \u201cThe answers,\u201d says the Journal, \u201care the implementation fiasco and politics.\u201d\n\nEnrollment in exchange plans is well below the administration\u2019s objectives, and enrollment among the young is even further below projections \u2014 and that\u2019s true even using the administration\u2019s inflated count of enrollees that includes everyone who has selected a plan, not just those who have actually paid for one. Moreover, a recent McKinsey & Co. survey found that few of those enrolling were previously uninsured and that many of those who looked for coverage on the exchange declined to purchase it because it cost too much. \u201cSome substantial share of the people ObamaCare is supposed to help say it is a bad financial value,\u201d remarks the Journal. \u201cYou might even call it a hardship.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper believes the administration \u201cis also trying to pre-empt the inevitable political blowback from the nasty 2015 tax surprise of fining the uninsured for being uninsured, which could help reopen ObamaCare if voters elect a Republican Senate this November.\u201d For that matter, the election of a Republican Senate is more likely if voters are angry about becoming involuntarily uninsured and then being penalized for it. By giving these voters another two years\u2019 breather, the White House is hoping they won\u2019t be motivated to turn out and dump Democrats this fall.\n\nInsurers aren\u2019t exactly happy about yet another delay of a key ObamaCare provision, rightly seeing it as threatening their business model under the healthcare law. If not enough young and healthy people buy insurance, it could lead to a death spiral of skyrocketing premiums and more costly beneficiaries. \u201cOur sources in the insurance industry are worried the regulatory loophole sets a mandate non-enforcement precedent, and they\u2019re probably right,\u201d the Journal reports. \u201cThe longer it is not enforced, the less likely any President will enforce it.\u201d\n\nThe less that ObamaCare is enforced, the better, generally speaking. But removing some parts and not others makes the law even less sustainable than it already was, which could lead to repeal but could also provide the impetus for a fully nationalized, single-payer healthcare system. ObamaCare opponents will need to remind others continually that the ACA, not (for the most part) doctors, hospitals, and insurers, is the cause of their healthcare woes and that the solution is not to treat the symptoms but to excise the underlying disease.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, individual mandate, 2016, hardship exemption, insurance, healthcare, extension", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/17842-white-house-effectively-delays-individual-mandate-through-2016", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/89e2c56767cf16298f22c8b981567819_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration recently extended until 2016 a \"hardship exemption\" from ObamaCare's individual mandate for just about everyone. by Michael Tennant", "title": "White House Effectively Delays Individual Mandate Through 2016"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/89e2c56767cf16298f22c8b981567819_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddde8\"", "article_summary": "Thus, the individual mandate has become a \u201cpaper tiger,\u201d in the words of Breitbart.com\u2019s John Sexton.\nWhat\u2019s more, because the standards for receiving the hardship exemption are so lax, practically anyone can obtain such an exemption.\nWithout the individual mandate, the ACA\u2019s other provisions will \u201cmake matters worse, not better,\u201d Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the Supreme Court in 2012.\nThe Obama administration has effectively \u2014 and quietly \u2014 suspended the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) individual mandate, the linchpin of ObamaCare, through 2016, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\u201cIf anyone can claim a hardship exemption,\u201d he avers, \u201cthe regulation doesn\u2019t mean much.\u201dOf particular interest is the fact that the Obama administration, not its opponents, is gutting the individual mandate."}
