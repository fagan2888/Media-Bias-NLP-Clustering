They claimed they were wrongfully charged 10 percent interest rather than a fluctuating rate determined by the prime rate set by banks.\n\nDepartment of Human Services records dating to 2000 show that more than 26,000 men could be due refunds. If the decision is upheld, a search of paper records that date back to 1993 will be necessary to determine who is owed refunds.\n\nBob Robinson, an attorney for the four men, estimates the state will have to reimburse fathers $130 million or more.\n\nOklahoma Department of Human Services attorney Richard Freeman said in reference to Robinson\u2019s estimate that \u201cIt could be in the millions for sure, potentially. I don\u2019t think it will be that much.\u201d\n\nFreeman also said that the reimbursement funds could come from insurance.\n\nThe agency says the way it computes, assesses and collects interest on child support judgments is proper under Oklahoma law.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, the law was rewritten to make clear that the human services department can charge 10 percent interest on back child support in paternity cases. The new law went into effect on Nov. 1, 2012.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oklahoman, http://www.newsok.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A judge's decision against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in a class-action lawsuit could cost the state millions of dollars if upheld on appeal.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/30/state-could-owe-millions-after-ruling-in-child-sup/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A judge\u2019s decision against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in a class-action lawsuit could cost the state millions of dollars if upheld on appeal.", "title": "State could owe millions after ruling in child support case"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A judge's decision against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in a class-action lawsuit could cost the state millions of dollars if upheld on appeal.", "card": "summary", "title": "State could owe millions after ruling in child support case"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The agency says the way it computes, assesses and collects interest on child support judgments is proper under Oklahoma law.\nOklahoma Department of Human Services attorney Richard Freeman said in reference to Robinson\u2019s estimate that \u201cIt could be in the millions for sure, potentially.\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A judge\u2019s decision against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in a class-action lawsuit could cost the state millions of dollars if upheld on appeal.\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, the law was rewritten to make clear that the human services department can charge 10 percent interest on back child support in paternity cases.\nThe Oklahoman reports (http://bit.ly/1MPlyHQ ) that Oklahoma County District Judge Barbara Swinton ruled that for years the state agency has charged fathers in paternity cases too much in interest for back child support judgments."}
