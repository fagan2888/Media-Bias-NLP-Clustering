Asa Hutchinson\u2019s plan for the future of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program continues to hang in the balance as legislators prepare to convene Wednesday for a session devoted to budget issues.\n\nThe three-fourths hurdle\n\nOne of those budget issues will be an appropriation for the state Medicaid program, including Arkansas Works, Hutchinson\u2019s reconfiguring of the Medicaid expansion program that has been known as the private option. More than 267,000 low-income Arkansans have obtained government-subsidized private health insurance under the private option since it launched in 2013 as an alternative to the expansion of Medicaid rolls envisioned in the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nHutchinson has said that while he opposes the Affordable Care Act, continuing Medicaid expansion is the best path forward for the state. The program is projected to save Arkansas $757 million over the next five years and help rural hospitals stay afloat.\n\nThirty House members and 10 senators, all Republicans, voted against the bill to create Arkansas Works last week. Their objections include concerns about the national costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, philosophical objections to expanding social welfare programs and complaints that the reforms in Arkansas Works, such as referral to voluntary work training for unemployed recipients, will not do enough to encourage recipients to work and ensure that only the truly needy receive benefits.\n\nThe opponents\u2019 votes were not enough to stop the legislation from passing during the special session, but they would be enough to block an appropriation bill. Most appropriation bills in Arkansas require at least a three-fourths majority vote in each chamber for passage, or 75 votes in the 100-member House and 27 votes in the 35-member Senate.\n\nUphill battle for opponents\n\nThe Arkansas Works appropriation is expected to be included in a bill containing the entire Medicaid budget, so defeating the bill would block funding not only to Arkansas Works but also to the traditional Medicaid program as well. Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said last week that opponents hope to present an alternative budget bill that would fund all of Medicaid except Arkansas Works.\n\nCould that approach work? It\u2019s doubtful, according to Senate President Pro Tem Jonathan Dismang, R-Beebe.\n\n\u201cFor the opponents that are against appropriation, it\u2019s an uphill battle in the other direction,\u201d he said, noting that an alternative budget bill also would require at least a three-fourths majority vote.\n\n\u201cAt some point, 75 percent of both chambers are going to have to agree to move forward. At this point, a significant majority \u2026 wants to move one direction; the minority does not,\u201d Dismang said.\n\nHutchinson said the Legislature does not need to vote separately on Arkansas Works during the fiscal session.\n\n\u201cThat vote has been taken,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have voted on Arkansas Works, and it was adopted by a majority of both parties in both chambers.\u201d\n\nHutchinson said that \u201ca minority should not derail the expressed will of the majority\u201d and said he does not want a Washington-style government shutdown \u201cunder my watch.\u201d\n\nHester said he is willing to defund all of Medicaid if that is the only way to stop Arkansas Works, but he said he believes some sort of deal will be reached to avoid that possibility. He also said there is nothing wrong with a minority exerting its power in the appropriations process.\n\n\u201cThe constitution says if we\u2019re going to spend the people\u2019s money, 75 percent need to agree, and we don\u2019t have 75 percent agreeing on spending it that way,\u201d he said.\n\nLet\u2019s make a deal\n\nIt is unclear what kind of deal could prevent an impasse on the issue. Some have suggested the governor could yield on his proposal to let a private company or companies manage parts of the traditional Medicaid program, a proposal that Hutchinson dropped from the agenda for the special session at the last minute because of resistance from some lawmakers.\n\nAsked Friday if he might use the issue of managed care as a bargaining chip, Hutchinson said that \u201cI have a lot of tools in my pocket\u201d but said that is not the way he works.\n\n\u201cI deal pretty straightforward with folks,\u201d he said. \u201cI make the case on its merits. I try to separate the issues.\u201d\n\nYielding on managed care likely would not be much help to Arkansas Works anyway, according to Dismang and House Speaker Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia.\n\n\u201cThose concerned about the federal deficit are the ones I think are more inclined to look in that direction\u201d and support managed care, Gillam said.\n\nRep. Bob Ballinger, R-Hindsville, one of the opponents of Arkansas Works, said that \u201cI\u2019ve been promised there will be no deals offered from the other side, and I have nothing to offer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real thing is going to be, how are you going to deal with this with your constituents?\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral other legislators who oppose Arkansas Works also said they are thinking about their constituents.\n\n\u201cIf you put this before a vote of the Arkansas people, it\u2019d go down in flames. I\u2019ll vote what my people tell me,\u201d said Sen. Terry Rice, R-Waldron.\n\nThe House and Senate will convene at noon Wednesday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDale Ellis contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Despite receiving approval in last week\u2019s special session, Gov.
