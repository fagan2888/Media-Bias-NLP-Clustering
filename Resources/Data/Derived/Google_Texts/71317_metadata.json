And the lawmakers did it without leaving Del. Terry Kilgore\u2019s office.\n\nThey joined Kilgore, a Republican from Gate City, in his annual \u201ctelephone town hall.\u201d Kilgore said almost 3,000 constituents called in from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. as he spoke about his plans for the 2015 General Assembly session and listened to residents\u2019 questions and comments.\n\nAlso on the line were Sen. Charles W. Carrico Sr., R-Galax; Sen. A. Benton Chafin Jr., R-Lebanon; Del. Todd E. Pillion, R-Abingdon; and Del. Jeffrey L. Campbell, R-Marion. A staff member of U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, who represents Southwest Virginia\u2019s 9th Congressional District, also attended.\n\nA key topic was the coal industry. Republicans say the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has declared a \u201cwar on coal\u201d and imposed costly regulations on the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all working hard up here to create jobs and keep our coal miners at work,\u201d Kilgore said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a battle for us with the state fighting the federal regulations that are going into play.\u201d\n\nChafin said the EPA wants \u201cto basically shut down our coal industries.\u201d Southwest Virginia lawmakers are countering with legislation to protect coal production.\n\nFor example, Kilgore is sponsoring House Bill 1879, which would extend Virginia\u2019s coalfield employment enhancement tax credit program until the year 2022. (The tax credit is set to expire in 2017.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to us to keep the coal industries until we can see a change in administration in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Chafin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s critical that we do it because electricity running depends on it; our employment depends on it; and our livelihood depends on.\u201d\n\nKilgore said coal is not the only item on his energy agenda. He is among 14 legislators \u2013 Republican and Democrats \u2013 sponsoring HB 1665, which would provide loans for \u201cclean energy programs.\u201d\n\nKilgore said he also is looking into natural gas and offshore oil. He called himself \u201cone of those guys that\u2019s \u2018all of the above\u2019 \u201d on energy issues.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to make sure that our children have the opportunity to work in coal or in the coal areas or just work in manufacturing?\u201d Kilgore asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all important stuff that we think about every day, and we are trying to fight the administration in Washington.\u201d\n\nBy telephone, one resident asked about programs to teach manufacturing jobs to high school graduates and unemployed miners. Kilgore responded that his office has been working with schools, such as Mountain Empire Community College, on such training programs.\n\nPillion added, \u201cThat\u2019s definitely something that we\u2019re all focusing on. Even the governor\u2019s focusing on workforce development. We\u2019re all making sure that he keeps that in the budget.\u201d\n\nDuring the town hall, residents raised a few other concerns: about improving spotty cellphone service in mountainous areas; about raising the speed limits on some roads; and about when Lee County Hospital might be reopened (Kilgore said he hopes in July).\n\nBesides taking comments and questions, Kilgore polled his constituents on a few issues:\n\nOne involved Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s proposal to reinstate Virginia\u2019s prohibition against buying more than one handgun per month. More than 80 percent of the town hall participants opposed the limit on gun purchases.\n\nKilgore also asked about expanding Medicare, the health coverage program for low-income people, as part of the federal Affordable Care Act. Of the respondents, 56 percent opposed expanding Medicare and 44 percent were OK with the idea.\n\nWritten by: Editor on January 23, 2015.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1452308658361000}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddac4\"", "article_summary": "Delegate holds town hall meeting, without a hallBy Janeal DownsCapital News ServiceRICHMOND \u2013 Several legislators representing Southwest Virginia discussed their plans to help the coal industry and fielded complaints about cellphone service and gun laws at a town hall meeting with thousands of people Tuesday.\nMore than 80 percent of the town hall participants opposed the limit on gun purchases.\nA staff member of U.S. Rep.
