But anamysts say it was mostly meant as a message to militant Sunnis.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for a series of bombings and shootings in Saudi Arabia since Nov. 2014 that have killed more than 50 people, most of them Shi'ites but also more than 15 members of the security forces.\n\nSaudi security officials say the group's supporters inside Saudi Arabia mainly act independently, depending on Islamic State for only limited logistical help and advice, making them harder to detect, but also less capable of attacks on well protected targets.\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) threatened in December to \"shed the blood of the soldiers of Al Saud\" if its members were executed.\n\nAQAP is the Yemen-based wing of the global militant movement and was formed by local jihadists and veterans of al Qaeda's earlier uprising in Saudi Arabia from 2003-06, for participation in which most of those executed on Saturday were convicted.\n\n(Reporting by Ahmed Tolba in Cairo and Yara Bayoumy in Dubai; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Catherine Evans and Andrew Heavens)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The militant group, which has claimed responsibility for attacks in the kingdom and st", "title": "Islamic State threatens to destroy Saudi prisons after executions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/06/Islamic-State-threatens-destroy-Saudi-prisons-after-executions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/saudi-iran_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/06/Islamic-State-threatens-destroy-Saudi-prisons-after-executions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/saudi-iran_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The militant group, which has claimed responsibility for attacks in the kingdom and st", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "An Islamic State supporter killed himself in a car bomb at a checkpoint outside Ha'ir prison near Riyadh in July.\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) threatened in December to \"shed the blood of the soldiers of Al Saud\" if its members were executed.\nSaudi security officials say the group's supporters inside Saudi Arabia mainly act independently, depending on Islamic State for only limited logistical help and advice, making them harder to detect, but also less capable of attacks on well protected targets.\nThe militant group, which has claimed responsibility for attacks in the kingdom and stepped up operations in neighboring Yemen, singled out the al-Ha'ir and Tarfiya prisons where many al Qaeda and Islamic State supporters have been detained.\nWhile Islamic State and al Qaeda are rivals who have condemned each other on ideological grounds, they are both united in enmity towards Saudi Arabia, which has declared them terrorist groups and locked up thousands of their supporters."}
