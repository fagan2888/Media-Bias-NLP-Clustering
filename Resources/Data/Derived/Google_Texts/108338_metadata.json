Her attorney, Michael Waxman of Portland, said Hill-Spotswood is currently on leave from the hospital, and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nMurphy had been violent at Riverview before, the complaint states, and had also threatened several patients and employees over the years, but Hill-Spotswood claims she was never warned specifically about Murphy.\n\nIn a court document filed by Waxman, Hill-Spotswood alleges the attack left her \u201cdisfigured and emotionally damaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis attack by Mr. Murphy could easily have been prevented had DHHS taken reasonable security measures to prevent foreseeable, grave harm to be visited upon its employees, like Ms. Hill-Spotswood,\u201d Waxman wrote. \u201cDHHS\u2019s conduct, in creating a dangerous situation, placing Ms. Hill-Spotswood directly into that dangerous situation, and failing to protect her from the grave danger it created, violates her civil rights and shocks the conscience.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that, at the time of the attack, there was no security on the floor where Hill-Spotswood worked, which housed forensic patients, and that there was no training for handling violent patients.\n\nIn January of this year, a Kennebec County Superior Court judge disagreed with Murphy\u2019s claim that his mental state left him unaccountable for his actions, ruling that it was anger over lost privileges \u2014 not delusion \u2014 that caused him to attack Hill-Spotswood. Murphy was found guilty of three felony assault charges in January of this year.\n\nEfforts to reach spokesmen for the Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office were unsuccessful.\n\nThe assault on Hill-Spotswood triggered new security protocols at Riverview, including the placement of law enforcement officers within the hospital.\n\nA subsequent investigation by the federal government led to the hospital losing its accreditation b ecause of overcrowding, inadequate staff and the use of methods such as handcuffs and Tasers to subdue violent patients.\n\nThe loss of accreditation led to a reduction of $20 million in federal funding, and became a political football through most of the recently concluded legislative session. A supplemental budget approved by the Legislature in April earmarked $900,000 for security at Riverview and Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in Bangor.\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 A mental health worker who was stabbed repeatedly by a patient wielding a pen at Riverview Psychiatric Center last year is suing the Department of Health and Human Services, claiming the state failed to protect her from a man known to be violent.
