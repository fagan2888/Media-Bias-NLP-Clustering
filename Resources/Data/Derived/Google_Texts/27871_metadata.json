After nearly 30 years in the Senate, Reid has established quite a legacy for his efforts in advancing liberal ideology. Here are four of his progressive accomplishments:\n\n1. Health Care\n\nThe Affordable Care Act may be better known as Obamacare, but the law could just as easily have received a Harry Reid nickname as well. The senator made passing the health care bill a top priority and negotiated with politicians on both sides of the aisle to ensure it would have enough votes to pass. According to political analysts, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the legislation was unlikely to pass without Reid\u2019s efforts.\n\nReid himself called the ACA \u201cthe most important thing we\u2019ve done for the country.\u201d Although the Republican Party still threatens to dismantle Obamacare, getting it passed in the first place was the real trick. Now that Americans have had the opportunity to see that expanding access to medical insurance to those who previously could not afford or qualify for it is hardly the evil idea it was rumored to be, Republicans will have a much harder time getting rid of something that\u2019s wound up being fairly popular amongst citizens.\n\n2. Downgrading the Filibuster\n\nWith partisanship running strong in the Senate, Reid grew tired of the incessant filibustering that blocked the legislative body from accomplishing even the most routine of tasks. In order to minimize future obstructions, Reid helmed a controversial decision to change the way presidential appointments and judicial nominees are approved. Now, rather than needing a hard-to-obtain 60 votes to get approved, a simple majority is all it takes.\n\nRepublicans called Reid\u2019s change a \u201cpower grab,\u201d but it\u2019s a rule that they now benefit from since Republicans now have the majority in the Senate. Pointless posturing over appointees just leaves important federal jobs unfilled. It\u2019s a way of reducing the gridlock and saving the filibustering for issues that really matter.\n\n3. Reproductive Issues\u2026 in a Roundabout Way\n\nWhile most Democrats support a woman\u2019s right to choose, Reid actually considers himself \u201cpro-life.\u201d Unlike most politicians who oppose abortion, however, he\u2019s not anti-woman\u2019s reproductive health altogether. It\u2019s crazy when the same people who gripe about abortions also vote to block birth control, sex education and other ideas that would help women avoid having unwanted pregnancies in the first place.\n\nIn 2006, Reid teamed with (then) Senator Hillary Clinton to launch the Prevention First Amendment. The law acknowledged that people on both sides of the abortion debate have deeply held convictions, and called on the government to put forward more money to expand access to family planning programs and emergency contraception\n\nHe may not be pro-choice, but at least Reid is a man who understands that decreasing abortion means starting to eliminate the reasons women have abortions. His 92 percent approval rating from Planned Parenthood proves that a politician can have personal objections to abortions and still not be a jerk when it comes to reproductive health.\n\n4. Environment\n\nWhen it comes to the environment, Reid has never waivered, earning a perfect score from the League of Conservation Voters. He may not be the most vocal politician on this issue, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from always doing the right thing.\n\nReid\u2019s office includes three energy/environmental staffers so that he can help safeguard the EPA\u2019s powers. He\u2019s voted to close coal plants, protect public lands, maintain clean water, slow the effects of climate change, and even give extra consideration to endangered species. The planet will miss having his consistent vote, un-swayed by private interests.\n\nPhoto Credit: Korean Resource Center", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Senate Minority Leader announces his retirement take a look back at the liberal legacy he leaves behind", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3136/3135689.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "harry reid,senate,senator,politics,dc,environment,health care,affordable care act", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9db1\"", "article_summary": "After nearly 30 years in the Senate, Reid has established quite a legacy for his efforts in advancing liberal ideology.\nDemocrat Harry Reid, the current Senate Minority Leader, has announced he will not seek re-election when his term expires in 2016.\nDowngrading the FilibusterWith partisanship running strong in the Senate, Reid grew tired of the incessant filibustering that blocked the legislative body from accomplishing even the most routine of tasks.\nAccording to political analysts, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the legislation was unlikely to pass without Reid\u2019s efforts.\nRepublicans called Reid\u2019s change a \u201cpower grab,\u201d but it\u2019s a rule that they now benefit from since Republicans now have the majority in the Senate."}
