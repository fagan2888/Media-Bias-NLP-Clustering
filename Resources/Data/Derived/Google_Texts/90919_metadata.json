Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.\u201d\n\nHebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011.

We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.\u201d\n\nAs part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision.
