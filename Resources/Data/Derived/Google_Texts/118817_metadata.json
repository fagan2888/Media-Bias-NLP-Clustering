Our mail is delivered in one of those neighborhood delivery boxes which require a key to access so I don't think it is a case of stolen mail. Has the post office instituted a reduced delivery schedule? \u2014 Wondering If The Check Is In The Mail\n\nDear Wondering: No, the Postal Service has not instituted a reduced delivery schedule.\n\n\"We deliver six days a week, with the exception of some very, very rural addresses,\" David Rupert, the USPS spokesman for Colorado, told me in an email.\n\n\"The mail delivery should be more even,\" he said. \"It is true that some days are very heavy (Monday) and others are exceptionally light (Tuesday), but that's the normal ebb and flow of mail.\"\n\nWondering, if there really is a check in the mail, contact the issuer.\n\nIf you have concerns about your mail delivery, though, call the USPS customer service line at 1-800-275-8777, or go to https://www.usps.com/help/welcome.htm. Rupert said that knowing your address will help the USPS track down the problem.\n\nSend questions to johnnie@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29312843/johnnie-st-vrain-blizzards-droughts-mail", "modificationDate": "2016-01-05T18:16:49-0700", "sailthru.section": "Johnnie St. Vrain", "endDate": "2025-12-26T10:00:57-0700", "description": "Dear Johnnie: It seems like mail delivery to our address has become hit or miss with frequent days of no items whatsoever, followed the next day by a comparative blizzard of mail.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29312843:view"}, "startDate": "2015-12-27T11:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29312843/johnnie-st-vrain-blizzards-droughts-mail", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Dear Johnnie: It seems like mail delivery to our address has become hit or miss with frequent days of no items whatsoever, followed the next day by a comparative blizzard of mail.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Blizzards, droughts of mail"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Dear Johnnie: It seems like mail delivery to our address has become hit or miss with frequent days of no items whatsoever, followed the next day by a comparative blizzard of mail.", "title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Blizzards, droughts of mail", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/columnists/johnnie-st-vrain/ci_29312843/johnnie-st-vrain-blizzards-droughts-mail", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-27T11:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Johnnie St. Vrain: Blizzards, droughts of mail", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-12-26T10:06:31-0700"}, "article_summary": "Dear Johnnie: It seems like mail delivery to our address has become hit or miss with frequent days of no items whatsoever, followed the next day by a comparative blizzard of mail.\nIf you have concerns about your mail delivery, though, call the USPS customer service line at 1-800-275-8777, or go to https://www.usps.com/help/welcome.htm.\n\"The mail delivery should be more even,\" he said.\n\u2014 Wondering If The Check Is In The MailDear Wondering: No, the Postal Service has not instituted a reduced delivery schedule.\nHas the post office instituted a reduced delivery schedule?"}
