It would force companies to deliberately weaken the security of their products by providing backdoors into the devices and services that everyone relies on. Senators Burr and Feinstein should abandon their efforts to create a government backdoor,\u201d Singh Guliani stated.\n\nMasnick added, \u201cThis bill makes effective cybersecurity illegal,\u201d referring to encryption allowing the \u201cbuilding [of] systems as secure as possible to protect people from malicious attacks.\u201d\n\nWired cited numerous technology experts who denounced the bills\u2019 implications, such as Kevin Bankston, the director of the New America Foundation\u2019s Open Technology Institute, who said: \u201cI gotta say in my nearly 20 years of work in tech policy this is easily the most ludicrous, dangerous, technically illiterate proposal I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Wired\u2018s reporting adds:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s app store, Google\u2019s play store, any platform for software applications somehow has to vet every app to ensure they have backdoored or little enough security to comply,\u201d says Bankston. That means, he says, that this would \u201cseem to also be a massive internet censorship bill.\u201d\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, also a member of the intelligence committee, responded to the draft on Friday, stating that it \u201cwould definitely require [companies] to build a back door.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time in America, companies who want to provide their customers with stronger security would not have that choice\u2014they would be required to decide how to weaken their products to make you less safe,\u201d his statement continued.\n\nOther commentators charge that the document reveals a total absence of technological savvy on the part of the senators:\n\nYou people beating up Burr/DiFi's Cuckoo Bill are missing the bright spot. Now we have PROOF our Intel Oversight run by blithering idiots. \u2014 emptywheel (@emptywheel) April 8, 2016\n\nActor and writer Will Wheaton also curated tweets under the title \u201cFeinstein-Burr\u2019s anti-crypto bill is a technologically illiterate disaster,\u201d which you can see here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty disturbing that these two particularly clueless people happen to be the highest ranking members on the Senate Intelligence Committee,\u201d Masnick added, while Bankston told Wired, \u201cIf this is the level of nuance and understanding with which are policymakers are viewing technical issues we\u2019re in a profoundly worrisome place.\u201d\n\nBurr and Feinstein said in a statement Friday, \u201cWe\u2019re still in the process of soliciting input from stakeholders and hope to have final language ready soon,\u201d according to the WSJ.\n\nReuters reported Thursday that the \u201cWhite House is declining to offer public support\u201d for Feinstein and Burr\u2019s legislation.\n\nAs the draft encryption bill makes waves, the Justice Department on Friday is continuing its push to get \u201cApple to unlock a drug dealer\u2019s device even after the man pleaded guilty,\u201d theGuardian reports.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, prosecutors wrote: \u201cThe government\u2019s application is not moot, and the government continues to require Apple\u2019s assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This bill makes effective cybersecurity illegal.\" , cybersecurity, encrypted data, encryption,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Andrea Germanos | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\"This bill makes effective cybersecurity illegal.\" , cybersecurity, encrypted data, encryption,", "title": "Leaked Encryption Draft Bill 'Ignores Economic, Security, And Technical Reality'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/leaked-encryption-draft-bill-ignores-economic-security-technical-reality/215492/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CC-e1455721912212.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-08T20:38:39-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"This bill makes effective cybersecurity illegal.\" , cybersecurity, encrypted data, encryption,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/AP_693252440964.jpg", "title": "Leaked Encryption Draft Bill 'Ignores Economic, Security, And Technical Reality'", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "encryption", "published_time": "2016-04-09T05:00:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-08T20:38:39-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b3b\"", "article_summary": "Leaked Encryption Draft Bill \u2018Ignores Economic, Security, And Technical Reality\u2019\"This bill makes effective cybersecurity illegal.\"\n\u201cInstead of heeding the warnings of experts, the senators have written a bill that ignores economic, security, and technical reality.\nAs the draft encryption bill makes waves, the Justice Department on Friday is continuing its push to get \u201cApple to unlock a drug dealer\u2019s device even after the man pleaded guilty,\u201d theGuardian reports.\nA draft of a proposed bill mandating companies give, under a court order, the government access to encrypted data is being derided by technology experts as \u201cludicrous,\u201d as it \u201cignores technical reality\u201d and threatens everyone\u2019s security.\nThe Hill reports that it obtained a discussion draft of the legislation, and others have posted the purported 9-page draft online."}
