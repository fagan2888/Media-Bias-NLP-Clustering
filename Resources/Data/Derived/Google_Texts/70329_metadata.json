Apparently, the group fears it will be \u201cparticularly harmful and disruptive\u201d to businesses.\n\nThe Caller reports that the letter was sent March 12 by Democrat Senators Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp, Chris Coons, Joe Manchin, Joe Donnelly and Jon Tester, and independent Sen. Angus King. They asked for a two-year deferment:\n\nUnder the law, employers with 51 to 100 employees will be included in the ACA\u2019s definition of small group market starting in 2016. Instead of providing stability, we believe expanding the definition will force those historically defined \u2018large group plans\u2019 into the \u2018small group market,\u2019 where they could experience higher premiums, less flexibility, and new barriers to coverage. We therefore encourage you to delay the effective date in the definition change for two years so the market can more smoothly transition to the new rules.\n\nMcCaskill, Heidkamp, Donnelly, and Tester are up for reelection in 2018. Coons, King, and Manchin face reelection in 2016.\n\nAs CNBC reports, in 2014 HHS granted an exemption for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees from having to pay the penalty for failing to provide health insurance to employees. The penalties for business would be $2,000 to $3,000 per employee.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that on the fourth anniversary of the bill\u2019s passage, HHS gave waivers to individuals who would be hit with a penalty if they didn\u2019t buy the government mandated health insurance:\n\n(The) Administration quietly excused millions of people from the requirement to purchase health insurance or else pay a tax penalty.\n\nThis is on top of the other big waiver the year before, which the Journal reports was another way to put off pain from the law:\n\nIn 2013, HHS decided that ObamaCare\u2019s wave of policy terminations qualified as a \u201chardship\u201d that entitled people to a special type of coverage designed for people under age 30 or a mandate exemption. HHS originally defined and reserved hardship exemptions for the truly down and out such as battered women, the evicted and bankrupts.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that more than 1,200 companies got an HHS waiver to for the first year. As the Daily Caller reported at the time, nearly 20% of the companies were found in then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Congressional District.\n\nCongress declared itself a small business in order to buy insurance policies and allow its staffers to receive ObamaCare subsidies.\n\nAccording to The Washington Times, a judge ruled last month that it was legal for Congress to exempt itself from regular ObamaCare exchanges:\n\nThe administration issued regulations in 2013 that designated the D.C. small business exchange, or \u201cSHOP,\u201d as the go-to exchange for congressional lawmakers and staff who wanted to retain a federal employer subsidy that covers about three-quarters of their premiums.\n\nThe Hill reports that President Obama has encouraged lawmakers to stop trying to repeal the law and \u201cembrace reality.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"post_id": 280538, "description": "The President has encouraged lawmakers to stop trying to repeal the law and \"embrace reality\"...", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "The President has encouraged lawmakers to stop trying to repeal the law and \"embrace reality\"...", "title": "Democrats Ask for Another ObamaCare Reprieve, Warning It Is 'Harmful and Disruptive' to Businesses", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamacare-signature-e1427328289426.jpg", "height": 428}, "updated_time": "2015-03-26T12:55:26-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/280538-democrats-beg-another-obamacare-reprieve-warning-harmful-disruptive-business/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The President has encouraged lawmakers to stop trying to repeal the law and \"embrace reality\"...", "title": "Democrats Ask for Another ObamaCare Reprieve, Warning It Is 'Harmful and Disruptive' to Businesses", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamacare-signature-e1427328289426.jpg", "creator": "@injo", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Victoria Taft", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-26T10:01:06-04:00", "wp-categories": "14075 14087 482 1471", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "published_at": "2015-03-26T10:01:06+00:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/280538-democrats-beg-another-obamacare-reprieve-warning-harmful-disruptive-business/", "wp-category-slugs": "economy-business, health, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Economy", "published_time": "2015-03-26T10:01:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T12:55:26-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamacare-signature-e1427328289426.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2ff\"", "article_summary": "Apparently, the group fears it will be \u201cparticularly harmful and disruptive\u201d to businesses.\nThey asked for a two-year deferment:Under the law, employers with 51 to 100 employees will be included in the ACA\u2019s definition of small group market starting in 2016.\nCongress declared itself a small business in order to buy insurance policies and allow its staffers to receive ObamaCare subsidies.\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The Daily Caller reports Senate Democrats sent a letter to the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department asking for a reprieve from ObamaCare for small businesses scheduled to be brought under its regulatory umbrella in 2016.\nInstead of providing stability, we believe expanding the definition will force those historically defined \u2018large group plans\u2019 into the \u2018small group market,\u2019 where they could experience higher premiums, less flexibility, and new barriers to coverage."}
