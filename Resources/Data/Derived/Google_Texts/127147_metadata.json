(Staff contributor Bonnie Delaney)\n\nA dozen environmentalists and northern New Jersey residents picketed outside of Island Beach State Park on Sunday in a fight to have material they say originated from superstorm Sandy-damaged homes removed from a Roxbury-based landfill.\n\nTheir signs demanded action on the part of Gov. Chris Christie and the state Department of Environmental Protection, calling for the removal of material from the former Fenimore landfill in Roxbury, Morris County.\n\nBut Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the material is not connected to clean-up from Sandy.\n\n\u201cWe did not direct Sandy material to go up there,\u201d Ragonese said.\n\nBoth sides agree that the Fenimore landfill is emitting hydrogen sulfide gas, which results from the breakdown of gypsum board used to build walls in homes.\n\nHydrogen sulfide is flammable and smells of rotten eggs. It is a byproduct of natural processes in salt marshes, swamps and sulfur springs as well as industrial processes like paper mills and solid waste landfills, according to a fact sheet on the Fenimore landfill released by the state Department of Health.\n\nAt 30 parts per billion, hydrogen sulfide causes irritation to the eyes, nose and throat and can trigger breathing problems in people with sensitive airways, according to the department. At 500,000 parts per billion, the gas causes problems with thinking, headaches, poor motor function and sometimes unconsciousness.\n\nNeighborhoods closest to the Roxbury landfill were exposed to as much as 160 parts per billion, and concentrations at the landfill rose to 7,000 parts per billion, according to the Department of Health.\n\n\u201cI have to wear a gas mask in my house,\u201d said Marion Emery, 36, of Roxbury, who suffers from severe asthma. \u201cThe only thing that helps me is being in my room with an air purifier.\u201d\n\nOther protestors who gathered on the barrier island Sunday complained of foul odors that could be smelled for miles, and coughing fits while outside.\n\nBill Morrocco, vice president of REACT, or the Roxbury Environmental Action Coalition, said 400,000 cubic yards of decomposing material was dumped on the Roxbury landfill when a new owner needed to level the site to construct a solar farm. As the material decays and stench fills the community, protesters said children are prevented from playing outside and residents are forced to keep their windows closed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d said Ellen Marshalek, 65, of Roxbury, who joined the Island Beach State Park protest. \u201cI\u2019m worried about losing the value of my home.\n\nRagonese, of the DEP, said the owner of the landfill failed to property seal the landfill, failed to follow an agreement with the DEP, and ended up in a lengthy court battle with the state department. The owner also placed material on the site without DEP approval, he said.\n\nThe DEP is in the process of capping the landfill, which will keep water off the decomposing material and eventually halt the release of hydrogen sulfide, Ragonese said. The capping process should be complete by the end of the year, he said.\n\nIn the meantime, REACT and its supporters have worked to gain attention from Christie with protests across the state. They chose Island Beach State Park on Sunday to draw his attention from the governor\u2019s mansion there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going away,\u201d said Morrocco. \u201cHe destroyed our community\u2026 The material needs to go.\u201d\n\nRagonese said no matter what, the landfill will not be dug up.\n\n\u201cIt would be completely irresponsible to excavate that landfill,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we dug into the landfill \u2026we would unleash a very high level of H2S (hydrogen sulfide) gas throughout the community.\u201d\n\nSuch a release would endanger not just the Roxbury neighbors, but surrounding towns, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not on the table at all,\u201d he said.\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/2014/05/25/protesters-picket-island-beach-roxbury-landfill/9573027/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Environmentalists said material came from Sandy-damaged homes.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Environmentalists said material came from Sandy-damaged homes.", "title": "Protesters picket at Island Beach over Roxbury landfill", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/2014/05/25/protesters-picket-island-beach-roxbury-landfill/9573027/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Environmentalists said material came from Sandy-damaged homes.", "title": "Protesters picket at Island Beach over Roxbury landfill", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ab63d0dff0d636cfbac13f6a8e46c9a71320c21/c=262-0-937-675&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/05/25/roxbury.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/amanda.oglesby.njpress"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Protesters gather Sunday at Island Beach State Park to demand Gov.\n\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d said Ellen Marshalek, 65, of Roxbury, who joined the Island Beach State Park protest.\nThey chose Island Beach State Park on Sunday to draw his attention from the governor\u2019s mansion there.\nEnvironmentalists picketed outside of Island Beach State Park on Sunday in a fight to have material they say originated from superstorm Sandy-damaged homes removed from Roxbury-based landfill.\nChrist Christie and the state Department of Environmental Protection remove material from a Roxbury landfill that they say originated in superstorm Sandy-damaged homes."}
