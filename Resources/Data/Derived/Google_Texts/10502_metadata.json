Just 11.5 percent and 12 percent, respectively, lacked coverage in 2014.\n\nMartinez said expanded access to health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces and some states' expansion of Medicaid -- key features of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare -- \"are probably contributing\" to the decline in the ranks of the uninsured.\n\nCoverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act took full effect in 2014, although some states began expanding Medicaid much earlier.\n\nOverall, slightly more than 16 percent of Americans aged 18 to 64 were uninsured in 2014, down from just over 20 percent in 2013, according to a CDC report released last month.\n\nIn addition to gains in insurance coverage, the new CDC report tracked changes in three other measures of health access.\n\nFor example, adults were asked whether they have a usual place to go for medical care. On that measure, Hispanics and whites realized significant year-over-year improvements.\n\n\"We could confidently say that that was an increase\" not due to chance, said Brian Ward, report co-author and a statistician at the NCHS.\n\nBy contrast, there was no significant change in blacks' and Asians' access to a usual place to receive medical care, the study authors found.\n\nCost of care also remained a barrier for many minority groups. The survey found no significant improvements in the percentages of blacks and Asians skipping needed care due to cost. Blacks were most likely not to get needed care, according to the 2014 data.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"In the U.S., 1 in 4 women dies of heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Report finds Hispanic adults saw biggest gains, but they still had more trouble getting medical care", "zone": "homepage/articles", "og": {"url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/07/15/health-care-access-improves-with-expansion-of-obamacare-cdc", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "Report finds Hispanic adults saw biggest gains, but they still had more trouble getting medical care", "title": "Health Care Access Improves With Expansion of 'Obamacare': CDC"}, "twitter": {"title": "Health Care Access Improves With Expansion of 'Obamacare': CDC - US News", "description": "Report finds Hispanic adults saw biggest gains, but they still had more trouble getting medical care", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "keywords": "Collections: Health,HealthDay,government,health,health insurance,Medicaid,Medicare,insurance,race", "published_at": "2015-07-15", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-07-15"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Zbdhnx", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "By contrast, there was no significant change in blacks' and Asians' access to a usual place to receive medical care, the study authors found.\nAnother expert agreed that increased access to health insurance alone isn't enough.\nDespite these gains, Hispanic adults are still more likely than non-Hispanics to have difficulty accessing and using care, the report found.\nIn addition to gains in insurance coverage, the new CDC report tracked changes in three other measures of health access.\nFor example, adults were asked whether they have a usual place to go for medical care."}
