It is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe Democratic party, like a plantation, is made up of poor minorities, while the leaders are old, very rich, liberal white people.\n\nmagine the press digging into Obama\u2019s birth, transcripts & heritage like they are doing Ben Carson \u2013shocking results?\n\nMy 2016 Social Security won't increase because of low COLA. But my monthly Medigap insurance doubled to $380. Thanx Obamacare!\n\nCNN where lies become truth and truth becomes lies and tragedy becomes ratings as they make viewers cry\n\nBen Carson exaggerated about a scholarship; Hillary lied to the families killed in Libya for political reasons. Which is worse?\n\nDespite the media, Republicans have earned 31 governorships, 68 (of 98) state legislative chambers, the House and the Senate.\n\nThe Clintons ....have already found a way to turn the presidency into a global moneymaking opportunity for themselves.\n\nSunday paper had no national political news, nothing on Carson, etc. Get with it!\n\nI propose a new, permanent section of the StarNews called \"National Political News\" - same place in paper every day.\n\nPeat&repeat news and features in Sunday StarNews. Refund?\n\nIt's been awhile, but as a Michigan high schooler I received a Congressional appointment to a Federal Academy, not a 'scholarship'.\n\nGiven all the disgust with Washington by the right, why no discussion of term limits by the candidates and media ?\n\nNotice how old, stodgy, white, entrenched all the Dem. debaters/candidates were? Opposite traits of diverse GOP frontrunners speaks volumes.\n\nWhy is it that you need a license to practice law, get married, and drive a car but you don't need one to have children. Go figure.\n\nDemocrats are great digging up dirt and slime , their media lackeys who wallow in it teach them how it\u2019s done.\n\nSubmit a Buzz\n\nbuzz@starnewsonline.com\n\nFollow The Buzz\n\nStarNewsOnline.com/buz", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editor\u2019s note: Buzzes can be no longer than 20 words.
