The “Right Side Forum,” an hour-long conservative live news and talk show hosted by columnist Armstrong Williams, will explore a goal-minded topic on the next broadcast: “The Epitome of Success.” What does it take to be a successful entrepreneur? There are several in the Washington metropolitan area - but they are rarely seen on live television for more than a few minutes. This week, two area entrepreneurs with national reputations visit the show to talk in depth about what it takes to be successful.

The guests this week are Thomas A. Moorehead, CEO and owner, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Sterling and BMW of Sterling; and Lance London, CEO and owner, Carolina Kitchen.

“This is my second of three shows looking at a variety of ways to be successful, to view success, or to define success. This week, two entrepreneurs who I see as the epitome of success will join me to talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly of being in business,” observes Armstrong.

“I believe personal success can mean a lot for an individual and his or her family, but it can also mean a lot for their community. I’m looking forward to hearing what my guests think about that. I hope you are, too.”

The show, which debuted in January, airs live on Saturday mornings at 10:30 a.m. on News Channel 8 in the Washington, D.C., area, and repeats again at 6:30 p.m.
