RIVERSIDE – A divided Board of Supervisors today approved a $25.85 million contract with a healthcare consulting firm to develop and implement a strategy to prevent Riverside County Regional Medical Center from falling into financial ruin.

On a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Kevin Jeffires dissenting and Supervisor John Benoit on vacation, the board awarded the contract to Huron Consulting Inc.

The Chicago-based firm will devote up to 50 analysts and other experts to identifying a variety of cost-saving measures and long-term goals for bringing the Moreno Valley hospital back into the black financially, according to the contract terms.

Simultaneously, the board approved a $1.2 million contract with veteran healthcare strategist Lowell W. Johnson to serve as RCRMC’s interim chief of operations, putting reforms into effect.

It was the Johnson contract that Jeffries disliked. The supervisor expressed displeasure that the Department of Human Resources revised the contract over the weekend to reflect a mandatory $155,000 contribution that the county will have to make on behalf of Johnson into the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, even though he will be serving in a short-term capacity of less than two years.

The RCRMC has been operating in the red since early last year and is close to accumulating losses at a rate of $1 million a week, according to county officials. RCRMC’s current cash shortage stands at $86 million.

Around three-dozen Huron consultants were brought aboard in May to conduct an audit and reported to the board in September that a number of efficiencies and policy reforms could be put into effect that would close the hospital’s funding gap.

Huron consultants said they have a strategic plan to return the hospital to self-sufficiency and position it for revenue growth, projecting that if initiatives are successfully implemented, RCRMC could end the 2014-15 fiscal year with $70 million in receipts.

Details of the plan were vague. However, county Executive Office officials pointed out that Huron had already identified a pharmacy benefits discount program expected to net the county $8 million to $10 million in savings in the current fiscal year.

During a board hearing on Sept. 10, then-RCRMC Director Doug Bagley explained that the medical center’s shortfall stemmed from county and state actions. The hospital began hemorrhaging funds when the board imposed across- the-board cuts as part of a 2009 general fund deficit control plan, Bagley said.

Further exacerbating the situation is the rising cost of operating an infirmary for a growing number of jail inmates — an expense for which the hospital has not been adequately compensated, according to Bagley.

He said treating patients under the care of the county Department of Mental Health is another largely unreimbursed expense, and it has only gotten worse since realignment legislation was enacted in 2011, making what used to be a state function a county responsibility — without commensurate funding.

Treating uninsured patients who rarely pay their bills has hollowed out the hospital’s appropriations, as well, Bagley said.

According to county Executive Office spokesman Ray Smith, county Department of Purchasing & Fleet Management officials have been working with hospital staff to expedite treatment authorization requests for patients on Medi-Cal so that the county can get paid faster.

The 111-page contract has an exit clause allowing the county to opt out if at any time officials determine that Huron is not meeting expectations.

Executive Office documents note that Huron has a number of past satisfied clients, including UC Irvine, Natividad Medical Center in Monterey and the Salinas Valley Memorial Health Care System. In the case of Natividad, Huron helped turn $25 million in operating losses into $6.6 million in revenue gains, according to the county.

Under the contract with Johnson, he will be paid $450,667 for the remainder of the current fiscal year and $676,000 during 2014-15. The compensation is in line with what hospital CEOs are earning in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the Department of Human Resources.

County officials said Johnson has worked in the healthcare industry for 35 years, serving in executive capacities at more than 30 hospitals and other medical facilities.

”Given his niche skillset, proven track record of hospital transformation and the anticipated financial improvements he will produce, Mr. Johnson’s cost is a prudent investment,” human resources chief Barbara Olivier said.



Supervisors to Scrutinize Proposed $25 Million Contract with Consultants

RIVERSIDE – A healthcare consulting firm hired by Riverside County to find ways of fixing the financially ailing county hospital could be awarded a $25.85 million contract today to stay on the job until the medical center’s fortunes turn.

The Board of Supervisors will debate whether Chicago-based Huron Consulting Inc. should be retained through at least September 2015 to implement a range of reforms aimed at putting the Riverside County Regional Medical Center on secure financial footing.

The Moreno Valley hospital has been operating in the red since early last year and is close to accumulating losses at a rate of $1 million a week, according to county officials. RCRMC’s current cash shortage stands at $86 million, according to the county Executive Office.

Around three-dozen Huron consultants were brought aboard in May to conduct an audit and reported to the board in September that a number of efficiencies and policy reforms could be put into effect that would close the hospital’s funding gap.

In an introduction to the proposed 111-page contract with the county, Huron consultants said they have a strategic plan to return the hospital to self-sufficiency and position it for revenue growth, projecting that if initiatives are successfully implemented, RCRMC could end the 2014-15 fiscal year with $70 million in receipts.

Details of the plan were vague. However, county Executive Office officials pointed out that Huron had already identified a pharmacy benefits discount program expected to net the county $8 million to $10 million in savings in the current fiscal year.

”As part of its effort, Huron expects to bring in about 50 consultants to improve billing procedures, revise operations hospital-wide, establish processes to increase revenue and cut costs, and train hospital staff to maintain the improvements after Huron completes its work,” said county spokesman Ray Smith.

Consulting Firm Expected to Get $25 Million Contract with County

RIVERSIDE – A healthcare consulting firm hired by Riverside County to find ways of fixing the financially ailing county hospital could be awarded a $25.85 million contract Tuesday to stay on the job until the medical center’s fortunes turn. The Board of Supervisors will debate whether Chicago-based Huron Consulting Inc. should be retained through at least September 2015 to implement a range of reforms aimed at putting the Riverside County Regional Medical Center on secure financial footing.

The Moreno Valley hospital has been operating in the red since early last year and is close to accumulating losses at a rate of $1 million a week, according to county officials. By the end of the current fiscal year, RCRMC’s deficit will be around $50 million if the status quo doesn’t change.

Around three-dozen Huron consultants were brought aboard in May to conduct an audit and reported to the board in September that a number of efficiencies and policy reforms could be put into effect that would close the hospital’s funding gap.

In an introduction to the proposed 111-page contract with the county, Huron consultants said they have a strategic plan to return the hospital to self-sufficiency and position it for revenue growth, projecting that if initiatives are successfully implemented, RCRMC could end the 2014-15 fiscal year with $70 million in receipts.

He said treating patients under the care of the county Department of Mental Health is another largely unreimbursed expense, and it has only gotten worse since realignment legislation was enacted in 2011, making what used to be a state function a county responsibility — without commensurate funding.

Treating uninsured patients has eaten into the hospital’s budget, as well, with many indigent patients not paying their bills, Bagley added.

According to Smith, county Department of Purchasing & Fleet Management officials have been working with hospital staff to expedite treatment authorization requests for patients on Medi-Cal so that the county can get paid faster.

The proposed contract has an exit clause allowing the county to opt out if at any time officials determine that Huron is not meeting expectations.
