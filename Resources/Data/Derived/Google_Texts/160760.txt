Orelvis Olivera, a 45-year-old owner of Acclaim Home Health Care in Miami, admitted to running a $6.9 million Medicare fraud in which he and his conspirators billed the government for expensive therapies that patients did not need.

Olivera pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, and he will be sentenced on April 21, according to an announcement from the FBI and the Office of Inspector Generalâ€™s Miami office.

Olivera, in his plea, admitted that he and several accomplices billed Medicare for home health services and physical therapies that were not medically necessary. He also admitted to bribing patient recruiters in exchange for patient referrals, prescriptions and plans of care that included the unnecessary treatments.

The fraud took place from 2008 to 2014, and resulted in Acclaim billing Medicare for $6.9 million. The company received $5.7 in reimbursements.

The Medicare Fraud Strike Force discovered the fraud, which was investigated by the FBI and the OIG. To date, the crackdown has resulted in finding more than 2,100 defendants who collectively billed more than $6.5 billion in false Medicare claims.
