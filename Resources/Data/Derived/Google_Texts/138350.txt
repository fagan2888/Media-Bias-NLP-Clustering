When an automaker like Ford (NYSE:F) introduces a product like the all-new 2015 F-150 pickup to the media, they don't just pull a sheet off the truck and say, "Here it is, guys!"

In fact, last month, Ford took over Joe Louis Arena -- home of the Detroit Red Wings -- to unveil its new pickups with an elaborate, big-budget presentation that kicked off two days of media events at the North American International Auto Show.

We (The Motley Fool's John Rosevear and Rex Moore) were there in Joe Louis Arena when it happened, and we can tell you that it was a very impressive event. Not just because Ford's top executives gave an elaborately choreographed update on the state of the company before revealing the all-new truck (see it here, here, here, here, here, and here), but because the media presence was absolutely massive.

Hundreds of journalists from around the world crowded the arena, and mobbed the stage afterward to get up-close looks at the new trucks. Several key Ford executives stuck around to talk to the media, including Ford Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields -- likely the next CEO of Ford.

Fields' comments to the media were fascinating, and we've captured them in this short video. He explained how the new trucks were expected to actually help Ford's corporate fuel-economy averages, and pointed out some key features that Ford thinks will increase the new pickups' appeal to families. He also gave some insights into Ford's expectations for profitability and spending in 2014.

We tried in this video to give you the flavor of the events following the reveal of the new pickups -- but Fields' comments are also worth a close listen for any Ford shareholder. Take a look, and then scroll down to leave us a comment with your thoughts on the new F-150.
