Adam Baldwin has had enough of Twitter. After the social media platform’s continued censorship of conservatives, the actor decided he’s leaving and never coming back.

“Twitter is dead to me,” Baldwin told the Independent Journal Review. “I’m going to find greener pastures elsewhere and I’m not coming back.”

On Monday, Balwdin, who currently plays XO Mike Slattery in TNT’s “The Last Ship,” deleted his entire Twitter history, except for one:

Hi @Twitter: Fire @jack and disband the 'Trust and Safety' Council.



Here's why: https://t.co/TwHxVGr429 — Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) February 22, 2016

@Jack is the CEO of Twitter and the Trust and Safety Council was created earlier this month as a “foundational part of our strategy to ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter.”

“This group-think, Orwellian, so-called Safety Council is really killing the wild west of ideas that Twitter was,” Baldwin told IJR.

The recent banning of conservative Robert Stacy McCain that prompted Baldwin to call it quits.

“It’s really a shame that so-called ‘liberal thinkers’ and the so called ‘tolerant crowd’ is intolerant of varying viewpoints,” he said, reports IJR. “They’re so afraid to hear people disagree with them. Instead of ignoring it or providing their own arguments in return, they say “shut up!””
