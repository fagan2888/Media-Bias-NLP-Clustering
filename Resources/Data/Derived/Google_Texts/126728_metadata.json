( Ethan Prater/Flickr )\n\nIt\u2019s brunch time at Eggheads, a restaurant on Main Street in Fort Bragg, where portraits of Judy Garland and film stills from the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d cover the walls. Dishes here have names like Auntie Em\u2019s Pancakes, the Red Shoe Scramble and Dorothy\u2019s Revenge.\n\nTo get to the bathroom\u2026\n\n\u201cFollow the yellow brick road, and get to the Emerald City,\u201d says server Kelly Metlin, pointing to a yellow-tiled path through the kitchen.\n\nToday, and for the last six weeks, tables here are set with paper napkins and plastic forks. And $23 crab omelets are served on paper plates.\n\nMetlin says they stashed their dishes and silverware to save water from dishwashing, after the city declared a Stage 3 water emergency.\n\n\u201cAll restaurants are required to reduce their water usage by 30 percent,\u201d she says.\n\nFort Bragg is a small city of 7,000 people along the Mendocino Coast. Roughly half the city\u2019s water supply comes from the nearby Noyo River, says Tom Varga, director of public works.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the fall, the drought drained the river to record lows, allowing the ocean tides to push salt water upstream. It traveled 4 miles to the pump that moves river water into the city\u2019s water system, contaminating the supply with salt water. The city had to shut the system down.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what triggered the emergency,\u201d Varga says.\n\nThe city called for immediate, maximum water conservation efforts, including a requirement that all restaurants trade their china and porcelain for paper and plastic.\n\nThe mandate lasted two weeks.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of input back from restaurants,\u201d Varga says. \u201cWe realized it wouldn\u2019t work out as a one-size-fits-all arrangement.\u201d\n\nManagers at fancier eateries were mainly the ones who complained. The disposable supplies were expensive. And customers got frustrated trying to cut ribeye steaks with plastic knives.\n\n\u201cThey did not dig it at all,\u201d says Ali Green, a server at Cucina Verona. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying that much for a meal, then you\u2019re expecting it to be on something nicer. So, it felt really bar-b-q-y.\u201d\n\nCity officials backed off the mandate last month. Paper plates are now encouraged, rather than required. And a few restaurants have powered through with the paper plan. Eggheads plans to continue as long as the Stage 3 water emergency is in effect.\n\nSome locals have adapted just fine.\n\n\u201cI brought my own coffee cups to the restaurant, things like that,\u201d says Jeff Beard, who works weekends at a framing shop.\n\nIt\u2019s mainly out-of-towners \u201cwho have a hard time coping,\u201d says Kelly Metlin, the server at Eggheads.\n\n\u201cDepending on where they\u2019re from, they\u2019re used to a certain way or a certain lifestyle. So when they come in here, and they see plastic, they request silverware,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t offer that. We took it all out of the house.\u201d\n\nDee Calbraith and Nigel Smith, a British couple visiting from San Francisco, were among the recent diners who asked for \u201cproper cutlery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought it was kind of weird and maybe wasteful,\u201d Calbraith says.\n\nBut when the waitress explained why they couldn\u2019t have the flatware, Smith says they understood, even though he felt like it compromised the experience of the meal.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got to make sacrifices,\u201d he says.\n\nCalbraith nodded.\n\n\u201cI would prefer my tea out of a glass cup,\u201d she says. \u201cBut out of paper is also fine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The city backed off a paper plate mandate after facing complaints - but a few restaurants continue to serve on paper to save water.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Fort Bragg Restaurants Serve on Paper Plates to Conserve Water\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2015\\/11\\/28\\/fort-bragg-restaurants-press-on-with-paper-plates-to-conserve-water\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-28 00:05:51\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-25 18:13:38\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10771862,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Drought\",\"Food\",\"water\",\"water conservation\"],\"categories\":[\"Environment\",\"News\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2015\\/11\\/EggheadsFtBragg.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "The city backed off a paper plate mandate after facing complaints - but a few restaurants continue to serve on paper to save water.", "title": "Fort Bragg Restaurants Serve on Paper Plates to Conserve Water", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/11/28/fort-bragg-restaurants-press-on-with-paper-plates-to-conserve-water/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/11/EggheadsConserve-800x594.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "drought,food,water,water conservation", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It traveled 4 miles to the pump that moves river water into the city\u2019s water system, contaminating the supply with salt water.\nEggheads restaurant in Fort Bragg says it will continue to serve on paper as long as the Stage 3 water emergency is in effect.\nMetlin says they stashed their dishes and silverware to save water from dishwashing, after the city declared a Stage 3 water emergency.\n\u201cWe had a lot of input back from restaurants,\u201d Varga says.\nThe city called for immediate, maximum water conservation efforts, including a requirement that all restaurants trade their china and porcelain for paper and plastic."}
