Scott Walker, Dr. Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina sounded similar notes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAll of us are familiar with campaign conservatives. Candidates who talk a good game on the campaign trail and yet don\u2019t walk the walk,\u201d he said, as a few in the crowd shouted back, \u201cMcConnell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of him,\u201d Cruz responded, a winking reference to the GOP Senate majority leader whom Cruz recently referred to as a liar.\n\nCruz and the three other presidential candidates \u2014 former New York Gov. George Pataki was slated to speak, but did not appear \u2014 pitched their conservative credentials and grinned for selfies on Saturday against the dramatic backdrop of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where they wooed voters in the first state that will vote in the West.\n\nThe event, hosted by Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, was designed to honor Laxalt\u2019s Basque heritage and the shepherding traditions of the group, many of whom emigrated to and settled in northern Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bring as many candidates here, and let every day Republican voters from around the state meet everyone,\u201d said Laxalt, who hasn\u2019t yet endorsed a candidate. When asked whether he would, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nCarson, Walker and Fiorina also tapped into conservative grassroots resentment Saturday \u2014 a palpable sentiment here that also led much positive speculation about Donald Trump among the crowd.\n\n\u201cThe political class has failed you,\u201d said Fiorina to cheers, ticking off issues that \u201ccareer politicians\u201d hadn\u2019t fixed in decades, like border security and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nWalker mocked Washington as \u201c68 square miles surrounded by reality,\u201d where, he said, \u201cin the last few months, we\u2019ve had it with Republican leaders in Washington,\u201d he said, pointing to the GOP leadership\u2019s failure to repeal Obamacare. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to just be angry, you want to do something to fix it for future generations. If that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019m your candidate.\u201d\n\nYet it was Cruz who drew the most energy from a crowd wilting in 93-degree sunshine. After his speech, he jumped off the front of the stage, and greeted voters. Dozens surged toward Cruz to snag a picture, even as Laxalt started to introduce the speaker who followed him, Walker.\n\nCruz and Walker both scheduled evening events for those who couldn\u2019t get into the sold-out fry.\n\n\u201cBefore the debate, I was leaning toward Scott Walker,\u201d said Phil Perine, founder of the grassroots group Siena Conservatives and president of the Nevada Republican Men\u2019s Club. \u201cBut [Cruz\u2019s] performance put me in his camp.\u201d\n\nInterviews with event attendees suggested many were still making up their minds \u2014 they frequently named two or three candidates who\u2019d they gladly see challenging a Democrat in the general election.\n\n\u201cThere are maybe ten candidates, not just the ones who made the primetime debate, who I really like,\u201d said Nancy Brisack, a retiree who volunteers with the Sierra Nevada Republican Women.\n\n\u201cWho am I going to vote for right now?\u201d she said with a laugh, turning to her husband, Phil, who shrugged and said, \u201cask us again in a few months.\u201d\n\nBut few of those interviewed seemed to embrace former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. \u201cI\u2019m concerned he\u2019s not conservative enough,\u201d said Paul Corley, who owns the ranch that hosted the event. \u201cIn fact, a little more than concerned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His anti-establishment message resonates in northern Nevada.", "title": "Cruz connects at 'Basque Fry'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/cruz-connects-at-basque-fry-121398.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/15/081515_cruz_nevada_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Mitch McConnell,Ted Cruz 2016,GOP,Ted Cruz,Nevada", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His anti-establishment message resonates in northern Nevada.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05e6\"", "article_summary": "Cruz connects at 'Basque Fry' The Texas senator\u2019s anti-establishment message resonates in northern Nevada.\nGARDNERVILLE, Nev. \u2014 Four Republican presidential hopefuls gathered Saturday at a picturesque Northern Nevada ranch and pounded anti-establishment themes, but it was Ted Cruz who gave the most convincing performance at the first annual Basque Fry.\nCruz and Walker both scheduled evening events for those who couldn\u2019t get into the sold-out fry.\nDozens surged toward Cruz to snag a picture, even as Laxalt started to introduce the speaker who followed him, Walker.\nThe event, hosted by Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, was designed to honor Laxalt\u2019s Basque heritage and the shepherding traditions of the group, many of whom emigrated to and settled in northern Nevada."}
