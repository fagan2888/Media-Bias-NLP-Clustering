In the past few weeks, she\u2019s been trying to sell off what\u2019s left of Sac-Osage Hospital.\n\n\u201cCasework, lighting, plumping, sinks, toilets. Anything you want,\u201d Smiley says.\n\nThat\u2019s not in her job description. She\u2019s actually the CEO of Sac-Osage, a hospital in Osceola, Mo., that closed in September.\n\n\u201cI have become an auctioneer,\u201d Smiley says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve learned more about asbestos and construction demolition than I ever wanted to know.\u201d\n\nThe small, 45-year-old hospital shut down, Smiley explains, because of diminishing payments from Medicare as well as a heavy load of uninsured patients.\n\nIt\u2019s a scenario more and more hospitals are facing \u2013 one that\u2019s been especially hard on rural hospitals in states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nSuch hospitals are often the biggest employers in rural counties. But unless Medicaid eligibility is expanded to include more low-income people, as the Affordable Care Act envisions, officials at those hospitals say they may be forced to cut jobs \u2013 or even, like Sac-Osage, to close down.\n\nQuid Pro Quo\n\nThe payment reductions that hospitals face came about in large part because of an agreement they made when the Affordable Care Act was crafted.\n\n\u201cIt was a quid-pro-quo deal that the hospitals made,\u201d says Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nHospitals expected to see millions of newly insured customers thanks to federal subsidies enabling people to buy health insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs. In exchange, they agreed to accept reduced Medicare payments and a huge cut in Disproportionate Share Hospital, or DSH, funding, which the federal government pays to offset the costs of uncompensated care.\n\nFederal law requires hospitals to treat all patients in emergency situations, regardless of ability to pay, and many hospitals provide a full range of services without reimbursement.\n\nMcBride says the American Hospital Association offered to forgo more than $100 billion in federal payments.\n\nBut in 2012, when the Supreme Court ruled that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional, it also decided that individual states could not be required to expand their Medicaid programs. Many states, including Missouri and Kansas, chose not to do so.\n\nThat left many rural hospitals in an untenable situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a double-whammy, if you will. We\u2019ve taken a cut in reimbursement and not received any additional patients with any type of coverage,\u201d says Ronald Ott, CEO of Fitzgibbon Hospital in Marshall, Mo.\n\nLast year, two of Missouri\u2019s 74 rural hospitals (including psychiatric, rehabilitation and Veterans hospitals) shut down. Statewide, about 1,800 hospital employees lost their jobs, according to the Missouri Hospital Association.\n\nAll told, Missouri hospitals say they expect to lose nearly $3.5 billion by the end of 2019 because of Affordable Care Act cuts. Similarly, hospitals in neighboring Kansas and Nebraska anticipate major reductions of well over $1 billion each over the coming decade.\n\nTo avoid economic ruin, Missouri hospital leaders say the state needs to expand Medicaid eligibility to include people with incomes below 139 percent of the federal poverty level, as provided by the Affordable Care Act. That would add about 300,000 people to the Medicaid rolls in the state, an increase of nearly 40 percent.\n\nWithout expansion, the Missouri Hospital Association says, the state could lose 5,000 jobs in health care and other fields.\n\nOtt shudders to think about what closing Fitzgibbon Hospital would mean for Marshall. The hospital employs 600 people in the largely rural community.\n\n\u201cIt would be disaster,\u201d he says. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how difficult it would be for the community.\u201d\n\nHolding Fast\n\nBut conservatives in Missouri\u2019s largely pro-business legislature remain unmoved.\n\n\u201cNow the hospitals have brought some of this on themselves,\u201d says Republican Sen. Ed Emery from Lamar, Mo., \u201cA lot of it was what we call in the rural areas \u2018betting on the come\u2019: If you\u2019ll do this, then we\u2019ll promise you this, and those promises were not fulfillable.\u201d\n\nEmery is among the majority of Missouri state senators who have held fast against Medicaid expansion because they say it will cost the state too much money and create too much reliance on government.\n\n\u201cNow they want my constituents and taxpayers to bail them out, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he says.\n\nThe federal government has agreed to pay the entire cost of Medicaid expansion for states through 2016, phasing down eventually to 90 percent.\n\nStudies conducted by the University of Missouri and the Missouri Budget Project show that once the federal funding level drops, expansion would cost hundreds of millions of dollars in state spending. But those costs would be offset or even exceeded by the economic boost provided by the federal funds.\n\nThe 2012 University of Missouri study forecast that the state would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue and create tens of thousands of jobs in the next few years if it approved expansion.\n\nThe principal author of that study, MU professor and health economist Lanis Hicks, says that since the state has missed the first two years of federal expansion funding, the potential tax revenue is somewhat lower now than what her study initially predicted \u2013 though she maintains expansion at this point would still save the state money and produce jobs.\n\nRepublican Sen. David Pearce doesn\u2019t buy it.\n\n\u201cThe thought that, because you have federal dollars that that creates jobs \u2013 at the very end of the day we\u2019re all paying for that,\u201d Pearce says. \u201cAnd so if it\u2019s something you can\u2019t afford, then it\u2019s something you can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nPearce represents the state\u2019s 21st district, where Fitzgibbon Hospital is located. He professes to be concerned about jobs there but insists the overall nature of health care is changing due to changing demographics and consolidation.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, healthcare is extremely expensive, and so to be able to have a hospital in each county probably is not going to be a model we can sustain in the future,\u201d Pearce says.\n\nThe End\n\nIt\u2019s a future that has already come to Osceola.\n\nIn a town of around 900 people, Sac-Osage Hospital employed more than 100. Now, a few months after the hospital closed its doors, that workforce has dwindled to five.\n\nThe remaining employees include Carolyn Bruce and Connie Chapman, who worked at the hospital for a combined 75 years. In recent weeks, they\u2019ve been digitally scanning the hospital\u2019s decades of paper records and preparing the building for demolition on May 1.\n\nSince the hospital closed, a few clinics have helped fill the health care gap, and most of the employees have been able to find work elsewhere. But the town is now without an emergency room or inpatient services. There\u2019s not another full-service hospital for 30 miles in any direction.\n\nAnd of course the town\u2019s largest single employer is no more.\n\nCEO Chris Smiley keeps a stiff upper lip as she talks about the end of the hospital. But after her remaining employees leave for the day, she admits the closure has been difficult.\n\n\u201cThis is my last job, so I see it as a failure,\u201d Smiley says. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I could\u2019ve done anything different. I don\u2019t think I could have saved the hospital. I hope that I have done everything that I could do to minimize the negative impact on my people and on the community.\u201d\n\nAlex Smith is a reporter for KCUR, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.\n\nTodd Feeback (video) is multimedia editor for KCPT television in Kansas City, Mo., a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "If you\u2019re in the market for fluorescent light bulbs, you might talk to Chris Smiley.
