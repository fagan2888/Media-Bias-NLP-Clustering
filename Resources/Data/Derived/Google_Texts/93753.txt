The latest development in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 could be the breakthrough everyone’s waiting for: three “pings,” sounding from deep in the Indian Ocean, that could be signals from the plane’s black boxes.

Australian Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston, who is coordinating the search, couldn’t confirm that the pings were related to the missing airliner, but nonetheless called it “an important and encouraging lead.” Two were detected in a relatively small search area on Friday and Saturday; a third was picked up elsewhere Sunday morning.

“We have an acoustic event,” Houston explained. “The job now is to determine the significance of that event. It does not confirm or deny the presence of the aircraft locator on the bottom of the ocean.”
