Although they estimate Lila may not live past Thanksgiving, her family and the community decided to throw her the most spectacular birthday party any little girl could ask for.\n\nHeidi Hall, Lila\u2019s mother told KOIN 6, a local news channel, that for her daughter\u2019s 5th birthday, they wanted to give her it all \u2014 a birthday, a prom, a Cinderella ball, and a wedding, all wrapped up into one. \u201cEverything she won\u2019t get,\u201d Hall said.\n\nAnd the community truly came through for Lila. Over 1,000 people were expected to attend the party at the Butler Bank Building, many of which did not know the family but came to show their support. People traveled from places like California, Idaho, and Utah to see Lila on her big day, some of whom donated their time and services to the party. Hair stylists from Portland came to Hood River to do Lila and her friend\u2019s hair before the ball, while another out-of-state woman donated a custom-made Cinderella dress for Lila to wear. Every Disney princess character was in attendance, and Lila strolled up to her party in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nWhen Lila arrived to her party, she was greeted by the cheers of hundreds of people, while her father, doubling for the day as her Prince Charming, escorted her in via the red carpet. When inside the venue, Lila May danced with her father, and there was not a dry eye in the house. Afterward, she danced with her step-father, who then got down on one knee, and asked his step-daughter to marry him, giving her another experience she may never see.\n\nOnce Lila accepted, the crowd joyfully sang \"Happy Birthday\" to the 5-year-old and enjoyed a total of six cakes donated by bakeries in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply touching to see how everyone responded,\u201d Hall told KOIN 6. \u201cThanks is not enough.\u201d\n\nRadiant and smiling from ear to ear, Lila told reporters she liked her party, and her mother could not be happier for her. \u201cIt\u2019s just the most beautiful thing I think I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Hall said.\n\nTo see more photos of this inspiring young girl, click \"view slideshow\" above.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lila, may, schow, toddler, terminal, neuroblastoma, given, wedding, prom, and, princess, ball", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Oregon 5-year-old could not have received a more deserving birthday celebration.", "title": "Toddler With Terminal Cancer Gets Wedding, Prom, And Grand Ball For Her Birthday [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lila-may-schow-toddler-terminal-neuroblastoma-given-wedding-prom-and-princess-ball-346494", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/06/lila-may.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Oregon 5-year-old could not have received a more deserving birthday celebration.", "title": "Toddler With Terminal Cancer Gets Wedding, Prom, And Grand Ball For Her Birthday [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lila-may-schow-toddler-terminal-neuroblastoma-given-wedding-prom-and-princess-ball-346494", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/06/lila-may.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/06/lila-may.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-06T13:50:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-06T14:00:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Oregon 5-year-old could not have received a more deserving birthday celebration."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s deeply touching to see how everyone responded,\u201d Hall told KOIN 6.\n\u201cThanks is not enough.\u201dRadiant and smiling from ear to ear, Lila told reporters she liked her party, and her mother could not be happier for her.\nAlthough they estimate Lila may not live past Thanksgiving, her family and the community decided to throw her the most spectacular birthday party any little girl could ask for.\nEvery Disney princess character was in attendance, and Lila strolled up to her party in a horse-drawn carriage.\nWhen inside the venue, Lila May danced with her father, and there was not a dry eye in the house."}
