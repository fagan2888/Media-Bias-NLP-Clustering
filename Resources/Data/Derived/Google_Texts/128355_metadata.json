The new facility will also bolster the hospital\u2019s ability to attract new physicians for expanded and improved quality of services.\u201d\n\nThe critical access hospital currently features 25 beds, but the new, two-story facility will house inpatient and outpatient surgery departments, a Level IV trauma center, physical therapy, an imaging department, post-anesthesia and secondary recovery, an endoscopy suite and central sterile supply on the ground level. Meanwhile, the second floor will feature 25 private rooms.\n\nAccording to Lancaster Pollard, the publicly financed bonds were a better option than seeking out Federal Housing Administration or U.S. Department of Agriculture loans. The federal funding would have slowed the project during the approvals wait, and could have included mandates to reduce the scope of the project.\n\nThe investment firm also helped Otto Kaiser get a credit rating from Fitch Ratings, making it one of only eight critical-access hospitals to score and investment-grade rating, the firm said. Otto Kaiser earned a BBB/stable rating.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/otto-kaiser-memorial-scores-44-million-bonds-replace-hospital", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Otto-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Kenedy, Texas-based Otto Kaiser Memorial Hospital recently said it has secured $43.8 million in bonds to fund a new hospital that will replace its aging facility.", "title": "Otto Kaiser Memorial scores $44 million in bonds to replace hospital"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Otto-feature.gif"}, "description": "The Kenedy, Texas-based Otto Kaiser Memorial Hospital recently said it has secured $43.8 million in bonds to fund a new hospital that will replace its aging facility.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Otto Kaiser Memorial scores $44 million in bonds to replace hospital"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Kenedy, Texas-based Otto Kaiser Memorial Hospital recently said it has secured $43.8 million in bonds to fund a new hospital that will replace its aging facility.&#13; Columbus investment firm Lancaster Pollard underwrote the fixed-rate, tax-exempt bonds, led by the firm\u2019s vice president, Scott Blount.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Image from GoogleThe Kenedy, Texas-based Otto Kaiser Memorial Hospital recently said it has secured $43.8 million in bonds to fund a new hospital that will replace its aging facility.\nColumbus investment firm Lancaster Pollard underwrote the fixed-rate, tax-exempt bonds, led by the firm\u2019s vice president, Scott Blount.\nOtto Kaiser earned a BBB/stable rating.\nThe investment firm also helped Otto Kaiser get a credit rating from Fitch Ratings, making it one of only eight critical-access hospitals to score and investment-grade rating, the firm said.\nAccording to Lancaster Pollard, the publicly financed bonds were a better option than seeking out Federal Housing Administration or U.S. Department of Agriculture loans."}
