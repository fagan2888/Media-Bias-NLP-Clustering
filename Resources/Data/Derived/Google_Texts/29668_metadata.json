Some of these people are going to be bankrupt.\u201d\n\nCallister is also litigating another class-action lawsuit against the beleaguered state Obamacare exchange and Xerox, on behalf of customers whose coverage was delayed due to the website\u2019s ongoing glitches.\n\n\u201cIt makes life extremely difficult when you don\u2019t get paid after working very hard,\u201d said insurance agent Dwight Mazzone, who is taking part in the lawsuit.\n\nInsurers are supposed to pay insurance brokers commissions after customers pay for coverage. The Nevada exchange and its former lead contractor Xerox, however, have struggled to identify what customers have paid their coverage.

It\u2019s faced numerous complaints from customers who reported that they\u2019d purchased insurance and paid premiums, but their insurance companies had no record of their coverage.

Basich is taking part in the class action lawsuit already pending against the exchange.\n\nThe exchange has not commented on the latest lawsuit.\n\nNevada isn\u2019t the only Obamacare exchange failing to pay its insurance brokers. The Washington Post reported in July that insurance brokers working with the District of Columbia Obamacare exchange haven\u2019t not been paid their commissions either.
