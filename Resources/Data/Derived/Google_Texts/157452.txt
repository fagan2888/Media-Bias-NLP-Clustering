SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – Thursday, the Massachusetts Health Connector approved more customer service help in signing up for health insurance. The plan includes adding temporary walk-in centers called “Customer Interaction Centers.” Three are planned for northeastern and southeastern Massachusetts, with the only year-round location in Springfield.

Heather Goodhind of Caring Health Center told 22News that now is a good time to prepare for November’s open enrollment period.

“If they don’t have coverage, they can come in anytime if they need help paying. So they can bring in income information, household information, tax returns are always helpful if they have them,” Goodhind said.

The Health Connector also announced Thursday the start of a grant program to provide initial in-person help leading up to and during this year’s open enrollment. The Caring Health Center in Springfield is receiving nearly $190,000 as part of that grant.
