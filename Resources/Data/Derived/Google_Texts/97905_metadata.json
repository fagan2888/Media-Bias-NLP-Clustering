The $1.7 billion project hoped to overhaul a 65-year-old coal-fired power plant in Illinois with carbon capture technology. After carbon sequestration was demonstrated, the government-backed project would help develop a new industry of low-carbon coal power.\n\nRelated: How Plunging Oil Prices Could Create Economic Upheaval\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t to be. The Department of Energy scrapped the project on February 3, ordering the developer to cease work due to the expiration of federal funding. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Energy has directed the suspension of FutureGen 2.0 project development activities. The DOE has concluded that there is insufficient time to complete the project before federal funding expires in September 2015,\u201d Ken Humphreys, CEO of the FutureGen Alliance, said in a statement on February 3.\n\nFutureGen had been riddled with problems from the start. Originally proposed by the Bush administration in 2003, it suffered from huge cost overruns, leading to its cancellation in 2008.\n\nBut the Obama administration revived the project following the financial meltdown, including funding for the carbon capture and sequestration coal plant as part of the administration\u2019s stimulus package. The inclusion was made in no small part to the strong support of Senator Dick Durbin (D), a powerful Illinois Democrat in the Senate and Obama ally. He released a statement following its cancellation on February 3, lamenting the loss of FutureGen. \u201cThis is a huge disappointment for both Central Illinois and supporters of clean coal technology,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA decade-long bipartisan effort made certain that federal funding was available for the FutureGen Alliance to engage in a large-scale carbon-capture demonstration project. But, the project has always depended on a private commitment and can\u2019t go forward without it,\u201d Durbin added.\n\nRelated: Surprise!

As a first-of-its-kind demonstration, many companies remained skeptical that the technology was commercially viable. The original design changed several times \u2013 using different technologies and changes in the site location. Troubles obtaining other permitsset the project back. Costs ballooned and the project increasingly looked like an unviable technology.\n\nUltimately, the clock ran out. The $1 billion in federal funding as part of the stimulus project was set to expire in September 2015.\n\nThe failure of the only large-scale carbon capture and sequestration project ultimately dims the prospects that coal will have a legitimate role to play over the long-term in America\u2019s electricity market, due to the need for utilities to comply with EPA regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In other words, the failure of FutureGen could accelerate the death of coal as a source of power generation.\n\nIn political terms, the death of \u201cclean coal\u201d is another setback for the influence of the coal industry, already diminishing because of its shrinking market share. The coal lobby has been historically very powerful, and the existence of FutureGen was a sort of political compromise to begin with \u2013 the Obama administration threw coal a bone, offering up billions of dollars in support of an unproven technology in exchange for heavier Congressional action on clean energy and climate change.\n\nRelated: What Saudi Arabia\u2019s New King Means for Oil Prices\n\nSince then, a wave of shale gas has come online and clean energy is getting cheaper by the day. Coal seems less necessary than it once did. That means there will likely to be less of a pretense in the White House of supporting a future for the coal industry. EPA regulations had already ensured that it will be essentially impossible to build new coal plants without carbon capture technology. But with FutureGen dead, so is the dream of clean coal.\n\nThis article originally appeared at OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from Oilprice.com:\n\nElectric Utilities Face A Disruptive Future\n\nHow Broken Are The Energy Markets?\n\nIEA Says Coal Demand Will Keep Growing Through 2019", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Clean coal is dead.", "title": "The Obama Administration Has Killed \u2018Clean Coal\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Obama-Administration-Has-Killed-Clean-Coal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/West_Virginia_Coal_Jim_Urquhart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Obama-Administration-Has-Killed-Clean-Coal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/West_Virginia_Coal_Jim_Urquhart.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Clean coal is dead.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a huge disappointment for both Central Illinois and supporters of clean coal technology,\u201d he said.\nIn political terms, the death of \u201cclean coal\u201d is another setback for the influence of the coal industry, already diminishing because of its shrinking market share.\nWhile the notion of coal being a source of \u201cclean\u201d was a bit oxymoronic to begin with, the Obama administration perhaps put an end to the dream for good.\nClean coal is dead.\nBut with FutureGen dead, so is the dream of clean coal."}
