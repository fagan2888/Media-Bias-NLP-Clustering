Gov. Richard Ravitch at a speech in Philadelphia in June 2013. AP\n\nUPDATED | Former Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch sharply criticized the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s planned toll rebates for Staten Islanders who use the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, saying board members could be in violation of their fiduciary duty to the authority in approving it.\n\n\u201cYou are in the midst of two labor negotiations in which you are undoubtedly asserting, and properly so, the financial constraints that make it impossible for you to meet the demands of the labor unions,\u201d Mr. Ravitch, a former MTA chairman, said in a public comment session of the agency\u2019s monthly board meeting. \u201cThat argument is inconsistent with voluntarily reducing the revenues of this authority.\u201d\n\nThe measure was unanimously approved by the MTA board, but not before a debate among members about the appropriateness of passing a benefit targeted at Staten Island residents.\n\nOne board member, former New York City budget director Mark Page, abstained from the vote, explaining that he didn\u2019t believe the toll rebates were \u201can MTA initiative,\u201d and hadn\u2019t been subjected to the authority\u2019s usual decision-making processes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe if the question were being asked solely of the MTA and this board that we\u2019d be taking this action ourselves with our resources at this moment,\u201d Mr. Page said.\n\nThat was an apparent reference to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislators who announced the toll deal earlier this year. The rebate cuts 50 cents from the E-ZPass toll rate for Staten Island residents, beginning April 1. Under the proposal, residents would pay $5.50 for each round-trip toll across the bridge, compared with the current resident discount amount of $6.\n\nNon residents using an E-ZPass pay $10.66 to cross the bridge. The cash toll rate is $15.\n\nThe toll plan also includes a 20% rebate for trucks and commercial vehicles making more than 10 trips a month over the bridge.\n\nThe reduction will cost the MTA $14 million in toll revenues. Plans call for the MTA and the state legislature to evenly share the cost, though the state hasn\u2019t yet appropriated its share of the money.\n\nMr. Cuomo, at an unrelated news conference on Wednesday, said he disagreed with Mr. Ravitch, but declined to elaborate.\n\nBoard members, including MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast, said they had carefully considered their fiduciary duties. Before the vote, a staff attorney gave reassurance that the rebate program was consistent with covenants of the authority\u2019s outstanding debt.\n\nRepresentatives of Staten Island defended the change.\n\n\u201cThis is an important relief for people whose businesses have been onerously affected,\u201d board member Allen Cappelli said. Mr. Cappelli noted the relative insufficiency of mass transit on Staten Island compared with other parts of the city and the MTA service region, saying that the island\u2019s residents are \u201ccaptive\u201d to the Verrazano and must rely on their cars more than other residents.\n\nBut that position wasn\u2019t embraced by the board, even as members prepared to vote in favor of the plan.\n\n\u201cWhy do lower bus fares not have an equal claim on the MTA\u2019s finances?\u201d member Norman Brown asked, noting that the city also provides Staten Island Ferry service, free of charge.\n\n\u201cI live in a little place called Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones that pay the toll that you\u2019re always citing as a horrible toll.\u201d\n\nThe six-dollar residential discount rate is \u201calready a substantial\u201d discount, Mr. Brown said. \u201cDo the math.\u201d\n\nAnother board member, Jeff Kay, said the MTA should remind state officials later in the year, as the authority lobbies for financial support for its operating and capital budgets in Albany, that the authority has acceded to demands from the legislature about how it levies tolls.\n\n\u201cI really do hope they\u2019re taking ownership of our funding decisions,\u201d Mr. Kay said, adding \u201dGuys, we\u2019re doing what you asked us to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Former Lt.
