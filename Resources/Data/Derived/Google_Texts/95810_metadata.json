A large crowd gathered to hear Trump speak for over 20 minutes.\n\nAfter throwing some campaign hats into the assembled crowd Trump went after the \u201cstupid leadership\u201d for allowing ISIS to have over 2000 armor-plated humvees. \u201cWe have people who don\u2019t know what they are doing and we just can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cFor the last year I\u2019ve been talking about $18 trillion in debt and now it is $19 trillion in debt, not it is going to start going up fast. Obamacare starts kicking off in \u201916 because Obama didn\u2019t want it to kick in while he is president. It is going to be a catastrophe. We are going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something great, with something really good, we will do that too,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u201cWe have so many other bad things happening that people are not talking about Obamacare that much, have you noticed it? Remember the five billion dollar website, because I\u2019m not going to forget it. The five billion dollar website that doesn\u2019t work, and I think we all know. So we are going to take care of that. We are going to take care of our military. We are going to have a military and by the way we are going to take care of our vets and we have a lot of vets (pointing out into the crowd). We are really going to take care of our veterans. They are our greatest people. We are going to take care of our vets like they should be,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to take care of our vets and we are going to build up our military so big and so strong that we are never going to have to use it perhaps and that would be great,\u201d Trump stated.\n\nTrump addressed concerns he has with career politicians.\n\n\u201cI hear these politicians, I can\u2019t stand them anymore, and somebody said \u2018you\u2019re a politician.\u2019 I said, \u2018please for three months I\u2019ve been a politician, do you believe it.\u2019 All my life I\u2019ve dealt with politicians. If you can\u2019t make it with a politician you might as well give up. I help them, they do whatever\u2026. I hope we don\u2019t have too many politicians. We\u2019ll exclude the people in this audience,\u201d Trump noted.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are all talk and no action. They go to Washington, they tell you they are going to do all these things and they never get done. Then you have some people and you think, \u2018oh these are my people, these are great, this guy or this woman is going to be fantastic.\u2019 They go to Washington and they change. They see the beautiful ceilings, the vaulted ceilings, they see the beautiful marble columns and something happens. I say they become impotent. Is that a correct word to use? They become impotent. Something happens to them,\u201d Trump stated.\n\n\u201cPeople are tired of incompetence, people are tired of people who don\u2019t get it done,\u201d Trump added later in his speech.\n\nTrump went after former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and his support of Common Core, \u201cSomeone like Jeb Bush is in favor of Common Core meaning your children are educated from Washington, DC. Who could want this? When you listen to these people like the Common Core people they can\u2019t explain it. There is no justification. If I am in Iowa and I have my children in Iowa, I want local education. The local teachers and local administrators will do a better job.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier in his speech said he would end illegal immigration and build a wall on the U.S. southern border. He said he has a firm immigration position. \u201cIf you are illegal, if you are illegal, you have got to go back. You got to go back,\u201d Trump said. He indicated some support for flexibility. \u201cIf you are great and you\u2019ve been here a long time\u2026. You can move it, you can move the process for those who have been here a long time, but they have got to go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of the bad ones, we\u2019ve got some real bad ones,\u201d Trump described criminals among the illegal immigration population. \u201cYou know a lot of the gangs you\u2019ve been reading about in different places\u2026. They are illegals. They are tough dudes, they are tough. They are out of here. Before I even get the wall started, they\u2019re gone. On the first day, one of the first things, they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nShifting to the economy. \u201cI like free trade, but when you have free trade you need to have smart negotiators, we don\u2019t have those people. Believe me, if I\u2019m elected, I know the smartest, I know the toughest, I know the meanest (negotiators).\u201d\n\nTrump said that he wants those types of negotiators working on behalf of the United States.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have people who are so good. We are going to have the greatest negotiators, I know them all. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. I know the ones who will really do a good job and keep friendly which I want. We\u2019ll have better relationships with China, Japan, Mexico, we\u2019ll have better relationships than we do right now,\u201d Trump promised.\n\nTrump said his tax plan would come out in three or four weeks. \u201cWe are going to lower taxes, especially for the middle class. We are going to make sure that my friends in the hedge fund business who make a fortune and pay virtually no tax they are going to start paying taxes,\u201d he shared.\n\nTrump highlighted that he is self-funding his campaign, and said he turned down offers from prospective donors and criticized Bush for receiving campaign funding \u201cfrom China, from the Wall Street guys.\u201d\n\nTrump noted he wasn\u2019t worried about Hillary Clinton, but is focused on his Republican opponents.\n\nTrump pointed out former Texas Governor Rick Perry who was once of his earliest critics who just dropped out of the race on Friday. \u201cPerry, isn\u2019t he a nice man? Mr. Perry, Governor Perry, he\u2019s gone. Good luck. Oh he was very nasty to me, but yesterday I put out a Tweet. I said he is a wonderful man and wish him well. People couldn\u2019t believe, but when you win everybody is wonderful right? I actually think he\u2019s a nice guy, but he dropped out.\u201d\n\nTrump complained about the media headlines focused on Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson when he\u2019s leading the polls. \u201cThese headlines say, \u2018Carly is surging,\u2019 she\u2019s got 3 percent. I hear Ben, who is a nice guy, he\u2019s a very nice man. He\u2019s surging, but he\u2019s way behind me. I say, but what about me? I\u2019m leading, but they don\u2019t mention that.\u201d\n\nTrump also complained about Carson\u2019s recent comment that Trump didn\u2019t appear to have faith. \u201cBen, he hit me on my faith,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hit a person on faith. I don\u2019t know him. He knows nothing about me. I\u2019m Protestant. I\u2019m Presbyterian. I believe strongly. I believe in the Bible strongly.\u201d\n\nTrump said Carson apologized and then mentioned he leads among evangelicals.\n\n\u201cThe one thing we need in this country. We need energy. I see where the evangelicals are supporting Trump, largely, and I\u2019m leading with evangelicals and you know part of the reason that they like me and I think strongly is that they want to see our country, they\u2019re smart people, they know\u2026 I may not be perfect, and they know that. And maybe 10 years ago and four years ago they said \u2018no, no he\u2019s not perfect, he\u2019s not perfect we can\u2019t do it,'\u201d Trump stated. \u201cBut do you know what I\u2019m really good at? I\u2019m really good at making deals and making this country rich and bringing it back. I saw Pastor Jeffers and I saw a few of them on television the other night and they said \u2018how do you explain the Donald Trump?\u2019 and again I\u2019m Protestant, \u2018how do you explain that Donald Trump is leading substantially, by substantial numbers with the evangelicals?\u2019 And they said, \u2018because they are tired of losing. They are tired of getting these people who don\u2019t do anything that have no energy.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd it is true, people don\u2019t have energy. I don\u2019t think Ben has the energy. Ben is a nice man, but when you are negotiating against China and you are negotiating against these Japanese guys who are going to come after you in waves, and they think we\u2019re all a bunch of jerks because our leaders are so stupid and so incompetent and so inept; we need people who are really smart, that have tremendous deal making skills, and that have great, great energy,\u201d Trump added.\n\nRegarding complaints about his tone, Trump inferred that there are larger problems like Christian persecution at the hands of ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe have Christians in Syria and other places, ISIS is chopping off their head. They are chopping off their head. They are drowning them. They\u2019re killing them. If you are a Christian you have no chance. Do you know if you are a Christian from Syria it is almost impossible to come into the United States. If you are a Muslim from Syria it is the easiest thing to do to come into the United States. It is one of the easiest places to get in, but if you are a Christian, and they are the ones who need the help, you can\u2019t get into the United States,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWe need that tone today. We need energy. We need strength, and we can\u2019t be low-key and nice and beautiful,\u201d he added.\n\nWatch Trump\u2019s full remarks below:\n\nTrump also held a press avail after his remarks in Boone:", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/09/donald-trump-in-boone-we-need-energy-we-dont-need-nice/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/donald-trump-boone.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-09-15T18:38:12+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "ben carson, boone pufferbilly days, common core, donald trump, hillary clinton, immigration, iowa caucus, jeb bush, obamacare, rick perry, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Donald Trump in Boone, Iowa said American needs his type of tone. \"We need energy.
