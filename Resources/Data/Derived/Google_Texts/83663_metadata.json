There is no such person this year. But either Mitt Romney or Jeb Bush looks sort of president-y and has a moderate demeanor, at least, so sure, it will have to be one of them. This is what the rich people think, for 2016. \u201cMitt or Jeb?\u201d They spend all of their time thinking about this. It doesn\u2019t ever occur to them that neither is a good fit for the current incarnation of the Republican party. Where do we send the check? Jeb will have to run, or Mitt. Where do we send the check? No one ever said being a rich Republican donor was easy.\n\nSpeaking of rich people: the big feature article marking the launch of Bloomberg news\u2019 deep-pocketed politics site is a piece about Jeb Bush, by Mark Halperin. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to about the new Bloomberg Politics. They have a fine stable of writers. Mark Halperin, who is being paid a $1 million salary, is not one of them. Here he is eating ice cream with Nancy Pelosi. One million dollars per year. And here is his big launch scoop: Jeb Bush may or may not run for president. One million dollars per year.\n\nHalperin is not wholly without value, though. He\u2019s good at capturing the zeitgeist of the Republican moneyed class. We can ignore the parts in which Halperin offers his own prognostications about Jeb Bush\u2019s general election chances. (Halperin, for example, thinks that Jeb Bush could put New Jersey and California into play.) (One million dollars per year.) But the parts about how donors are waiting to unload a dump truck of cash atop Jeb Bush seems correct:\n\nJeb (along with Romney) is likely the only contestant who could keep pace with the expected Clinton haul in excess of $1.5 billion. \u201cThe Republican donor base will fall in line\u201d behind Bush, says one of the party\u2019s best and most experienced fundraisers. \u201cThere is no competition.\u201d Despite a near-total lack of spadework in the early states and among activists and bundlers, Bush could line up a team of campaign staffers, policy experts, and finance mavens at a moment\u2019s notice. More to the point, he doesn\u2019t have much ground to make up. One long-time senior Republican official says of the other prospects, \u201cNone of them has done shit\u201d to build an organization so far. \u201cBush will have the band put together in a day. He is the most prepared from a infrastructure point of view by light-years.\u201d Unlike his competitors, Bush could lure donors off the fence in a hurry, without undergoing a hazing trial to test skill and stability. The train would fire up and chug away from the station at the git-go.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP establishment donor class just cannot wait to donate to Jeb '16 -- even if he's...
