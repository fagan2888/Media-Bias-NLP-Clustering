We should condemn them all, give no quarter to anyone who is involved in such activities, and to try to divert the attention away from the outrage that has been focused on the radical Islamic terrorists, in this manner is rather disingenuous, I\u2019m sure, to say the least\u201d he stated.\n\nCarson added, in response to how he reacted to the president\u2019s remarks as a Christian, \u201cobviously, it makes me feel that perhaps we\u2019re being betrayed. perhaps we don\u2019t have a leader who feels the same about things as most of us do, but the good thing is, we have a system in place, that has allowed us to take control. We need to observe carefully what our leaders do and what the people who support them do.
