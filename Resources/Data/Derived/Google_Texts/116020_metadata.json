One of those workers was 63-year-old Charles Gladden who works in the Senate cafeteria. He has been homeless for the past five years.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday, Gladden said his weekly take-home pay is $360; and he gives most of that to his three daughters and grandchildren. Though Gladden makes more than $10.10 \u2013 the required minimum wage for federal contract workers \u2013 he says that is not enough for him and his fellow workers on Capitol Hill.\n\nGladden also suffers financially because of complications from chronic diabetes, which often leads to lengthy hospital stays, some lasting weeks at a time. He says he also struggles to find a safe place to store his insulin when living on the streets.\n\nCharles Gladden spoke with msnbc about his experiences being homeless in the nation\u2019s capital. He also shared what he would like to say to the senators he serves every day in the Senate cafeteria who are likely unaware of his struggles.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Charles Gladden makes more than the required minimum wage for federal contract workers, but he says that is not a living wage for workers on Capitol Hill.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/homeless-and-working-the-senate", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Charles Gladden makes more than the required minimum wage for federal contract workers, but he says that is not a living wage for workers on Capitol Hill.", "title": "Homeless and working in the Senate", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/homeless-and-working-the-senate", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/z_2.jpg?itok=mHTiMXt6", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/homeless-and-working-the-senate", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/z_2.jpg?itok=4Ocp-D4m", "height": 553}, "title": "Homeless and working in the Senate", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Charles Gladden makes more than the required minimum wage for federal contract workers, but he says that is not a living wage for workers on Capitol Hill."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-24T19:29:08-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "casey-dolan", "tags": "economy,equality,minimum-wage,poverty,unions,washington,washington-dc,the-last-word", "title": "Homeless and working in the Senate", "published": 1, "date": "04/24/2015 19:29:08 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/homeless-and-working-the-senate"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Charles Gladden makes more than the required minimum wage for federal contract workers, but he says that is not a living wage for workers on Capitol Hill.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, Poverty, Unions, Equality, Minimum Wage, Washington, Washington DC"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe240b\"", "article_summary": "On Wednesday, federal contract workers in Washington, D.C., went on strike demanding union rights and a minimum wage of $15 an hour.\nOne of those workers was 63-year-old Charles Gladden who works in the Senate cafeteria.\nThough Gladden makes more than $10.10 \u2013 the required minimum wage for federal contract workers \u2013 he says that is not enough for him and his fellow workers on Capitol Hill.\nCharles Gladden spoke with msnbc about his experiences being homeless in the nation\u2019s capital.\nHe also shared what he would like to say to the senators he serves every day in the Senate cafeteria who are likely unaware of his struggles."}
