Republican Steve Daines prevailed in the race for the U.S. Senate seat left open by Democrat Max Baucus. Daines was predicted to win by more than 16 points by CBS, MSU-Billings and Rasmussen. Rasmussen predicted the largest margin -- 20 points.

But the Daines campaign took pains to highlight his bipartisan record: “Steve broke from House leadership and Republicans to support the Violence Against Women Act, which provides critical support and services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.”
