One of those contracts has led to an official investigation.\n\n/ Download\n\nFormer Precinct Four Constable Ron Hickman was appointed Harris County Sheriff in May, after Adrian Garcia resigned to run for Houston mayor. Once he came into office, Hickman started reviewing consulting contracts that were paid for with revenues from the jail commissary. One that caught his eye was a million-dollar contract for chaplain services, provided by a ministry run by former Houston Oiler Mike Barber.\n\nA sheriff\u2019s spokesman says there appears to be discrepancies with time sheets. At issue is whether chaplains were being paid for working at the jail when they were actually at other facilities.\n\nHickman has now launched a formal investigation. He cancelled the contract and replaced the ministry with volunteer chaplains.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office says its investigation could result in criminal charges, like tampering with a government record. It could also result in civil penalities.\n\nIn a statement, Garcia expressed support for the program. He said it gave inmates \u201cthe best chance to remake themselves as law-abiding citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Harris County's new sheriff is reviewing some jail contracts that were signed under the previous administration.
