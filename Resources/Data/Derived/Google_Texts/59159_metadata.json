But that hasn\u2019t stopped the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG)\u2014a proudly pro-abortion \u201cmedical\u201d organization\u2014from attempting to mislead courts into believing that life-ending drugs do not actually end the lives of tiny human beings.\n\nACOG\u2019s efforts come in the many HHS mandate cases that are currently pending before federal courts all over the country, including the U.S. Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius. In these cases, the plaintiffs are challenging the mandate in the Affordable Care Act (or \u201cObamacare\u201d) that requires employers to fully cover, without co-pay, all drugs and devices labeled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as \u201ccontraception.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: the FDA has labeled some drugs as \u201ccontraception\u201d that actually work after a new human organism has been created.\n\nAmong many other facts from scientific journals, AUL has consistently cited the following in amicus briefs filed in federal courts in these cases:\n\n\u201cThe fusion of sperm and egg membranes initiates the life of a sexually reproducing organism.\u201d 1\n\nof a sexually reproducing organism.\u201d \u201cFertilization is the process by which male and female haploid gametes (sperm and egg) unite to produce a genetically distinct individual .\u201d 2\n\n.\u201d \u201cFertilization\u2014the fusion of gametes to produce a new organism\u2014is the culmination of a multitude of intricately regulated cellular processes.\u201d3\n\nEven the National Institutes of Health defines \u201cfertilization\u201d as the process of union of two gametes (i.e., ovum and sperm) \u201cwhereby the somatic chromosome number is restored and the development of a new individual is initiated.\u201d\n\nBut here is the problem: drugs and devices categorized as \u201ccontraception\u201d by the FDA can work after fertilization has occurred. The FDA\u2019s criterion in categorizing a drug as \u201ccontraception\u201d is whether a drug can work by preventing \u201cpregnancy\u201d\u2014which the FDA defines as beginning at \u201cimplantation,\u201d not fertilization. Thus, drugs that interfere with implantation\u2014which occurs after fertilization and the creation of a new human organism\u2014are categorized as \u201ccontraception.\u201d Both Plan B and ella have mechanisms of action which can end the life of a human being after fertilization has occurred.\n\nAnd here is where ACOG comes in to blur the terminology and confuse the courts. Relying on a definition of pregnancy that begins at \u201cimplantation,\u201d ACOG argues that \u201cemergency contraceptives\u201d are not \u201cabortifacients\u201d because there is no \u201cpregnancy.\u201d However, this is a nonresponse to the concern that a drug or device can work after fertilization, by blocking or interrupting the implantation of a developing human embryo.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nSuch drugs might not end a \u201cpregnancy\u201d under ACOG\u2019s definition, but they do end the life of a unique human being.\n\n1 Marsden et al., Model systems for membrane fusion, CHEM.
