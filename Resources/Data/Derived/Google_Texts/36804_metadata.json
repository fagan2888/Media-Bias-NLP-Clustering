The path opened on Monday after a procedural block by Republicans was suddenly lifted. Murthy\u2019s areas of focus, as outlined in a February Senate hearing, will include smoking, obesity, mental illness, and infectious disease.\n\nHarvard health experts voiced their support, saying that strong leadership is needed in those areas, as well as on the politically fraught issue of gun control.\n\nJohn McDonough, a professor of the practice of public health and a specialist in health care reform, said that Murthy is highly intelligent, innovative, and entrepreneurial. He also cautioned that the position has been weakened in recent years.\n\nBefore the administration of George W. Bush, the surgeon general was also typically appointed as assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human Services, McDonough said. That position, which oversees the Office of the Surgeon General, provided past surgeons general with more administrative power than the surgeon general\u2019s post holds on its own. In addition, McDonough said, coming aboard so late in Obama\u2019s second term may limit Murthy\u2019s impact.\n\nThe surgeon general, often described as \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor,\u201d serves as head of the U.S. Public Health Service and is the nation\u2019s leading voice on public health matters. The position has a mandate to inform citizens on health-related scientific findings. Past surgeons general have taken strong stands on issues such as tobacco, AIDS, youth violence, and skin cancer.\n\n\u201cThe power is to shine a spotlight on neglected or misunderstood challenges to public health in the U.S.,\u201d McDonough said.\n\nThe surgeon general\u2019s landmark 1964 report linking smoking and cancer is often cited by health experts in discussions of the role\u2019s game-changing potential.\n\nFrank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said that a similar game-changing report is needed to fight obesity, which long ago reached epidemic proportions. The crisis costs some $147 billion annually, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cThe obesity problem is a very complicated problem,\u201d Hu said. \u201cThere\u2019s no single magic bullet to deal with [it]. That\u2019s why we need national leadership and a multi-sectorial approach. We live in a very obesity-genic environment, a very toxic environment. \u2026 It\u2019s important for the surgeon general to elevate this issue to a national priority.\u201d\n\nMcDonough agreed that obesity stands at the forefront of issues demanding attention, though he pointed out that some of Murthy\u2019s work in the area may already have been done. The Affordable Care Act required a surgeon general-chaired National Prevention Council to report on preventing health ills and to create a national prevention strategy. That document, released in 2011, was both \u201cwonderful and woefully neglected,\u201d McDonough said, and awaits an implementation strategy.\n\n\u201cMurthy can breathe new life into that document,\u201d McDonough said.\n\nRonald Kessler, the McNeil Family Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School and an expert on mental illness, said that Murthy\u2019s discussion of mental illness as a priority has been welcome \u2014 and appropriate.\n\n\u201cMental health is an incredibly neglected area. \u2026 Major depression is the No. 2 disabling condition, with respect to lost productivity, in the world,\u201d Kessler said.\n\nMental illness is not just dangerous in its own right, Kessler said, but a factor in physical well-being. Heart disease patients, for example, have higher rates of depression, while those with cancer have higher rates of anxiety. The systems for diagnosing and treating mental and physical ailments traditionally have been separate, an arrangement that Kessler said does a disservice to patients struggling with both.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence showing that neglecting the psychological piece gets in the way of dealing with the physical piece,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only that mental disorders are important in their own right, but they\u2019re a really integral piece of understanding how to deal with people\u2019s physical health problems.\n\n\u201cIt would be great if, in his tenure as surgeon general, he tried to tackle that in a way that does both a better job of recognizing mental health problems and of integrating the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in the context of the broader health system.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s already caused Murthy political problems, McDonough and David Hemenway, a professor of health policy and director of HSPH\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, urged a strong stand on gun violence.\n\nGun violence in the United States has reached the level of a public health concern, Hemenway said, a view Murthy supported in a 2012 tweet that raised the ire of gun-control opponents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling to me that here\u2019s someone who basically says gun violence is a public health problem and because of that they try to prevent him from being surgeon general,\u201d Hemenway said. \u201cI mean, if he didn\u2019t say that, he\u2019s not qualified to be surgeon general.\u201d\n\nHemenway said the central issue \u2014 that U.S. society is awash in guns \u2014 appears unlikely to change in the short term, but that a difference might be made on aspects of the problem, such as gun-assisted suicide.\n\nResearch shows that having a gun in the home is a risk factor for suicide, Hemenway said. In fact, he said, disparities among state suicide rates can be almost entirely explained by the prevalence of guns in the home, because suicide attempts with a gun have a much higher chance of succeeding than those by other methods.\n\nFurther, he said, lowering the gun suicide rate would not be just a nibble at the edges of the broader problem, since the annual number of gun suicides is actually significantly higher than that for gun-related homicides.\n\n\u201cWe know that so many suicides are pretty spontaneous, and the desire passes,\u201d Hemenway said. \u201cThe policies [needed] are not so much government policies, but to change social norms. Just as friends don\u2019t let friends drive drunk, if a friend is going through a rough patch, make sure they don\u2019t have easy access to guns for a little bit.\u201d\n\nPast surgeons general have been key leaders against tobacco-related illness. Vaughan Rees, for one, hopes that work continues.\n\nRees, the interim director of the Harvard Center for Global Tobacco Control, said that the surgeon general\u2019s leadership on the issue is still needed. Potential areas of action include tobacco marketing and promotion strategies that target vulnerable populations, such as children, low-income individuals, and those with low levels of education.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the surgeon general comes into his or her own, championing leadership around new initiatives and protection of the health of those underserved communities,\u201d Rees said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#99283c", "news_keywords": "Alvin Powell, Brigham and Womens Hospital, David Hemenway, Gun Control, Harvard Medical School, Harvard T.H.
