Primarily, the clinics aim to provide employees with routine medical care similar to what they\u2019d receive from a primary care physician.\n\nIdeally, the clinics\u2019 staff can treat medical conditions as they appear, including instances of workplace injury, as well as monitor pre-existing conditions to identify or ward off any potential chronic diseases.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that healthy employees are less expensive employees when it comes to health care,\u201d said John Workman, president and co-owner of Eagle Alloy.\n\nThe three manufacturers currently operate two clinics that are open 36 hours a week and offer free care to any of the companies\u2019 employees.\n\nThe clinics are also open to workers\u2019 families and can provide sports physicals for children along with pre-employment physicals for prospective employees. They also offer a 24/7 hotline for support.\n\nThe clinics are staffed by physician\u2019s assistants, nurse practitioners and a medical director and operated through ProMedico LLC, a third-party firm that manages the day-to-day operations. ProMedico is part of the Lighthouse Group, an insurance brokerage that operates offices across the state.\n\n\u201cCertainly (rising health care costs) are a driver,\u201d Workman said of the clinics. \u201cIf you identify a chronic issue when they come in for an acute issue, you\u2019ll probably head off larger costs in the future.\u201d\n\nAll three companies have adopted a self-insurance model for health care that allows for greater flexibility when it comes to designing outside programing such as health clinics, he said.\n\nCOST SAVINGS\n\nWhile the companies behind the Muskegon clinics won\u2019t see immediate returns, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll experience long-term savings through an overall decrease in health care costs and improved productivity from workers, said Larry Boress, executive director of the National Association of Worksite Health Centers (NAWHC).\n\nWith more people having access to health care under the federal Affordable Care Act, access to primary physicians can at times be scarce, Boress said. That leaves workers often relying on urgent care facilities or emergency departments to treat routine or easily treatable conditions. Not only does that put a bigger financial burden on employees, but it impacts the employer\u2019s health care costs and their bottom lines.\n\nForty percent of the companies that host onsite clinics at their workplace do not have doctors at all, Boress added. Indeed, a lack of primary care physicians was one of the reasons behind creating the Muskegon clinic group, according to Workman.\n\n\u201cIt costs (employers) a lot less than if employees use the emergency room for a cough or an ear infection,\u201d Boress said. \u201cIf you have a nurse on campus that can give a few minor prescriptions, then employees don\u2019t have to pay out of their pocket. I think it makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nOf 255 companies surveyed nationwide by NAWHC across 15 different industry sectors, 116 indicated that they had onsite or near-site clinics. Sixty-four percent of the companies surveyed noted that the use of on-site or near-site clinics helped them reach their cost-reduction goals for health insurance.\n\nThese clinics also have the added benefit of being quickly accessible by employees pressed for time. Workers can visit the clinic quickly before or after work, thereby saving the company any potential loss in productivity from the employee leaving the facility for a routine doctor appointment or urgent care visit \u2014 both of which could take between four hours and the entire day, Boress said.\n\nThe savings in employer health care costs can also translate directly into lower premiums for employees, he said.\n\nCLINICS GROW AS PREMIUMS RISE\n\nWith insurance premiums largely on the rise, it\u2019s likely that manufacturers will seek out new and innovative ways to cut down on health care costs, said Delaney McKinley, director of human resource policy and membership development at the Michigan Manufacturers Association.\n\nAverage health insurance premiums have risen 26 percent from 2009 to 2014, according to data collected by The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation as part of a 2014 Employer Health benefit survey. Average premiums for single-coverage and family plans tempered in 2014, rising only 2 percent and 3 percent year-over-year, respectively.\n\nThe average annual premium for employer-sponsored health insurance was $6,025 for an individual and $16,834 for family coverage in 2014, according to the Kaiser Foundation.\n\n\u201cI do expect manufacturers and other employers to look outside the box to address employee health care costs,\u201d McKinley said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been seeing dramatic increases in costs and they\u2019re looking at more ways to get involved to avoid that uncertainty.\u201d\n\nBecause of the increasing costs and uncertainty, more employers are likely to offer health care programing ranging from wellness programs to onsite clinics \u2014 particularly among smaller, regional employers, sources said.\n\nForty-eight percent of the respondents with fewer than 200 employees included some sort of worksite health program in their operations, according to the NAWHC survey.\n\nA REGIONAL APPROACH\n\nWhile worksite clinics are more common in large organizations, smaller operations normally lack the resources necessary to fund a clinic. National firms such as Wisconsin-based QuadMed and Oklahoma-based CareATC require companies to employ at least 1,000 workers to make operating their on-site clinics profitable, said Amy McCulloch, an account executive who leads ProMedico.\n\nLocally, Kentwood-based auto supplier Lacks Enterprises Inc. operates its own clinic through CareATC, which has operations in 16 states, said Mike La Penna, principal of The La Penna Group Inc., a Grand Rapids-based consultancy.\n\nThe Lighthouse Group began forming ProMedico in 2012 to address a gap in on-site health clinics for mid-size and small manufacturers in the region, McCulloch said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bring the same advantages from employers across the country that have taken advantage of worksite clinics for 20 years and bring it to smaller manufacturers that are able to share resources,\u201d she said.\n\nProMedico bills its clients based on the number of hours the clinic is operational and the number of employees that are seen by the health professionals.\n\nThe firm initially reached out to six employers in West Michigan as a test group \u2014 which included the three Muskegon-based manufacturers. ProMedico hasn\u2019t limited its services to manufacturers and plans to open another clinic in August at a company in Northern Michigan, although the firm declined to provide further details on the project.\n\nEven with ProMedico\u2019s more regionally focused model, it\u2019s likely that companies will follow the Muskegon-based manufacturers\u2019 model and offer collaborative health clinics to minimize costs, sources said.\n\nThe model still requires some investment from participating companies. For example, Eagle Alloy invested $80,000 into building its clinic facility. The other Muskegon clinic \u2014 colocated near the Fleet Engineers and Port City Group facilities \u2014 was created in an existing space owned by Fleet Engineers.\n\n\u201cWe always thought about having our own clinic and that it would be a good idea,\u201d Workman said, \u201cbut to make it sustainable on a standalone level would have been hard for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three Muskegon-area manufacturing companies have banded together to create their own on-site health care clinics to better manage employee health.
