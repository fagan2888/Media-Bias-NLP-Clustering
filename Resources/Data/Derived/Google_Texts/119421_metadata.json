(Clemson athletic communications)\n\nCLEMSON \u2013 Mackensie Alexander, in the library, with a candlestick.\n\nThe victim: coachspeak. The charge: murder. The surviving: fans and media, who have no qualms with any of this.\n\nIn a world of \u201cwe take it one game at a time\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re all just working hard\u201d and \u2013 gag me \u2013 \u201ceverybody\u2019s on the same level,\u201d Alexander was refreshing, resplendent, relentless and real.\n\n(Real talk: we all know Division I college football players are, by and large, confident in themselves. That\u2019s a nice way of saying they\u2019re cocky. That\u2019s also the reason they\u2019re capable of being Division I college football players. It\u2019s OK for said college athletes to show that every now and again.)\n\nBesides his bold proclamation Wednesday, here are seven snippets from Alexander\u2019s interview \u2013 his second as a collegian, following only the postgame scrum after the Russell Athletic Bowl \u2013 as he held court with attentive reporters for 11 minutes Wednesday.\n\n1) Since I used library and candlestick as the examples \u2013 you\u2019re welcome for the classic Clue references, by the way \u2013 it\u2019s easy to actually imagine Alexander working late in a library with the use of a candlestick.\n\nWhy? Because Alexander takes notes. A lot of them. On wide receivers.\n\n\u201cI got a drawer at home that\u2019s full of stuff. I just moved into my new place,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI even got notes of our receivers, so that tells you it all.\u201d\n\nYep: in the unlikely event Alexander ends up facing off on Saturdays vs. Mike Williams or Artavis Scott \u2013 or the more likely event he does so someday on Sundays \u2013 he\u2019s researched their strengths and weaknesses. He\u2019s done the same for receivers he\u2019ll see this year with Wofford, Louisville, Notre Dame, Florida State and South Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt shows you my competitive nature,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about college. It\u2019s about doing it at the next level also, preparing my mind to be that good and be where I need to be.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m just focusing on fall camp, but I do got my mind on those guys. I got my notes written down. It\u2019s going to be good to attack them this year, see how good they really are.\u201d\n\n2) Head coach Dabo Swinney says things like \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he showers\u201d after games Saturday before Alexander has gone to watch film of himself in the game that just finished.\n\nThat was as a redshirt freshman. Now Alexander is a third-year sophomore, and one who could feasibly declare for the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even worse now that I\u2019m putting in more hours and more time, like a quarterback,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be a better man, also. Even now, every day, after these camp practices, it\u2019s a routine every day, and it never stops. The more hours I put into this, I can be a better player and put up better numbers than last year.\u201d\n\n3) Why does Mackensie Alexander do it? Why does he get out of bed in the morning and eat, sleep, breathe football?\n\n\u201cMy preparation pushes me. Because what\u2019s mine is mine. I don\u2019t want to let anybody take what\u2019s mine,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI thrive on competition. I thrive on one-on-one matchups. I\u2019m a competitor.\n\n4) Like most players, family ties are a major factor as well.\n\n\u201cMy parents have really driven me to be me,\u201d said Alexander, who\u2019s from Immokalee, Fla. \u201cWatching my mom and dad picking tomatoes in this hot sun, doing it out here \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s pretty easy, but I make it look easy because I work hard.\u201d\n\nAlexander said he speaks with his father, who\u2019s still a tomato picker, every other day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for me when I hear that,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cWe\u2019re a blue-collar family \u2013 we don\u2019t come from much. For me to see my dad keep doing those things, for me to come out here, it\u2019s pretty easy. That\u2019s where the motivation comes from.\u201d\n\n5) Here\u2019s what fans probably don\u2019t realize and, honestly, media probably hasn\u2019t harped on nearly enough: for all the deserved daps the Tigers\u2019 front seven got last year, Clemson\u2019s secondary was a really, really instrumental cog in the No. 1 total defense machine.\n\nAlexander joined the chorus, which includes Jayron Kearse and Jadar Johnson, in touting the Tigers\u2019 defensive backs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so talented in the secondary, it\u2019s not even funny,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more about being smarter than opponents, understanding down and distance, how they want to attack you, where you\u2019re at on the field.\u201d\n\n6) For all his bluster, Alexander doesn\u2019t want to be portrayed as a me-me-me guy. He points no further than his willingness to assist younger players like Mark Fields and Kaleb Chalmers after practice to work on their craft \u2013 and the pressure put on by Brent Venables has a little bit to do with that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding our d-coordinator. He\u2019s a little crazy; he\u2019s in tune with every coverage, every call that we\u2019re in. He\u2019s emotionally invested in it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard for a young guy to come in and understand Coach V.\n\n\u201cAll the young guys after practice, every day I\u2019m with them. If they want help, they\u2019re always free to join me whenever.\u201d\n\n7) As Alexander was pulled from the media circle to go eat lunch before Clemson\u2019s second practice Wednesday, a reporter rattled off one last question: Mackensie, who\u2019s your favorite cornerback?\n\nThe question meant to indicate NFL cornerbacks. Alexander took it differently.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d Alexander answered, with a smile, before leaving the public interview world for a duration of time to be determined.\n\n-AB", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "7 at 7: Clemson CB Mackensie Alexander sounds off in rare interview, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Brent Venables,Clemson football,Mackensie Alexander", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "CLEMSON \u2013 Mackensie Alexander, in the library, with a candlestick.", "title": "7 at 7: Clemson CB Mackensie Alexander sounds off in rare interview", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150813/150819739/7-at-7-clemson-cb-mackensie-alexander-sounds-off-in-rare-interview", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150813/PC20/150819739/AR/0/AR-150819739.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150813/PC20/150819739/AR/0/AR-150819739.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CLEMSON \u2013 Mackensie Alexander, in the library, with a candlestick.", "title": "7 at 7: Clemson CB Mackensie Alexander sounds off in rare interview", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150813/PC20/150819739/AR/0/AR-150819739.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150819739}}, "keywords": "7 at 7: Clemson CB Mackensie Alexander sounds off in rare interview , Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Brent Venables,Clemson football,Mackensie Alexander", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-13T07:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T22:41:00Z", "author": "Aaron Brenner"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "CLEMSON \u2013 Mackensie Alexander, in the library, with a candlestick."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2258\"", "article_summary": "Clemson cornerback Mackensie Alexander guards during the Tigers' win over Georgia State on Nov. 22, 2014 at Memorial Stadium.\n(Clemson athletic communications)CLEMSON \u2013 Mackensie Alexander, in the library, with a candlestick.\nThe more hours I put into this, I can be a better player and put up better numbers than last year.\u201d3) Why does Mackensie Alexander do it?\n\u201cMe,\u201d Alexander answered, with a smile, before leaving the public interview world for a duration of time to be determined.\n\u201cIt\u2019s even worse now that I\u2019m putting in more hours and more time, like a quarterback,\u201d Alexander said."}
