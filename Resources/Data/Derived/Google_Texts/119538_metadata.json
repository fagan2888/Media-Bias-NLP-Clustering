No one can accuse the president of abandoning his promises on regulation in 2014.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a group of federal employees last month, Mr. Obama said Republicans \u201care about 25 percent right when it comes to regulatory burden.\u201d He said his administration continues to take steps to eliminate outdated rules and to work with the business community for more sensible policies.\n\nBut a report last month by the Congressional Research Service showed that businesses have been hit with nearly 50 percent more \u201ceconomically significant\u201d regulations under Mr. Obama than under the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\nMr. Obama has issued 406 of these regulations, estimated to cost businesses more than $100 million per year, over his first six years in office \u2014 an average of 68 per year. Mr. Bush issued 277 such regulations over his first six years in office, for an average of 46 annually.\n\nCRS found that the number of final rules has declined slightly, from 3,830 in 2008 to 3,659 last year.\n\nThe AAF report also said the impact of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory act and Obamacare were $16.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\n\nAAF was is led by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. The group was founded in 2010 by Norm Coleman, a former Republican senator from Minnesota, and Fred Malek, a longtime Republican fundraiser and strategist.\n\nOverall in 2014, the AAF report said, there were six regulations that could have an annual impact of more than $1 billion, and regulators published 39 rulemakings with yearly burdens of more than $100 million. Those 39 regulations also carried 25.6 million hours of paperwork.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration pushed through $181.5 billion in new or expanded regulations in 2014, according to a new report from a conservative think that said California, Texas and Ohio were hardest hit by the additional red tape.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration pushed through $181.5 billion in new or expanded regulations in 2014, according to a new report from a conservative think that said California, Texas and Ohio were hardest hit by the additional red tape.", "title": "Obama rules cost $181.5B in 2014: report", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/6/obama-rules-cost-1815b-2014-report/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/04/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/04/obama.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration pushed through $181.5 billion in new or expanded regulations in 2014, according to a new report from a conservative think that said California, Texas and Ohio were hardest hit", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama rules cost $181.5B in 2014: report"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38e7\"", "article_summary": "The American Action Forum said the new rules mostly focus on clean energy and auto emissions regulations, saying the rules cost California $7.9 billion, Texas $6.5 billion and Ohio $3.4 billion.\nLast month, the group estimated that the administration\u2019s regulations would cost a total of $143.3 billion in 2014.\nMr. Obama has issued 406 of these regulations, estimated to cost businesses more than $100 million per year, over his first six years in office \u2014 an average of 68 per year.\nThe AAF report also said the impact of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory act and Obamacare were $16.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nBut a report last month by the Congressional Research Service showed that businesses have been hit with nearly 50 percent more \u201ceconomically significant\u201d regulations under Mr. Obama than under the presidency of George W.
