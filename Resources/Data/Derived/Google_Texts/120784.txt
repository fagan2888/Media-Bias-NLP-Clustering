Leaning power poles are creating a concern for some homeowners in the metro.

Leaning power poles are creating a concern for some homeowners in the metro.

Ron Kilman and his wife Joyce live across from Will Rogers Elementary School at NW 122 Street.

Monday morning a neighbor alerted them to an ice-laden power pole that was leaning dangerously over their backyard.

Kilman said he filed a report with OG&E online.

OG&E spokeswoman Kathleen O’Shea said customers are encouraged to report these kinds of things as soon as they arise.

Kilman said since his home still has power, he’s not going to let the leaning pole bother him too much.

“You hate to lose your fence, but there’s a lot of other people around who don’t have power and we have power,” O’Shea said.

Monday morning, 65,000 OG&E customers were still without power.
