But her communications with then-Clinton State Department official Philippe Reines turned up Tuesday in a batch of emails obtained and published by Gawker.\n\nIn those January 2013 emails, Reines appears to give Labott suggestions for tweets. Phil Kerpen, president of the conservative American Commitment, first flagged the exchange about Paul.\n\nIn it, Labott shares the following tweet, in reference to Clinton\u2019s Benghazi committee testimony, with Reines.\n\nSen Paul most critical on committee of Clinton, but a little late to the #Benghazi game.Not sure he was at many of the 30 previous briefings \u2014 Elise Labott (@eliselabottcnn) January 23, 2013\n\nThis was right after she asked Reines whether he was sure Paul wasn\u2019t \u201cat any hearings.\u201d\n\nThe Paul campaign on Wednesday said CNN\u2019s correspondent was working with Reines to discredit Paul, and called on the network to \u201caddress\u201d the \u201cbias\u201d exhibited \u2013 particularly ahead of a CNN-hosted debate next month.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

Paul during the next debate. All eyes will be on CNN's response to their employee colluding with Hillary Clinton in order to attack a prominent U.S. senator on their dime.\"\n\nThe campaign specifically cited a Daily Caller report that said the reporter coordinated with Reines.\n\nA representative with CNN has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nKerpen said on Twitter, as he posted screenshots of multiple email exchanges, that Labott \u201cTweets on request!\u201d\n\nAnother exchange from Jan. 23 showed Reines telling Labott: \u201cI suggested a good Tweet.\u201d\n\nLabott asks what he suggested, and Reines responds, \u201cPin.\u201d\n\nThis may have been a reference to a BlackBerry messaging system. Labott tells Reines she put her BlackBerry \u201cnear the window\u201d and \u201cwill get back to you.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, she writes, \u201cDone.\u201d\n\nThe tweet sent in that time period
