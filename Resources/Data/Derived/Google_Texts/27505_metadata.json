He\u2019s a first grader at Reed Elementary in Tiburon. Rhett was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 2 and went through three years of chemotherapy.\n\nRhett is in remission now, but cannot yet be vaccinated, for medical reasons. A small percentage of school children statewide \u2014 0.19 percent \u2014 have such medical exemptions. They depend on everyone around them being vaccinated to protect them from disease. This community protection is called herd immunity.\n\nBut Marin County has a much higher rate of \u201cpersonal belief exemptions\u201d \u2014 a way for parents to lawfully refuse vaccines on behalf of their children.\n\nIn large part because of prodding from Rhett\u2019s parents, the district\u2019s board at its regular meeting tonight will consider whether to formally endorse a new bill that would abolish the personal belief exemption in California.\n\nSeven-year-old Rhett is going to read a short statement in favor of the proposed bill. He happily read his remarks to me on Monday in a clear, bright voice. \u201cThank you Reed school board for teaching science and making everyone get vaccinated,\u201d he read aloud.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of Marin students are vaccinated, the county\u2019s vaccine refusal rate of 6.45 percent is almost triple the statewide average. Pockets of the county have refusal rates that are much higher. Measles is highly contagious, one of the most contagious illnesses known. To achieve herd immunity against measles, vaccine rates must be 92 to 94 percent.\n\nState Senator Richard Pan of Sacramento, who is introducing the bill, plans to attend the district\u2019s board meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be talking to the board about why it\u2019s important for them to protect children like Rhett in their school district\u201d he said, adding that many adults also have weakened immune systems from cancer treatments or other illnesses and rely on herd immunity for protection.\n\n\u201cI certainly would ask that they support my bill so that we can get our immunization rates up,\u201d Pan said.\n\nMany children have completed only some of their vaccines. Across California, this \u201cunder-vaccination\u201d is another issue that can allow diseases to spread.\n\nReed Union\u2019s superintendent, Steve Herzog, says school nurses have been working hard since the beginning of the year to get all students up-to-date on their vaccinations. He says all but 24 students out of more than 1,500 in the district have had at least one measles, mumps, rubella vaccine of the two recommended doses. And one dose will protect 95 percent of people.\n\nHerzog says he will recommend tonight that the board formally endorse Pan\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cAny legislation that will support getting more of our people immunized is good,\u201d he said.\n\nHerzog says that since measles cases started mounting in early January, he\u2019s heard more from parents who support vaccination than from those who do not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Family of a first grader recovering from leukemia has been advocating for vaccination.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Marin School District Considers Endorsing Ban of Vaccine 'Personal Belief Exemption'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/02\\/10\\/marin-school-district-considers-endorsing-ban-of-vaccine-personal-belief-exemption\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-10 00:11:17\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-10 22:03:38\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23865,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"personal belief exemption\",\"Vaccine\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/02\\/image2-copy-3.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Family of a first grader recovering from leukemia has been advocating for vaccination.", "title": "Marin School District Considers Endorsing Ban of Vaccine \u2018Personal Belief Exemption\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/02/10/marin-school-district-considers-endorsing-ban-of-vaccine-personal-belief-exemption/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/02/image2-copy-3-640x476.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "personal belief exemption,vaccine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb427\"", "article_summary": "Update Feb. 10, 10:00pm: The board of the Reed Union School District voted 4-1 to \u201cencourage the state of California\u201d to eliminate the personal belief exemption.\n\u201cThank you Reed school board for teaching science and making everyone get vaccinated,\u201d he read aloud.\nOriginal post:As first reported on State of Health, the face of the vaccine debate in southern Marin\u2019s small Reed Union School District is Rhett Krawitt.\nTo achieve herd immunity against measles, vaccine rates must be 92 to 94 percent.\nWhile the overwhelming majority of Marin students are vaccinated, the county\u2019s vaccine refusal rate of 6.45 percent is almost triple the statewide average."}
