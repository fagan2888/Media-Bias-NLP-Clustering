But the United Auto Workers union has said Ford plans to shift production of the Focus compact and C-Max small gas-electric hybrid from suburban Detroit to Mexico, where the cars can be made cheaper and more profitably.\n\nThe UAW\u2019s new four-year contract with Ford, signed last year, guarantees new vehicles for the Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant in 2018 and 2020 and a $700 million investment that preserves the plant\u2019s 3,924 jobs. Union members have said they expect the factory to get a new version of the Ranger small pickup and a new small truck-based SUV called the Bronco.\n\nFord announced the move on the day of the key Wisconsin primary. Outsourcing jobs has been become a campaign issue largely because of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who has railed about corporate America moving jobs to Mexico to take advantage of what he calls a lopsided trade agreement. He has vowed to rewrite the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, tax imports and punish U.S. companies including Ford.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ford to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs", "title": "Ford to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/05/ford_to_build_small_car_factory_in_mexico_adding_2800_jobs/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Ford to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs", "title": "Ford to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ford to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs", "title": "Ford to build small-car factory in Mexico, adding 2,800 jobs", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Tom Krisher", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He has vowed to rewrite the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, tax imports and punish U.S. companies including Ford.\nOutsourcing jobs has been become a campaign issue largely because of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who has railed about corporate America moving jobs to Mexico to take advantage of what he calls a lopsided trade agreement.\nThe company announced the plant in the San Luis Potosi state Tuesday without saying specifically what cars it will build there.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Ford Motor Co. plans to build a new $1.6 billion auto assembly plant in Mexico, creating about 2,800 jobs and shifting small-car production from the U.S. at a time when moving jobs south of the border has become a major issue in the U.S. presidential campaign.\nUnion members have said they expect the factory to get a new version of the Ranger small pickup and a new small truck-based SUV called the Bronco."}
