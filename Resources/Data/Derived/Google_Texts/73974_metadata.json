We\u2019ve got some things we\u2019ve got to clean up and get ready for Cal,\u201d said Whittingham, who earlier gave Utes fans who traveled a thumbs-up as he left the field.\n\nWilson completed 18-of-30 passes, hitting nine receivers, and ran for 100 yards and another score for Utah (4-0). The lanky senior sprained his left shoulder two weeks ago against Utah State and sat out the Utes\u2019 victory last weekend over Fresno State.\n\nOregon hadn\u2019t lost so badly at home since falling 54-0 to Washington in 1977. Utah\u2019s 62 points were the most scored against a Pac-12 opponent since joining the league in 2011, and also the most the Ducks have ever allowed in Eugene.\n\n\u201cIt felt amazing. It\u2019s a great win for this program, a great step for this offense. To put that many points on a team like Oregon is unheard of,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nVernon Adams Jr. started at quarterback for Oregon (2-2) despite a broken index finger that kept him out of the Ducks\u2019 victory last weekend over Georgia State, but he didn\u2019t last long and was replaced by backup Jeff Lockie in the second quarter.\n\nAfterward, coach Mark Helfrich said it wasn\u2019t just Adams\u2019 injury that merited the change.\n\n\u201cThere were some things there that are plays he would normally make, you have to kind of get into their head as to why and what, if he\u2019s thinking about something else, whatever it is,\u201d Helfrich said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give Utah credit.\u201d\n\nBut it was Oregon\u2019s besieged defense that had no solution for Wilson and the rolling Utes, who amassed 530 yards of total offense.\n\nAndy Phillips put Utah ahead with early field goals from 28 and 44 yards, and Utah\u2019s defense thwarted Oregon\u2019s first three series of the game.\n\nByron Marshall\u2019s 77-yard kickoff return and a facemask penalty put Oregon on the Utes 11 at the end of the first quarter, and Adams capped the short drive with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Royce Freeman. The 2-point conversion failed.\n\nThe Utes pulled back in front on Wilson\u2019s 26-yard touchdown pass to wide-open Britain Covey in the end zone, then pushed the lead to 20-16 with Wilson\u2019s 7-yard pass to Kenneth Scott.\n\nOregon\u2019s defense struggled. The unit went into the game ranked 105th among FBS programs for overall defense, allowing an average of 456.3 yards. The Ducks\u2019 scoring defense was at 104th in the country.\n\nAdams struggled, too. The senior transfer from Eastern Washington completed just two of seven pass attempts before he was replaced by Lockie, Marcus Mariota\u2019s backup last season.\n\nLockie sparked the offense, completing his first three passes of the game and earning a \u201cLock-ie! Lock-ie!\u201d chant from the Autzen Stadium crowd. His first drive finished with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Bralon Addison.\n\nBut the enthusiasm from the crowd was short-lived and Utah answered with Wilson\u2019s 9-yard scoring pass to true freshman Caleb Repp to make it 27-13 going into the half.\n\nWilson opened the third quarter with a 2-yard scoring run, and the Utes padded the lead with running back Devontae Booker\u2019s 25-yeard scoring pass to Britain.\n\nOregon suffered a blow early in the half when Marshall appeared to injure his right ankle on a kickoff return. The senior receiver, who ranks 10th on Oregon\u2019s career list with 27 touchdown receptions, had to be carted to the locker room.\n\nWilson hit Repp with a 16-yeard scoring pass and the Utes went up 48-13, sending fans streaming for the exits. Boobie Hobbs added a touchdown on a 69-yard punt return when Utah faked out the Ducks by drawing them to a different player.\n\n\u201cEverything that could have gone wrong went wrong,\u201d Helfrich said.\n\nBackup Kendal Thompson ran six yards for the final touchdown for Utah, which has a bye next week before hosting California.\n\nOregon travels to Colorado next week.\n\nThe game had some unusual moments. In addition to Booker\u2019s touchdown pass, the game also featured an appearance on offense at receiver for Utah cornerback Cory Butler-Byrd. The versatile junior was last week\u2019s Pac-12 special teams player of the week for his 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against Fresno State.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Utah crushes Oregon 62-20; Ducks\u2019 worst home loss since 1977", "title": "Utah crushes Oregon 62-20; Ducks\u2019 worst home loss since 1977", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/utah-crushes-oregon-62-20-ducks-worst-home-loss-since-1977/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__utahp1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__utahp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T11:21:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T23:52:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5fe5\"", "article_summary": "The Ducks\u2019 scoring defense was at 104th in the country.\nIn addition to Booker\u2019s touchdown pass, the game also featured an appearance on offense at receiver for Utah cornerback Cory Butler-Byrd.\nThe lanky senior sprained his left shoulder two weeks ago against Utah State and sat out the Utes\u2019 victory last weekend over Fresno State.\nWilson hit Repp with a 16-yeard scoring pass and the Utes went up 48-13, sending fans streaming for the exits.\nHis first drive finished with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Bralon Addison."}
