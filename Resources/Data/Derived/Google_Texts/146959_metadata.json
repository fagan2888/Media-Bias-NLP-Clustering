LOUIS \u2014 Religious freedom, vocations to the priesthood, family and marriage were among the top priorities Roman Catholic bishops from across the U.S. gathered here in St. Louis outlined on Thursday.\n\nSome bishops, however, left the discussion feeling dissatisfied.\n\nThey argued bishops should follow in the steps of Pope Francis and place a greater emphasis on alleviating poverty.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be given greater visibility to plight of the poor,\u201d said Bishop George Thomas of Helena, Mont.\n\nApproximately 250 U.S. bishops gathered at the Hyatt Regency at the Arch for a second day of meetings. They were here for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops annual spring assembly.\n\nOther priorities outlined by bishops included evangelization, as well as human life and dignity \u2014 combating the \u201cthrowaway culture of abortion and euthanasia.\u201d\n\nRegarding religious freedom, the persecution of Christians was of specific concern. \u201cI am burning. Christianity is burning,\u201d said Bishop Yousif Habash of the Syrian Catholic Church in Newark, N.J.\n\nA draft of the priorities is expected to be finalized at the 2016 general assembly, held in November in Baltimore.\n\nWednesday, Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Ky., president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, kicked off the general assembly by referring to Ferguson, Mo., and releasing a statement on racism.\n\nThe spring assembly is scheduled to end Friday.\n\n(Lilly Fowler is the religion reporter at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
