The Threefoot Preservation Society marks the occasion every year with an open house. This year, the great-granddaughters of the building's founders were in town to celebrate the landmark\u2019s anniversary.\n\n\u201cThe society has done a tremendous job and time and effort in preserving this building and trying to turn it into something,\u201d the founders' great-granddaughter Tracy Threefoot says.\n\nAfter cutting the cake, Mayor Percy Bland presented the family with a key to the city of Meridian. He talked about his hopes of seeing downtown grow and the future of the Threefoot Building.\n\n\u201cThis city is going to be what\u2019s most important to this administration. What the society has done by staying active and keeping breath inside this building, I think, is going to add to the momentum of what eventually does happen to the Threefoot Building,\u201d Bland says.\n\nHundreds of people had the chance to tour the building and see what the Threefoot Preservation Society has been doing to inform the community about its history, as well as the structural integrity of the building. The Threefoot family says it is excited people are putting care into the family\u2019s building.\n\n\u201cThese are people who have volunteered their time and effort. They\u2019ve\n\njust had it in their heart and soul to keep it alive,\u201d great-granddaughter Shelley Threefoot says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not Threefoots because the Threefoots don\u2019t live here anymore, but these are people who are not related to the Threefoot family. It\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d Tracy Threefoot says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Threefoot building has been a staple in the skyline of Meridian for 85 years now.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "The Threefoot building has been a staple in the skyline of Meridian for 85 years now.", "title": "Threefoot Building Celebrates 85 Years of Standing Tall", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Threefoot-Building-Celebrates-85-Years-of-Standing-Tall-298680761.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FF2/4BB/FF24BB63271E457AAA6109DBEA7B7036", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/393/330/393330B29F194F6FA833248A0DC6480F.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Threefoot building has been a staple in the skyline of Meridian for 85 years now.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Threefoot-Building-Celebrates-85-Years-of-Standing-Tall-298680761.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Threefoot+85.jpg", "title": "Threefoot Building Celebrates 85 Years of Standing Tall", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Threefoot Building Celebrates 85 Years of Standing Tall", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Threefoot Building Celebrates 85 Years"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff7c\"", "article_summary": "The Threefoot Building has been a staple in the skyline of Meridian for 85 years.\nThe Threefoot Preservation Society marks the occasion every year with an open house.\nHe talked about his hopes of seeing downtown grow and the future of the Threefoot Building.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not Threefoots because the Threefoots don\u2019t live here anymore, but these are people who are not related to the Threefoot family.\nThe Threefoot family says it is excited people are putting care into the family\u2019s building."}
