Being in Congress can be exhausting.

Just ask Rep. Mike Honda, D-California, who ran out of gas.

On Friday, he was captured on C-SPAN nodding off while Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard talked about funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

Give Honda credit — he tried to stay awake, with some long, drawn out blinks. Unfortunately, it didn’t work.

And if you think it’s some GIF trickery above, here’s the full video:

While some on Twitter called his nap a symbol of dysfunction in Congress, Honda had a little fun with it.

“I’m tired of the GOP playing games with our national security,” he said, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

This isn’t the first time Honda has appeared to take a nap in a public meeting. In September, 2013, at a town-hall meeting in Fremont that he called to explain Obamacare, he leaned back and nodded off as one of the speakers got into the gritty details.

And Honda’s not alone. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsurg was guilty of doing the same at the State of the Union address.

Honda’s nap once again proves C-SPAN can serve up some real gems.

Just last week, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, threw a snowball on the Senate floor.

There was the time Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland, did the ol’ wink, wink, nod, nod to his mom.

And there was that time Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Florida, appeared to pick his ear, then eat his earwax.
