Jason Rapert at UCA Downtown.\n\nJoining Rapert to discuss such topics as health care, roads, \u201cdark money\u201d in judicial elections and more were Reps. Stephen Meeks, David Meeks, Rick Beck and Douglas House.\n\nUCA Chief of Staff Kelley Erstine moderated the event. Members of the audience gave Erstine cards with questions related to the announced topics and the legislators chose which questions to weigh in on during the event.\n\nDiscussing Arkansas Works, the private option passed in 2013 that uses federal Medicaid money to purchase private insurance for people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, David Meeks said it\u2019s important \u201cto look at the big picture\u201d because \u201cthere are other solutions to health care but the federal government\u201d won\u2019t pass them.\n\nRapert said Arkansas Works was \u201cthe most contentious issue I was ever involved in\u201d and the hardest vote \u2014 in favor of the private option \u2014 he ever cast.\n\n\u201cThe reality of campaigning and the reality of governing are two different things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things we want to change, we can\u2019t change at this level.\u201d\n\nRapert said that at this point, the state is at a \u201cprove it or lose it\u201d stage, reading a letter he received from a local doctor complaining that under the plan, Medicaid paid more than $4,000 for around $1,100 worth of medication.\n\nHouse said that the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, \u201ctook $2.2 billion away from Arkansas hospitals\u201d and he voted to do whatever it took \u201cto keep the hospitals open.\u201d\n\nStephen Meeks said even though he doesn\u2019t support the private option, \u201cit does have some good in it.\u201d\n\nBeck pointed out that federal block grants were \u201ca great thing to come out of this\u201d legislation.\n\n\u201cWe had a committee meeting and after the committee meeting, we were all sitting around talking and another representative came up with a plan and said, \u2018That would probably be a better fit for Arkansas.\u2019 Discussion immediately turns to \u2018Can we get waivers to do that?\u2019\u201d Beck said.\n\nSwitching the discussion to roads, Erstine said the state needs to set aside $50 million in order to be eligible for $200 million annually in federal funds for the highway department and asked the legislators if raising the gas tax is necessary to do it.\n\nDavid Meeks said no.\n\n\u201cRaising the gas tax is not an option to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe there are other solutions. Poor people would be hit the most if the gas tax was raised.\u201d\n\nStephen Meeks said a lot of people don\u2019t grasp how large of an issue this is for the state.\n\n\u201cArkansas is the smallest geographic state west of the Mississippi; however, we ranked 12th in the nation as far as state highway miles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re ranked next to California, so that gives you an idea of just how many highway miles we\u2019re talking [about]. \u2026 I think that all options need to be considered on this issue.\u201d\n\nRapert agreed about the importance of roads.\n\n\u201cRoads are vital. Where roads are, economic development happens, jobs happen,\u201d he said before adding that he doesn\u2019t plan to vote for a new tax.\n\nHouse compared the highway department to a college student \u201cusing Daddy\u2019s credit card,\u201d illustrating that he wants more accountability from the department before \u201chanding over any more money.\u201d\n\nErstine asked the lawmakers, given all of the \u201cdark money\u201d that was used in judicial races in the state this year whether they thought judges should continue to be elected or if they should be appointed.\n\nDavid Meeks said he would be in favor of appointing judges with some caveats including that \u201cthe state Senate has a say in the appointment and they\u2019re not lifetime appointments \u2014 the judge has to go through reappointment process.\u201d\n\nHouse said he would be in favor of a \u201chybrid\u201d process where local judges are elected and judges at the state level are appointed for not more than six years. He said he thinks the state Supreme Court Chief Justice should be chosen by other Supreme Court justices.\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t \u201clocked in\u201d to this plan and would be open to listening to other ideas.\n\nRapert said taking away residents\u2019 right to vote in judicial races was an \u201cimmediate red flag\u201d to him. Instead, he would like to see laws that focus on \u201ctruth in advertising\u201d in political races.\n\n\u201cWe need a higher standard in politics, in general,\u201d he said.\n\nThe discussion that was scheduled to last about an hour and a half \u2014 from 6-7:30 p.m. \u2014 went past 8 p.m., with several residents staying after to approach the legislators with questions of their own.\n\nRapert said he was excited about the turnout and he hopes to organize another town hall meeting in the near future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite rainy weather, dozens of residents packed the Conway Legislative Town Hall hosted by the University of Central Arkansas and Sen.
