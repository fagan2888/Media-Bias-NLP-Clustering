Without expansion, 6.9 million low-income Americans will not get Medicaid assistance, the foundation said.\n\nPolitical divides have stalled the expansion of Medicaid coverage in states concentrated in the South and central West.\n\nIn total, Alaska and other states that have opted out of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion have turned down $472.1 billion in federal funds that would have been used for that purpose from 2014 through 2024, Kaiser said.\n\nSome state lawmakers have said Alaska should not risk the possibility the federal government would pull the program and leave the state committed to something it cannot afford. They also have said Alaska needs to fix its current Medicaid system before it is expanded.\n\n\"It's not the time to dump tens of thousands of people into that system,\" said Republican state Senator Pete Kelly. \"We've got a system that's broken.\"\n\nWalker tried in January to include funding in the current fiscal year's budget for an expansion. Lawmakers removed the funding, saying it required a separate bill.\n\nWalker then introduced a bill in mid-March to expand coverage, but legislators said the current system needed an overhaul, and the proposal stalled after preliminary hearings.\n\nThe debate over Medicaid expansion provisions drove a wedge in budget talks that threatened a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe current budget contained language that blocked Walker from accepting more than $130 million in federal funds, but the lawyers for the state and legislature said those provisions were unconstitutional.\n\n(Additional reporting by Eric M.
