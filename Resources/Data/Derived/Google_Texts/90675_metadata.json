Is there a specific amount of time at which to keep your heart rate up during interval training to receive the most benefit?\n\nA. The answer probably depends on your capacity for suffering, according to scientists who study high-intensity interval training, which is designed to briefly strain your body to its limits. Studies show that these short bursts of very intense exercise lead to beneficial changes similar to those achieved from much longer moderate workouts.\n\nBut precisely how much or how little intense exercise is best remains in question.\n\nWhen Martin Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University, first began studying intervals, he asked young male volunteers to grunt through all-out, 30-second intervals performed at 100 percent of the men\u2019s aerobic capacity. The volunteers became much more fit after a few minutes a week of such strenuous interval training, but they also generally hated the process, Gibala said.\n\nRecently, Gibala and other researchers have been experimenting with intervals as short as 20 seconds performed all-out, as hard as someone possibly can stand, followed by a recovery period of two minutes between each interval. The results so far are encouraging, he said.\n\nFor those like me, who find even 20 seconds of all-out effort daunting, researchers in Denmark have concocted a high-intensity interval training workout that requires only 10-second bursts of burning, painful effort, preceded by 30 seconds of gentle exercise and 20 seconds of moderate effort. I like this workout.\n\n\u2014 Gretchen Reynolds, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/06/1003025720-FL_SHT_hffit09.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0946\"", "article_summary": "Is there a specific amount of time at which to keep your heart rate up during interval training to receive the most benefit?\nThe answer probably depends on your capacity for suffering, according to scientists who study high-intensity interval training, which is designed to briefly strain your body to its limits.\nFor those like me, who find even 20 seconds of all-out effort daunting, researchers in Denmark have concocted a high-intensity interval training workout that requires only 10-second bursts of burning, painful effort, preceded by 30 seconds of gentle exercise and 20 seconds of moderate effort.\nStudies show that these short bursts of very intense exercise lead to beneficial changes similar to those achieved from much longer moderate workouts.\nThe volunteers became much more fit after a few minutes a week of such strenuous interval training, but they also generally hated the process, Gibala said."}
