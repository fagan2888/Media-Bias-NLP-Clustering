Two years later, it relocated to San Diego.\n\nThe company has 14 brands, some acquired through mergers and acquisitions. They include Nursefinders, for local daily nurse placements, and the Merritt Hawkins permanent doctor placement service.\n\nSusan R. Salka joined the company as its first chief financial officer in 1990, and the company name was changed to AMN Healthcare Services in 2001 to reflect that it expended beyond nurses. The company went public in November 2001, raising $170 million.\n\nSalka was named president in 2003 and added the title of chief executive in 2005.\n\nThe latest\n\nLast month, AMN Healthcare reported fourth-quarter net income of $8.4 million, up 18% compared with a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were flat at $248.7 million.\n\nFor the full year of 2013, profit jumped 102% to $32.9 million. Sales increased 6% to more than $1 billion.\n\nIn November, the company acquired ShiftWise, considered a leading provider of workforce vendor management technology software and services in healthcare.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nAMN Healthcare has evolved from a single service \u2014 nurse staffing \u2014 to a much more comprehensive approach in providing healthcare personnel.\n\n\"We have the largest national network of quality clinicians and physicians,\" Salka said, adding that the company now includes other \"customizable solutions that help a hospital or health system manage their entire workforce.\"\n\nUsually, hospitals would have to work with several companies to fulfill their staffing needs, but the company's Managed Services Programs have proved, Salka said, that it can serve as \"a single point of contact\" for \"candidate quality screening, selection and interviews, time-keeping, invoicing and billing.\"\n\nSalka said this \"more efficient process reduces costs and improves the consistency of quality clinicians delivering care for each client.\"\n\nChallenges\n\nOne of the biggest tests the company faces is trying to keep up with the new demands of Obamacare, which could exacerbate other situations, Salka said.\n\n\"We expect that demand will increase over time, as more patients enter the system,\" Salka said, later adding that would \"contribute to more demand for our staffing and workforce solutions.\"\n\nIn addition, nurse and doctor shortages are developing because current professionals are retiring and new ones aren't being trained fast enough, she said.\n\nAnalyst views\n\nWall Street is bullish about the company.\n\nOf seven analysts that regularly follow AMN Healthcare, four have it rated as a strong buy, citing the company's strategic position in relation to the staffing needs of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTwo other analysts rate it as a buy and one considers the stock a hold.\n\nSeparately, Zacks Investment Research, although not regularly covering AHS, recently said \"now could definitely be the time for this breakout candidate.\"\n\nron.white@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @RonDWhite", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "AMN Healthcare Services poised for healthy growth under Obamacare", "Description": "AMN Healthcare Services expects the Affordable Care Act to boost demand for its services.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "In the age of Obamacare , AMN Healthcare Services Inc. would appear to be in a healthy position.", "title": "AMN Healthcare Services poised for healthy growth under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0310-stock-spotlight-amnhealthcare-20140310-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-531d393d/turbine/la-fi-0310-stock-spotlight-amnhealthcare-20140310", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/79573420", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-03-09", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0176\"", "article_summary": "In the age of Obamacare, AMN Healthcare Services Inc. would appear to be in a healthy position.\nThe latestLast month, AMN Healthcare reported fourth-quarter net income of $8.4 million, up 18% compared with a year earlier.\nAMN Healthcare was founded in Las Vegas in 1985 as American Mobile Nurses Inc.
