He\u2019s 6 feet 3 inches tall, which means that squeezing his lanky frame into economy airline seats, crammed against other passengers, can be a challenge.\n\nSo he came up with a scheme particularly for budget carriers that let you pick your own seat. It involves claiming a spot on the aisle and committing to any means necessary to keep the middle seat empty. \u201cThere\u2019s never any leg room on the plane,\u201d said Zabielski, 35. \u201cMy idea is what would you do if you had no shame and were totally obnoxious. What would that look like?\u201d\n\nRelated: The 10 Best Super Bowls of All Time\n\nTrimming your toe nails and letting the clippings fall to the airplane floor, for instance. Flossing your teeth.\n\nPretending you have a quarantine-worthy infectious disease, complete with fake sneezes spewing droplets onto nearby passengers.\n\n\n\nScott Zabielski, whose Doritos Super Bowl commercial won $1 million.

(Photo by Jason Cochard.)\n\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s a winning strategy worthy of a million bucks. Zabielski, who spent much of his high school years at Thomas Jefferson High School in Fairfax County, Va., and is now a California-based television director and producer, took the grand prize in the 2015 Doritos Super Bowl advertisement contest for his 30-second comical sketch, \u201cMiddle Seat.\u201d\n\nIt aired during the Super Bowl last Sunday, one of the coveted breaks that some people watch more closely than the game. The main character in the skit employs a slew of ruses to keep the precious real estate next to him vacant, such as blowing spasmodically into a recorder to emit shrieking whistles.\n\nRelated: When It's Worth Springing for the Travel Upgrade\n\nThe plan works flawlessly until he glimpses a doe-eyed blonde in the crowded aisle on the prowl for a seatmate. His conniving expression reads: Jackpot!\n\nHe hints that the middle seat is available and uses a bag of Doritos as enticement. She smiles appreciatively in return. Then reality hits: a passenger ahead of her moves away to reveal she\u2019s got a squirmy, whimpering infant in her arms.\n\nThe ad was a home-grown idea with a home-grown budget: It cost $2,000 to produce and took just four hours to shoot. It topped 4,900 other entries, and the return on investment was, well, sky high.\n\nZabielski credits his success to the years he attended the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a magnet program in Fairfax County that is considered one of the top-ranked schools in the country. A Chicago native, Zabielski spent his teen years in Oakton, Va.\n\n\u201cI was a science and tech kid,\u201d Zabielski said. \u201cBut I always knew I wanted to make television shows and movies for a living.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hottest Travel Spots for Americans in 2015\n\nHis mentor at TJ, as the school is known, was Ed Montgomery, a 24-year Fairfax veteran who oversaw the school\u2019s video technology and media lab. \u201cYou know it\u2019s fun when you have a good teacher along the way and you do something that makes them proud,\u201d Zabielski said.\n\nMontgomery calls his one-time protege \u201cthe guy who pulled down a million dollars in one night.\u201d \u201cHe had an eye for creating things that people would watch,\u201d said Montgomery, who retired in 2011.\n\nHe helped Zabielski learn the basics of digital video editing on what in the mid-1990s was cutting-edge software known as Video Toaster. In Zabielski\u2019s winning commercial, Montgomery noticed his former student\u2019s signature handiwork, such as the use of lighting to make the lead female character appear to glow on screen and the story\u2019s twist ending.\n\n\u201cWhen he sees the girl and when he sees the baby, that disappointing, quirky facial expression, that kind of sells it right there,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI think a lot of guys can relate to that at one point or another.\u201d\n\nZabielski later graduated from the University of Southern California\u2019s school of cinematic arts and got his start in Hollywood as an editor, using the skills he learned in Montgomery\u2019s class.\n\nRelated: The Business Travel Sector Is Ripe for Reinvention\n\nEarly on, he landed a gig editing a pilot for a television series starring the comedian Daniel Tosh. There, Zabielski has risen to become the director and executive producer of Tosh\u2019s popular Comedy Central show, Tosh.0. \u201cI\u2019m not a stand-up or sketch comedy guy,\u201d Zabielski said. \u201cMy experience is behind the camera. My editing background helps when you\u2019re directing because you already know what shots I\u2019d need and what shots I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRecently seeking a new outlet for his creativity, Zabielski began expressing interest in commercials, speaking to colleagues about the possibilities.\n\n\u201cTheir answer was, \u2018We love what you do in television, but we can\u2019t hire you until you know how to tell a story in 30 seconds,\u2019\u201d Zabielski said. So he decided to make his first commercial on his own budget, calling in favors to get bargain rates on equipment and the airplane set.\n\nZabielski said he learned about the Doritos competition days before the final deadline and submitted the ad on a lark. He now plans to pursue a career in feature films. \u201cI thought I might as well enter it,\u201d said Zabielski, who also secured a year-long contract with Universal Pictures as part of the grand prize. \u201cSo it worked out okay.\u201d\n\nRam Krishnan, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Frito-Lay North America, said the video was a natural match for the Doritos product. \u201c\u2018Middle Seat\u201d is such a great ad \u2014 not only does it fit perfectly with what Doritos is all about, it\u2019s relatable, brings a smile to our consumers and clearly resonates on a global scale \u2014 exactly what you look for in a Super Bowl spot,\u201d Krishnan said.\n\nZabielski said he lucked out with the cast. The main actors \u2014 David Hoffman, a Groundlings improv troupe member, and Michelle LaRue, also a USC alum who was on the school\u2019s \u201cSong Girls\u201d cheerleading squad \u2014 were friends of friends in the business and worked for free.\n\nAt the last minute, Zabielski said he realized he was missing one critical role: the baby. Securing an actor to play the part, Zabielski said, required negotiating with a tough agent \u2014 his wife \u2014 as he sought her permission to enlist the help of their 13-month-old son, Jack.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I agreed that he wasn\u2019t going to be one of those Hollywood kids that someday ends up having a reality show, so we were never going to put him on TV,\u201d Zabielski said. \u201cOnce I realized I needed a baby on short notice, I convinced her to give me a one-time exception. She said okay, but only because this is only for a contest and no one will actually ever see it. And of course, now it\u2019s been seen by 150 million people around the world.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:\n\nWhy Teachers Can't Have Normal Lives\n\nRand Paul's Rude Awakening on the National Stage\n\nScholars Rank Kerry Dead Last in Effectiveness", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A frequent flier, Scott Zabielski faces a common dilemma.", "title": "The Man Who Made a Million on His Doritos Super Bowl Ad", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Man-Who-Made-Million-His-Doritos-Super-Bowl-Ad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/markets-safrica-currency_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Man-Who-Made-Million-His-Doritos-Super-Bowl-Ad", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/markets-safrica-currency_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A frequent flier, Scott Zabielski faces a common dilemma.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Scott Zabielski, whose Doritos Super Bowl commercial won $1 million.\nZabielski said he learned about the Doritos competition days before the final deadline and submitted the ad on a lark.\nAnd of course, now it\u2019s been seen by 150 million people around the world.\u201dThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\nHe hints that the middle seat is available and uses a bag of Doritos as enticement.\nIt involves claiming a spot on the aisle and committing to any means necessary to keep the middle seat empty."}
