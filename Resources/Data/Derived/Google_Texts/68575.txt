The Humane Society of Bay County got a helping hand Saturday morning.

More than 30 local Seminoles participated in the 4th Annual Seminole Service Day.

The Panama City Seminole Club along with staff and students at FSU-Panama City hot a 'dog gone' good time walking and washing the dogs, sweeping the kitty condos, feeding the cats, and even a little lawn mowing.

With more than 70 dogs and cats at the facility, their efforts were very much appreciated.

"It is hard to take out each and every one and hug them for a little bit. We can't do that with all 70 animals with a limited staff and volunteers help out so much," said Sam Sopko, a medical technician.

"The response has been fantastic this year," said Chris Smith, President of the PC Seminole Club. "We probably have more than twice the number of volunteers as last year. Maybe a small part of that is cute ones like these guys help draw them in. But we have had a great effort. Cat people. Dog people. Having a great time today. "

Some Seminoles ended up going home with some furry new family members.
