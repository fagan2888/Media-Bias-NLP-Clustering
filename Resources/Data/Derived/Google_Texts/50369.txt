LANDOVER — Washington Redskins inside linebacker Keenan Robinson is inactive for Sunday’s game against the New Orleans Saints.

Robinson was limited in practice on Thursday and Friday because of a stinger. Will Compton will start in his place alongside Perry Riley.

In eight games this season, Robinson has 56 tackles, an interception and a pass deflection.

The other inactive players are quarterback Robert Griffin III, tight end Anthony McCoy, cornerback Quinton Dunbar, defensive end Frank Kearse, wide receiver Andre Roberts and left guard Arie Kouandjio.

That means cornerback DeAngelo Hall, who has been inactive since spraining a toe on his right foot in a Week 3 loss to the New York Giants, will play for the first time.

Roberts has been battling an unspecified ankle injury this week and was limited in practice all week. Wide receiver Rashad Ross is expected to resume his role as kickoff returner after he was inactive last week.

The Saints‘ inactive players are linebackers Dannell Ellerbe, David Hawthorne and Ramon Humber, cornerback Damian Swann, quarterback Matt Flynn, defensive tackle Kaleb Eulls and offensive tackle Tony Hills.
