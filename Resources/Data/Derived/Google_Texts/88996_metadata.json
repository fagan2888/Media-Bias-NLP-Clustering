She makes her own medical decisions, she says, so why should her parents see her insurance documents before she does?\n\nChurch suspects the snitch was her insurance company\u2019s Explanation of Benefits form, also known as an EOB. That\u2019s the statement that the insurance company\u2014Blue Cross Blue Shield, in her case\u2014sends to the insurance policy holder summarizing the doctor's visit. The form varies between companies, but it usually includes the doctor\u2019s name, the cost of the visit, and the type of service or treatment provided. And because Church is on her parents\u2019 insurance, her father, the policy holder, gets her EOBs sent to his house\u2014standard procedure for most insurers.\n\n\u201cHe was fine with it, but it\u2019s kind of embarrassing,\u201d said Church, a 24-year-old who lives near Indianapolis. \u201cI don't want my dad knowing about my ob-gyn visit.\u201d\n\nWhen Kristen Church learned she was pregnant last fall, she didn\u2019t want to tell her friends and family right away. So it came as a surprise when her father called her a few days after her visit to the ob-gyn.\n\nOne of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d is the one allowing adult children to be added or kept on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26. As a result of the change, 7.2 percent more 19- to 25-year-olds are now insured, and 6 percent more report being in excellent physical health.\n\nBut the benefit comes with a major downside: Though these individuals are often well into independent, adult life in other ways, it\u2019s often their parents who receive their EOBs by default.\n\nThe loophole is especially concerning for women, who might have different reproductive health views than their policyholder parents. In 2013, 45 percent of women aged 18 to 25 were covered on a parent\u2019s plan, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nViews on Privacy and EOBs Among Young Women\n\nThe same survey found that though the vast majority (71 percent) of young women say health privacy is important to them, only 37 percent knew that insurers commonly send EOBs to parents.\n\nThe knowledge that parents might see their medical documents can have a kind of chilling effect. Rebecca Steelman, a 21-year-old who lives in Seattle, said she felt compelled to call her parents in California to inform them that an intrauterine device would soon be popping up on an upcoming EOB. They were supportive, but Steelman says some of her friends haven\u2019t been as lucky.\n\n\u201cI have friends who are scared to have that conversation, so they'll just pay out of pocket or not do the procedure entirely,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're waiting until they're off their parents\u2019 insurance or they're not going to do it at all.\u201d\n\nThe disclosures to parents can extend beyond EOBs, too, in the form of denied claims, marketing materials, or surveys that innocently ask, \u201cHow was your experience at Dr. Psychiatrist\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nAlina Salganicoff, director of women\u2019s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that the non-medical details on paperwork are often enough to determine what kind of provider the person visited, which is particularly an issue with \u201creproductive health services, mental health services, that other services that this group may want to keep private.\u201d\n\nWhile young adults can ask that their EOBs and other documents be sent to their own addresses, there\u2019s no requirement that health plans accept or honor the request, according to Amy Moy, vice president of public affairs at the California Family Health Council.\n\nLast year, California became the first in the country to mandate that health plans honor such \u201cconfidential communication requests\u201d through a state measure that the Health Council co-sponsored. Moy said she hopes that the California law will spur insurers to extend the same privacy protections to young adults in other states.\n\nAnother issue, of course, is that many young people don\u2019t know their parents might be receiving their EOBs\u2014because they don\u2019t know what EOBs are. Only about 12 percent of adults have proficient \u201chealthcare literacy,\u201d meaning they understand common insurance terminology.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are not aware that their personal info is being shared if they use their insurance,\u201d Moy said. \u201cFor example, I know one college student in Michigan who had a pregnancy scare. Months later, she got a call from her mother like, \u2018What is this? I didn't even know you were doing such and such.\u2019 So one of the things we're working on is just letting people know about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many young adults aren&#39;t aware that insurers send documents to the policyholder&#39;s house\u2014a.k.a., their parents", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Many young adults aren&#39;t aware that insurers send documents to the policyholder&#39;s house\u2014a.k.a., their parents", "title": "How Your Parents Can Find Out You're Pregnant Without You Telling Them", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/13243871354_52fcf5becb_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/how-getting-on-a-parents-insurance-can-lead-to-a-loss-of-privacy/373236/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0e0\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the statement that the insurance company\u2014Blue Cross Blue Shield, in her case\u2014sends to the insurance policy holder summarizing the doctor's visit.\nAnd because Church is on her parents\u2019 insurance, her father, the policy holder, gets her EOBs sent to his house\u2014standard procedure for most insurers.\nOne of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d is the one allowing adult children to be added or kept on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26.\nAnother issue, of course, is that many young people don\u2019t know their parents might be receiving their EOBs\u2014because they don\u2019t know what EOBs are.\nShe makes her own medical decisions, she says, so why should her parents see her insurance documents before she does?"}
