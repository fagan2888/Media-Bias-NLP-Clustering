Today, after the failed 2011 \u201cArab Spring\u201d and shake-up of official power, Egypt\u2019s economy is crippled. The tourism industry is dead. Many other vital sectors are in a bad shape, like electricity and gas. Half of the population is on or below the poverty line.\n\nNot surprisingly, ISIS has made inroads. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis (or ABM), the main insurgent group in Egypt, declared allegiance to ISIS earlier this month, and Egyptian affairs experts fear that Egypt is descending into the kind of violence that has crippled state authorities elsewhere. Not only that, Egypt\u2019s influence in the region and its position as a staging ground for Holy Land attacks makes this substantially different than the ISIS targeting of fringe areas.\n\n\u201cThe gradual escalation of violence in Egypt, and particularly in Northern Sinai, is extremely concerning and could herald a new chapter of violent internal conflict for a country that has hitherto been largely peaceful,\u201d said Dr. Nussaibah Younis, a senior research associate at Project On Middle East Democracy.\n\nRelated: Path to Jihad\u2014From Upscale Cairo to ISIS Beheadings\n\nEgypt is the leading country in the Arab world and a major country in both the Islamic world and Africa. When the Free Officers took over Egypt in 1952, similar movements emerged in Iraq, Yemen and Libya. When Egypt\u2019s Nasser leaned to the left, most of the Arab world did as well. When he fought Israel, many other Arabs followed. When Egypt agreed on peace with Israel, others eventually did, too. If Egypt is rocked by Islamic extremism, shock waves will sweep the entire Middle East.\n\nLast October, 31 Egyptian soldiers and police officers were killed in a single day. Sinai governorate of the Islamic State declared its responsibility for the attack in a graphic video. In the same month, three people were beheaded by the militants after being accused of spying for Israel. Early in November, eight navy sailors went missing after an attack in the Mediterranean Sea. These events forced the government to declare a state of emergency in Sinai, impose a nighttime curfew, and evacuate the population in the border with the Gaza strip to build a security zone.\n\n\u201cIn October 2014 alone the ABM group is believed to have carried out a dozen attacks against Egyptian security forces\u2026. Their recent pledge to join ISIS is expected to give them the resources necessary to expand the insurgency,\u201d said Jacob Kennedy, an intelligence analyst at AIG - Global Security Operations Center. \u201cAjnad Misr, a Giza-based Salafist militant group, has claimed responsibility for over a dozen attacks in Cairo and Giza in 2014 and has allegedly worked with ABM. The Arab Gas Pipeline has been blown up nine times this year,\u201d Kennedy, said.\n\nWhile Egypt is facing a surging rebellion in its eastern border, another threat is escalating from the west. \u201cEgypt faces a low-level but potentially combustible security situation on its Western border with Libya, which has become one of the world\u2019s biggest open-air arms markets. In July, Libyan militants killed 21 Egyptian border guards manning the frontier between the two countries,\u201d said Oren Kessler, deputy director of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nRelated: The Coup in Egypt\u2014a Greater Failure than Morsi\n\nLike other countries emerging from a long dictatorship, Egypt came to realize that it was one thing to get rid of an unscrupulous ruler and another to reform a society that was crippled by decades of mismanagement and corruption. The overpopulation, combined with high exposure to the information revolution, the lack of jobs to satisfy angry young Egyptians, and the highly organized Islamic groups led to the dominance of the Muslim Brotherhood on the political life in post Mubarak\u2019s Egypt.\n\nIt is hard to believe that the country that produced one of the greatest peaceful pro-democracy revolutions in modern history in January and February 2011 has unraveled within three years into an ISIS-inspired insurgency and another dictatorship. \u201cAuthoritarianism under the command of a strong executive, which we may refer to as a 'Pharaoh Syndrome,' seems to be a hallmark of Egypt's leaders in the modern era,\u201d said Nicholas A. Heras, a Middle East researcher at the Center for a New American Security, Washington DC.\n\nTHE \"PHARAOH SYNDROME\" SEEMS TO BE A HALLMARK OF EGYPT'S LEADERS IN THE MODERN ERA\n\nEgypt, the North African nation of 87 million people, the most populous in the Arab world, has been in turmoil. The government changed hands from President Mubarak in February 2011 to the army. Then it went to Mohammed Morsi, the first-ever elected civilian Muslim Brotherhood president in 2012, to General Sisi, the army chief, in a widely popular coup in July 2013.\n\nMohammed Morsi\u2019s regime was a turning point in Egypt\u2019s history. After winning the presidential and the two house parliamentary elections, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the mother organization of the largest and the oldest Islamic party in the Arab world, managed to alienate everybody in Egypt with its authoritarian style of governance, including youth, women, the left, the army, the judiciary, the Nassirists, the media, the Christians, the other opposition parties, the former regime loyalists, al-Azhar and even the Islamic Salafists.\n\nRelated: The Merger of ISIS and al-Qaeda Could Cripple the Civilized World\n\nA constitution was drafted and ratified hastily. By the end of June 2013, an uprising erupted that supported a coup that overthrew Morsi. \u201cThe Muslim Brothers are the most hated political group in Egypt today,\u201d said Dr. Abdelmonem Said Aly, the chairman of the board of the Regional Center for Strategic Studies in Cairo.\n\nSoon after, a massive crackdown against the Brotherhood followed. President Morsi was detained then put on trial. The group\u2019s leadership, including its spiritual leader, was arrested. When the group was officially banned, its assets were confiscated and its media organizations shut down. It was labeled a terrorist organization by internal and foreign bodies and a state of emergency was declared. The constitution was suspended and another was ratified. The parliament was dissolved.\n\n\u201cEGYPT\u2019S SUPPORT FOR SISI IS BASED ON A FRIGHTENED MASS, POPULIST FEAR, CREATING THE PERFECT COCKTAIL FOR THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW, EVEN HARSHER AUTHORITARIANISM.\u201d\n\nBecause of its populist roots, civilians paid the price. Tens of thousands of the groups\u2019 members and supporters were arrested. Some estimate the number of detainees as 40,000. Military tribunals were placed in charge of their trials. In one case, 529 members were sentenced to death. It has been estimated that no fewer than 3,000 people were killed in the street violence since the coup. The group had never suffered such a severe suppression since the Nasser era in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cEvery observer of Egypt must be deeply alarmed by the sharp polarization that is dividing the country. Egypt is wracked by severe repression and growing militarism. There is clearly a popular groundswell of support for President al Sisi, but it is based on a frightened mass, populist fear, creating the perfect cocktail for the emergence of a new, even harsher authoritarianism,\u201d said William Youmans, an assistant professor at George Washington University.\n\nBefore the 1970s, the Muslim Brotherhood had an armed wing, but since then, it has declared peaceful means in building its political party. It is undeniable that some of its members and supporters have used violence and sabotage during riots, yet no one proved the group has endorsed such a policy.\u201cThe continued persistence of non-violent protest speaks to the movement\u2019s continued commitment to utilize peaceful means of societal change,\u201d said Youssef Chouhoud, a doctoral fellow at the University of Southern California.\n\nNot everyone is so sure this will be always the case.\n\n\u201cThe removal of the democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi from power through a military coup has been a radicalizing experience for members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists who now believe that they will never be allowed to gain power in Egypt through democratic means,\u201d Dr. Younis said.\n\n\u201cEgypt is on a fast track towards full-scale insurgency because hundreds of thousands of supporters of Islamist parties are being pushed underground and radicalized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect there to be a growth of violent Islamist insurgency in Egypt. Egypt is on a fast track towards full scale insurgency, because it is not allowing any public space for those hundreds of thousands of supporters of Islamist parties to express their disaffection with the current political reality. Those voices are being pushed underground and some are being radicalized. The military coup in Egypt has certainly provided ISIS and Al Qaeda with further material for their propaganda, because it is seen as evidence that no secular government would ever allow Islamists to take power and that democracy is therefore a sham,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated: ISIS Beheads Another American as New 60 Terror Groups Join\n\nYet, Sisi\u2019s crackdown didn\u2019t just target Islamists or the Muslim Brotherhood. Vice President Mohammed al-Baradei, the Nobel Peace prize winner, resigned. Two leaders of the 2011 revolution, Ahmed Maher and Alaa Abdul Fattah, were imprisoned. Three Al Jazeera reporters were imprisoned as well. Most recently, a popular actor was accused of treason by lawyers loyal to the government for criticizing Sisi\u2019s regime.\n\n\u201cAs the military regime and its loyalists on the ground squeeze out dissent, political opposition is forced into the shadows. Meanwhile, the people with the best chance of saving the country, the activists who brought the end of Mubarak, are being silenced and pushed further into the margins; we will see it become even more of a police state run by the military. Egypt, I fear, is sacrificing its future,\u201d added Youmans.\n\nSince Sisi\u2019s coup, the new \u201cPharaoh\u201d has perfected his image. A nationwide campaign is being conducted to present General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as the man who saved Egypt from the Muslim Brotherhood. He now enjoys presidential and parliamentary authorities combined. Some observers refuse the comparison. \u201cIt is unfair to describe Sisi as a new Pharaoh. Pharaohs did great things to Egypt but Sisi is a mere dictator that only cares about power and consolidating his autocratic regime,\u201d said Dr. Khalil al-Anani, an Egyptian professor at Georgetown University.\n\nIf there is any historical precedent for Egypt\u2019s crackdown on Islamists, it may be events in Algeria, twenty years ago. In December 1991, the Algerian army forced the reformist President to resign after an Islamic party won the first round of the general election. Soon afterward, a decade-long civil war began that claimed about 150,000 lives and left deep dividing wounds in the Algerian society. The Algerian army is still in power as it has been since 1965. Whether or not Sisi\u2019s Egyptian military will remain as long has yet to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian military has a lot of interests and seeks to protect them. It doesn't care much about people's rights or interests. The July 3 [2013] coup is the main vehicle for radicalization for not only Islamists but all young revolutionaries who are driven now by despair and are disillusioned. Sisi's repressive policies could turn Egypt into a new Algeria where radicals would use violence against the state and society,\u201d Dr. al-Anani said.\n\n\u201cThe military \u2026 dissolved the Islamist-led Parliament days before the election even took place, exposing a power struggle that ultimately doomed the nation\u2019s bid for democracy from the beginning.\u201d\n\nSome argue that Sisi\u2019s coup helped the cause of the Muslim Brotherhood. \u201cThe military\u2019s takeover certainly delegitimized the revolution\u2019s more genuine elements of calls for democratic change,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThe military did not give Egyptians a chance to vote and remove the Muslim Brotherhood from power peacefully. The military \u2026 dissolved the Islamist-led Parliament days before the election even took place, exposing a power struggle that ultimately doomed the nation\u2019s bid for democracy from the beginning.\u201d\n\nKennedy said Sisi\u2019s oppressive regime has only made the Muslim Brotherhood stronger. Once reviled, the Brotherhood is now the underdog, wronged by military thugs in an unlawful power play.\n\nThere is a grave risk in crushing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, with implications for the region and the world. The group claims it has 600,000 members, but some say only 100,000 are truly committed. Whatever number used, it is the largest Islamist party in the Arab world. Since its formation in 1928, it has survived numerous suppression campaigns by several Egyptian governments. These campaigns only succeeded in producing splintering hardline groups that terrorized Egypt, the region and the world.\n\nOne of those products was the current chief of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 14 during the 1960s and saw his comrades detained, tortured and executed under President Nasser\u2019s government. He then formed his first secret cell to overthrow the regime.\n\nAnother example is the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayub al-Masri, who also joined the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as a teenager. When Zawahiri formed his al-Jihad organization, the group assassinated former Egyptian president Sadat in October 1981. After this, a military crackdown was launched against the brotherhood and al-Masri became further radicalized by joining Zawahiri\u2019s splinter group, providing him formative training for his own leadership in terror organizations now dominating Middle East politics.\n\nRelated: 5 Countries With the Biggest Terror Targets on Their Backs\n\nWhile Egypt is in desperate need of stability and control, authoritarian politics is the wrong answer. \u201cThere was certainly a radicalizing impact that resulted from the illegitimate ouster of a legitimately elected president,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI do believe the next iteration of severe radicalization is teetering dangerously above already-rising Salafi jihadism and (extremist) Islamism in the country. Sisi\u2019s harsh stance against Islamists, however, will suppress the group\u2019s logistical functions, operational mobility and ideological freedoms, which in turn will produce the similar oppressive environment that facilitated Zawahiri and al-Masri\u2019s radical Islamic development,\u201d added Mr. Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare of Egyptian security planners is an organized, armed rebellion against the al-Sisi government on the Egyptian mainland, not necessarily in the Sinai, where the country's huge urban population is located and where the competition for essential resources such as water, electricity, food, jobs, etc. will be fiercest,\u201d Heras said. \u201cThese very real and widely-felt existential concerns, which are severely exacerbated by the weak Egyptian economy, are strong factors that could collapse the al-Sisi government, and its potential successors\u201c, he added.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see what happens when the Gulf spigot runs dry and Sisi must rely on domestic factors to shore up the economy,\u201d Chouhoud said. \u201cClearly, if the economy goes south, his popularity will wane. The prospect of that scenario grows in likelihood the longer the tourism sector remains depressed\u2014and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any indication that the ethnocentrism and suspicion of foreigners that is in part keeping tourists away from Egypt will abate anytime soon.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Egypt has historically been one of the most stable countries in the Middle East.", "title": "Egypt, the Most Important Arab Nation, Is an ISIS Target", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/24/Egypt-Most-Important-Arab-Nation-ISIS-Target", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06162011_Arab_Spring_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/24/Egypt-Most-Important-Arab-Nation-ISIS-Target", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06162011_Arab_Spring_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@AlhamdaniRiyadh"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Egypt has historically been one of the most stable countries in the Middle East.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc17\"", "article_summary": "Related: ISIS Beheads Another American as New 60 Terror Groups JoinYet, Sisi\u2019s crackdown didn\u2019t just target Islamists or the Muslim Brotherhood.\nThere is a grave risk in crushing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, with implications for the region and the world.\nAnother example is the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Ayub al-Masri, who also joined the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as a teenager.\nWhether or not Sisi\u2019s Egyptian military will remain as long has yet to be seen.\nA nationwide campaign is being conducted to present General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as the man who saved Egypt from the Muslim Brotherhood."}
