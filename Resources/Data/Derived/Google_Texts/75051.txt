LONG HILL — Police continue to search for a Morris County man who left his home for a walk more than a week ago and never returned.

David Bird, a 55-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter, was last seen leaving his home in the Millington section of Long Hill on the afternoon of Jan. 11.

Long Hill police were seen searching along railroad tracks behind Greenwood Drive this morning.

Township police, who are leading the investigation, directed questions to the Morris County Prosecutor's Office. Thomas Zelante, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said this afternoon that the search is continuing today.

There have been no major developments in the search, Zelante said.

Last week police told NJ.com that while people would continue searching the area, more attention was being focused on other areas of their investigation.

"We're looking at what activity he had on his computers, on his phone, at his work," Chief Michael Mazzeo said Wednesday.

Hundreds of people have been involved in the search operation since Bird reportedly left his home for a walk ahead of an expected storm eight days ago. Bird is a local Scout leader an avid hiker.

He is required to take medication for a liver transplant twice a day, but he left the medication home when he went out for his walk, police said.

Bird is described as white, 6 feet and 1 inches in height, approximately 200 pounds, partially balding with gray hair and with a gray beard. He was last seen wearing a distinct bright red jacket with two yellow zippers.
