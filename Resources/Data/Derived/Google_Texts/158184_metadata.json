Why don\u2019t we just say they have these death camps they will send people to and let them go die?\u201d\n\n(Give it a few years.)\n\nCo-host Andre Tantaros said President Obama\u2019s own words had opened the door to the conversation.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe Mark Halperin, why not listen to what President Barack Obama himself has said?\u201d she asked, quoting the president: \u201cThe chronically ill and those towards the end of their lives account for potentially 80 percent of the total health care bill. We have to have a very difficult conversation about this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe conversation was apparently too difficult for Beckel, though.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation! We can\u2019t go any deeper in Obamacare than saying \u2018You\u2019re all going to die,\u2019\u201d he said, truthfully enough. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s absolutely nuts!\u201d\n\nBolling, who described Beckel as the show\u2019s \u201cresident liberal on Obamacare\u201d started to prove it up summing up Beckel\u2019s argument as essentially ignorance.\n\nThat\u2019s when Beckel showed his real intellectual, liberal chops.\n\n\u201cI have an idea of what it was, and what it is is bullshit,\u201d he said.\n\nQuod erat demonstratum, Mr. Beckel.\n\n[poll id=\u201d143\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A prominent liberal columnist\u2019s admission that the \u201cdeath panels\u201d Sarah Palin warned about really are and always have been a part of Obamacare caused a blowup Tuesday on Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Five,\u201d when host Eric Bolling said \u201cliberal royalty\u201d owes Palin an apology.
