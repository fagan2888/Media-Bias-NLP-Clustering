The debate will be live-streamed at 7 p.m. ET on CNN.com, and CNN's \"Piers Morgan Live\" will host both Ham and Nye at 9 p.m. Tuesday after the debate.\n\nOpinion by Bill Nye, Special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - A lot of people have been asking why I accepted Ken Ham\u2019s invitation to debate the origins of life Tuesday night at the Creation Museum in Kentucky.\n\nIn short, I decided to participate in the debate because I felt it would draw attention to the importance of science education here in the United States.\n\nWhat keeps this country in the game economically is our ability to innovate. New ideas lead to new technologies, which drive new businesses and new opportunities.\n\nTechnological innovations absolutely cannot be created without fundamental understanding of science, the means by which we know nature.\n\nHow many young adults and taxpayers use mobile phones? How many of us rely on global navigation systems that use satellites high above the Earth\u2019s surface to find our way around?\n\nEven if you eschew smartphones, you rely on the system to keep airplanes in the sky and ships at sea on their routes. Modern farmers plant seeds in fields with extraordinary precision using information beamed from satellites in space.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Ken Ham: Why I'm Debating Bill Nye\n\nFor the United States to maintain its leadership in technology, we need well-educated science students. To allow our students to come of age without the knowledge gained through the extraordinary scientific insights and diligence of our ancestors would deprive them of understanding of nature and our place in the cosmos.\n\nIt would also rob our students of their future. Without scientists and engineers to create new technologies and ways of doing society\u2019s business, other economies in other countries will out-compete the United States and leave our citizens behind.\n\nTuesday's debate will be about whether Ham\u2019s creation model is viable or useful for describing nature. We cannot use his model to predict the outcome of any experiment, design a tool, cure a disease or describe natural phenomena with mathematics.\n\nThese are all things that parents in the United States very much want their children to be able to do; everyone wants his or her kids to have common sense, to be able to reason clearly and to be able to succeed in the world.\n\nThe facts and process of science have enabled the United States to lead the world in technology and provide good health for an unprecedented number of our citizens. Science fuels our economy. Without it, our economic engine will slow and eventually stop.\n\nIt seems to me that Ham is a fundamentalist. Around the world there are billions of people, who embrace the facts and process of modern science, and they enjoy their faith. By all accounts, their faith enriches their lives. These people have no conflict with their faith and science. Ham is unique in this regard.\n\nFundamentally, Ham\u2019s creation model is not part of modern science. His idea has no predictive quality or ability. It provides no means to learn more about the world around us. It does not enable students to make consistent sense of nature.\n\nSo, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see if his model stands up to traditional scientific inquiry: If a certain claim is true, then we would expect a certain outcome.\n\nI\u2019m excited and very much looking forward to the encounter.\n\nBill Nye is a science educator and CEO of the Planetary Society.
