As with, yes, Breaking Bad, the show's actors and writers know how to wring tension from deception. The question of why people betray and what happens when they do powered all the action surrounding Season 1\u2019s investigation of Nicholas Brody, from the portrayal of the Sgt.\u2019s radicalization to the drama engendered by his dishonesty at home to Carrie\u2019s off-books obsession with his loyalty. Later, we got onto other topics Homeland doesn\u2019t handle so well\u2014the passions that drive love and revenge, mental illness as a reflection of deep-seated somethings, kids as reckless drivers, etc.\u2014and the twists that piled up felt like tedium.\n\nKidding, mostly. The show that Homeland actually aped in tonight\u2019s episode, \u201cA Red Wheelbarrow,\u201d was its old self. Certainly Carrie defying orders, jeopardizing everything, and striding forward Lone Wolf McQuade style as Quinn and the viewer shouted WHAT ARE YOU DOING? evoked familiar feelings. But even beyond that scene\u2014which ended with Quinn non-lethally shooting our hero, in another sign that Season 3\u2019s more interested in punishing its characters than vindicating them\u2014the series tonight helped remind why, exactly, anyone started watching this thing in the first place.\n\nBut tonight offered a parade of liar lying for reasons noble and not, and the results intrigued well enough. The central caper in which the CIA \u201cflushed out\u201d its own betrayer offered a web of high-stakes fakery: Carrie keeping up the traitorous act she\u2019s playing for those traitorous lawyers, those traitorous lawyers in turn murdering the traitorous (and shlubby) CIA bomber. Intervene in that murder, as Quinn says, and you blow the larger lie of the operation\u2014which, in truth, could have more devastating effects on national security.\n\nCarrie stammers in the ambulance that something\u2019s wrong, and she\u2019s right; Saul, her mentor and confidante, has been duping her. We don\u2019t yet know what he\u2019s up to\u2014or how he knows Brody\u2019s location, his relationship to the Tower of David posse, and what this all has to do with regime change in Iran\u2014but we do know there's a nice new note of tension in the show: For once, he\u2019s misleading Carrie and not vice versa.\n\nThe emergence of Saul the schemer has been one of this disjointed season\u2019s main throughlines, and it\u2019ll probably end in disaster. The apparent success of Operation Javadi has given him swagger\u2014demonstrated with him kicking Lockhart out of a White House briefing and with his newly copacetic home life\u2014but the show keeps spiking it with creepy vibes. Remember a few episodes back when there was that leering camera angle on Saul as he gleefully learned that Carrie had been kidnapped? Remember Javadi repeatedly saying Saul\u2019s M.O. is to endanger the people who trust him? As mentioned before, this season seems obsessed with punishing the characters, with making them confront the implications of their amorality. So while his obfuscation at the moment may seem like a white lie, it\u2019s likely it\u2019ll have dark consequences.\n\nOne of those consequences possibly in the making: The data thievery by Mira\u2019s Mumbai man. Here, again, is betrayal on betrayal\u2014Saul\u2019s negligence leading to Mira\u2019s infidelity leading to an apparent enemy spy in the CIA director\u2019s home. If this guy\u2019s working for Iran and gets the intel on what Javadi\u2019s up to, the game changes in ways unfavorable to world peace.\n\nHomeland's haters act like it should ditch domestic drama, but betrayal at home sits at the heart of the show.\n\nSpeaking of the Berenson residence: Homeland's latter-day haters\u2014myself included\u2014tend to act like the show should just stick to CIA machinations and ditch domestic drama. The truth, though, is that familial concerns sit at the heart of the show\u2014note the first syllable of its title\u2014and in Season 1 the Brody residence offered a lab test for what happens when the compromised consciences created by warfare come home. With Brody gone and the emotional effects of his betrayals made amply clear, the travails of Jessica, Dana, and Chris became predictable and tiresome. But now, we get a deeper investigation of the strains that spying puts on a marriage, and the question of whether the people drawn to the profession can ever make loyal partners. Mira had started to believe \u201cyes\u201d again, but then Saul blithely dropped the fact that he\u2019s taking a week-long trip to areas unknown, and that old feeling came back\u2014yes, betrayal.\n\nSeven-hundred words into a Homeland recap without a single grouse about plausibility? To be sure, I\u2019m not ready to praise this episode as more logically coherent as any other. But the fact that I walked away thinking through the thematic implications of everything that had gone on, and that I\u2019m trying to guess ahead at where this all goes rather than untangle the crappiness of what\u2019s transpired, might mean that for the first time in a while, something\u2019s gone right on this show. Of course, don't expect that to last; by now, it's clear, Homeland is not to be trusted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As tonight&#39;s episode reminded, the show only works when everyone&#39;s betraying everyone else.", "author": "Spencer Kornhaber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "As tonight&#39;s episode reminded, the show only works when everyone&#39;s betraying everyone else.", "title": "What Homeland Does Right", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/homeland_308_650_quinn/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-em-homeland-em-does-right/281581/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca723\"", "article_summary": "Carrie stammers in the ambulance that something\u2019s wrong, and she\u2019s right; Saul, her mentor and confidante, has been duping her.\nThe show that Homeland actually aped in tonight\u2019s episode, \u201cA Red Wheelbarrow,\u201d was its old self.\nOf course, don't expect that to last; by now, it's clear, Homeland is not to be trusted.\nSeven-hundred words into a Homeland recap without a single grouse about plausibility?\nBut tonight offered a parade of liar lying for reasons noble and not, and the results intrigued well enough."}
