In driving to new heights of the healthcare facilities' award-winning commitment to excellence in clinical care and the patient experience, The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center determined the need for securing a technology partner who combined cutting-edge patient entertainment and information solutions to enhance patient satisfaction and aid in providing a patient engagement focus.\n\nA hospital-wide solution of the latest in IPTV technology was completed to aid in providing superior performance in delivering high quality, efficient, and blockbuster patient entertainment and amenities. To support this vision, TeleHealth Services implemented a comprehensive IPTV hospital television system as a platform to expand the reach of their digital media resources. The hospital's IPTV solution offers a range of popular TV channels in HD, an interactive programming guide, and expansion for the inception of an OSUTV branded channel. Additionally, the solution can monitor and control all TV functions remotely, and has been architected to ensure failover protection if the server or network fails. The hospital's IPTV system also offers management features to ensure parental security settings for safeguarded viewing. By creating a more home-like entertainment experience through HD programming and large screen healthcare televisions provided within the inpatient setting, the technology aims to provide increased levels of patient experience. Based on their ability to provide a full technology solution and a wealth of experience in the healthcare industry, The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center turned to TeleHealth Services for their solutions.\n\nBy creating a high-quality, cost effective patient education and entertainment portal, and integrating additional levels of support tools within the patient care environment, The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center will increasingly find the advantages of transmitting information to patients via television to provide welcome distractions, change health behaviors and educate the patient, while decreasing operating costs. Additionally, the hospital's IPTV solution is aiding in creating efficiencies for hospital staff. With the inception of the Affordable Care Act, technical staff resources have become one of the most coveted resources within a hospital facility, and the IPTV solution allows them to spend more time focusing on their core competencies versus traditional coaxial systems.\n\n\"This again demonstrates the power of our advanced patient engagement platform to handle innovative new healthcare features and provide the powerhouse capabilities to deliver content around the hospital. We have created a patient experience that demonstrates our commitment to enhance our client hospitals in the digital world by leapfrogging even consumer technology to create enhanced patient experiences.
