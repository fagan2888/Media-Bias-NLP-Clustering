Will Republicans win back control of the Senate? Most political forecasters give Democrats a minuscule chance of taking back the House of Representatives, so most attention will be on the six seats Republicans need to have the majority in the upper chamber.\n\nThe seven most vulnerable seats all belong to Democrats right now: Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia.\n\n2. Will Congress pass immigration reform? A bill has passed the Senate but House leaders refuse to bring it up. Considering the inability of this Congress to pass almost anything, it's hard to give much hope to immigration reform \u2014 particularly in an election year.\n\nHowever, two things could force the issue. First, national Republicans know they must improve the party's standing with Hispanic voters and immigration reform is a key issue for this increasingly important voting bloc. Second, Speaker John Boehner has given signs he may move pieces of the Senate bill independently.\n\n3. Will there be another fiscal showdown? Despite a bipartisan budget deal earlier this month, another major battle could be coming in the New Year over the debt ceiling. The federal government is expected to exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of February.\n\nThough many Republicans want to use the event as leverage over the Obama administration to cut spending or tie it to legislation the White House opposes, the politics are brutal for the GOP. The self-inflicted wounds of the government shutdown on the Republican party are still raw and could act to prevent a major battle.\n\n4. Will ObamaCare be a big issue for the midterm elections? Republicans will do everything in their power to tie the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act to Democrats like they did in the 2010 midterms. It helped them retake control of the House.\n\nBut the White House is throwing every resource at their disposal to get the law implemented and move beyond the problems that crippled the health care exchange website. If millions of people are getting health insurance they otherwise could not afford by summer, it could end up being a non-issue or even a positive for Democrats.\n\n5. Who knows? Politics is amazingly unpredictable except one thing is almost certain: There is usually a big political story we cannot predict.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/articles/453719/5-important-political-stories-watch-2014", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/55943_article_full.jpg?itok=AaV-ry9P", "type": "article", "title": "5 important political stories to watch in 2014"}, "twitter": {"description": "", "creator": "@politicalwire", "image": {"src": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/55943_article_full.jpg?itok=AaV-ry9P"}, "title": "5 important political stories to watch in 2014", "site": "@theweek", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 10716057521}, "keywords": "feature, Politics, analysis", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-27T13:13:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec12\"", "article_summary": "Considering the inability of this Congress to pass almost anything, it's hard to give much hope to immigration reform \u2014 particularly in an election year.\nFirst, national Republicans know they must improve the party's standing with Hispanic voters and immigration reform is a key issue for this increasingly important voting bloc.\nPolitics is amazingly unpredictable except one thing is almost certain: There is usually a big political story we cannot predict.\nWill Congress pass immigration reform?\nBut the White House is throwing every resource at their disposal to get the law implemented and move beyond the problems that crippled the health care exchange website."}
