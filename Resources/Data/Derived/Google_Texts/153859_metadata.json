But not one of those would rival President Barack Obama\u2019s current dare to congressional Republicans to impeach him.\n\nIf Republicans take up the dare, it would cost them the Senate in 2014, the presidency in 2016 and relevance for perhaps a decade or more. And that includes if Obama takes out his pen and phone and signs an executive order legalizing millions of undocumented immigrants. Even if a Republican could get elected president in, say, 2020, Democrats then would be in position to impeach with political impunity 20 minutes after the inauguration ended.\n\nThis is bad governance, bad politics and bad strategy. It would be political suicide even to contemplate it seriously.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nAnd it\u2019s not being contemplated by serious people. But mere discussion of impeachment by fringe players, such as Sarah Palin and Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, has enabled Democrats to raise millions of dollars with desperate email appeals to \u201chave Barack\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the fringe of the Democratic Party that talks about impeachment. It\u2019s the marquee names \u2014 Obama, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden \u2014 who push the I word. And it\u2019s not hard to figure out why. Democrats face a turnout debacle in 2014. Their younger voters are less enthusiastic. The independents who twice made Obama president are not on board. Current polling gives Republicans a 14-point engagement advantage. And this time around, it\u2019s been Democratic candidates \u2014 Bruce Braley, running for Senate in Iowa, for example \u2014 whose missteps have dominated campaign coverage.\n\n[COMMENTARY: Boehner's Lawsuit Gets the OK]\n\nThe Democrats also want to talk impeachment because they don\u2019t want to talk about the lawsuit House Republicans are considering filing. Jonathan Turley, the George Washington University law professor and most-of-the-time Obama supporter, says Congress must press this case to restore our nation\u2019s checks and balances. He and others believe Republicans could well win the case on its merits.\n\nThat explains the \u201cfact sheet,\" duly lapped up by the administration\u2019s sycophants in the press, that says no Congress has ever sued a sitting president. In fact, members of Congress have sued a sitting president 14 times since Watergate. It\u2019s why President Obama attempts to conflate the two when he can \u2014 to make the low-information voters who form his base think the lawsuit equals impeachment. It\u2019s why he says \u201cstop just hatin\u2019 all the time,\u201d because he knows questions of executive power relative to Congress have been bubbling to the surface for decades and are now ripe for a court challenge. Whether it\u2019s immigration or the environment or unilateral changes to the Affordable Care Act, there is a growing sense the Supreme Court needs to create a bright line that defines the limits of presidential power.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nThere is some risk for Republicans in taking this on. But at least they can say they are fighting for important principles, addressing concerns that have been building over several administrations and not playing for the crowd. Democrats can\u2019t say any of that, but given who their crowd is, it may not matter.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Can't Accept Obama's Impeachment Dare", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Attempting to oust the president would be a boneheaded move for Republicans.", "title": "Don't Accept Obama's Impeachment Dare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/ford-oconnell/2014/08/01/republicans-cant-accept-obamas-impeachment-dare", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ef/d066fb12237a44015854d885e8bef8/media:055bf51d276642858409e989fc866de1Obama.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Republicans Can't Accept Obama's Impeachment Dare", "description": "Attempting to oust the president would be a boneheaded move for Republicans.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Aug. 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Ford O'Connell,Obama, Barack,Republican Party,politics,impeachment,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Attempting to oust the president would be a boneheaded move for Republicans."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd65b\"", "article_summary": "But not one of those would rival President Barack Obama\u2019s current dare to congressional Republicans to impeach him.\nThe independents who twice made Obama president are not on board.\n[COMMENTARY: Boehner's Lawsuit Gets the OK]The Democrats also want to talk impeachment because they don\u2019t want to talk about the lawsuit House Republicans are considering filing.\nDemocrats can\u2019t say any of that, but given who their crowd is, it may not matter.\nThis is bad governance, bad politics and bad strategy."}
