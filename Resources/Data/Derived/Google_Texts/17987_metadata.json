But we have a problem in New Mexico. We have a statute that created the New Mexico Medical Insurance Pool and since that statute is active and in place, we have to make sure we don\u2019t violate that.\u201d\n\nFranchini said his office is working on legislation to limit the pool\u2019s population.\n\nThere are currently 5,600 patients in the New Mexico Medical Insurance Pool, Franchini said, compared to about 10,000 at the beginning of last year.\n\nFranchini said he\u2019d like to see the numbers reduced to \u201cno more than 1,000 \u2014 that\u2019s my expectation.\u201d\n\nBut if the ACA prohibits insurance companies from denying patients with preexisting medical conditions, why does the pool still exist?\n\n\u201cI think the answer is: not every New Mexican can avail themselves of the Obamacare system,\u201d said Gabriel Parra, staff attorney for Presbyterian Healthcare Services and a member of the NMMIP board. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to put New Mexicans at risk by kicking them out of the pool and we wanted to do that in a more thoughtful way.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico isn\u2019t alone.\n\nAccording to the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans, 35 states had high-risk insurance plans before the ACA went into effect.\n\nOf those, 12 states have eliminated their pools and six are the process of shutting them down, but 17 other states haven\u2019t made any specific plans to drain their pools, so to speak. Click here to see the state-by-state breakdown.\n\nBut won\u2019t there come a time when the existence of the pool is superfluous?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a matter of great debate among the board members,\u201d said board vice chairman Jason Sandel. \u201cSome folks feel like it needs to happen by Dec. 31, 2014. Others feel that, based upon the experience of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that that period be extended to 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be down to zero because I think there will always be a few people in transition that are going to need a safety net for a short period of time,\u201d said Franchini in a telephone interview with New Mexico Watchdog. \u201cWe have some people in the pool who have no other place to go.\u201d\n\nExamples include those who are under the age of 65 who are buying Medicare supplements through the pool and patients with severe kidney problems that are on dialysis.\n\nThere\u2019s also another wrinkle: While those who are in the country illegally cannot sign up under the ACA, there are people who are not U.S. citizens in the New Mexico high-risk pool. That\u2019s because there is no requirement for proof of citizenship, only for residency, to be eligible for the New Mexico plan.\n\nOfficials say most of the undocumented patients in the pool are sick children.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about over 200 children,\u201d Franchini said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking right now at how we\u2019re going to have that funding source provide these same kind of coverages for these children outside of the pool \u2026 They\u2019ll probably end up going to one to four insurance companies that will spread the risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically speaking, there has been no citizenship test to access care through the pool,\u201d said Parra. \u201cHow we deal with them is really a question for the Legislature because the statute doesn\u2019t give (the board) the authority \u2026 to exclude them.\u201d\n\nThe New Mexico Medical Insurance Pool board of directors in March extended its contract with the Delta Consulting Group, based in Albuquerque, to continue managing the operation of state\u2019s high risk pool.\n\nFranchini said the contract pays Delta and its president and executive director of the pool, Debbie Armstrong, up to $600,000 \u2014 a $300,000 base package, plus another $300,000 in incentives to bring the numbers in the pool down to what the board considers to be a minimal level.\n\nNot every member of the board thought a contract worth up to $600,000 was appropriate.\n\n\u201cI personally think that it\u2019s a little much,\u201d said Sandel, who voiced concerns over the bonus package. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of incentive built into that contract \u2026 to move people out of the pool.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, it really wasn\u2019t an incentive to move them out as it was a recognition that as you move people out it takes work,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\n\u201cThe incentive program is a very fair one,\u201d Franchini said. \u201cIt saves the medical insurance pool and the state of New Mexico huge amounts of money.\u201d\n\nFranchini said depopulating the pool could translate into savings of $80 million in premiums for insurance companies in the state. \u201cIt is very hard to do this work.\u201d\n\nAs for the long-term existence of the pool in New Mexico, that\u2019s still up in the air.\n\n\u201cWe ought to be thoughtful and predictive on how we depopulate the pool, \u201d Sandel said. \u201cIn other words, that we don\u2019t just hope people leave, that people begin to build an expectation of when it is that their coverage is going to end.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to get this pool as small as possible as soon as possible,\u201d Franchini said, \u201cand get all those people into Medicaid or the state exchange.\u201d\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Since Obamacare is the law of the land, why does the New Mexico high-risk insurance pool still exist?", "title": "Despite Obamacare, NM's high-risk insurance pool stays afloat -
