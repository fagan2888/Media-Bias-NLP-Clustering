Gray\u2019s \u201cshadow campaign\u201d also funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to aid Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bid for the White House.\n\nJeffrey E. Thompson\u2019s scheme included diverting more than $608,000 in illicit funds to a New York marketing executive, Troy White, who organized \u201cstreet teams\u201d to raise Mrs. Clinton\u2019s visibility in urban areas during her Democratic primary battle against Barack Obama. Mr. White pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case.\n\nProsecutors said that from February to May 2008, Thompson used two firms to disburse $608,750 in \u201cexcessive and unreported contributions to pay for campaign services in coordination with and in support of a federal political candidate for president of the United States and the federal and the candidate\u2019s authorized committee.\u201d That candidate was Mrs. Clinton.\n\nSEE ALSO: Prosecutors: Gray had firsthand knowledge of \u2018shadow campaign\u2019\n\nMr. Obama, too, received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Thompson and his employees, although those donations apparently were legal.\n\nU.S. Attorney Ron Machen said there was no indication that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the specific activities to aid her campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are varying degrees of knowledge among the different candidates,\u201d Mr. Machen said.\n\nSEE ALSO: SIMMONS: Too close to Thompson\u2019s tangled web, Mayor Gray should go\n\nAn attorney for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2008, Lyn Utrecht, has said the campaign cooperated fully with prosecutors and never hired Mr. White to work on the presidential race. She said the campaign committee \u201cturned down Mr. White\u2019s services.\u201d\n\nBut news reports last fall indicated that a top Clinton adviser, Minyon Moore, facilitated a meeting between Mr. White and Thompson. Ms. Utrecht did not return a request for comment Monday, nor did Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top spokesman, Philippe Reines.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman at the time was Terry McAuliffe, now governor of Virginia. Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s gubernatorial campaign said last year that it would not return a $2,500 donation that Thompson made in 2009.\n\nThe revelations are raising untimely, for Mrs. Clinton, reminders of fundraising improprieties just as her supporters are gearing up for a probable run for the presidency in 2016.\n\nIn 2007, when Mrs. Clinton was considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, she took the unprecedented step of returning $850,000 in contributions raised by Norman Hsu, a top campaign bundler who was wanted on criminal charges in a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. At the time, Clinton campaign officials said they would undertake \u201cvigorous\u201d extra vetting procedures to make sure her sources of campaign funds were legitimate.\n\nIn 2009, a federal judge sentenced Hsu to more than 24 years in prison for violating campaign finance laws and defrauding investors.\n\nThe Hsu scandal, in turn, brought unwelcome reminders for Mrs. Clinton of her husband\u2019s fundraising controversies in the 1990s, including Little Rock businessman Charlie Trie. In that episode, about $640,000 was returned or refused after accusations that Trie funneled fraudulent donations.\n\nThere was also the case of businessman Johnny Chung, in which the Democratic National Committee returned more than $360,000 in donations raised during President Clinton\u2019s 1996 re-election bid. Chung admitted that he accepted some of the money from Chinese military officials.\n\nIn the Thompson case, prosecutors said Mr. Gray knew about the illegal shadow campaign. But Mr. Gray\u2019s defenders are now using the example of Mrs. Clinton to bolster their argument that the mayor had no knowledge of Thompson\u2019s illicit fundraising.\n\n\u201cNo one has suggested that Hillary Clinton knew of Thompson\u2019s illegal activities,\u201d said Chuck Thies, manager for the Vince Gray 2014 campaign. \u201cMayor Gray has not been afforded the same presumption of innocence.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity reported last year that Thompson and other donors who listed his accounting firm as their employer gave at least $514,350 to federal candidates and political action committees since the 2002 campaign cycle. The biggest beneficiary of those funds was Mrs. Clinton, whose campaigns took in $50,400. Her presidential campaign committee received $40,300 from employees at Thompson\u2019s firm in November 2007, when she attended a fundraiser at the company\u2019s headquarters in the District.\n\nOther recipients included Mr. Obama ($14,500 in the 2008 cycle), Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry ($20,000 in the 2004 cycle), presidential candidate John McCain ($13,800 in the 2008 cycle) and Sen. Harry Reid ($9,600 in 2009).\n\nThompson personally made political contributions totaling at least $215,000 in that period.\n\nCraig Holman, a campaign finance specialist at the watchdog group Public Citizen in Washington, said shadow campaigns are becoming common with the expansion of political action committees.\n\n\u201cOf all the super PACs involved in the 2012 federal elections, 58 percent supported a single candidate \u2014 established and run by friends, family or former campaign staff of that single candidate. This is a shadow campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Holman said courts have imposed a high barrier in defining which shadow campaigns are legal and which are not.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is no traceable agreement between the candidate and the political operative \u2014 just a wink and a nod \u2014 the courts are reluctant to find coordination between the two,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Holman said the public should raise concerns about shadow campaigns, especially those backing every major recent presidential campaign, including Mrs. Clinton\u2018s.\n\n\u201cHopefully, public disgust will grow against the artificial line drawn in the sand by the courts as to \u2018legal\u2019 versus \u2018illegal\u2019 shadow campaigns,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prosecutors said Jeffrey E.
