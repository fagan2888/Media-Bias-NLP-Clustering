While cases of POW are rare, experts have recently found ticks in New Jersey and Connecticut with the virus.\n\nNew Jersey in particular was alerted to the virus\u2019s presence after a woman from Warren County died in 2013. Prior to her death, The Standard Daily reported she was experiencing Lyme-like symptoms: fever, rash, and headache. And since Lyme doesn\u2019t cause deaths, whereas POW does, the woman was initially believed to have died from encephalitis or brain inflammation.\n\nBut later on it was determined her death was caused by POW. Additional symptoms, added the Daily, include vomiting, confusion, seizures, memory loss, and may leave survivors with long-term neurological problems. In Connecticut, WTNH News reported one to four percent of the ticks carried POW in comparison to the 20 to 40 percent that carried Lyme.\n\nSince both tick-borne diseases cause health problems, WTNH reminded people they can avoid getting bitten, thus potential disease, by wearing long sleeve shirts; tucking pants into socks; buying tick repellent; and checking for ticks. Scientists told WTNH if you find a tick during your check, use tweezers to pull it out before disinfecting with alcohol.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 60 cases of POW were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. In addition to checking yourself for ticks, check your pets, too. There is currently no vaccine to treat POW.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "powassan, virus, found, new, jersey, connecticut, ticks, how, avoid, tick, borne, diseases", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "It's about that time to brush people up on tick prevention.", "title": "Ticks Transmit Powassan Virus, Too [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/powassan-virus-found-new-jersey-connecticut-ticks-how-avoid-tick-borne-diseases-329558", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/16/powassan-virus-found-new-jersey-connecticut-ticks-how-avoid-tick-borne-diseases.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's about that time to brush people up on tick prevention.", "title": "Ticks Transmit Powassan Virus, Too [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/powassan-virus-found-new-jersey-connecticut-ticks-how-avoid-tick-borne-diseases-329558", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/16/powassan-virus-found-new-jersey-connecticut-ticks-how-avoid-tick-borne-diseases.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/powassan-virus-found-new-jersey-connecticut-ticks-how-avoid-tick-borne-diseases.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-16T14:03:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T14:03:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "It's about that time to brush people up on tick prevention."}, "article_summary": "Lyme disease is the tick-borne disease on everyone\u2019s radar \u2014 but ticks can also carry the Powassan virus (POW).\nWhile cases of POW are rare, experts have recently found ticks in New Jersey and Connecticut with the virus.\nIn Connecticut, WTNH News reported one to four percent of the ticks carried POW in comparison to the 20 to 40 percent that carried Lyme.\nSince both tick-borne diseases cause health problems, WTNH reminded people they can avoid getting bitten, thus potential disease, by wearing long sleeve shirts; tucking pants into socks; buying tick repellent; and checking for ticks.\nNew Jersey in particular was alerted to the virus\u2019s presence after a woman from Warren County died in 2013."}
