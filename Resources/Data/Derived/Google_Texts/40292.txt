Sioux Falls, SD

The victim of a deadly New Year's Day crash, Tanya Sanchez, was a 38-year-old mother of six. On Wednesday night, family and friends gathered at the crash site for a candlelight vigil to remember Tanya Sanchez.

Dozens of people listened to music, burned sage and held candles to remember a mother taken too soon. Tanya's husband, Nigel Sanchez Jr., was driving the van that was hit by a suspected drunk driver.

"I can't believe that she's gone," Sanchez Jr. said. "She leaves wonderful kids, I can't believe that she's gone."

Sanchez Jr. says Tayna had just picked him up from work and they were on their way home. He says it happened so fast, he never saw the Jeep coming. He says Wednesday night's large turnout at the candlelight vigil at the site of the crash in bitter cold temps, warms his heart.

"I'm happy seeing all the people that loved my wife, she was a good person. She made me happy and proud," Sanchez Jr. said.

As family and friends reflect on this tragic event, they fight back tears remembering a mother who leaves behind six kids and a husband.

New Year's Eve is usually a night for celebration, but this time celebration turned to sorrow in an instant.

"Please if you drink, don't drive because you could take a good person's life, like my wife," Sanchez Jr. said.

20-year-old Oscar Madrigal is charged with vehicular homicide, his second DWI and driving without a license.
