It\u2019s an affliction.\n\nFortunately, because I don\u2019t own these places, I am all talk and no caulk. All nail and no hammer. Because I live under a restraining order that comes with non-homeownership, these homes have been spared clueless improvements that could have actually harmed them, particularly the older homes.\n\nMy last three houses have been historic: a 130-year-old Folk Farmhouse, a 100-year-old Southern Plantation-style home, and currently, an 85-year-old Spanish Mediterranean. Though different in character, what each has in common is a past \u2014 and that, I have come to understand, is worth preserving.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to upgrade old homes, I\u2019ve seen people do some frightening things,\u201d said a contractor who was in my kitchen this week doing some work.\n\n\u201cThey tear out important and valuable architectural elements and replace them with off-the-shelf items from the local big-box store all in the name of improvement.\u201d\n\nThe worker, who didn\u2019t know what I do for a pseudo living, was chatting in passing while I packed my lunch for work, but I was listening closely and thinking, \u201cHoly Mary, that could be me!\u201d\n\nAll this was up for discussion a couple days later when I talked with Nicole Curtis, host of HGTV\u2019s \u201cRehab Addict.\u201d Curtis regularly takes on falling-apart old homes \u2014 ones others would have leveled or \u201cimproved\u201d but made worse \u2014 and restores them authentically.\n\nWe soon sounded like historic-home evangelists in need of an intervention. \u201cPeople don\u2019t do the wrong thing on purpose,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cThey do the wrong thing because they aren\u2019t educated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s fix that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake people make when improving an old home is they try to do what\u2019s hot right now,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cBut what\u2019s hot right now won\u2019t be hot in 10 years. What will always be hot, and will maintain the home\u2019s value, is keeping with the era of the home.\u201d\n\nHer advice \u2014 tear out almost nothing, restore what\u2019s there \u2014 is not only better for the home\u2019s value, it\u2019s easier on the wallet.\n\nOn her short list of what she would add or replace in an older home are these modern conveniences: Walk-in closets \u201cbut added in a way where they don\u2019t take away from the character of the home\u201d; updated heating, cooling systems, and plumbing systems, \u201cso homes are comfortable, safe and more energy-efficient,\u201d and new appliances that weren\u2019t invented when the house was built.\n\n\u201cNo one will ever say, \u2018Oh my gosh, why did you put in a dishwasher?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBeyond that, here are some of her tips for updating an older home without messing it up:\n\n1 Keep the cabinets. When Curtis sees people pull out solid wood cabinets to put in new ones made of melamine, or MDF (medium-density fiberboard), she cringes. \u201cThese manmade materials were not made for years of wear and tear. They don\u2019t handle moisture well. The laminate pulls away, and the pulls come off.\u201d Instead, strip and refinish the wood. It looks better, lasts longer and will save money.\n\n2 Refinish the tubs and sinks. To give an old porcelain bathtub a new coat costs about $400. A new tub can run more than $1,000, not including demo and installation, said Curtis, who is especially horrified when homeowners swap an old porcelain tub for a fiberglass Jacuzzi.\n\n3 Save wood floors. Covering old wood floors with cheaper inferior tiles or carpet is a common crime. Even worse is removing them. \u201cI have never replaced a wood floor in my life,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with floors that were burnt, flooded and covered in pet stains. It is always cheaper and more authentic to refinish existing floors and patch sections where needed.\u201d You can always get the patch to match.\n\n4 Clean old tile. Half the reason old tile floors or other tile surfaces look worn out is because they are filthy. Don\u2019t tear them out until you\u2019ve given them a good cleaning, said Curtis.\n\n5 Make counters authentic. Don\u2019t use products that weren\u2019t available when the house was built. That means nothing manmade, like laminate or Corian, and nothing modern, like glass tiles. Go for wood counters, like butcher block, or classic marble, and occasionally granite. Ceramic tiles work in homes built after 1930.\n\n6\n\nKeep the walls up. Open floor plans are a trend, but they don\u2019t belong in old houses, said Curtis. \u201cAfter a couple years of living in an open floor plan, people don\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d Before knocking out a wall (which Curtis would rarely do) live in the house for six months. \u201cGet into the groove of the home and see how it lives.\u201d\n\n7 Repair, don\u2019t replace, windows. They are important to the home\u2019s historic value. Old windows leak and are drafty because they haven\u2019t been properly maintained. Have them repaired and weatherstripped so they\u2019re efficient and work. Adding historically accurate storm windows outside can boost efficiency. The same for original doors. Leave them.\n\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).
