Join us in the struggle for global white supremacy at The Daily Stormer,\u201d the fliers read in bold, black font. A pair of large swastikas, as well as the web address, are displayed on the printouts as well.\n\nAndrew Auernheimer, better known by the alias \u201cweev,\u201d told The Washington Times he was behind the breach, using a freely available tool to scour \u201cbasically \u2026 the whole English-speaking Internet\u201d for vulnerable devices that could be remotely accessed.\n\nHe claims to have within minutes identified roughly 29,000 printers that were connected to the Internet and could be exploited through an open port, then automated a procedure that asked each vulnerable machine to print the Daily Stormer ad.\n\nThe fliers were discovered this week at Princeton University, Northeastern University,UMass Amherst, Smith College,Mt. Holyoke, University of California at Berkley and Depaulia.\n\nNo entities were specifically targeted, Mr. Auernheimer said, but coincidentally several colleges had printers where he could send commands to port 9100.\n\n\u201cThis is not the worst that could happen, and is a serious indictment of the complete incompetence of the universities network administrators,\u201d Darren Martyn, an Irish security researcher, told The Times.\n\nThough Mr. Auernheimer\u2019s actions demonstrated the vulnerability of the devices, he said that wasn\u2019t his intention.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a security issue,\u201d Mr. Auernheimer told The Times. \u201cI am communicating a political message solely by transmitting something incendiary. All the devices in the chain are acting in the exact manner of their designers.\n\n\u201cPeople are now calling the cops and crying hacking and hate crimes as a response,\u201d he said. \u201cThis flies in the face of our traditions of free speech and the marketplace of ideas. I have the right to send you a message you dislike in an envelope. It\u2019s your right to decide how to process that message, which may include throwing it in the trash.\u201d\n\nDescribing his exploits online, Mr. Auernheimer called his experiment \u201ca lesson in how positively hilarious the IoT will be in the future,\u201d referring to the Internet-of-Things, or the phenomena in which devices are exponentially designed to be Internet-ready.\n\nRobert Graham, the owner of Errata Security and developer of the \u201cmasscan\u201d tool Mr. Aurenheimer used to find vulnerable devices, said the Internet is \u201cend-to-end\u201d and that if printers are publicly-accessible, \u201cpeople will print things to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, I support free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I deeply dislike this speech, I have no reason to condemn this use of masscan versus printing anything else.\u201d\n\nAndrew Anglin, founder of The Daily Stormer, said Friday he favored what the hacker had done.\n\n\u201cOf course I endorse it. Six million percent, I endorse this glorious action,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 30-year-old computer hacker has claimed responsibility for anti-Semitic fliers appearing this week in the printer trays of computer labs at colleges nationwide, which prompted officials at several campuses to launch investigations amid heightened security concerns.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A 30-year-old computer hacker has claimed responsibility for anti-Semitic fliers appearing this week in the printer trays of computer labs at colleges nationwide, which prompted officials at several campuses to launch investigations amid heightened security concerns.", "title": "Hacker takes credit for anti-Semitic fliers on college campus", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/25/hacker-takes-credit-colleges-investigate-anti-semi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/22/2eacc5d60bf07d0d710f6a7067008f50.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/22/2eacc5d60bf07d0d710f6a7067008f50.jpg", "description": "A 30-year-old computer hacker has claimed responsibility for anti-Semitic fliers appearing this week in the printer trays of computer labs at colleges nationwide, which prompted officials at several c", "card": "summary", "title": "Hacker takes credit for anti-Semitic fliers on college campus"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, Weev"}, "article_summary": "Join us in the struggle for global white supremacy at The Daily Stormer,\u201d the fliers read in bold, black font.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a security issue,\u201d Mr. Auernheimer told The Times.\nNo entities were specifically targeted, Mr. Auernheimer said, but coincidentally several colleges had printers where he could send commands to port 9100.\n\u201cWhile I deeply dislike this speech, I have no reason to condemn this use of masscan versus printing anything else.\u201dAndrew Anglin, founder of The Daily Stormer, said Friday he favored what the hacker had done.\n\u201cWhite man \u2026 are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy?"}
