The challenge returns on Tuesday. ( The Denver Post )\n\nArmed with fresh produce, meat and other ingredients from farmers' market vendors, two area chefs will square off Tuesday at the fourth annual Iron Chef Challenge at the Broomfield Farmers' Market.\n\nSteven Yacovetta, sous chef at the Omni Interlocken Resort, will defend the resort's 2014 title against challenger chef Scott Yosten, owner of The Butler Did It Fine Foods and Catering. The two will be challenged to whip up the most delectable dishes prepared from the produce and meat available at the market. The chefs' skills will be judged by a celebrity panel of experts including Dan Borgmann, host of the \"Beyond the Booth\" farm-to-table program on KLZ Radio 560 AM; Kia Ku, food and wellness blogger; and a guest judge selected from shoppers at the market.\n\nAt 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, each chef will receive $60 in Market Bucks and will be given 40 minutes to purchase ingredients at the market. At 5:20 p.m. the chefs will step up to cooking stations to prepare an appetizer and main course to be judged by the panel. Samples of their creations will be provided to spectators.\n\n\"The Iron Chef Challenge is a signature event each year at the Broomfield Farmers' Market,\" Dave Carter, one of the volunteer market managers, stated in a news release. \"Our farmers bring their best to Broomfield each Tuesday, so chef Yocevetta and chef Yosten will have a cornucopia of fresh meat, produce and other ingredients available for their creations.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more information on the market, search for Broomfield Farmers' Market at Holy Comforter on Facebook or email market@holycomforterchurch.net.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/broomfield-news/ci_28595936/chefs-face-off-tuesday-showdown-at-broomfield-farmers", "sailthru.author": "By Enterprise Staff", "ag": {"canon": "BroomfieldEnterprise:article:28595936:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-09T05:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "broomfieldenterprise.com", "description": "Armed with fresh produce, meat and other ingredients from farmers' market vendors, two area chefs will square off Tuesday at the fourth annual Iron Chef Challenge at the Broomfield Farmers' Market.", "title": "Chefs to face off Tuesday in showdown at Broomfield Farmers' Market", "url": "http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/broomfield-news/ci_28595936/chefs-face-off-tuesday-showdown-at-broomfield-farmers", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site24/2015/0806/20150806__09bemarkw~1.jpg", "site": "@bfld_enterprise", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Broomfield News", "modificationDate": "2015-08-06T12:20:48-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-06T12:09:03-0600", "news_keywords": "Broomfield , Broomfield  news, Broomfield Colorado Broomfield  news, Broomfield Colorado news, Broomfield  Broomfield news, Broomfield  Colorado news, US Broomfield  news, world Broomfield  news", "byline": "By Enterprise Staff", "pubDate": "2015-08-06T12:22:15-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-09T05:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Chefs to face off Tuesday in showdown at Broomfield Farmers' Market", "verify-v1": "6kuA7CAUki9AlbVICJv2yCJD45ruAoxDsIhKXTD4sYM=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site24/2015/0806/20150806__09bemarkw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Armed with fresh produce, meat and other ingredients from farmers' market vendors, two area chefs will square off Tuesday at the fourth annual Iron Chef Challenge at the Broomfield Farmers' Market.", "sailthru.site": "broomfieldenterprise.com", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "og": {"url": "http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/broomfield-news/ci_28595936/chefs-face-off-tuesday-showdown-at-broomfield-farmers", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site24/2015/0806/20150806__09bemarkw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Armed with fresh produce, meat and other ingredients from farmers' market vendors, two area chefs will square off Tuesday at the fourth annual Iron Chef Challenge at the Broomfield Farmers' Market.", "title": "Chefs to face off Tuesday in showdown at Broomfield Farmers' Market"}, "google-site-verification": "29ynt8ABZn2B9ik2YYAbLz7eV-Q-plF6J10joLJwHDA", "y_key": "287043cba670060e", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site24/2015/0806/20150806__09bemarkw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementFor more information on the market, search for Broomfield Farmers' Market at Holy Comforter on Facebook or email market@holycomforterchurch.net.\n( The Denver Post )Armed with fresh produce, meat and other ingredients from farmers' market vendors, two area chefs will square off Tuesday at the fourth annual Iron Chef Challenge at the Broomfield Farmers' Market.\n\"The Iron Chef Challenge is a signature event each year at the Broomfield Farmers' Market,\" Dave Carter, one of the volunteer market managers, stated in a news release.\nJeff Bolton or Kachina Southwestern Grill, foreground, faced off against Eric Johnson of Via Toscana Ristorante in the 2013 Iron Chef Challenge at the Broomfield Farmers' Market.\n\"Our farmers bring their best to Broomfield each Tuesday, so chef Yocevetta and chef Yosten will have a cornucopia of fresh meat, produce and other ingredients available for their creations.\""}
