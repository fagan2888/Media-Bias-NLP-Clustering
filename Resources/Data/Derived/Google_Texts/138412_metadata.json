Perry Thurston, D-Fort Lauderdale, have been outspoken in their advocacy for a medical marijuana initiative on the November ballot, and for allowing same-sex marriages.\n\nThe primary winner\u2019s eventual opponent, Attorney General Pam Bondi, has been the polar opposite. Bondi opposes the medical marijuana constitutional amendment and fought its placement on the November ballot. A recent poll shows nearly nine out of 10 voters support the measure.\n\nBondi has aggressively defended the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriages, although similar provisions have been overturned in more than two dozen courts across the nation, including judges in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties in the last few weeks.\n\nDespite their positioning on those popular issues, Thurston and Sheldon \u2014 who face each other in the Aug. 26 Democratic primary \u2014 have a daunting task in taking on Bondi, a former Tampa Bay prosecutor who was first elected in 2010.\n\nThe defeat of incumbent Cabinet members is rare; the last such event occurred two decades ago in 1994.\n\nAdditionally, the Cabinet races \u2014 including less competitive contests for agriculture commissioner and chief financial officer \u2014 are \u201cdown ballot\u201d contests that will struggle to draw attention from voters who are likely to be overwhelmed by the high-stakes, big-money governor\u2019s race.\n\nAnd with the backing of the Republican establishment that controls Tallahassee, Bondi has already been able to raise a substantial campaign fund, including some $2.4 million in cash and in-kind services in her standard account and some $1.8 million in other political committees through mid-July.\n\nSheldon and Thurston have raised less than $500,000 between them, with Sheldon at just over $300,000 and Thurston with about $190,000.\n\nThat means Bondi will be in a much stronger position to make her case to voters through television advertising and other efforts to get her supporters to the polls.\n\nMeanwhile, Thurston and Sheldon are waging primary campaigns that will tax their already limited resources. Neither has the ability to run major television advertising, although Sheldon has launched a radio ad criticizing Bondi for not intervening in a Public Service Commission case where the state's major electric utility companies are seeking to reduce their energy conservation programs.\n\nThey face an uncertain late-summer primary electorate, where the only certainty is that fewer than one out of every four voters \u2014 a 21.4 percent turnout average over the last decade \u2014 are likely to show up at the polls.\n\nThe Democratic voters that make to the polls will have to draw a distinction between Sheldon and Thurston, who have refrained from criticizing each other and are in agreement on major issues including marijuana, marriage equality, gun control and civil rights.\n\nFor his part, Sheldon, 67, who is also a former state legislator and former deputy attorney general and who recently served as a top administrator at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has emphasized his management experience and legal background.\n\n\u201cI think he and I are very similar on a lot of issues,\" Sheldon said about Thurston. \u201cBut I've been deputy attorney general. I\u2019ve managed parts of that office. I managed 13,000 employees at the Department of Children and Families. I had a $50 billion budget at HHS.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of this is the ability to get the job done, not just about taking positions,\u201d Sheldon added.\n\nSheldon\u2019s campaign has been boosted by support from his former boss, Bob Buttterworth, the state\u2019s longest serving attorney general.\n\nButterworth said Sheldon might have the best set of qualifications of any candidate \u201cin recent memory\u201d who has sought the attorney general\u2019s job.\n\nAs another former head of DCF, Butterworth said managing the state\u2019s chief social services agency is an even more challenging task than the Cabinet office.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes George Sheldon,\u201d Butterworth said. \u201cHe\u2019s very, very competent. He understands the issues. He not only has a good resume, he has the experience.\u201d\n\nThurston, 53, is highlighting the fact that, as the leader of the House Democrats for the last two years, he has stood toe to toe with Bondi and Gov. Rick Scott on many major issues, including pushing for changes in Florida's controversial \u201cstand your ground\u201d law and expanding Medicaid, which Bondi has opposed.\n\nThurston cited the example of his criticizing Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, who suggested that the controversial Common Core education standards could lead to children becoming homosexuals.\n\n\u201cThis kind of ignorance and intolerance has no place in our state\u2019s discourse. Unfortunately, it is far too commonplace in one faction of the Republican Party,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cRick Scott has spoken out against gay adoption and, right now, Pam Bondi is going to court to deny LGBT citizens their rights. As your attorney general, I promise to stand up for the rights of all Floridians.\u201d\n\nBondi\u2019s campaign dismissed the Democrats\u2019 charges that she is out of touch with voters and is pushing a political agenda that trumps policy. \u201cIt is never on the wrong side to perform your constitutional duty and to be an advocate and watchdog for the people of Florida,\u201d said Pablo Diaz, Bondi\u2019s campaign manager.\n\n\u201cPam Bondi has a nationally recognized record for shutting down pill mills, waging war against human traffickers and protecting consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to comparing General Bondi\u2019s substantive record of fighting for the citizens of this state against the tired, empty rhetoric of the Democrats in the coming months,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nThurston\u2019s campaign has been bolstered by support by major Democratic leaders, including U.S. Reps. Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson, who help solidify Thurston\u2019s support among African-American voters in Southeast Florida.\n\nAdditionally, many of Thurston\u2019s House colleagues are backing his bid, including St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, a former House member.\n\nKriseman said Thurston will battle for \u201cthe middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was proud to stand with him in the Legislature to expand Medicaid, raise the minimum wage and protect education,\u201d Kriseman said. \u201cAs attorney general, I know he\u2019ll put consumers ahead of special interests and citizens\u2019 interests ahead of political interests.\u201d\n\nButterworth, who ran four successful statewide campaigns for attorney general, said it was \u201chard to say\u201d whether the primary would hurt or help the candidate that emerges with the party\u2019s nomination. But Butterworth stressed both Sheldon and Thurston would remain united regardless of the outcome.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one target and that\u2019s Pam,\u201d Butterworth said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/08/bondi.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 The Democratic candidates for attorney general strongly back two high-visibility issues that are supported by a majority of Floridians", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5808\"", "article_summary": "The primary winner\u2019s eventual opponent, Attorney General Pam Bondi, has been the polar opposite.\nRick Scott on many major issues, including pushing for changes in Florida's controversial \u201cstand your ground\u201d law and expanding Medicaid, which Bondi has opposed.\nSheldon\u2019s campaign has been boosted by support from his former boss, Bob Buttterworth, the state\u2019s longest serving attorney general.\n\u201cI think he and I are very similar on a lot of issues,\" Sheldon said about Thurston.\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 The Democratic candidates for attorney general strongly back two high-visibility issues that are supported by a majority of Floridians heading into the fall elections."}
