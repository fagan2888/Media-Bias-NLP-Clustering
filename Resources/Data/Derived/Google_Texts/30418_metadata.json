Ronald Reagan even recorded an LP denouncing Medicare.\n\nThey said one program would end freedom in America, and worried that another was akin to socialism.\n\n\n\nNo, we\u2019re not talking about aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf you think politicians up in arms about the upcoming launch of Obamacare, you must not be old enough to remember the name-calling and dire predictions that predicated the introduction of two other major legislative milestones: Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\u201cThere is a history around these government programs of controversy, of fear, of partisan division and ideological debates,\u201d said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina.\n\nOf course, both Social Security and Medicare were enacted despite such opposition \u2013 and in both cases, experts say they quickly became quite popular and have stayed that way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before, and in some ways that's comforting because Medicare and Social Security turned out OK,\u201d Oberlander said.\n\nBut although the rhetoric around Social Security and Medicare was dire, experts say it was not nearly as venomous as the current fight over Obamacare, which has included an all-night speech replete with references to Nazism and the first government shutdown in almost two decades.\n\nPresident Obama has gone so far as to make fun of some of the harshest criticism.\n\n\u201cThe current debate is an order of magnitude more intense, dishonest and verging on indictable than was the case with either of those programs,\u201d said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and an expert on health care financing.\n\n(Read more: Gov-love was fading long before the shutdown, study says)\n\nExperts say Social Security, in the 1930s, and Medicare, in the 1960s, were established at times when the partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats was not nearly as strong as it is today.\n\nIn addition, during both periods the Democrats pushing for the programs had a much stronger grip on political power.\n\n\u201cThere were some people very strongly opposed to Medicare (and) very strongly opposed to Social Security, but politically they did not have the clout that those opposed to Obamacare, or ACA, have today,\u201d said Daniel Beland, a professor of public policy at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, and an expert on the U.S. Social Security and Medicare systems.\n\nStill, the fears about Social Security and Medicare are surprisingly similar to the ones critics have raised about the Affordable Care Act today.\n\nThe Social Security Act, which in 1935 introduced old-age insurance, unemployment insurance and other social welfare programs, faced critics who worried it would threaten democracy itself.\n\n\"Isn\u2019t this socialism?\u201d one senator, Thomas Pryor Gore, asked at one point.\n\nThree decades later, the plan to introduce Medicare also faced foes including the American Medical Association and Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.\n\nAnother critic was Ronald Reagan. In 1961, the future president recorded a speech in which painted a dark picture of a time in which doctors would be told by the government which patients they could see, and where.\n\nIf his listeners didn\u2019t oppose Medicare, he warned, the medical plan would be followed by \u201cother federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do this and if I don\u2019t do it, one of these days you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children\u2019s children, what it once was like in America when men were free,\u201d Reagan added.\n\nReagan's efforts to thwart Medicare weren't successful, and the conservative lawmaker even ended up being the one to overhaul Social Security while serving as president.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Affordable Care Act is assured the same fate. Experts say today's health care overhaul is more complex than Social Security and Medicare, and it comes at a time when politicians are far more deeply divided.\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, has argued that the health care overhaul could literally be deadly.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens. Let\u2019s not do that. Let\u2019s love people. Let\u2019s care about people. Let\u2019s repeal it now while we can.\u201d\n\nOther critics have said it veers dangerously into socialism.\n\n\u201cHow much more socialist can you get than the government telling everybody what they can do, what they can\u2019t do, how they can live,\u201d Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Republican Congressman from Texas and a key Obamacare opponent, told the Huffington Post last year.\n\nEdward Berkowitz, a history professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., noted that any major overhaul like this is at its most vulnerable when it is being implemented, and the inevitable glitches need to be sorted out. He noted other examples of ambitious legislation, such as the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in 1988, that didn\u2019t end up working out.\n\nStill, others note that one reason both Medicare and Social Security endured is that people quickly started getting benefits, and enjoyed them. Even Ted Cruz, the Texas Senator who is among Obamacare\u2019s fiercest opponents, told Fox News one worry is that people will become \u201chooked\u201d on Obama's health care plan and not want to repeal it.\n\nBeland, the professor, said one risk for proponents of Obamacare is that Americans who are getting a benefit from the program, such as being able to keep an adult child on their health care plan, may not realize it is because of the health care overhaul.\n\n\u201cWhen you receive a Social Security check, you are aware of it,\u201d Beland said. \u201cWhen you deal with indirect measures or regulatory changes, you benefit from government action without knowing that.\u201d\n\nStill, if Obamacare can survive the implementation period, some experts say the next generation may find it hard to believe that there ever was a time when the political rancor over the program was so intense.\n\n\u201cIf we get by the initial years, people will look back on the rhetoric that is being (used) today with absolute incredulity,\u201d said Aaron, of the Brookings Institution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They said one program would end freedom in America, and worried that another was akin to socialism.No, we\u2019re not talking about aspects of the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/business/obamacare-fight-vs-birth-social-security-which-was-uglier-4B11241122", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/september/130924/4b9145355-130924-reagan-medicare-cover-240p.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "They said one program would end freedom in America, and worried that another was akin to socialism.No, we\u2019re not talking about aspects of the Affordable Care Act."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "They said one program would end freedom in America, and worried that another was akin to socialism.No, we\u2019re not talking about aspects of the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/september/130924/4b9145355-130924-reagan-medicare-cover-240p.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare fight vs. birth of Social Security: Which was uglier? - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-01", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/obamacare-fight-vs-birth-social-security-which-was-uglier-4B11241122", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Business,Economy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda16c\"", "article_summary": "The uproar over Obamacare echoes the fears some conservatives raised about two now-popular programs: Social Security and Medicare.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before, and in some ways that's comforting because Medicare and Social Security turned out OK,\u201d Oberlander said.\n\u201cWhen you receive a Social Security check, you are aware of it,\u201d Beland said.\nThe Social Security Act, which in 1935 introduced old-age insurance, unemployment insurance and other social welfare programs, faced critics who worried it would threaten democracy itself.\nStill, others note that one reason both Medicare and Social Security endured is that people quickly started getting benefits, and enjoyed them."}
