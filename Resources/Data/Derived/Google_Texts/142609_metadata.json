Of those nine, four were getting medication alone, one was receiving behavioral therapy alone, one was taking dietary supplements (not currently a recommended ADHD treatment), and the remaining three were taking medication and getting behavioral therapy at the same time.\n\nThis begs the question, if the combination treatment is the medical gold standard, why are so few kids getting this ideal treatment?\n\n\u201cWhile I have definitely seen the merits of combined ADHD treatment, it is also important to remember that an individualized approach is key,\u201d Dr. Mandi Silverman, a clinical psychologist at the ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Center at the Child Mind Institute, told Healthline. \u201cThis means that parents may opt to try one or the other first, due to whatever their specific preferences for treatment may be.\u201d\n\nBesides parental decisions, there are also several potential access barriers that may be affecting ADHD treatment in the United States.\n\nMedication is sometimes easier and less time consuming than therapy, so for families with limited time, resources, and access to therapy providers, medication is the option chosen. Dr. Mandi Silverman, Child Mind Institute\n\n\u201cSometimes practitioners are wed to one approach over another, and thus, they recommend that approach to families,\u201d explained Silverman. \u201cOther times, parents or families may have certain preferences for treatment, even when a combined approach is touted as the most effective option to take. A family may choose to participate in one option and decline other options if that is what they feel is best for their child.\u201d\n\nSilverman added, \u201cMedication is sometimes easier and less time consuming than therapy, so for families with limited time, resources, and access to therapy providers, medication is the option chosen, especially if it is dispensed by a pediatrician.\u201d\n\nGet the Facts: ADHD By the Numbers \u00bb\n\nNot all doctors are ADHD specialists, especially in general practice. They don\u2019t necessarily know the recommended guidelines for treating ADHD.\n\n\u201cInitially we were not advised that both [medication and therapy] were recommended,\u201d said Jamie Freedman, a Massachusetts mom of an 8-year-old son with ADHD. \u201cWe tried behavioral therapy with a social worker before trying medication but chose not to continue therapy after starting medication. We weren\u2019t seeing enough results and it was a power struggle just to get [our son] to attend.\u201d\n\nMany families also don\u2019t have health insurance or cannot afford the cost of behavioral therapy. And, of those who have health insurance, many face steep mental health deductibles and copays, if they can get mental health coverage at all. The Affordable Care Act stipulates that mental health must now be covered by all insurance policies, easing this barrier somewhat.\n\nLearn More: How Is an ADHD Diagnosis Made? \u00bb\n\nAccess to mental health care is also a struggle for many families due to a shortage of therapists that leads to long waiting lists, especially in small towns and rural areas.\n\n\u201cWe would prefer our son have behavioral therapy too,\u201d said Freedman, \u201cbut our pediatrician said there isn\u2019t anyone to recommend in our area.\u201d\n\nWe would prefer our son have behavioral therapy too, but our pediatrician said there isn\u2019t anyone to recommend in our area. Jamie Freedman\n\nThere is a large discrepancy in ADHD treatment standards across states, too. For example, Michigan has the highest use of medication, with 88 percent of kids diagnosed with ADHD taking drugs. In contrast, 57 percent of California kids with ADHD take medication, the lowest of all states. About 33 percent of kids with ADHD in Tennessee receive behavioral therapy, yet 61 percent in Hawaii do. Why such a large gap in the way ADHD is treated among the 50 states?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult to answer,\u201d said Silverman, \u201cbut it may come down to the resources available in each state or within each community in the particular state.\u201d\n\nExperts say it\u2019s important that parents and doctors are familiar with the medical practice guidelines, so children with ADHD receive optimal care and have the chance to achieve the best possible outcomes.\n\nA self-described \u201cveteran\u201d parent of a son with ADHD, Penny Williams is an award-winning blogger and author of the Amazon best-seller, \"Boy Without Instructions: Surviving the Learning Curve of Parenting a Child with ADHD.\" Her second book, \"What to Expect When You\u2019re Not Expecting ADHD,\" is now available.\n\nRead More: Helpful Tips for Raising Children with ADHD \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ADHD, children, ADHD treatment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, CDC, medication, behavioral therapy", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Different state standards and family situations prevent children with ADHD from getting both medication and behavioral therapy.", "title": "Only a Third of Kids with ADHD Get the Recommended Treatment \u2014 Why?", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/only-a-third-of-kids-with-adhd-get-the-recommended-treatment-040815", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/040815_adhd_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/040815_adhd_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Different state standards and family situations prevent children with ADHD from getting both medication and behavioral therapy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Only a Third of Kids with ADHD Get the Recommended Treatment \u2014 Why?"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-08", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Different state standards and family situations prevent children with ADHD from getting both medication and behavioral therapy."}, "article_summary": "Jamie FreedmanThere is a large discrepancy in ADHD treatment standards across states, too.\nThis begs the question, if the combination treatment is the medical gold standard, why are so few kids getting this ideal treatment?\nAbout 33 percent of kids with ADHD in Tennessee receive behavioral therapy, yet 61 percent in Hawaii do.\nOf those nine, four were getting medication alone, one was receiving behavioral therapy alone, one was taking dietary supplements (not currently a recommended ADHD treatment), and the remaining three were taking medication and getting behavioral therapy at the same time.\nYet, a new study analyzing 2011 data shows that only one-third of kids with ADHD are getting the suggested AAP treatment \u2014 both medication and therapy \u2014 up just slightly from 2009."}
