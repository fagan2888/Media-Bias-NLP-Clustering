Only four Southwest Florida teams remain in the hunt for state high school football championships, and all will be in action Friday night at 7:30.

Dunbar High School of Fort Myers is the lone Lee County team still playing and will visit Tampa Jesuit in the Class 5A-3 regional finals. A win will move the Tigers, now 10-2, to next week's state semifinals against Bishop Moore or Hallandale.

The Tigers will be leaving for Tampa at 2 p.m., and the community is being asked to come out and see them off. People can gather in the school's parking lot at 1 p.m.

First Baptist Academy of Naples is in the Class 2A semifinals and will visit Cambridge Christian of Tampa. The Lions, seeking their first state finals berth, are 11-1 and have not lost since September. The winner will face either University Christian or Victory Christian Academy for the state title.

The other remaining local teams -- Naples and Charlotte -- will square off against each other in the Class 6A-3 regional finals at Naples.

The host Golden Eagles are 10-1 and haven't lost since their season opener in late August, while the Tarpons are 12-0 and come in off a 41-17 defeat of Port Charlotte last week. The winner will meet Mainland or Central in the state semifinals.
