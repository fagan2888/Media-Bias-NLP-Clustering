Russia\u2019s prime minister, who was two seats away, was later described by the White House as an \u201cactive participant.\u201d Containing oil prices was a leading topic given worries about supply shortages, spurring an unusual joint statement from the G-8.\n\nTwo years later, the price of oil has plunged 50% in just six months and Russia faces deepening economic turmoil as its split from other leading nations widens. They\u2019re proving to be two of the biggest developments for the global economy this year, reshaping the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy.\n\nRisks from higher oil prices have hung over the global economy throughout the past four years. In 2011, in the aftermath of the Arab spring, Mr. Obama used a G-8 meeting to press for a rare global release of emergency oil stockpiles. In 2012, sanctions against Iran were among the drivers of oil-price worries that seeped into global economic summits. In 2013, Syria\u2019s deepening conflict \u2013 including potential U.S. engagement \u2013 kept oil prices on the agenda of the G-8, a group generally focused on security concerns.\n\nOil\u2019s stunning turn in recent months is slamming nations from Iran and Syria to Venezuela and Russia. Not having to worry about oil prices offers more room to worry about other problems, economic and otherwise.\n\nThat G-8 gathering at Camp David appears to be one of the last positive exchanges between Mr. Obama and Russian leadership. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was sitting in for President Vladimir Putin. During the May 2012 meeting, top White House aides told reporters Mr. Medvedev was an \u201cactive participant\u201d in the G-8 discussions. They said Mr. Obama had \u201cvery good interaction\u201d with Mr. Putin as well by phone.\n\nThe G-8 is no more, of course, after the rest of its members suspended the group this year due to Russia\u2019s engagement in Ukraine. U.S. and European sanctions against Russia appear to have slowed Russia\u2019s economy throughout the year and they remain high on the priority list of the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy makers. The plunge in oil prices is helping their strategy by giving Russia a sharper blow.\n\nThe split with Russia is showing little cost to the U.S. economy, at least for now. Three years ago, when Russia joined the World Trade Organization, U.S. officials saw it as an opportunity to integrate Russia further into the global economy and strengthen ties on every front. Mr. Obama at the time called it a \u201csignificant day for U.S.-Russia relations.\u201d\n\nVery little has come of it for the United States. Russia represents a negligible amount of trade with the U.S. \u2013 just 0.1% of the U.S. economy \u2014 and the sanctions against Russia are keeping it that way. The impact of Russia\u2019s severe economic turmoil appears to be centered on other emerging markets so far. Few officials see it as a concern for U.S. trade or the financial sector.\n\n\u201cI see the spillover as pretty small,\u201d Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen told reporters this week.\n\nThe oil drop, on the other hand, is \u201cone of the most important developments shaping the global outlook,\u201d Ms. Yellen said after a two-day meeting of Fed officials.\n\nSetting aside worries about oil still leaves plenty of other topics for policy makers to focus on. Among the other leading worries around the G-8 table back in May 2012 were the eurozone\u2019s economic troubles, North Korea, Syria and Iran. At least some things haven\u2019t changed.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Falling oil prices and Russia's deepening economic turmoil are proving to be two of the biggest developments for the global economy this year, reshaping the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy.", "title": "Oil Collapse, Russia Woes Reshape White House\u2019s International Economic Policy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/12/19/oil-collapse-russia-woes-reshape-white-houses-international-economic-policy/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-TA280_0518g8_G_20120519090237.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Oil Collapse, Russia Woes Reshape White House\u2019s International Economic Policy", "description": "Falling oil prices and Russia's deepening economic turmoil are proving to be two of the biggest developments for the global economy this year, reshaping the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Sudeep Reddy", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Falling oil prices and Russia's deepening economic turmoil are proving to be two of the biggest developments for the global economy this year, reshaping the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-12-19T12:30:20-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/12/19/oil-collapse-russia-woes-reshape-white-houses-international-economic-policy/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-51670", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Falling oil prices and Russia's deepening economic turmoil are proving to be two of the biggest developments for the global economy this year, reshaping the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy.", "title": "Oil Collapse, Russia Woes Reshape White House\u2019s International Economic Policy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/12/19/oil-collapse-russia-woes-reshape-white-houses-international-economic-policy/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-TA280_0518g8_G_20120519090237.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-51670", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-19T12:53:23-05:00"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re proving to be two of the biggest developments for the global economy this year, reshaping the Obama administration\u2019s international economic policy.\nRisks from higher oil prices have hung over the global economy throughout the past four years.\nNot having to worry about oil prices offers more room to worry about other problems, economic and otherwise.\nIn 2012, sanctions against Iran were among the drivers of oil-price worries that seeped into global economic summits.\nMr. Obama at the time called it a \u201csignificant day for U.S.-Russia relations.\u201dVery little has come of it for the United States."}
