Youtube \u2014 Dermablend Pro\n\nDermablend along with two popular YouTube makeup gurus have started a new ad campaign that shows how makeup can empower women \u2014 not cover them up.\n\nIn two videos, Cheri Lindsay and Cassandra Bankson start off with a full face of makeup, and as the clip progresses, they wipe off their foundation. They then go on to tell viewers how they have not used makeup to cover up their flaws, but it has made them a \"bit more approchable.\"\n\n\u201cMy name is Cheri, and this is my Camo Confession,\u201d she says before she proceeds to rub off her foundation to reveal her discoloration.\n\n\u201cMy vitiligo started ... my sophomore year of college,\u201d Lindsay says in the video, explaining her skin pigment disorder. \"I was in Texas, and I've been told that the sun exposure just makes it spread that much faster.\"\n\n\u201cAll of this came within the past maybe three years or so, and it was shocking to me at first because of how much came so fast. It's not that easy to deal with,\u201d she added.\n\nLindsay says she uses her makeup to encourage people to see her for who she truly is. \u201cI don't want people to think that I would get offended,\u201d she continued. \u201cDon't hide, you know. There's something wrong with everybody. Nobody's 100 percent perfect.\u201d\n\nCheri Lindsay before removing her Dermablend Pro makeup.

Now at the young age of 21, she has become a YouTube sensation and has used her struggles as a person suffering with acne to help inspire others. \u201cWhen you hear things like that ['freak of nature' and 'the exorcist'] on a daily basis, it becomes really, really hard to love yourself,\u201d Bankson said.\n\n\u201cI used to use make-up to cover up and hide who I was,\u201d she added. \u201cNow I use it to express myself and show the world who I truly am.\u201d\n\nCassandra Bankson before removing her Dermablend Pro makeup.
