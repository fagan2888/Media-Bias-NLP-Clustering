(Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media)Buy Photo\n\nThe food truck craze has arrived in Green Bay and the City Council has tried to stop it in its tracks.\n\nNationwide, the food truck industry has been growing at an annual rate of 9.3 percent in the last five years, with $857 million in revenue last year, according to IBISWorld.\n\nNortheastern Wisconsin might be a little late to the party, but interest in mobile food vendors here is increasing.\n\nFor example, On Broadway Inc. launched Food Truck Fridays this year, held on eight Fridays from June through September at Museum Place.\n\nAlso, city staff have crafted an ordinance that would regulate, yet promote, the presence of food trucks outside of the regular festivals and events where they're allowed.\n\nYet the City Council on Tuesday sent the proposed ordinance back to the Protection & Welfare Committee for more discussion.\n\nThe move is disappointing for several reasons.\n\nIt further delays the operation of food trucks, especially during a prime time of year when people are out and about and more likely to patronize these food vendors.\n\nIt also exposes an attitude of status quo and protectionism that stalls the development of a vibrant downtown and city.\n\nAlderman Guy Zima took the opportunity to do what he seems to do so well and that is to offend \u2014 \"I for one am not interested in seeing Green Bay become something like Tijuana, where you see a bunch of ragtag businesses lining the streets\" \u2014 while presenting a legitimate concern \u2014 \"I think this is an insult to the property owners of Green Bay.\"\n\nMany food trucks are far from being \"ragtag,\" as Zima worries. They often offer unique and exotic fare that is on par with brick-and-mortar establishments. Take, for example, Nistebox of Sturgeon Bay. When we wrote about them two years ago the food truck was offering Norwegian-influenced burritos and sliders.\n\nFood trucks offer a quick and cheap meal for many who may not have been intending to go to a sit-down restaurant. Plus they appeal to a younger demographic, many of them advertising where they will be through social media.\n\nThe ordinance would also allow food trucks to set up in areas outside the downtown. In some cities you'll find them outside factories, shipyards, office complexes, catching the lunchtime crowd.\n\nAs to Zima's concern about property owners, the presence of food trucks isn't quite \"an insult,\" but they do provide competition to restaurants in the area in which they operate and, we believe, complement those eating establishments, as well\n\nThere's nothing wrong with competition. Did the city block Hinterland from opening across the street from Titletown Brewing? Does the city stop new restaurants or bars opening right next to existing ones?\n\nNo. It allows these businesses carve out their niche and then lets the consumer decide.\n\nIt's true that brick-and-mortar restaurants that own property, and pay utilities and property taxes may not like these mobile vendors without those fixed costs, but as long as the ordinance doesn't give an unfair advantage to one business over another, then we believe it should go forward.\n\nWe believe the proposed ordinance does just that. It prohibits food trucks from setting up within 150 feet of a \"public entrance of any business which sells a food product during the hours the particular business is open for sale\" and 500 feet from any fair, festival or special event sanctioned by the city.\n\nThe ordinance sets licensing requirements, addresses health standards, allows existing restaurants to get a license at a discount, requires annual health inspections and limits the hour of service and the areas of operation.\n\nIt appears to regulate without being too onerous.\n\nThe city should foster an environment of economic opportunity. You don't want to put existing businesses at risk but you do want the diversity of options that attract visitors to thriving cities.\n\nWhether food trucks are popular here and flourish remains to be seen, but the city shouldn't hamper that growth with burdensome regulations that put a damper on these mobile entrepreneurs.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1LlHc7y", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Green Bay City Council sends proposal back to committee", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Green Bay City Council sends proposal back to committee", "title": "Food truck ordinance delay is unnecessary", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/06/20/food-truck-ordinance-delay-unnecessary/28999963/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Green Bay City Council sends proposal back to committee", "title": "Food truck ordinance delay is unnecessary", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a001c4ea7ef644090f4d68314af85cf9614c9f0/c=334-0-1665-1331&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/19/GreenBay/B9317795108Z.1_20150619163453_000_G99B4KEGM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Chef Chris Wiltfang, from Skaliwags in Algoma, serves a customer from his food truck the Skaliwagon during the Food Truck Friday event June 12 in downtown Green Bay.\nFor example, On Broadway Inc. launched Food Truck Fridays this year, held on eight Fridays from June through September at Museum Place.\nA proposed ordinance that would regulate food trucks in the city was sent back to committee on Tuesday.\nWhen we wrote about them two years ago the food truck was offering Norwegian-influenced burritos and sliders.\n(Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media)Buy PhotoThe food truck craze has arrived in Green Bay and the City Council has tried to stop it in its tracks."}
