Fortunately the two officers were not hurt,\u201d said Jill McGranahan, Arvada police spokeswoman.\n\nAn argument between two groups of people broke out at the Hoffbrau Bar and Grill at 7699 W. 88th Ave. in Westminster at about 2 a.m., or closing time, McGranahan said.\n\nThree men and a woman left the bar in one car and were headed west on West 80th Avenue near Pierce Street when they saw two men in a a silver Audi following them, she said.\n\nGunshots were fired from the Audi at the four people in the other car, McGranahan said. The victims called police and gave a description of the suspect\u2019s car.\n\nPolice spotted the suspect car twice \u2014 once at West 66th Avenue and Iris Street and a second time at Oberon and Carr streets. The first time they did not chase the Audi because it was too dangerous. The second time Arvada police officers chased the car for about 30 blocks until the officers lost track of the Audi, McGranahan said.\n\n\u201cWe have very specific rules of engagement,\u201d she said. Officers repeatedly discontinued chases when it became too dangerous, she said.\n\nAt about 4 a.m., Arvada policemen spotted the Audi a third time at West 72nd Avenue and Miller Street. The suspects sped away in the car yet again, turning north on Miller Street, McGranahan said.\n\nBut Miller Street quickly dead ends there and the driver in the suspect car spun the vehicle around and sped directly towards two officers who had stopped at 72nd Avenue to block the suspect\u2019s escape.\n\n\u201cThey were coming head-on towards the police officers,\u201d McGranahan said. \u201cThe two officers opened fire. Several shots were fired.\u201d\n\nOnce again police lost track of the suspects because it was too dangerous to pursue them at the time, she said. Forty minutes later at about 4:40 a.m. police officers spotted the Audi with broken windows pulled over at West 62nd Avenue and Dover Street.\n\nFour officers arrested the driver within further incident. The man had cuts from broken glass. The other suspect was dead in the passenger seat, McGranahan said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the officers shot the suspect or if he shot himself,\u201d she said.\n\nIndependent investigators will review the shootings, she said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man killed in officer-involved shooting in Arvada", "title": "Man killed in officer-involved shooting in Arvada", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/04/man-killed-in-officer-involved-shooting-in-arvada/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T09:50:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-04T09:50:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9322\"", "article_summary": "The second time Arvada police officers chased the car for about 30 blocks until the officers lost track of the Audi, McGranahan said.\nThe victims called police and gave a description of the suspect\u2019s car.\nGunshots were fired from the Audi at the four people in the other car, McGranahan said.\n\u201cThey were coming head-on towards the police officers,\u201d McGranahan said.\nOne man was killed and a second man was arrested early Saturday morning after two suspects wanted in a road shooting incident tried to ram the officers, police say."}
