China, despite holding a somewhat better relationship with the United States, has taken a strong stance in the South China Sea by building artificial, man-made islands and equipping them with military capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe have to take the Russian threat extremely seriously,\u201d Nile added. \u201cThe Russians have increased their defense spending by 30 percent since 200. In contrast, NATO members have reduced spending by 15 percent overall in that same time period.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are pledging to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in rebuilding their overall military might. In contrast, European partners are continuing to cut defense spending.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Sullivan said in his keynote speech credibility is the \u201ccoin of the realm\u201d in foreign policy, but U.S. credibility is in serious disarray. And the Obama administration\u2019s claim Russian involvement in the Middle East is a sign of weakness has only made the situation worse.\n\nAs the Obama administration accommodates other countries that have traditionally been indifferent or actively hostile to U.S. interests, those same countries continue to issue anti-American statements. Sullivan emphasized the danger in withdrawing forces from the Middle East as threats continue to escalate: \u201cAs Sen. John McCain said, we\u2019re moving back, and they\u2019re moving in.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse ranked the U.S. first in terms of military strength compared to other countries in a September report. Russia ranks second, just barely ahead of China. Another ranking index called Global Firepower, which looks at conventional military capabilities comprised of 50 different factors, also listed the U.S. as first in the world.\n\nFollow Jonah Bennett on Twitter\n\nClick here for reuse options!
