She said even the plan she could get through the university was too expensive.\n\nShe purchased a health insurance plan on the federal exchange with help from an applications counselor at Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWith the subsidy it motivated me to go ahead and get it because it was something I could finally afford,\u201d Limones said.\n\nThe subsidies that make health insurance plans affordable for people like Limones are at the center of King v. Burwell.\n\nThe question is whether insurance plans obtained through federally run exchanges qualify for subsidies.\n\nA section in the law says that the subsidies are available for people who enroll in plans through exchanges \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d\n\nThe government argues that this applies to any exchange, whether it\u2019s run by a state or run by the federal government for a state. Opponents argue that the subsidies aren\u2019t available to people who purchase health insurance through an exchange set up by the federal government.\n\nTexas is one of 34 states that chose not to set up its own exchange and 1.4 million residents could lose their subsidies if the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, citing data from the Department of Health and Human Services, said Limones is one of 562,546 women in Texas who would lose their affordable plans.\n\nLimones said if that happens, \u201cI would probably have to forgo getting insurance,\u201d because the cost of her plan would double.\n\nLimones wasn\u2019t the only Texan speaking at a rally about the case Wednesday. Reps. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, and Joe Barton, R-Arlington both spoke at a rally for opponents of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBarton said in a statement that he\u2019s confident that the Supreme Court will strike down the subsidies. \u201cWhen that falls, in all probability the entire law will fall and then it will be our job in the Congress to come up with a conservative alternative,\u201d he said.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton also weighed in on the case in support of the states challenging the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that this lawsuit will ultimately free Texans from the bureaucratic burdens of this unjust, unaffordable and failing law,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy90ZXhhcy1jb2xsZWdlLXN0dWRlbnQtc3BlYWtzLWFib3V0LWltcGFjdC1vZi1raW5nLXYtYnVyd2VsbC1vdXRzaWRlLXN1cHJlbWUtY291cnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Aubree Abril", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "While justices heard arguments in the latest case dealing with the Affordable Care Act, Texas woman Delma Limones spoke at a rally outside the Supreme Court Wednesday about the case's\u2026", "title": "Texas college student speaks about impact of King v.
