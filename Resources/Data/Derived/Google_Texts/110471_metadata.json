Its Medicare plans also earned 5 stars for 2015 \u2013 the top rating in the state \u2013 from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\n\nBut Kaiser has been under fire a lot in recent years, especially from its mental health workers, who staged a strike in January, and from state regulators, who fined it in 2013 for mental health care lapses.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Kaiser \u2013 like all other insurers, hospitals and medical groups \u2013 is adapting quickly to the changes brought about by the federal Affordable Care Act and structuring its programs to remain competitive.\n\n\n\nBut Kaiser\u2019s integrated model \u2013 with insurance, hospitals and doctors all under one umbrella \u2013 sets it apart in the U.S. health care landscape, and many industry observers say it best embodies the future of health care envisioned by the proponents of the ACA, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\n\nSome of Obamacare\u2019s key objectives include coordinated and preventive care, and improvement in the continuity of care.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur whole mission is to keep people well,\u201d Costa says. \u201cWe think that is best done when the system is coordinated and integrated. The health care reform is providing incentives and guidance, and we advise everyone in health care to do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe notes that Kaiser has many long-term members, which enables it to maintain a database on their medical histories to help provide better care.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the era of consumerism and health care reform, people have more choices allowing for selection based on quality, service and affordability,\u201d Costa says. \u201cAnd those are all the things that the health care providers will compete on.\u201d\n\n\n\nNationally, Kaiser\u2019s membership grew by 510,000 last year to 9.6 million. Of that total, close to 7.5 million are in California.\n\n\n\nFor the second year in a row, Kaiser Permanente hospitals in Orange County have received special certification for their focus on geriatric care issues. \u201cWe are training our caregivers at a much higher level to be sensitive to the unique needs of the elderly,\u201d Costa says.\n\n\n\nMENTAL HEALTH, STRIKES AND THE ER\n\n\n\nThe quality of mental health care provided by Kaiser Permanente has not been similarly celebrated. It came into serious question in 2013 when the state fined Kaiser $4 million for long wait times, under-staffing, errors in educational materials and other problems in its behavioral health services.\n\n\n\nAlthough Kaiser Permanente said the ruling was unfair, it announced a series of measures last year to address the red flags that were raised. In addition to more mental health service locations, more convenient office hours and a focus on improving customer service, Kaiser will allow patients to choose their therapists.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are placing more emphasis on behavioral health than we have in the past, and we are proud of the work we have done,\u201d Costa says. \u201cMuch of it has been focused on the improvement of the access to care.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe January strike by about 2,600 mental health clinicians in California, led by the National Union Of Healthcare Workers, refocused attention on the claims that Kaiser Permanente\u2019s mental health departments were understaffed and the workers underpaid.\n\n\n\nBargaining with the union began after the five-day strike, and it is still underway.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are at the table negotiating a contract with that group of workers,\u201d Costa says. \u201cUnfortunately, they selected (the strike) versus remaining at the table and working with us to come to a fair agreement. Again, good work has been done. Resources have been given to be responsive to the needs of behavioral health, and we know there have been improvements.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnion spokesman Justin DeFreitas said that despite the fine levied by the state, \u201cKaiser continues to fail to staff its psychiatric services with enough clinicians to care for its current membership, much less the quarter-million new patients it added to its rolls last year under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said Costa should \u201cuse his new position to fix these urgent problems that affect Kaiser\u2019s patients every day.\u201d And, \u201cwe know Kaiser has the resources,\u201d he says, noting that it recently announced a profit of $3.1 billion last year \u2013 a 15 percent increase from the previous year.\n\n\n\nAnother issue that has plagued hospitals is emergency room crowding. Proponents of the Affordable Care Act said that if more people had health insurance, they would be less likely to visit the ER for medical issues that could be resolved in a doctor\u2019s office. But many hospitals are reporting larger patient volumes in their ERs.\n\n\n\nLast year, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Orange County ERs admitted 97,000 patients \u2013 up from 89,337 in 2013.\n\n\n\nCosta attributes the rise to Kaiser\u2019s swelled membership ranks and notes that demand for all Kaiser services has grown.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe question about whether ER use should go down or up with health care reform \u2013 I think it\u2019s still too early to tell,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nContact the writer: JLJones@ocregister.com or on Twitter @JLJonesOCR\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "undef", "description": "Business: OC Metro: Kaiser Permanente navigates crossroads | kaiser, care, health, costa, year, says, permanente, mental, hospitals, county", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JENNA L.
