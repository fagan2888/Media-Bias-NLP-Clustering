Four and five years is a lot of life: it\u2019s the length of time it takes to complete college or to see your child through to kindergarten.\u201d\n\nThey say the gap starts at birth, where Black women have a 43 percent higher risk than white women to deliver their babies prematurely and are also between two and three times as likely to have babies dangerously early, in less than 32 weeks.\n\nOnce the babies are born, Black mothers are much less likely to breastfeed than white mothers, resulting in less healthy children.\n\n\u201cThis gap has been explained by everything from preference to a lack of access and education about health benefits, to a dearth of support for new moms,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThe latest data from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) showed that hospitals in predominantly black neighborhoods also do less to promote breastfeeding than mostly white hospitals.\u201d\n\nBlack kids are more likely to suffer asthma and obesity and have poorer oral health than whites. Into adulthood, the prevalence of obesity in Black people was nearly twice that of white people, resulting in much higher rates of diabetes in African-Americans.\n\nAfrican-Americans suffer the most from HIV of all racial groups.\n\nNot only do Black women have the highest breast cancer death rates, they\u2019re 40 percent more likely to die of the disease than white women.\n\nEven when Black and white people have the same rates of cancer screening, studies show Black people are more likely to die from the disease. A study in Maryland found that white women got surgery more, while Black women were more likely to get radiation or chemotherapy combined with radiation.\n\nIn older adults, the authors write, Black people have the highest death rates from stroke and hypertension, in addition to the largest incidence and highest death rates from colorectal cancer.\n\nBlack patients are much less likely to get life-saving organ transplants than white people. In a six-state study that measured the likelihood of being placed on a waiting list for a donor organ, \u201cBlack patients were much less likely than white patients to have been referred to a transplantation center for evaluation; they were also much less likely to have been placed on a waiting list or to have received a transplant within 18 months after the initiation of dialysis.\u201d\n\nBlack women suffer the most because they are hit by the double whammy of race and gender disparities. The authors cite a classic study from the New England Journal of Medicine 15 years ago, showing that when 720 physicians from across America are shown eight random videos of an actor conveying symptoms and asked to make health care recommendations, Black women were the least likely group to be referred for cardiac catheterization.\n\nThomas LaVeist, director of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has been studying racial disparities for decades, told Vox.com one key cause is \u201ceveryday racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese little microaggressions include things like going to a reception and sipping a glass of wine, and no one talks to you; trying to go into an elevator and someone doesn\u2019t hold the door for you; or walking into the elevator and someone moves farther away as if they\u2019re concerned about you snatching their purse,\u201d LaVeist said. \u201cThese things are happening at a subconscious level, and they have a physiological and psychological response. That degrades your health, and it has been shown to degrade the strength of the immune system.\u201d\n\nEven at a policy level, while the Affordable Care Act has expanded access to more than 30 million people, it isn\u2019t working as well for African-Americans as other racial groups: their uninsured rates have only dropped from 21 percent to 20 percent since the legislation was introduced.\n\n\u201cRight now, in 2014, despite all the advances of medicine in the last 100 years, despite this groundbreaking health-care legislation, despite having a black president in the White House, the black-white health gap isn\u2019t going away,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe often focus on medicine and the latest technology in health. Yet as the people of Ferguson, Missouri, know, what dictates how healthy you\u2019ll be throughout life \u2014 and all the promise and opportunity that cascades from that \u2014 is something a lot more basic. In America, it\u2019s still the color of your skin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "When it comes to the health of Americans, racial discrimination and white privilege have a devastating impact on health care outcomes, resulting in an across-the-board advantage for whites in every aspect of the health care system.
