But you can\u2019t eat statistics, as people in the southern-rim crisis nations have learned. Even now, the laser-thin growth numbers sustaining the \u201causterity works\u201d argument are evaporating.\n\nEven the lion-hearted austerians\u2014British Prime Minister David Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, for instance\u2014have been awfully quiet about this so-called \u201crecovery.\u201d This column has been of little faith since 3Q 2013, when the eurozone band struck up the post-crisis tune, and it is one of those moments when one regrets being right.\n\nRelated: Two Charts That Explain the 2014 Eurozone Crisis\n\nLast week was an especially rough one for the Europeans. Italy announced Thursday that its economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the second quarter. Given this follows a 1Q fall of 0.1 percent, the long-suffering Italians are now in recession for the third time in seven years.\n\nIn Germany, the engine of the European machine, the Economics Ministry announced simultaneously that industrial orders, an especially important leading indicator in the German context, dropped 3.2 percent in June, after a 1.6 percent fall the previous month. The Bundesbank had already warned that GDP, the eurozone\u2019s standout at a measly 0.8 percent, had probably flatlined in the second quarter.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of this around now. France, the eurozone\u2019s No. 2 economy, had 0.2 percent growth in the second quarter, and economists don\u2019t rule out a return to recession.\n\nSpanish politicians now make a meal of this year\u2019s GDP figures. At 0.4 percent, 1Q growth was the fastest in six years. And this \u201caccelerated\u201d\u2014count on the pols to pounce on this term\u2014to all of 0.6 percent in the second period. In the Spanish context, calling this a recovery amounts to the austerians\u2019 sick joke. With a quarter of the work force jobless and demand consequently lifeless, the better description is \u201cnowhere, and not very fast.\u201d\n\nAs to Greece, it long ago entered a category of its own. It has lost a quarter of its economy since the onset of the euro crisis, and the talk now is that a lot of Greeks may never again find a place in what remains of it.\n\nRelated: ECB\u2019s Coeure\u2014Rates Stay Low, Europe Needs More Investment\n\nAnd we can\u2019t leave out Portugal anymore. Less the three months after it bravely left the bailout scene behind, Lisbon announced last week that Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, Portugal\u2019s largest publicly listed lender, had collapsed and will require a \u20ac4.9 billion ($6.6 billion) rescue.\n\nMario \u201cWhatever It Takes\u201d Draghi, the European Central Bank president, spends his days now explaining that the eurozone recovery is just fine. The weakening euro will make Europe more competitive, he says, and inflation is below but near 2 percent, the bank\u2019s target.\n\nAgain, it would be funny except that it\u2019s not. The drooping currency reflects weak fundamentals, and while it may support eurozone producers to a modest extent, exchange-rate fluctuations have never in history substituted for sound policy.\n\nAs to Draghi\u2019s inflation remark, let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t have the virtue of accuracy. The eurozone rate just fell to 0.4 percent, a four and a half year low and dangerous territory. A good shot of inflation would be the very best thing for the eurozone now. Only a technocrat running a bank domiciled in Germany could think otherwise.\n\nRelated: Global Economy Starts Second Half on Solid Footing--PMIs\n\nThere are a couple of things Europeans need to recognize now. One, the bill for signing on to Washington\u2019s sanctions against Russia is coming due and could be paid in economic damage. \u201cGeopolitical developments and risk above all led to certain reluctance in placing orders,\u201d the German Economics Ministry observed when announcing the lousy factory figures.\n\nThe markets are rattled, and anxieties grow daily. The government in Kiev, puffed from recent successes in the field and now pressing its campaign in eastern Ukraine aggressively, is gambling that Russia will not intervene under any circumstance. To many, in Western markets and ministries alike, this starts to look like Russian roulette.\n\nThe take-home: The eurozone is simply too fragile now to indulge in high-wire acts of brinkmanship in global politics. It is the Obama administration\u2019s bad call to push Europeans too hard on the Ukraine question.\n\nPoint two: A major confrontation between the austerians and the Keynesians\u2014in alternative terms, between conservatives and social democrats\u2014is sharpening and taking on a political hue. The dawning reality is that the E.U.\u2019s choice of severe austerity when its crisis erupted\u2014now fully six years ago\u2014has not delivered anything to be called success outside of the investors who have come out well.\n\nRelated: IMF Warns of Potential Risks to Global Growth\n\nAntonis Samaras and Matteo Renzi, respectively the Greek and Italian premiers, have launched tax reduction programs to aid low-income families\u2014givebacks Samaras calls \u201csocial dividends.\u201d These two are leftists of one or another stripe. Depending on who comes to power elsewhere, it is likely other crisis nations will follow suit.\n\nRenzi, meantime, is one of several social democratic leaders pushing for relaxation of the E.U.\u2019s tough budget rules, which function as one of the austerians\u2019 principal policy instruments. Not altogether oddly, Ibec, the Irish employers\u2019 association, has effectively joined the party in calling for Dublin to cancel yet another round of severe spending cuts to meet the mandated 3 percent deficit target.\n\nBehind these leaders lies the swell of anti-Brussels sentiment graphically evident in the recent E.U. elections. The other take-home: Neoliberal austerity policies, if they work anywhere, require economies far more resilient than Europe\u2019s at the onset of crisis.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s almost a year since the eurozone was supposed to enter recovery mode.", "title": "The Eurozone\u2019s So-Called Recovery Is a Bust", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/08/11/Eurozone-s-So-Called-Recovery-Bust", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04222013_euro_map_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/08/11/Eurozone-s-So-Called-Recovery-Bust", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04222013_euro_map_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s almost a year since the eurozone was supposed to enter recovery mode.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Bundesbank had already warned that GDP, the eurozone\u2019s standout at a measly 0.8 percent, had probably flatlined in the second quarter.\nMario \u201cWhatever It Takes\u201d Draghi, the European Central Bank president, spends his days now explaining that the eurozone recovery is just fine.\nRelated: Global Economy Starts Second Half on Solid Footing--PMIsThere are a couple of things Europeans need to recognize now.\n2 economy, had 0.2 percent growth in the second quarter, and economists don\u2019t rule out a return to recession.\nItaly announced Thursday that its economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the second quarter."}
