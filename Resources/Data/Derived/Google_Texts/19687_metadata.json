Ted Cruz, blamed by Democrats and some of his fellow Republicans as a chief architect of the ongoing government shutdown, struck back on Saturday, faulting President Obama and Senate Democrats for the political stalemate.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear, I don\u2019t think we should be in a shutdown,\u201d Cruz said in a speech to conservatives in the Virginia state capital. \u201cThroughout the course of it, I have said we should not shut down the government. But sadly this is Harry Reid\u2019s and President Obama's shutdown.\u201d\n\nThe government shutdown began Tuesday when the president refused to give in to Republican demands that he delay or change the Affordable Care Act, the signature achievement of his first term that began enrolling patients on October 1, in exchange for passing a routine spending bill.\n\nWatch CNN's \"State of the Union\" for an exclusive interview with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz at 9 a.m. and noon ET.\n\n\n\nFollow @politicalticker Follow @PeterHambyCNN\n\nIn the run-up to the shutdown, Cruz - whose profile has risen considerably among conservatives since taking office this year - had lobbied Republicans in the House and Senate not to relent, even as the president was promising not to sign any bill that would alter \"Obamacare.\"\n\nCruz reminded the audience that House Republicans have passed multiple \u201cnarrowly targeted continuing resolutions\u201d to fund parts of the government as negotiations continue, but he criticized Democrats for refusing to pass them.\n\nHe said Senate Democrats are \u201cdug in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of a battle,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cTheir position is untenable right now.\u201d\n\nCruz, who spoke without notes for nearly an hour, said Republicans would win the shutdown fight but offered little in the way of concrete solutions.\n\n\u201cHow do we win?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you trust the media, if you trust the voices in Washington, if you even trust, god forbid, some of the elected Republicans in Washington, they say we can\u2019t win this fight. The only way to win this fight is the way we won every other fight throughout the history of the republic, which is solutions don\u2019t come from Washington, D.C., they come from the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareer politicians in both parties have gotten us into this mess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be the American people who get us out.\u201d\n\nAccording to a CBS News poll released this week, 72% of Americans disapprove of the shutdown, and more Americans blame Republicans in Congress than Obama.\n\nBut the audience inside a convention center ballroom here was firmly behind Cruz, interrupting his speech frequently with applause.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time that someone abandoned the notion that compromise is the best way to win,\u201d said Rev. Mark Morrow, the Williamsburg pastor who introduced Cruz, a freshman senator who was elected in 2012 with tea party backing.\n\nThroughout his remarks, Cruz made clear he cares little for the approval of his colleagues in Washington, Republicans included.\n\n\"There are so many elected officials in both parties that desperately crave the adulation of the media and the intelligentsia,\u201d he said.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Republican candidate for governor, attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, spoke earlier in the program, an appearance that had consumed the governor\u2019s race all the week.\n\nDemocrats, betting that Cruz\u2019s uncompromising behavior in Washington is toxic to moderate voters in a state whose economic health is tied to the federal government, have been working overtime to portray Cuccinelli as a close ally of Cruz.\n\nHis Democratic opponent in the governor\u2019s race, Terry McAuliffe, has accused Cuccinelli of being Robin to Cruz\u2019s Batman, even running a television ad this week saying that \u201cTed Cruz\u2019s tea party shutdown is hurting Virginia.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli, whose fortunes depend on turning out conservative base voters on Nov. 5, has been reluctant to criticize his fellow Republicans, including Cruz, over the shutdown.\n\nBut his aides have been at pains to put some distance between the Republican candidate and Cruz, noting that his appearance here was not an official campaign event, and that he and Cruz were invited separately to the gala.\n\nBefore the event, Cuccinelli and Cruz crossed paths and chatted briefly backstage. A Cuccinelli aide told reporters that Cuccinelli urged Cruz to find a solution to the shutdown.\n\nDuring his brief remarks, Cuccinelli made no reference to Cruz, and he departed from the convention center soon after leaving the stage.\n\nCruz, though, lavished praise on Cuccinelli, who was the first state attorney general in the country to sue the federal government over the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Let me just say for a second how proud I am of my friend Ken Cuccinelli,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe is smart, he is principled and he is fearless.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- Texas Sen.
