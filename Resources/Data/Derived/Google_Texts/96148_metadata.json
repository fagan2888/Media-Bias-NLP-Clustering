At one point, Obama finds his wife\u2019s iPhone on the table.\n\n\u201cHuh, she\u2019s got Snapchat,\u201d Obama says as he proceeds to record a video of himself encouraging folks to sign up for Obamacare.\n\nThe video then cuts to a \u201cbreaking news\u201d report from CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer about \u201cMichelle Obama in hot water after posting this video.\u201d The clip is the president\u2019s recording, but overlaid with one of the creepier Snapchat Lens\u2019 filters that distorts Obama\u2019s voice and turns his head into a zombie (see right).\n\nLens\u2019 on Snapchat are one of the more popular features of the app, allowing people to spruce up their selfies with an assortment of fun face-detecting designs and animations. It looks like Obama is still learning how to properly use them, though. He can probably learn something from the White House staffers who run the administration\u2019s Snapchat account that launched in January.\n\nLinkedIn also received a couple shout-outs, once during another video clip that featured former Speaker of the House John Boehner advising Obama about life after politics.\n\n\u201cStop sending me all these LinkedIn requests,\u201d Boehner tells Obama.\n\nAfter the clip played, Obama brought up LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cI am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect on LinkedIn,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cBut I know you have jobs to do, which is what really brings us here tonight.\u201d\n\nMy other favorite moment: Obama saying \u201cObama Out\u201d at the end of his speech \u2014 an ode to Kobe Bryant \u2014 before dropping the mic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid zingers directed at everyone from Donald Trump to himself,\u00a0President Barack Obama briefly mentioned two tech giants\u00a0during\u00a0his final\u00a0White House corre", "application-name": "GeekWire", "og": {"site_name": "GeekWire", "description": "Amid zingers directed at everyone from Donald Trump to himself,\u00a0President Barack Obama briefly mentioned two tech giants\u00a0during\u00a0his final\u00a0White House corre", "title": "President Obama calls out Snapchat and LinkedIn during final White House correspondents\u2019 dinner", "locale": "en_US", "see_also": "http://www.geekwire.com/2015/president-obama-finally-gets-his-very-own-facebook-page/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-01-at-1.02.15-AM.png", "height": 588}, "updated_time": "2016-05-01T01:41:02-07:00", "url": "http://www.geekwire.com/2016/president-obama-calls-snapchat-linkedin-final-white-house-final-correspondents-dinner/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amid zingers directed at everyone from Donald Trump to himself,\u00a0President Barack Obama briefly mentioned two tech giants\u00a0during\u00a0his final\u00a0White House corre", "creator": "@Taylor_Soper", "image": "http://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-01-at-1.02.15-AM.png", "title": "President Obama calls out Snapchat and LinkedIn during final White House correspondents\u2019 dinner", "site": "@geekwire", "widgets": {"link-color": "#be4825"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 364309080316986}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/geekwire", "published_time": "2016-05-01T01:28:43-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ichiro51", "section": "Tech", "modified_time": "2016-05-01T01:41:02-07:00", "tag": "snapchat"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "linkedin, obama, politics, snapchat"}, "article_summary": "Amid zingers directed at everyone from Donald Trump to himself, President Barack Obama briefly mentioned two tech giants during his final White House correspondents\u2019 dinner Saturday evening.\nHe can probably learn something from the White House staffers who run the administration\u2019s Snapchat account that launched in January.\nAfter the clip played, Obama brought up LinkedIn.\n\u201cHuh, she\u2019s got Snapchat,\u201d Obama says as he proceeds to record a video of himself encouraging folks to sign up for Obamacare.\n\u201cBernie, you look like a million bucks!\u201d Obama told Bernie Sanders, the only presidential candidate in attendance."}
