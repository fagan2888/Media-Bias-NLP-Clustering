Three Chicago firefighters trying to extinguish a basement fire on the far south side had to call for help.

The fire broke out at 113th and Elizabeth this afternoon.

Part of the home's first floor collapsed amid the flames.

The firefighters made a "may day" call when one firefighter ran out of oxygen, and two others lost their way.

All three were hospitalized as a precaution.

A man had to be stopped by police after he kept trying to get inside the burning home.

The exact cause of the fire is under investigation.
