In an interview with MarketWatch, Sullivan said that the medical system was close but not there yet.\n\n\u201cClearly, this is very desirable. We need to have a seamless system where we can have various segments of our health-care system in contact with other segments so that this can improve efficiency and have care more readily available,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nA seamless system was one of the goals that the Obama administration had in mind when it included $30 billion in spending on health-care technology upgrades in the 2009 stimulus bill. The bill provided funding for doctors, clinics and hospitals to help upgrade their technology.\n\nWhile many medical organizations have been able to digitize their records and share them within a closed network, finding a common link for those groups to share outside the network has been difficult. Further, the amount of money dedicated to technology upgrades may not be enough as one single group, the non-profit Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization in California, spent roughly $30 billion just to be able to smoothly share records among its own clinics and hospitals.\n\nDr. Louis Sullivan\n\nThe effort has spawned a sort of cottage industry within health care, with a number of technology specialists such as Cerner Corp. /quotes/zigman/69765/delayed /quotes/nls/cern CERN and AthenaHealth Inc. /quotes/zigman/107872/delayed /quotes/nls/athn ATHN arising alongside such established giants as McKesson Corp. /quotes/zigman/247413/delayed /quotes/nls/mck MCK to bring the doctor\u2019s back office into the 21st Century.\n\nDevin Jopp, WEDI\u2019s chief executive, said industry must drive the effort. He\u2019s not expecting new federal legislation, but says the industry should make significant progress in five years.\n\n\u201cIn terms of when can you actually walk in as a patient, swipe your information and have this kind of be seamless, I think that\u2019s probably a little further off,\u201d Jopp said. He says he\u2019s hoping that within 10 years that is a possibility.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch\n\nWhy Obamacare might have been Bushcare\n\nObamacare website\u2019s latest glitch: Getting the information to insurers\n\nMore traffic, more people enrolling via Healthcare.gov", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-12-05T11:07:33-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Getting hospitals, doctors and clinics to the point where they can easily share electronic patient records remains an elusive goal in the effort to bring the health-care profession into the digital age, a study says.", "title": "Doctors, hospitals and clinics reluctant to embrace data sharing, study says", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/05/doctors-hospitals-and-clinics-reluctant-to-embrace-data-sharing-study-says/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP683_pfphon_MG_20131121171211.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Dr. Louis Sullivan,health care,Health care technology", "article.headline": "Doctors, hospitals and clinics reluctant to embrace data sharing, study says", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Dr. Louis Sullivan,health care,Health care technology", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Getting hospitals, doctors and clinics to the point where they can easily share electronic patient records remains an elusive goal in the effort to bring the health-care profession into the digital age, a study says.", "article.published": "2013-12-05T11:07:33-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/05/doctors-hospitals-and-clinics-reluctant-to-embrace-data-sharing-study-says/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Getting hospitals, doctors and clinics to the point where they can easily share electronic patient records remains an elusive goal in the effort to bring the health-care profession into the digital age, a study says.", "title": "Doctors, hospitals and clinics reluctant to embrace data sharing, study says", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/12/05/doctors-hospitals-and-clinics-reluctant-to-embrace-data-sharing-study-says/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP683_pfphon_MG_20131121171211.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1664", "article.updated": "2013-12-05T11:07:33-05:00"}, "article_summary": "The bill provided funding for doctors, clinics and hospitals to help upgrade their technology.\nA seamless system was one of the goals that the Obama administration had in mind when it included $30 billion in spending on health-care technology upgrades in the 2009 stimulus bill.\nIn an interview with MarketWatch, Sullivan said that the medical system was close but not there yet.\nWe need to have a seamless system where we can have various segments of our health-care system in contact with other segments so that this can improve efficiency and have care more readily available,\u201d Sullivan said.\nGetting hospitals, doctors and clinics to the point where they can easily share electronic patient records remains an elusive goal in the ongoing effort to bring the health-care profession into the digital age, a study released Thursday says."}
