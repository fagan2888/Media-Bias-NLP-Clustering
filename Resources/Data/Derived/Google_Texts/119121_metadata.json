Potential life equates to: productivity, wages, taxes, consumption of goods and services, housing, manufacturing \u2026 all good purpose given the current state of our economy \u2026 just in case anyone is looking for a return on investment thesis.\"\n\nThe top 10 healthcare markets, according to iVantage, are:\n\nBoston\n\nPortland, Ore.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nSt. Louis\n\nCharlotte, N.C.\n\nNew York\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nMinneapolis\n\nChicago\n\nAtlanta\n\nThese markets serve approximately 60 million people, or 19 percent of the U.S. population. If hospitals in these markets manage risk, performance and value, the added life expectancy could boost the gross domestic product (GDP) by $513 billion, the equivalent of the entire GDP of Ohio, according to the statement.\n\nThe fact that the top-performing cities are spread across the country is a good sign, according to Morrow. \"While not all markets are identical, there are common population psychographics; a key insight for population managers trying to effectively coordinate care with beneficiaries,\" he said in the announcement. \"This study reveals the direct relationship between education, income, ethnicity and consumption trends in top performing markets.\"\n\nDespite the performance of hospitals in these cities, rural healthcare providers continue to struggle, due to both states' failure to expand Medicaid and a shortage of workers.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the research announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRural hospitals desperately need healthcare workers\n\nExperts say rural healthcare in crisis\n\nMortality rates vary, even in 'top cities'\n\nU.S. News picks 'Best Hospitals'", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ten cities have the best healthcare in the country, based on market and hospital performance for populations,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from iVantage Health Analytics.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Ten cities have the best healthcare in the country, based on market and hospital performance for populations,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from iVantage Health Analytics.", "title": "10 best healthcare cities in U.S.", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/10-best-healthcare-cities-us/2014-03-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "hospital rankings,iVantage Health Analytics,Patient Care & Outcomes,urban hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21d7\"", "article_summary": "Ten cities have the best healthcare in the country, based on market and hospital performance for populations, according to a new report from iVantage Health Analytics.\nTo learn more:- here's the research announcementRelated Articles:Rural hospitals desperately need healthcare workersExperts say rural healthcare in crisisMortality rates vary, even in 'top cities'U.S. News picks 'Best Hospitals'\nDespite the performance of hospitals in these cities, rural healthcare providers continue to struggle, due to both states' failure to expand Medicaid and a shortage of workers.\n\"This year's findings confirm the premise of the new healthcare,\" John Morrow, executive vice president of iVantage Health Analytics, said in the report announcement.\nThe top 10 healthcare markets, according to iVantage, are:BostonPortland, Ore.PhiladelphiaSt. LouisCharlotte, N.C.New YorkWashington, D.C.MinneapolisChicagoAtlantaThese markets serve approximately 60 million people, or 19 percent of the U.S. population."}
