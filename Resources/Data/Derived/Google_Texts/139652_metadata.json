Is the Affordable Care Act addressing these problems?\"\n\n\n\nCarl Camden, CEO of Troy-based Kelly Services Inc., said the Affordable Care Act is helping millions of people gain access to health insurance and should remain the law of the land, despite Republican takeover this week of the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\nBut the law needs to be tweaked to help employers manage part-time workers and ease data reporting requirements, especially for small businesses, Camden said.\n\n\n\nScott Eathorne, M.D., interim CEO of Together Health Network, said physicians and hospitals are redesigning their business operations to accept reimbursement based on quality.\n\n\n\n\"We are improving quality, but consumers may not see that. How do they define quality? They want their questions answered, they want to be part of the process\" and want affordable prices, Eathorne said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
