Between June 2015 and June 2016, the court is likely to issue rulings on marriage equality, health care, abortion, and voting rights, all of which will be chewed over endlessly by both parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Meanwhile, with four justices in or approaching their 80s, the court\u2019s future will itself be up for grabs. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the Supreme Court will be 2016\u2019s most consequential issue, and that the party that makes the best case for what the court should be will be on its way to victory.\n\nIf you\u2019d like a preview of what the court will be batting around for the next two years, look at last week\u2019s headlines. On Friday, the Supreme Court announced that it would decide the latest challenge brought by conservative legal activists to the Affordable Care Act. This announcement\u2014surprising because there was no split of authority in the lower courts\u2014means the court will once again decide the fate of the ACA. A ruling for the challengers would not only threaten health coverage for 4.6 million Americans currently receiving federal subsidies to purchase insurance, but would also disrupt the nationwide insurance market and, therefore, threaten the overall viability of the ACA.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly eight decades since the third branch set the agenda for an election while its own future hung in the balance.\n\nAnd on Thursday, it was a lower court\u2014a divided panel of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals\u2014that grabbed everyone\u2019s attention, upholding laws in four states that prohibit same-sex marriage. This ruling came after a long series of decisions from courts around the country striking down these discriminatory laws. Now, with a clear circuit split, the court will have to step in to resolve the issue, probably this term. Whichever way the court rules, it will thrill the base of one political party and infuriate the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nIn recent years, conservative-controlled states have passed a series of harsh laws that both limit reproductive choice and make it more difficult to vote. Now, following a series of legal challenges, both abortion and voting rights are also on their way back to the Supreme Court\u2014if not this term, then certainly in the one following.\n\nThe leading abortion case comes out of Texas, where the staunchly conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld a state law that requires abortion clinics to upgrade their facilities and ensure that their doctors have admitting privileges at local hospitals. Reproductive rights groups argue that these requirements are a mere pretext designed to shut down clinics. Last month, the Supreme Court\u2014over the objections of Justices Alito, Scalia, and Thomas\u2014blocked implementation of the 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling. If the court ultimately decides the merits of this issue, it will be the Roberts court\u2019s first major opinion addressing what constitutes an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to reproductive choice\u2014an important signal of whether Roe v. Wade itself is imperiled in the Roberts court.\n\nFinally, over the last year, the lower courts have been wrestling with challenges to the recent wave of Republican-led restrictions on voting rights, including voter ID laws and restrictions on early voting. This fall, the court stayed the results of many of these lower-court rulings, maintaining the status quo and taking the pressure off of deciding these challenges this term. Instead, it likely pushed off a resolution of these matters until early 2016, just in time for it to deal with the new set of laws that\u2019s scheduled to kick in for the 2016 election. That will place the court right in the middle of a contentious political debate just as the presidential race heats up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThese blockbuster cases should amply demonstrate to the voting public the high court\u2019s significance. Meanwhile, the apparent decisions of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to stay on through the 2016 election highlight just how much power the next president will have to shape the court\u2019s future. With Justice Ginsburg turning 83 in 2016 and Justice Breyer turning 78, a Republican president could solidify conservative control over the court for decades to come and thereby threaten some of President Obama\u2019s landmark achievements, including the ACA. Similarly, with Justices Scalia and Kennedy both turning 80 in 2016, a Democratic president could have the opportunity to end the Roberts court\u2019s conservative push.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly eight decades since the third branch set the agenda for an election while its own future hung in the balance. In 1936, Franklin Roosevelt ran for re-election in the wake of a series of rulings by an aging, conservative-dominated court that had struck down critical elements of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. The stakes then, as now, were readily apparent: If Roosevelt lost, his New Deal would be dead. If he won, the New Deal would survive and Roosevelt would have the opportunity to deal a deathblow to the Lochner-era court, which had thwarted health, safety, and labor laws for the preceding 40 years. Roosevelt won, and over the next eight years he would appoint each of the court\u2019s nine justices, including legal giants like Hugo Black and Robert Jackson. Little wonder that they call the Supreme Court of that era the \u201cRoosevelt court.\u201d\n\nThe difference between then and now is that, beginning with his 1932 campaign, Roosevelt ran aggressively against the Lochner court, arguing that it did the bidding of large corporations and the Republican Party. No Democratic presidential nominee since Roosevelt has been nearly as aggressive in challenging the court, while recent GOP nominees have been more than happy to espouse the virtues of constitutional conservatives on the bench. The conventional wisdom seems to be that talking about the judiciary in general and the Supreme Court in particular is, at best, a distraction for progressive candidates, and, at worst, a losing fight.\n\nThat conventional wisdom is suspect. Indeed, progressives already have all of the resources they need to launch an effective counteroffensive. First, rather than shying away from the Constitution, progressives should fully embrace our nation\u2019s constitutional story\u2014a story that begins with the founders\u2019 decision to create a national government with the power to solve national problems, and continues with the efforts of subsequent generations to end slavery, promote equality, and expand the right to vote. This story\u2014supported by powerful scholarship from leading law professors like Akhil Amar and Jack Balkin\u2014shatters the Tea Party myth of a strictly limited federal government and offers an affirmative, progressive vision of our Constitution.\n\nSecond, progressives should attack the conservative Roberts court where it\u2019s most vulnerable. Polling shows that rulings by the court\u2019s conservative majority that favor the interests of corporations over individual Americans\u2014Citizens United is the poster child here\u2014are unpopular across the political spectrum, giving modern progressives an opening to make a case against the Roberts court not dissimilar to the one Roosevelt made against the Lochner-era court. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been making just this argument at events around the country, warning of the \u201ccorporate capture\u201d of the federal judiciary.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The biggest year in the Supreme Court\u2019s modern history will shape the 2016 election.", "fb-share": "How the Biggest Year in the Supreme Court\u2019s Modern History Will Shape the 2016 Election", "sailthru.author": "Doug Kendall", "description": "For all the uncertainty surrounding the 2016 campaign, this much is already clear: The Supreme Court will be at the center of that election in a way ra ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "For all the uncertainty surrounding the 2016 campaign, this much is already clear: The Supreme Court will be at the center of that election in a way ra ...", "title": "How the Biggest Year in the Supreme Court\u2019s Modern History Will Shape the 2016 Election", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/supreme_court_2016_the_biggest_year_in_the_high_court_s_modern_history_will.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/141112_JURIS_GinsburgBreyer.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all the uncertainty surrounding the 2016 campaign, this much is already clear: The Supreme Court will be at the center of that election in a way ra ...", "title": "How the Biggest Year in the Supreme Court\u2019s Modern History Will Shape the 2016 Election", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/supreme_court_2016_the_biggest_year_in_the_high_court_s_modern_history_will.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/141112_JURIS_GinsburgBreyer.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-12T12:46:27Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "How the Biggest Year in the Supreme Court\u2019s Modern History Will Shape the 2016 Election", "sailthru.headline": "The High Court Takes Center Stage", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"How the Biggest Year in the Supreme Court\\u2019s Modern History Will Shape the 2016 Election\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/supreme_court_2016_the_biggest_year_in_the_high_court_s_modern_history_will.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/141112_JURIS_GinsburgBreyer.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100141112005\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-12T12:46:27Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Doug Kendall\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"politics\",\n    \"jurisprudence\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "The biggest year in the Supreme Court\u2019s modern history will shape the 2016 election.", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "corporate capture, corporate capture of the judiciary, 2016 supreme court, supreme court 2016, supreme court aca, supreme court Obamacare, supreme court gay marriage, supreme court abortion, supreme court voting rights, Ginsburg retirement, breyer retirement, supreme court appointments", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "corporate capture, corporate capture of the judiciary, 2016 supreme court, supreme court 2016, supreme court aca, supreme court Obamacare, supreme court gay marriage, supreme court abortion, supreme court voting rights, Ginsburg retirement, breyer retirement, supreme court appointments", "sailthru.description": "For all the uncertainty surrounding the 2016 campaign, this much is already clear: The Supreme Court will be at the center of that election in a way ra ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/11/141112_JURIS_GinsburgBreyer.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Second, progressives should attack the conservative Roberts court where it\u2019s most vulnerable.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court announced that it would decide the latest challenge brought by conservative legal activists to the Affordable Care Act.\nSimilarly, with Justices Scalia and Kennedy both turning 80 in 2016, a Democratic president could have the opportunity to end the Roberts court\u2019s conservative push.\nThis ruling came after a long series of decisions from courts around the country striking down these discriminatory laws.\nMeanwhile, with four justices in or approaching their 80s, the court\u2019s future will itself be up for grabs."}
