Biochemical oxygen demand involves bugs needed in the system to keep it oxidized, he said.\n\nWhen the grease trap is overloaded with grease or other food matter, it robs oxygen from the water, which is needed for proper decomposition, Wiley said.\n\n\u201cIt coats and sticks and creates this ball of a monster that causes sanitary overflow, which is an issue,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t want that to impact our environment.\u201d\n\nKana said it\u2019s similar to a blockage in arteries.\n\nWiley said in 2009, 25 percent to 30 percent of restaurants in the area exceeded limits for biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids.\n\nThe city\u2019s ordinance states a normal level of BOD is 250 milligrams per liter and 300 mg per liter for TSS, which is the amount the city is contracted to deliver to the WCID No. 1 plant, Kana said.\n\nLab tests in 2010 indicated some restaurants produced BOD in excess of 100,000 mg per unit, Wiley said.\n\n\u201cIt was untestable,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cThat\u2019s how bad our sewer systems were being abused at the time.\u201d\n\nNow, a bad test would be about 2,500 mg, he said.\n\nTests & Maintenance\n\nKana said the city\u2019s ordinance requires food-service establishments to be tested annually, with the option for one retest.\n\nA composite sample is taken by a contracted company to determine how much BOD and TSS is present. Those numbers help calculate the surcharge establishments pay for extra FOG that must be treated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically making those who are causing this excess FOG in the system to pay for that,\u201d Kana said.\n\nThe city\u2019s last report from fall 2013 indicated 65 of the 230 food-service establishments were within TSS and BOD limits and not subject to the surcharge, Kana said.\n\nWiley said the goal is to have everyone in compliance so no one pays a surcharge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the city making money,\u201d Kana said. \u201cIt\u2019s about cleaning up the sewer systems.\u201d\n\nWiley said FOG staff also conducts visual inspections of grease interceptors using a \u201csludge judge\u201d apparatus to measure the grease and solids. If the solids in the sludge judge are greater than 25 percent of the total weight in the grease trap, the FOG department requires the establishment to pump the grease trap, Wiley said.\n\nThe city\u2019s ordinance requires a vacuum truck to clean grease traps every 90 days, he said.\n\nKana said the companies pumping the materials are required to report to the city to ensure it\u2019s monitored properly.\n\nEducation\n\nScott Osburn, Killeen\u2019s executive director of public works, said since 2009, the city\u2019s FOG staff held numerous meetings and seminars to educate the public and met with management of local restaurants.\n\nThe FOG staff identifies necessary maintenance improvements to keep fats, oils and grease out of the system, such as covering open floor drains, using strainers in sinks or grease trap maintenance, Osburn said.\n\nThey discuss the FOG ordinance, why it\u2019s in place and the detriments of high-strength wastewater in the city\u2019s sewer collection and Bell County\u2019s WCID No. 1, Osburn said.\n\nFOG staff also educate management about what to look for with regard to grease-trap maintenance, he said.\n\nWiley said staff members offer a walk-through for establishments on how to properly sanitize dishes and secure floor drains.\n\nMost individual homeowners don\u2019t produce excess FOG in the system, but Wiley said it collectively adds up.\n\nKilleen\u2019s FOG ordinance\n\nOsburn said the city\u2019s FOG ordinance is part of a broader sewer system protection ordinance, found in Chapter 30, Article III of the city\u2019s code of ordinances.\n\nThis year, a provision was added to the ordinance to require food service establishments utilizing cooking oil fryers to collect and properly dispose of yellow grease.\n\n\u201cCrews now ensure that a proper receptacle is being utilized for this purpose,\u201d Osburn said.\n\nAlthough the city\u2019s FOG program focuses on restaurants, Osburn said informational brochures are routinely sent to residential customers as well. The city entered an agreement with Central Texas College\u2019s Enactus class last year for its Liquid Gold program to educate residents about proper disposal of fats, oils and grease.\n\nProfessor Chastity Clemons, CTC\u2019s Enactus coordinator, said students help businesses producing yellow deep fryer grease set up recycling bins in addition to the grease traps.\n\nIn 2007, Enactus partnered with Centex Grease Recovery to collect the yellow grease. The owner started off with nine businesses, and now works with 40, Clemons said.\n\nData is being calculated to quantify how much yellow grease waste has been collected. During the past year, Clemons said students visited about 300 establishments. In July, an agreement was signed with Harker Heights to expand the Liquid Gold program.\n\nNeighboring cities\n\nHarker Heights Public Works Director Mark Hyde said grease clogs are the leading cause of sanitary sewer overflows in city wastewater collection systems nationwide.\n\nGrease can become hard as a rock if it solidifies, he said.\n\n\u201cGrease-related clogs can get costly when you factor in personnel, equipment, cleaning supplies and spill remediation,\u201d Hyde said.\n\nHarker Heights has about 121 linear miles of sanitary sewer pipe that could be affected if every resident poured grease down drains, he said.\n\nResidents should allow grease to cool down and put it in a disposable container with weekly solid waste pickup instead of pouring it down drains, Hyde said.\n\nCopperas Cove also deals with FOG issues in its wastewater lines.\n\n\u201cGrease/oil will most likely continue to be a concern to be dealt with daily,\u201d said Daryl Uptmore, Cove\u2019s public works director.\n\nLike Killeen, both cities also routinely vacuum wastewater lines to prevent clogs.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "Since Killeen paid more than $900,000 in 2009 for problems attributed to fats, oils and grease, work continues to keep such substances out of the city\u2019s sewer system and other infrastructure.", "title": "Cities combat FOG", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/news/politics/cities-combat-fog/article_7edfa866-2b4a-11e4-8741-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 1064, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/09/809113bc-296e-11e4-b328-001a4bcf6878/53f6510aca347.image.jpg?resize=1064%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "keywords": "killeen government,killeen,fats, oils, grease,grease interceptor,new york city,sanitary sewer,fat,wastewater,sewage treatment,limerick county council,environmental protection department,fats, oils and grease ordinance,fats, oils and grease,oils,grease,steve kana,john wiley,scott osburn,mark hyde,enactus,chastity clemons,daryl uptmore,killeen_texas,politics,top_story", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "news_keywords": "killeen government,killeen,fats, oils, grease,grease interceptor,new york city,sanitary sewer,fat,wastewater,sewage treatment,limerick county council,environmental protection department,fats, oils and grease ordinance,fats, oils and grease,oils,grease,steve kana,john wiley,scott osburn,mark hyde,enactus,chastity clemons,daryl uptmore,killeen_texas,politics,top_story", "description": "Since Killeen paid more than $900,000 in 2009 for problems attributed to fats, oils and grease, work continues to keep such substances out of the city\u2019s sewer system and other infrastructure."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9905\"", "article_summary": "Although the city\u2019s FOG program focuses on restaurants, Osburn said informational brochures are routinely sent to residential customers as well.\nSince Killeen paid more than $900,000 in 2009 for problems attributed to fats, oils and grease, work continues to keep such substances out of the city\u2019s sewer system and other infrastructure.\nTests & MaintenanceKana said the city\u2019s ordinance requires food-service establishments to be tested annually, with the option for one retest.\nKilleen\u2019s FOG ordinanceOsburn said the city\u2019s FOG ordinance is part of a broader sewer system protection ordinance, found in Chapter 30, Article III of the city\u2019s code of ordinances.\nThey discuss the FOG ordinance, why it\u2019s in place and the detriments of high-strength wastewater in the city\u2019s sewer collection and Bell County\u2019s WCID No."}
