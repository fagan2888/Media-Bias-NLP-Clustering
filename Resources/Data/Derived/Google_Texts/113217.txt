The Colorado State Patrol said goodbye at two separate events Friday, burying a 21-year-old cadet killed in the line of duty and wishing best of luck to a departing veteran billed as the “ambassador of the Capitol.”

Technician Kent Zeller, 52, was so good at his job that two of his bosses said they wished they could clone him. Zeller, who started in 1993, had worked for the State Patrol’s executive security unit since 2008, where his duties included handling the more than 300,000 visitors who come to the Capitol every year.

“The Colorado State Patrol is a little less today because we’re losing you,” Major Matt Packard told Zeller.

“There’s going to be a hole in our ranks,” said Sgt. Shawn Dominguez. “He’s one of the good guys.”

Zeller made news earlier this year when he and trooper trooper Carin Lawrence helped out a homeless man who had his shoes stolen in the middle of a freezing night. They talked to state Sen. Randy Baumgardner, R-Hot Sulphur Springs, who remembered he had a pair of tennis shoes in his trunk and handed them over to the troopers. Baumgardner joined Capitol staffers, State Patrol employees and friends and family to say good-bye to Zeller.

Laughs ensued when Zeller’s colleagues noted he’s as skinny now as the day he entered the academy. They also talked about his ever-present smile, no matter what was happening at the Capitol, including protests and festivals.

“It’s been a good ride,” an emotional Zeller said. “I’ll treasure it forever.”

Colonel Scott Hernandez, chief of the Colorado State Patrol, said the happiness at the event made up for the “rough” morning. Thousands attended the funeral of cadet Taylor Thyfault. He was killed and a trooper seriously injured on May 23 while trying to stop a fleeing car near Longmont.
