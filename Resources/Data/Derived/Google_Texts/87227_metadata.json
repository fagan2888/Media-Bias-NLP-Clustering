This is the culture here.\u201d\n\nElena Gonzalez, a police officer in the Neptune Township Police Department, was told that by superiors after she complained about sexually explicit behavior and discrimination in the force, according to a lawsuit filed in December 2013 and settled last year.\n\nGonzalez and co-plaintiff Christine Savage, also an officer with the township police force, received $330,000 apiece in that settlement and were promoted to sergeant.\n\nThe killing of Tamara Wilson-Seidle by her husband, Neptune police Sgt. Philip Seidle, has cast a harsh light on the department and its handling of domestic violence calls involving the Seidles.\n\nThe question of whether Seidle was vetted to see if he could possess firearms \u2014 as a state attorney general\u2019s directive outlines \u2014 has yet to be revealed despite Open Public Records Act requests from the Asbury Park Press. A domestic violence allegation would have triggered such an investigation.\n\nThe township denied the female officers\u2019 allegations in its answer to the lawsuit.\n\nNamed in it were Robert H. Adams, the then-chief of the department, who retired on a $126,643 pension before the lawsuit was filed; current Chief James Hunt; and Michael Emmons, then a captain and now retired with a $94,904 pension, according to public records.\n\nThe lawsuit said the two female officers were subjected to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment that included being exposed to sexually explicit gestures and language by Emmons, who denied the allegations in his answer.\n\nAnd they were passed over for promotions, they alleged.\n\nAmong the allegations were:\n\n\u2022Emmons was accused by both women of sending pornographic material to male officers and goading them into responding in the presence of women.\n\n\u2022Both women witnessed Emmons gesturing sexually with his crotch.\n\n\u2022Emmons, a sergeant at the time, mentioned in front of Gonzalez that he engaged in rough sex with another officer\u2019s wife the night before.\n\n\u2022The suit claimed that a car magnet indicating a love for the male sex organ was placed in the patrol car that Gonzalez used to drive to her assignment as a school resource officer at Neptune High School.\n\nThe attorney for both women did not respond to requests to interview the two.\n\nPhilip Seidle is mentioned in the suit. The complaint alleges that Gonzalez complained of the wrongful conduct to the sergeant. Seidle told Gonzalez he would record the alleged wrongful conduct as harassment and note that abdominal pains she complained about were related to it, according to the complaint.\n\nThe women allege in the suit that the department did not have a \u201cwell-publicized and enforced anti-harassment and anti-retaliation policy.\u201d\n\nPolice Director Michael Bascom, responding by email Tuesday, said the department had a policy in place and has since revised it.\n\nAs for the culture of the department as alleged in the complaint, Bascom said confidentiality agreements prevent him from responding.\n\nKen Serrano: 732-643-4029; kserrano@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
