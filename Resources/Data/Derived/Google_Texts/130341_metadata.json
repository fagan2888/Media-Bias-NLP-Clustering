That means a large swell can turn into a wave with a 25-foot face - even larger if you believe the stories told by surfers.\n\nHawaiians originally called this spot Kalehuawehe and for many, it is the holy grail of Oahu\u2019s south shore. It doesn\u2019t break very often but when it does, it has the power to sweep a surfer into legend, reported the Honolulu Star-Advertiser on Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what it did for the most famous surfer of all time: Duke Kahanamoku.\n\nIn 1917, Kahanamoku caught a wave at Castle\u2019s - named after the Kamaaina family whose three-story beachfront home was a prominent landmark - and surfed for more than a mile on a 16-foot-long, 114-pound redwood board without a skeg. He told a journalist years later that the wave could have been 30 feet high.\n\nFrom Castle\u2019s, Kahanamoku rode into Publics, located off the public baths by Kapiolani Park, then into Cunha\u2019s, named after another family with an estate at the water\u2019s edge. Connecting surf breaks, Kahanamoku kept going through to Queen\u2019s and then to the edge of Canoes, where beachboys gave tourists rides in outrigger canoes.\n\nCheers erupted on the beach when Kahanamoku stepped ashore.\n\nThe ride is a significant part of Kahanamoku\u2019s legacy, which will be celebrated in a Bishop Museum exhibit marking the birth of the waterman 125 years ago. From Sunday through Nov. 30 in the museum\u2019s J.M. Long Gallery, visitors can learn about Kahanamoku\u2019s Olympic swimming victories, his stint in Hollywood, the time he saved eight people from drowning when a boat capsized off Corona del Mar, California, and the grace and dignity that made him the state\u2019s official ambassador of aloha.\n\nMuseum visitors also will learn how Kahanamoku surfed into history. There are photos, one of his boards and a video game linked to a small surfboard - custom-made by museum staff - that allows visitors to recreate that 1-mile ride.\n\nThe story of Kahanamoku\u2019s big day at Castle\u2019s was told (and retold) by beach boys in Hawaii, but it reached the masses in 1924 when American cartoonist Robert Ripley, who was a personal friend of the great surfer, illustrated it in his \u201cBelieve It or Not\u201d syndicated feature.\n\nExact details are scarce, including a specific date for the epic ride. Ripley\u2019s 1924 cartoon said the feat was done in 1916, but many say that is incorrect. The ride was described in a few books and, briefly, in a March 1965 interview Kahanamoku gave to Surfer magazine.\n\n\u201cIt lives on as one of the great legends of surfing,\u201d said Fred Hemmings, a former state senator and world champion surfer who knew Kahanamoku. \u201cIt\u2019s become larger than life. It\u2019s folklore now.\u201d\n\nWhen the 69-year-old Hemmings tells the story, which he first heard as a boy, he says the swell that broke at Castle\u2019s arrived in May 1917.\n\n\u201cA very large swell came from the southern hemisphere off New Zealand,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then surfers didn\u2019t know what generated the swell or how it got here but they certainly knew it was big.\u201d\n\nHemmings believes Kahanamoku and his friends had never seen waves that big off Waikiki.\n\n\u201cI am sure Duke heard, deep in his conscience, the drums of ancient Hawaii beating and challenging him to ride the waves,\u201d he said.\n\nKahanamoku was well-known internationally by 1917, having won a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm and because he gave swimming and surfing demonstrations around the world. He was an early proponent of surfing, which he mastered while growing up on the shore at Waikiki.\n\nBut the wave Kahanamoku caught at Castle\u2019s underscored his understanding of the ocean, Hemmings said.\n\n\u201cI tell people that the ocean was his mistress and he had a lifelong love affair with it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the highest example of being an ocean man. He was the world\u2019s fastest swimmer, the world\u2019s best surfer, one of the world\u2019s best canoe steersman.\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees on the spot where Kahanamoku finished his ride. Some, including Hemmings, say it was at the Moana Surfrider hotel, not far from Canoes. Hawaii author and surfer John R.K. Clark believes Kahanamoku\u2019s ride was a little shorter and that he came in near Queen\u2019s.\n\nWhen he wrote his book \u201cHawaiian Surfing,\u201d Clark researched the event as well as the waves that break at Castle\u2019s, which is mentioned dozens of times in Hawaiian language newspapers going back to 1834, he said.\n\n\u201cTraditionally a lot of the versions have Duke riding up to the beach and stepping onto the sand,\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut if you go to the Surfer magazine of 1965 where he was interviewed, Duke said he fell right outside of the Waikiki Tavern, and the Waikiki Tavern is where the Duke statue is now. So in my mind he was coming in from Queen\u2019s.\u201d\n\nClark, a retired deputy fire chief at the Honolulu Fire Department, has surfed Castle\u2019s when the wave faces were 15 feet and said it\u2019s a challenge. But it is even harder to make a ride last as long as Kahanamoku\u2019s, regardless of where he finished.\n\n\u201cIt is not a perfectly peeling 1-mile wave,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThere are steep sections and there are flats in between. The challenge is to get through the flats to the next section.\u201d\n\nMichael Wilson, responsible for designing the new exhibit at the Bishop Museum, said there was a period when some doubted Kahanamoku had made such a long ride.\n\n\u201cThere was a long time afterward, in the 1930s through the 1950s, where people said it couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cA lot of people said it couldn\u2019t be done with the board he was riding and that the waves were not that big.\u201d\n\nBut the discovery that others made similar rides had Wilson convinced otherwise. Many of those later rides were documented by Clark, who said the waves were ridden by big-wave surfer George Downing, a Hobie Cat sailor and a pair of paipo boarders. And the Kamehameha Day swell of 1995 brought waves with 25-foot faces to Castle\u2019s.\n\nKahanamoku\u2019s feat is totally believable, Wilson said.\n\n\u201cBut for him to do that on a 16-foot, finless board was incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was the hardest wave he ever rode.\u201d\n\nOne of the paipo boarders was Jim Growney, who said he caught a monster wave from Castle\u2019s to the Moana with his friend John Waidelich in 1965. Their boards, wooden precursors to the ubiquitous bodyboards of today, were made out of 3/8-inch plywood. Growney, now 83, still has both of them and said he might take up the sport once more.\n\nThe two men caught a wave at Castle\u2019s - farther out than Growney had ever seen it break - and they just kept going. Because they were prone, planing across the water\u2019s surface, they were faster than surfboards of that time, Growney said.\n\n\u201cWe only did it once,\u201d said Growney, a retired public relations writer. \u201cI estimated it could be even more like a mile and a half. But I don\u2019t know. We were just two guys out there surfing who had this incredible experience.\u201d\n\nHemmings, who caught his own huge wave at Castle\u2019s in the summer of 1965, doesn\u2019t believe the stories he\u2019s heard about other surfers making it to the Moana.\n\nWhen Hemmings told Kahanamoku that he couldn\u2019t get farther than the Kapahulu Groin, Kahanamoku said no one could because the ocean bottom off Waikiki was changed by the construction of the Ala Wai Canal in 1928. The project cut off streams and altered drainage patterns, which allowed sandbars to build, negatively affecting wave lanes.\n\n\u201cThere are people now, in subsequent years, who have claimed to have done it,\u201d Hemmings said. \u201cMaybe their imaginations were better than their ride.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a big day, the waves at Castle's break so far off Waikiki that surfers call the spot Steamer Lane because they have to wait near the shipping channel.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On a big day, the waves at Castle\u2019s break so far off Waikiki that surfers call the spot Steamer Lane because they have to wait near the shipping channel.", "title": "The longest ride: Duke Kahanamoku\u2019s epic mile-long wave ride", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/the-longest-ride-duke-kahanamokus-epic-mile-long-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/15/355e753e10abeb247e0f6a706700bed7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/15/355e753e10abeb247e0f6a706700bed7.jpg", "description": "On a big day, the waves at Castle's break so far off Waikiki that surfers call the spot Steamer Lane because they have to wait near the shipping channel.", "card": "summary", "title": "The longest ride: Duke Kahanamoku\u2019s epic mile-long wave ride"}, "Author": "MIKE GORDON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Hawaii author and surfer John R.K.
