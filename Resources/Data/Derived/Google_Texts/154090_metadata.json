Now you have to worry whether the adviser at the investment company that manages your plan \u2013 the person you turn to when you want to know if your selections are too risky, or perhaps worse, too conservative \u2013 has your best interest at heart?\n\nA new AARP report, which surveyed 1,425 adults, found that 93 percent said they want their 401(k) and 403(b) plan advisers to give them advice that\u2019s in their best interest. Almost as many, 89 percent, said they want to be told, upfront, if the advice they\u2019re getting isn\u2019t required to be in their best interest.\n\nAnd more than three in four (77 percent) said they\u2019re concerned that the investment advice from their retirement plan sponsor isn\u2019t required to be in their best interest.\n\nCan you guess which age group was more trusting? If you said older workers, you\u2019d be right. Plan participants ages 50 and up (27 percent) were more likely to trust their advisers than employees ages 25 to 49 (20 percent), the report found.\n\nAdvocates including AARP say it\u2019s more important than ever that the government require fiduciary standards for financial advisers in the retirement industry. Just consider these numbers: Between 1975 and 2010, the number of workers in retirement contribution plans soared to 73.4 million from just 11.2 million. With traditional pensions vanishing, more of us will be relying on our 401(k)s and Social Security to bankroll our retirement years.\n\nBut we may have to wait a while longer for policymakers to expand consumer protections and raise standards for retirement industry professionals. The Labor Department, which oversees 401(k) plans, has pushed back a deadline that was set for October to propose a rule that would strengthen and expand fiduciary responsibilities involving retirement assets. According to Investment News, the proposal was delayed because Labor officials said they weren\u2019t ready. No new deadline was set.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to know whether your plan sponsor\u2019s investment adviser follows a fiduciary standard, just ask. If the answer is no, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll get less-than-stellar advice. But you do want to know. Then ask about the fees involved in the investment selections they recommend for you.\n\nFor more information on fiduciary duties, click here for the Labor Department\u2019s guide for consumers.\n\nPhoto: Iman Mosaad/Flickr\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "If you think your financial adviser is giving you retirement investment advice that\u2019s in your best interest, you could be sadly mistaken.
