(Cruz\u2019s official website, tedcruz.org, continues to work).\n\nInstead, the site is redirecting to the Canadian government\u2019s immigration page, which offers instructions on your eligibility and links to apply for citizenship.\n\nIronically, one of Donald Trump\u2019s most-commonly used barbs against Cruz is demanding he go back to Canada, his place of birth.\n\nThe redirect seems to be an attempt to undermine Cruz\u2019s political views, rather than a simple humorous move offering Americans a way out if he wins the Republican nomination and subsequently, the presidency.\n\nThe domain has previously redirected to the Human Rights Commission and U.S. government\u2019s healthcare website, featuring the finer points of Obamacare.\n\nCruz, and Republican presidential candidates en masse, have repeatedly disparaged Obamacare. The human rights redirect could be a reference to Cruz\u2019s views on abortion and criticism of Planned Parenthood.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only website hi-jinx from supporters or opponents of Republican candidates. Since Dec. 8, JebBush.com has been redirecting to Trump\u2019s website.\n\n\n\nAnother website proclaims to offer Americans an escape route into Cape Breton if Trump wins.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait until Donald Trump is elected president to find somewhere else to live!\u201d the website reads.\n\n\u201cStart now, that way, on election day, you just hop on a bus to start your new life in Cape Breton, where women can get abortions, Muslim people can roam freely, and the only \u2018walls\u2019 are holding up the roofs of our extremely affordable houses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In other U.S. election-connected website hi-jinks, JebBush.com takes web users to Donald Trump.", "application-name": "metronews.ca", "baseDomain": "http://www.metronews.ca/", "og": {"site_name": "metronews.ca", "description": "In other U.S. election-connected website hi-jinks, JebBush.com takes web users to Donald Trump.", "title": "Unofficial Ted Cruz website redirects to Government of Canada | Metro News", "url": "http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2016/02/17/ted-cruz-website-redirects-to-government-of-canada.html", "image": "http://www.metronews.ca/etc/designs/thestar/images/apple-touch.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.metronews.ca/content/dam/thestar/uploads/2016/2/17/tedcruzjpg-jpg-size-xxlarge-letterbox.jpg", "card": "photo", "title": "Unofficial Ted Cruz website redirects to Government of Canada | Metro News"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "metronews.ca", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#0066a4", "p": {"domain_verify": "81d199f7387bc50974c9e161d71512bb"}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2016/02/17/ted-cruz-website-redirects-to-government-of-canada.html", "storyId": "082db53b-2b86-4253-87e3-ebcae4c40b64", "pagetype": "article", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/metrocanada", "section": "News", "modified": "2016-02-17T15:38:18-05:00", "published": "2016-02-17T15:37:25-05:00"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.metronews.ca/content/dam/thestar/uploads/2016/2/17/tedcruzjpg-jpg-size-xxlarge-letterbox.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "viewport": "width=1260"}, "article_summary": "The human rights redirect could be a reference to Cruz\u2019s views on abortion and criticism of Planned Parenthood.\nSince Dec. 8, JebBush.com has been redirecting to Trump\u2019s website.\nIronically, one of Donald Trump\u2019s most-commonly used barbs against Cruz is demanding he go back to Canada, his place of birth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait until Donald Trump is elected president to find somewhere else to live!\u201d the website reads.\nThe domain has previously redirected to the Human Rights Commission and U.S. government\u2019s healthcare website, featuring the finer points of Obamacare."}
