It will be an interesting collaboration for sure, to combine Iroquois and American concepts of the game to the Dutch Lacrosse team.\u201d\n\nPowless was a member of the Iroquois Nationals from 1994 to 2006, playing at four World Championships, was part of the All-World team at the 2002 World Championships in Perth, Australia (with John Grant Jr. and Kevin Lowes) and played in the NLL for seven years, winning a World Championship with the Rochester Knighthawks in 1997.\n\nRELATED A Q&A With Lacrosse Legend and Co-Producer of Film Crooked Arrows Neal Powless\n\nPowless was first introduced to the Dutch National Team in 2012 while attending the Federation of International Lacrosse conference held during the European Championships in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and was later approached by Dutch national team assistant coach Ryan Demorest to become head coach. \u201cI was very excited about the opportunity to spread the game of lacrosse and share some of the expertise that I have learned from playing field lacrosse in the US as well as growing up on the Onondaga Reservation and learning the true origins and roots of the game and respect that goes with The Creators Game,\u201d says Powless.\n\n\u201cMy first goal is always to win. Having seen what the guys were able to achieve in 2012, I would like to see the team do very well in pool play and advance to the play-in rounds,\u201d says Powless about his expectations for the 2014 World Championships. \u201cI have been very impressed at every interaction I have had with Dutch players, with their level of athletic ability and dedication to developing their game. I am optimistic that we will surprise a few people.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 World Games will be played at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado, from July 9-19, 2014.
