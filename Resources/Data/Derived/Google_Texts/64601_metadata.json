The group is concerned about the rhetoric of some presidential candidates, violent attacks preventing women from accessing reproductive clinics and a lack of gun control.\n\n\u201cThere is a myth that women already enjoy all these rights and protections under US law,\u201d the group said on Friday, following a 10-day visit to the US.\n\nThe US is one of seven countries that have not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All of Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), despite committing to do so in 2010 and 2015.\n\n\u201cThis political resistance has also consistently blocked efforts to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, which would entrench women\u2019s right to equality in the US Constitution,\u201d the report said.\n\nWork and inequality\n\nWomen make up close to half of the labor force in the US and working mothers account for two third of household earnings.\n\nThe gender wage gap is 21 percent, and minority women earn even less. Federal law does not require equal pay for work of equal value.\n\nThe majority of minimum wage earners are women. Many are working full time and are the sole breadwinners for their families.\n\nThe group recommended increasing the minimum wage to a living wage.\n\n\"US, Papua New Guinea, Oman are only nations without paid maternity leave\" http://t.co/t7NHKYolpi \u2014 Charlie Camosy (@nohiddenmagenta) January 16, 2015\n\nMaternity Leave\n\nThe US is one of only two countries in the world without a mandatory paid maternity leave for all women workers.\n\nEmployees can take unpaid leave of 12 weeks. This is \u201cfar beneath international human rights standards, which require that maternity leave must be paid.\u201d\n\nThe group was \u201cshocked by the lack of mandatory standards for workplace accommodation for pregnant women, post-natal mothers and persons with care responsibilities, which are required in international human rights law.\u201d\n\nHealth Care\n\nThe group acknowledged efforts to improve women\u2019s right to health and the Affordable Healthcare Act, but highlighted the five-year waiting period for immigrant women to access Medicaid and the exclusion of undocumented workers from health care.\n\n\u201cWe heard appalling testimonies of migrant women who were diagnosed with breast cancer, but could not afford the appropriate treatment,\u201d they said.\n\nRT_com: RT RT_America: \u2018I am a warrior for the babies\u2019: #PlannedParenthood mass shooter proclaims guilt in court https://t.co/tr2H3RaiwU \u2026 \u2014 ChavezNews (@ChaviztaEu) December 10, 2015\n\nReproductive Health\n\nThe group is concerned about the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of an exemption on grounds of freedom of religion to opt out of contraceptive insurance for employees. \u201cFreedom of religion cannot be used to justify discrimination against women, and therefore should not be regarded as a justification for denying women\u2019s right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.\u201d\n\nAlthough women have a legal right to terminate a pregnancy under federal law, it is increasingly difficult to access abortion facilities.\n\nDelays and restrictions on granting licenses for clinics were deemed to have a \u201cdisproportionate and discriminatory impact on poor women.\u201d\n\nThreats, harassment and the vandalizing of clinics are common. The group observed a lack of protection from law enforcement. The Colorado massacre demonstrated the level of hostility.\n\nSex Education\n\nThe group found sex education was lacking in many areas, with abstinence the only education given in many schools.\n\nFrom US: Isolation & cold cells: Women asylum seekers go on hunger strike to protest mistreatment https://t.co/ciTaDyuxJ3 via @RT_com \u2014 Border Criminologies (@BorderCrim) November 5, 2015\n\nSafety Issues\n\nThe group shared concerns for women in detention, citing \u201csexual violence, shackling of pregnant women, solitary confinement,\u201d among their worries.\n\nThe group is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about migrant women in detention. They received allegations of sexual abuse, mistreatment and assault.\n\nThe lack of gun control was also vexing, particularly in relation to domestic violence. Increased police brutality and homicide of black women by police was highlighted.\n\n\n\nPolitical Representation\n\nWomen hold 19.4 percent of Congressional seats and more than a third of judges are women.\n\nSources told the delegation that women face greater difficulties in fundraising, in part due to big money in politics and predominantly male fundraising networks. The group was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the removal of limits on campaign funding by the Supreme Court.\n\n26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2013\n\nChanges to voter ID laws, which increase bureaucratic requirements and reduce the number of voting centers, making voting more difficult for the poor, were also troubling.\n\nThe group praised Emily\u2019s List, a group that promotes female candidates.\n\nThey also expressed gratitude for the US invitation, but observed a gap between the administration's expression of support for women\u2019s equality and the reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The US is lagging in human rights standards for women, a UN Working Group has found.
