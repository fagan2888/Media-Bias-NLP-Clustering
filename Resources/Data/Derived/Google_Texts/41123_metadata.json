Tom Cotton (R), his party\u2019s U.S. Senate hopeful in Arkansas, has been a fierce critic of the Affordable Care Act, vowing to destroy the system if given an opportunity. The far-right congressman even went so far as to argue that some Arkansans, because of \u201cObamacare,\u201d could \u201cface triple-digit increases in the cost of their health care premiums.\u201d\n\nAs of yesterday, that\u2019s not quite what happened. The Arkansas News Bureau reported\n\nInsurance policies sold through the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace are projected to see a net aggregate decrease of 2 percent in premium costs for 2015, Gov. Mike Beebe\u2019s office announced Tuesday. Beebe\u2019s office said the projection includes policies offered through the so-called private option, which uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for Arkansans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Premiums under the private option are projected to decrease slightly but remain essentially flat.\n\nFor much of the recent debate about health care policy, the argument about premiums has been based on two sets of expectations. ACA detractors predicted premiums would \u201cskyrocket,\u201d while ACA proponents suggested modest increases, consistent with trends that existed before the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\nBut for the second time in as many weeks \u2013 Connecticut last week and Arkansas yesterday \u2013 we\u2019re actually seeing some projections of modest premium decreases. Obviously, Cotton\u2019s rhetoric about \u201ctriple-digit increases\u201d looks pretty silly now.\n\nIs it any wonder the political debate, especially in Arkansas, has gone so topsy turvy?\n\nAs we discussed just last week, it was widely assumed that Arkansas\u2019 very competitive U.S. Senate race would feature a far-right congressman demanding the repeal of \u201cObamacare\u201d against a centrist Democrat who avoided the subject.\n\nWhat we have instead is a Democrat who\u2019s started to boast about the health care benefits he\u2019s delivered for his Arkansas constituents, and a Republican congressman who\u2019s conceded there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d the ACA has helped people.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, if Cotton and his allies succeeded in destroying the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, one recent report found that Arkansans could expect to see premium increases of over 300%", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The challenge for Senate hopeful Tom Cotton in the coming months is defending his increasingly untenable position on health care policy.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-makes-health-care-more-affordable-arkansas", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The challenge for Senate hopeful Tom Cotton in the coming months is defending his increasingly untenable position on health care policy.", "title": "ACA makes health care more affordable in Arkansas", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-makes-health-care-more-affordable-arkansas", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2013/03/ap684956453143.jpg?itok=s6dYQhQX", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-makes-health-care-more-affordable-arkansas", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/03/ap684956453143.jpg?itok=5mUugT82", "height": 553}, "title": "ACA makes health care more affordable in Arkansas", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The challenge for Senate hopeful Tom Cotton in the coming months is defending his increasingly untenable position on health care policy."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-27T09:33:41-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "ACA makes health care more affordable in Arkansas", "tags": "affordable-care-act,arkansas,election-2014,elections,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,tom-cotton,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "08/27/2014 09:33:41 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/aca-makes-health-care-more-affordable-arkansas"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The challenge for Senate hopeful Tom Cotton in the coming months is defending his increasingly untenable position on health care policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Election 2014, Elections, Health Care Reform, Health, Affordable Care Act, Arkansas, Obamacare, Tom Cotton"}, "article_summary": "ACA detractors predicted premiums would \u201cskyrocket,\u201d while ACA proponents suggested modest increases, consistent with trends that existed before the Affordable Care Act became law.\nFor much of the recent debate about health care policy, the argument about premiums has been based on two sets of expectations.\nThe Arkansas News Bureau reportedInsurance policies sold through the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace are projected to see a net aggregate decrease of 2 percent in premium costs for 2015, Gov.\nRep.
