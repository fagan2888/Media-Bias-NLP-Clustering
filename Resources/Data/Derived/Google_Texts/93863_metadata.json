They\u0092re better prepared in some cases than in others. One new challenge: Last year Swiss banks moved to sever relationships with U.S. taxpayers in the lead-up to this January\u0092s implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Financial wealth is easily transferable, but individuals with gold and other physical assets in Switzerland have had to confront the tax implications of liquidating them.\n\nFatca, which requires foreign banks to disclose more to U.S. tax authorities, creates a fresh layer of compliance for many firms. Most with lengthy offshore experience have been preparing for some time. \u0093The onerous penalties that firms who are in noncompliance will be subject to have meant that most wealth managers and family offices subject to [Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reporting] have rapidly adapted,\u0094 says Kevin Packman, a Miami-based partner with law firm Holland & Knight who chairs the offshore-compliance team as a member of the private wealth services department\u0092s estate planning group. The impact on domestic wealth managers is much smaller than on foreign banks with U.S. clients, Packman adds.\n\nThis year families with $250,000 or more in earnings will also start paying the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u0092s 3.8 percent surtax on investment income. \u0093There was a lot of preparation for this in 2012 in anticipation of the Obamacare provision and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts,\u0094 says Rhona Vogel, CEO of Vogel Consulting, a Brookfield, Wisconsin\u0096based multifamily office with $2.7 billion in assets under management. \u0093Still, as 2013 taxes are prepared, a lot of people are going to experience sticker shock.\u0094\n\nRobert Gordon, founder and president of tax-focused brokerage Twenty-First Securities Corp., sees several potential shifts in taxation that will affect advisers and their clients in 2014. The biggest move that New York\u0096based Gordon predicts is a bipartisan push to cap the deduction benefit for charitable donations at a specific rate, probably 28 cents on the dollar, the lowest bracket.\n\nThe Obama administration, the Senate Assessment and Taxation Committee and the Congressional Budget Office have already provided opinions on that change; combined with politicians\u0092 unwillingness to single out tax treatments, the need to boost revenue makes it likely, Gordon says. \u0093There are giant lobbying firms fighting for each individual deduction, mortgages, charities,\u0094 he notes. \u0093Capitol Hill will be loath to choose winners and losers from these groups.\u0094\n\nThe current maximum deduction is 50 percent of adjusted gross income for a public charity and 30 percent if the money goes to a private foundation. Family office CEO Vogel says a number of her firm\u0092s clients routinely exceed those limits. \u0093Private family wealth is a critical support base for nonprofits in this country,\u0094 she warns. \u0093A change like that could have a chilling effect on charities\u0092 ability to raise needed funds.\u0094\n\nTwenty-First Securities also sees potential threats to tax treatment on some of the products that advisers prefer to use for portfolio tax efficiency, founder Gordon says. Exchange-traded notes avoid mark-to-market treatment like futures contracts do; at the end of the year, they\u0092re subject to tax on unrealized gains or losses. Removing that advantage would make advisers rethink allocations to some asset classes. Mark-to-market exemptions for exchange-traded products have been a hot topic among financial industry lobbyists for several years, Gordon says: \u0093The mutual fund industry has been on a crusade to kill these, and I think they are going to get their wish.\u0094\n\nChanges to carried-interest treatment and limitations on master limited partnerships are possible too, he adds. During the past few years, MLPs have migrated from the oil and gas operations they were created to foster to businesses with ever-more-tangential links to energy production, such as hydraulic fracturing wastewater storage, prompting charges of abuse.\n\nScrutiny of carried-interest payments could hit many single- and multiple-family offices directly, Gordon and Vogel contend. The most widespread impact may be on so-called friends-and-family deals, a common practice whereby family offices bring in people they know on one-off transactions, often real estate investments. \u0093These deals are typically structured with an incentive for the general partner who found the opportunity,\u0094 Vogel says. \u0093A move by Congress to strike down carried-interest treatment will create a headache for many family offices as they try to calculate a change in value each year.\u0094 \u0095 \u0095", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "description": "For wealthy Americans and the firms that manage their money, this tax season offers plenty of potential headaches.", "language": "EN", "og": {"site_name": "Institutionalinvestor.com", "description": "For wealthy Americans and the firms that manage their money, this tax season offers plenty of potential headaches.", "title": "Family Offices, Wealth Managers Face New and Looming Tax Changes"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW,NOARCHIVE", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=470469146", "keywords": "private wealth, wealth management, family offices, Fatca, FBAR, Holland & Knight, tax treatment, Vogel Consulting, Twenty-First Securities, charitable donations, exchange-traded notes, master limited partnerships, MLPs, Obamacare, income tax", "distribution": "Global", "majestic-site-verification": "MJ12_4fc82b71-bfad-43da-a68e-770569a840a2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb04\"", "article_summary": "\u0093Private family wealth is a critical support base for nonprofits in this country,\u0094 she warns.\nRelated Content {{ article.title | removeHtmlTags }} {{ article.publishDate | date: 'MMMM d, yyyy' }}As tax season arrives, wealth managers and family offices throughout the U.S. find themselves grappling with how best to respond to recent and potential rule changes.\nThe most widespread impact may be on so-called friends-and-family deals, a common practice whereby family offices bring in people they know on one-off transactions, often real estate investments.\n\u0093A move by Congress to strike down carried-interest treatment will create a headache for many family offices as they try to calculate a change in value each year.\u0094 \u0095 \u0095\nFatca, which requires foreign banks to disclose more to U.S. tax authorities, creates a fresh layer of compliance for many firms."}
