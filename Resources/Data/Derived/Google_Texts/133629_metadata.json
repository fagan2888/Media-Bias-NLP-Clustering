In the background is College of the Ozarks President Jerry Davis.\n\nCharles Krauthammer pauses during a speech at C of O Wednesday night.\n\nPosted: Friday, October 17, 2014 5:30 pm |\n\nWashington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer spoke at a College of the Ozarks convocation Wednesday and his main message was clear: Good times are ahead for the right-wing party.\n\nKrauthammer is a Pulitzer Prize winner for his columns and has been named the most influential commentator in America by \u201cThe Financial Times.\u201d He is a contributing editor to \u201cThe Weekly Standard,\u201d and is also a contributor on a Fox News Channel program, \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asked many times to compare what I do as a political analyst in Washington (D.C.) with what I used to do as a psychiatrist in Boston,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cI tell people that it really isn\u2019t that different.\n\n\u201cIn both lines of work I deal every day with people who suffer from paranoia and delusions of grandeur. The only difference is that the paranoid in Washington have access to nuclear weapons \u2014 makes the stakes a little higher.\u201d\n\nIn the last few years, Krauthammer said there is a big debate that usually happens once a generation in every generation.\n\n\u201cTo put it more blandly, what is the nature of the American\u2019s social contract between the citizen and the state,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cSix years ago, we elected a president who laid down an ideological challenge to the nation ... My second proposition is that (President) Barrack Obama is not an ordinary liberal. Now, ya\u2019ll know what a liberal is?\u201d\n\nA liberal, as Krauthammer explained, is someone who doesn\u2019t care what someone \u201cdoes as long as it\u2019s mandatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to let that one settle in,\u201d he said as many in the audience laughed.\n\nKrauthammer went on to say that Obama\u2019s policies reflect the European model.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, it\u2019s end zone to end zone,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cIn Europe, you have real fascist parties, real communist parties on the left and the game is played all over the place.\n\n\u201cHere we have a center-right party, the Republicans, the center-left party, the Democrats, and we\u2019re fighting between the 40-yard lines.\u201d\n\nKrauthammer said he has a problem with Obama because the president is trying to push the boundaries of the 40-yard line.\n\n\u201cObama is, in my view, a social Democrat on the European model,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he came into office, he was sort of a chameleon.\n\n\u201cWhen he came into office, he revealed this ideological agenda, quite remarkably, quite openly and honestly, I would say.\u201d\n\nObama failed to reform education and energy; however, he succeeded in reforming healthcare through the Affordable Care Act, Krauthammer said.\n\n\u201cEver since that day, he has not passed a single significant bill of ideological legislation like Obamacare,\u201d Krauthammer said.\n\nAlthough Obama has used executive order to get several actions passed, Krauthammer said the crowd should not to worry.\n\n\u201cBut remember, executive orders are reversible by the next office holder in the White House,\u201d Krauthammer said as many in the audience applauded. \u201cThe result has been four years of gridlock.\u201d\n\nKrauthammer continues to believe in American exceptionalism, he said.\n\n\u201cDecline is a choice,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cPeople pretend America\u2019s in decline.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s total rubbish ... things are out of control because we have let the world go in Syria, in Iraq, even Ebola.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame Ebola on Obama; I mean, if anyone can do it, I can,\u201d he shrugged.\n\nKrauthammer believes a shift is coming.\n\n\u201cI think that will lead to a surge in the conservative party in 2016,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cI will sum it up in one sentence:\n\n\u201cGod looks after children, drunkards, idiots and the United States of America.\n\nCircuit judge candidate Laura Johnson attended the convocation.\n\n\u201cHis analysis is right on point,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur country needs to be more patriotic. It needs to go back to its center-right roots and we always need smaller and less-intrusive government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Branson Tri-Lakes News", "description": "Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer spoke at a College of the Ozarks convocation Wednesday and his main message was clear: Good times are ahead for the right-wing party.", "title": "Fox News contributor visits C of O", "url": "http://bransontrilakesnews.com/news_free/article_3b9cb674-564d-11e4-bb31-2f19b38365cd.html", "image": {"width": 288, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bransontrilakesnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/1a/f1a058d2-563d-11e4-9683-c3c225d7da7a/54417eed75210.image.jpg?resize=288%2C232", "height": 232}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer spoke at a College of the Ozarks convocation Wednesday and his main message was clear: Good times are ahead for the right-wing party.", "keywords": "news_free,news", "news_keywords": "news_free,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4fc7\"", "article_summary": "In the background is College of the Ozarks President Jerry Davis.\nCharles Krauthammer pauses during a speech at C of O Wednesday night.\n\u201cEver since that day, he has not passed a single significant bill of ideological legislation like Obamacare,\u201d Krauthammer said.\nAlthough Obama has used executive order to get several actions passed, Krauthammer said the crowd should not to worry.\n\u201cIn both lines of work I deal every day with people who suffer from paranoia and delusions of grandeur."}
