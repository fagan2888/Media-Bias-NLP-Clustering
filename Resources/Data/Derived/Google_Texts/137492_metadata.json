But customer traffic dwindled before dusk, so the caf\u00e9 imposed an earlier closing hour. It last month launched a dedicated dinner menu featuring merguez sausage and squid ink linguine, but even Saint Alban\u2019s most loyal fans apparently weren\u2019t comfortable dining at tables they associated with work-related meetings and skim lattes.\n\nThe menu for Little Jack\u2019s isn\u2019t yet available, but Reitz says it will feature \u201cfamiliar-but-smart pub standards.\u201d In order to serve lunch and dinner seven days a week, the space will gain a new kitchen, as well as a new chef; Reitz says they\u2019re now discussing the project with interested candidates.\n\nDuring the transition, which may take a few months, Saint Alban will open from 7 a.m.-2 p.m. daily in its current location.\n\nPart of the process of becoming Little Jack\u2019s, in addition to switching the soundtrack from Django Reinhradt to the Rolling Stones, involves redesigning the dining room with upholstered banquettes; different artwork and an expanded bar.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Saint Alban moving across street to make way for Little Jack\u2019s, Food, \r\nFoodFP LatestNews, \r\nBlogs, \r\nRaskin Around, \r\nRaskin Around, Saint Alban", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Following a second unsuccessful attempt to lure customers into Saint Alban for dinner, the caf\u00e9\u2019s owners today announced they\u2019re reinventing the venue as Little Jack\u2019s Tavern, a full-service bar and restaurant.", "title": "Saint Alban moving across street to make way for Little Jack\u2019s", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150720/150729892/saint-alban-moving-across-street-to-make-way-for-little-jack-x2019-s", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150720/PC0301/150729892/AR/0/AR-150729892.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150720/PC0301/150729892/AR/0/AR-150729892.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following a second unsuccessful attempt to lure customers into Saint Alban for dinner, the caf\u00e9\u2019s owners today announced they\u2019re reinventing the venue as Little Jack\u2019s Tavern, a full-service bar and restaurant.", "title": "Saint Alban moving across street to make way for Little Jack\u2019s", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150720/PC0301/150729892/AR/0/AR-150729892.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150729892}}, "keywords": "Saint Alban moving across street to make way for Little Jack\u2019s , Food, \r\nFoodFP LatestNews, \r\nBlogs, \r\nRaskin Around, \r\nRaskin Around, Saint Alban", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20T20:24:12Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T20:24:00Z", "author": "Hanna Raskin"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Following a second unsuccessful attempt to lure customers into Saint Alban for dinner, the caf\u00e9\u2019s owners today announced they\u2019re reinventing the venue as Little Jack\u2019s Tavern, a full-service bar and restaurant."}, "article_summary": "Saint Alban will continue to operate across the street at 721 King Street.\nDuring the transition, which may take a few months, Saint Alban will open from 7 a.m.-2 p.m. daily in its current location.\nFollowing a second unsuccessful attempt to lure customers into Saint Alban for dinner, the caf\u00e9\u2019s owners today announced they\u2019re reinventing the venue as Little Jack\u2019s Tavern, a full-service bar and restaurant.\n\u201cAnd despite the reception for our dinner service, it became clear that Charleston thinks of Saint Alban as more of a coffee shop that a cafe or restaurant.\u201dWhen Saint Alban opened in January, it offered small sandwiches, vermouths and other light continental fare in the evenings.\nPart of the process of becoming Little Jack\u2019s, in addition to switching the soundtrack from Django Reinhradt to the Rolling Stones, involves redesigning the dining room with upholstered banquettes; different artwork and an expanded bar."}
