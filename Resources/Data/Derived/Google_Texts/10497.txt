It’s safe to say Oklahoma native Brian Jackson was born with lungs of steel. The self-described “I BELIEVE GUY” holds 11 Guinness World Records, including one for “Heaviest Vehicle Lifted with Breath.” Jackson also holds the record for bursting three hot water balloons in a little over a minute. Before you think about trying to break Jackson’s record, he said that five people have lost their lives after their lungs burst from air shooting back down their throat.

"It can take up to 170 pounds of pressure to blow it up — like blowing up four car tires," Jackson told Entertainment 360 in an interview. "There's nothing to stop the air from coming back into my lungs."

Jackson, a Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole Native American, travels the United States as a motivational speaker after years of drug and alcohol abuse. Since starting his tour of America as a clown back in 1992, Jackson claims he has popped over 6,000 hot water bottles. In April 2006, Jackson broke his first Guinness World Record for “Fastest Hot Water Bottle Burst” in 51.98 seconds. Fast-forward to April 2009 when he set “Fastest time to burse 3 hot water bottles” in one minute, eight seconds.

Back on July 6, 2012, Jackson also went on TruTV’s Guinness World Records Gone Wild where he set yet another record for “Most Hot Water Bottles Blown up in 1 Minute” with five. He has broken his own Guinness World Record for “Heaviest Vehicle Lifted with Breath” two times already, the last time occurring in Beijing, China, where he lifted a 3,352-pound car with only the power of his lungs.
