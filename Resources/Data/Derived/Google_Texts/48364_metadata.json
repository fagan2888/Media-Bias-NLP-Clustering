Burwell, the case that is being argued before the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Less than three years have passed since the A.C.A. survived its first existential threat before the Court, in a 5-4 decision that upheld the law as a constitutional exercise of the taxing power; and it was not even nine months ago that the Court, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, ruled that businesses could opt out of the A.C.A. if they considered it incompatible with their religious beliefs. Yet here we are again, plumbing the pages of the law for another potentially fatal weakness\u2014in this instance, a four-word phrase (\u201cestablished by the State\u201d) that, if your squint your eyes, turn the text sideways, and look at it through a lens provided by the lawyers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, could theoretically, but hardly plausibly, be said to render seven and a half million Americans ineligible for the federal subsidies that enable them to be insured through the A.C.A.\n\nFew cases simply \u201cfind\u201d their way to the Supreme Court\u2014they are incubated, hatched, nudged along. But King, more than most, has an ersatz, inorganic quality, like something cooked up in a lab. That is, of course, because it was\u2014by the C.E.I. and other crusading, close-reading conservative attorneys. Their selection of plaintiffs who have plainly suffered no harm from the A.C.A. suggests an experiment gone awry\u2014or, perhaps, an assuredness that most or maybe all of the Court\u2019s Republican appointees will entertain any argument, no matter how silly, that can derail or dismember the supposed abomination that is Obamacare.\n\nIn this, King is not that different from the first big case brought against the health law, argued in 2011. The challengers\u2019 claim that Congress could not, under the Commerce Clause of Article I of the Constitution, regulate \u201cinactivity\u201d (namely, the decision not to buy health insurance) was initially dismissed by just about everyone who had an opinion on the matter. Yet, in the end, it won the backing of the Court\u2019s five conservatives\u2014including Chief Justice Roberts, who, while upholding the A.C.A. on other grounds, put in a good word for this new, would-be doctrine. Increasingly, the conservatives\u2019 view seems to be that every crackpot idea\u2014if developed by right-thinking crackpots\u2014deserves its day in court, especially the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nOf course, statutory and constitutional interpretations tend to rest on the meaning\u2014often obscure or ambiguous\u2014of a single word or a phrase (\u201cequal protection,\u201d \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d). But the four words at issue in King are ambiguous only if considered in a vacuum, in an airless chamber where the purposes of the A.C.A. and the mechanisms it uses to achieve them\u2014such as the subsidy\u2014become the abstractions, and the deconstruction of texts becomes the reality.\n\nThat mindset is not unique to this set of judges; history shows that it is an occupational hazard. In one New Deal-era case, Justice George Sutherland\u2014the architect of most of the conservative rulings of the nineteen-twenties and thirties\u2014described the Great Depression as \u201cnothing new,\u201d just another cyclical downturn that would end as soon as debt-ridden Americans exercised some \u201cself-denial.\u201d Around the same time, in an opinion overturning the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Justice Owen Roberts dismissed the Dust Bowl as a regional issue, rather than a national one; it reflected \u201ca widespread similarity of local conditions\u201d that states would have to address without federal help. Much more recently, in 2007, there was Parents Involved, a school desegregation case most memorable for Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s blithe assurance that \u201cthe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\u201d\u2014an epigram worthy of Wilde, or Yoda, but revealing little awareness of what it takes to desegregate a school district.\n\nNo public officials are more detached from public life than Supreme Court Justices. Life tenure shields them (as it should) from the slings of popular opinion; a ban on video cameras in the Court chamber means that their faces are unfamiliar to many Americans; protocol encourages them to keep a low profile. (Not all do: Antonin Scalia and Sonia Sotomayor clearly relish their celebrity, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at eighty-one, is what the kids call \u201ctrending.\u201d) Occasionally the Justices go on book tours or give lectures overseas; they hang out at retreats with the Koch brothers or headline at the Aspen Ideas Festival. But these extrajudicial activities rarely introduce Justices to ideas they don\u2019t already hold, or to people whose lives have been altered by one of their opinions.\n\nThey are, at the same time, sensitive to the charge of being detached. We know this by the fact that they fling it at one another. In 1984, in a 5-4 decision limiting the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction in cases concerning state officials and agencies, Lewis F. Powell wrote that John Paul Stevens\u2019s dissent rested \u201con fiction\u201d and was \u201cout of touch with reality.\u201d Likewise, in an impassioned dissent in Schuette v. BAMN, an affirmative-action case decided last term, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the conservative majority\u2019s tendency to deny, or wish away, the relevance of race was \u201ca sentiment out of touch with reality.\u201d Their \u201crefusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. The Chief Justice, clearly stung, complained in a concurrence that \u201cit is not \u2018out of touch with reality\u2019 to conclude that racial preferences may \u2026 do more harm than good.\u201d\n\nBut being, or appearing, out of touch has its advantages. Some Justices, sometimes, may simply be oblivious to the real effects of their decisions; others may be oblivious when it suits them to be. Almost eighty years ago, in the Agricultural Adjustment Act case, Owen Roberts\u2019s straight-faced suggestion that states were experiencing their own distinct droughts and parallel dust storms permitted him to deny, also with a straight face, that the collapse of the agricultural sector was a national problem requiring a national solution. In a subsequent case, in 1937, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes rebuked his conservative colleagues for their willingness to \u201cshut [their] eyes to the plainest facts of our national life.\u201d We will get an idea at the oral argument for King which of our present Justices, if any, will shut their eyes and indulge the notion that the Obama Administration and Congress tucked away, in Section 36B of the A.C.A., one little phrase that, if taken literally, would someday cause the entire program to collapse. But if we take those Justices at their word, then it is we, not they, who are out of touch.\u200b", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160525190933, "description": "This challenge to the Affordable Care Act has an ersatz, inorganic quality, like something cooked up in a lab.
