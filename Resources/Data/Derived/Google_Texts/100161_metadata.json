Check these out:\n\nCover Oregon sought out visual artists to help them depict the Obamacare health exchange agency\u2019s mission that health insurance should be affordable and accessible to everyone. From Cover Oregon\u2019s website:\n\nNot only did this empower Oregonians to share their view of Cover Oregon and help us create communications that feel true to the communities across the state, it allowed us to put the Cover Oregon marketing dollars right back into the state, and into a population that is historically uninsured.\n\nThe ads once again show little about health care accessibility or what Cover Oregon is or does, a common criticism of the multi-million ad campaign promoting Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder many Americans don\u2019t even understand that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing.
