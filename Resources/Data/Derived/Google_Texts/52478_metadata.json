So it goes with the Renewable Fuel Standard, a 2007 law establishing a widely lauded goal of increasing the amount of renewable resources in our gasoline to fight climate change, revitalize rural communities and put the U.S. on a path to energy independence.\n\nIn less than a decade, what was once seen as a symbol of good government and the synthesis of agriculture, energy and environmental priorities has become a political punching bag.\n\nRenewable fuel is contentious inside the Beltway these days for one simple reason: oil industry influence. Being the only alternative liquid transportation fuel eating up precious market share at the pump, the fossil fuel industry will stop at nothing to maintain their monopoly. Of course, biofuels aren\u2019t the only alternatives facing this kind of lopsided fight; wind and solar are only just now breaking the chokehold of the utility industry\u2019s legacy players after more than three decades of struggle. We shouldn\u2019t have to wait that long for renewable fuel.\n\nOne could argue it\u2019s needed now more than ever. Climate change impacts have become more profound and urgent, rural communities are shedding jobs, and although oil prices are low today, they will continue to be unpredictable and it is only a matter of time before they rise again, subjecting the American pocketbook to geopolitical turmoil.\n\nNowhere is this more keenly understood than in Iowa, a corn state that prides itself on both agricultural innovation and developing alternatives to fossil fuels. And luckily, the Iowa caucuses provide an important mechanism to pull politicians away from the Washington bubble, out of earshot of the fossil fuel industry. After all, in Iowa, people matter more than big donors do. Once engrossed in true retail politics in diners and town halls, candidates can take a more rational look at the issue and talk to the thousands of men and women impacted by their decisions.\n\nOutside Washington, especially in the rural communities buoyed by biofuels\u2019 economic value, the tone is very different \u2014 one might say approaching unanimous. A newly released poll from America\u2019s Renewable Future and DuPont suggests Iowa caucus-goers from both parties \u2014 61 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats \u2014 would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate that supports the Renewable Fuel Standard and renewable fuels.\n\nIn fact, the Renewable Fuel Standard \u2014 which requires a certain amount of fuel produced each year to be made from renewable sources \u2014 is a clear winner for Iowa caucus-goers for a number of reasons: three-quarters of Republicans and 7 out of 8 Democrats surveyed cited greenhouse gas emissions reductions over gasoline as a reason to support the RFS. About nine out of ten voters in both parties approve of the strong job and wage benefits the RFS ensures for Iowa. And 86 percent of Republicans and 92 percent of Democrats support the RFS for the hundreds of thousands of American jobs it supports across the United States as a whole.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a political whiz kid to understand this phenomenon. The simple fact is that the renewable fuel industry supports some of Iowans\u2019 biggest priorities: jobs, agriculture and a sustainable future.\n\nAs it happens, these benefits are set to expand tremendously with cellulosic ethanol, showcased at the end of October when DuPont opens the world\u2019s largest cellulosic ethanol facility in central Iowa. Rather than processing corn kernels, the facility will create 30 million gallons of liquid renewable fuel from crop waste collected from within a 30-mile radius of the plant. This \u201cbiorefinery\u201d reflects the forward thinking and entrepreneurship of Iowans and squarely puts the state in the bull\u2019s-eye of the global advanced renewable fuel industry. It exemplifies both a pinnacle in human scientific achievement and the roll-up-your-sleeves hard work ethic of Iowa growers.\n\nThis facility will create 85 permanent jobs and 150 seasonal jobs for the collection, transport and storage of biomass. Second, it represents an entirely new revenue stream for the 500 farmers providing the cobs, stalks and leaves for feedstock. This biorefinery has also created a microcosm of technological and agricultural partnerships \u2014 from the companies developing custom farm equipment for feedstock collection to the government-academic collaboration to cultivate sustainable harvesting practices \u2014 that will only continue to grow and bear fruit in the coming years.\n\nFinally \u2014 and most importantly \u2014 this represents a tremendous milestone in creating clean, renewable and homegrown fuel to power U.S. vehicles. (Of course it doesn\u2019t hurt that we can export this technology to any agricultural economy in the world that also seeks to develop its own localized source of energy.)\n\nReasonable people in Iowa and across the country certainly don\u2019t see a downside to the job creation, agricultural revitalization and energy independence renewable fuel provides. In fact, that\u2019s a list of benefits members of both parties can certainly agree upon. Come election time, candidates would do well to remember just how important renewable fuels are to Iowans, and to so many Americans, who care about our environment, our economy and our energy security.\n\nPatty Judge is co-chair of America\u2019s Renewable Future and former lieutenant governor of Iowa.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1S555AX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Opening of  world\u2019s largest cellulosic plant this week shows benefits", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Opening of  world\u2019s largest cellulosic plant this week shows benefits", "title": "Column: To win Iowa, you must support ethanol \u2014 and that's good", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/caucus/2015/10/25/win-iowa-you-must-support-ethanol-and-s-good/74444674/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Opening of  world\u2019s largest cellulosic plant this week shows benefits", "title": "Column: To win Iowa, you must support ethanol \u2014 and that's good", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f02038617955f0428e946278d3536eb8e06173ac/c=0-26-207-233&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/DuPont Co.", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/DuPont Co.", "title": "Column: To win Iowa, you must support ethanol \u2014 and that's good", "author": "Patty Judge", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/iowa-view/caucus", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5137fe072670031b62a0438d9f63c9fd4b805ef9/c=6-0-200-258/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d92506b17ecb98a64ebd364651fe8ec0897ea272/c=0-26-207-233/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41d7a460ff28897605fdafe3911234dcb4ad1fd9/c=0-52-207-207/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f222ccefb44aa22ca67ddb5442ba724179f0cab6/c=0-71-207-187&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png", "publishtime": "2015-10-25T22:13:03.067000-05:00", "shorthed": "Column: To win Iowa you must support ethanol", "articleid": 74444674, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a4797e6cf6cb38f33313f4eba7577be6d877617c/c=0-71-207-187/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a5863c2e6d7d0f35e98b0db73606af72bed7840/c=31-0-176-258/local/-/media/2015/05/21/DesMoines/B9317439137Z.1_20150521224937_000_G18ARVMCI.1-0.png"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc29a\"", "article_summary": "The simple fact is that the renewable fuel industry supports some of Iowans\u2019 biggest priorities: jobs, agriculture and a sustainable future.\nThis \u201cbiorefinery\u201d reflects the forward thinking and entrepreneurship of Iowans and squarely puts the state in the bull\u2019s-eye of the global advanced renewable fuel industry.\nBeing the only alternative liquid transportation fuel eating up precious market share at the pump, the fossil fuel industry will stop at nothing to maintain their monopoly.\nRenewable fuel is contentious inside the Beltway these days for one simple reason: oil industry influence.\nWe shouldn\u2019t have to wait that long for renewable fuel."}
