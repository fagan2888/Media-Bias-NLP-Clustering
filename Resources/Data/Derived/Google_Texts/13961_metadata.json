(Portland Tribune) \u2014 State officials are moving in to take partial control of Portland-based health insurer Moda Health, citing financial struggles and risk to consumers.\n\nModa\u2019s finances have gotten so bad that officials will block the firm from selling or renewing policies and are moving to shift about 67,000 members to other insurers. The company has seven days to raise capital or it could face further restrictions.\n\nConsumers with questions should call the DCBS Division of Financial Regulation\u2019s consumer advocates at 1-888-877-4894 (toll-free). Staff will be available to answer calls until 8 p.m. More information can be found on the division\u2019s website\n\nThe move marks a dramatic reversal for the once-dominant firm, whose name adorns the Portland Trail Blazers arena and one of downtown Portland\u2019s taller buildings. It comes with only days left before a key enrollment deadline for people who purchase their own insurance and are not on Medicare.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging people to sign up with someone other than Moda in these final days of open enrollment,\u201d says Oregon Insurance Commissioner Laura Cali.\n\nCali and Patrick Allen, the state\u2019s consumer and business services director, say they are taking additional steps to protect consumers. For now, the company won\u2019t be allowed to sell or renew business coverage, though that could change. The firm will submit a plan to right its financial ship by end of day Friday, after which the state will determine whether it can resume selling and renewing policies for businesses.\n\nModa spokesman Jonathan Nicholas issued a statement saying the firm had resolved to \u201cexit\u201d the individual market for consumers who buy their own policies but are not on Medicare. It linked the company\u2019s struggles to the Affordable Care Act, which resulted in an influx of people with medical conditions who\u2019d previously been uninsured.\n\n\u201cBringing tens of thousands of people into the ACA marketplace, many of them with acute healthcare needs, has been a difficult process to manage,\u201d according to a statement attributed to Robert Gootee, CEO of the parent company of Moda Health, Moda, Inc.\n\nA state financial examiner has been stationed at Moda headquarters since Wednesday, and no significant financial transactions will be allowed without advance approval. Alaska, where the firm also does business, is expected to take similar steps.\n\nRumors have swirled for months about Moda\u2019s financial condition. The firm last year received a $50 million loan from Oregon Health & Science University as well as one of the same amount from its parent company.\n\nThen, on Monday night, Cali received word from a top Alaska insurance regulator that the firm\u2019s condition had deteriorated further. By Wednesday evening she\u2019d issued an \u201corder of immediate supervision\u201d that authorized the state\u2019s move. It said Moda\u2019s finances are \u201cin such condition that its continuation of business with financial results currently reported is hazardous to the public or to its insureds.\u201d\n\nOfficials are arranging a special enrollment period for the roughly 67,000 Oregonians who\u2019ve signed up with Moda in the current individual market enrolment period, which ends Jan. 31. They\u2019ll be asked to select a different insurer instead.\n\nAllen expects minimal impacts for Moda members who are enrolled in group insurance \u2013 roughly 145,000 Oregonians as of last fall. Nor will there be immediate impact on 43,000 teachers and state employees enrolled through Moda, or the 48,000 members served by a Medicaid managed care company in Eastern Oregon that Moda partly owns, according to the state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be working with the company to make sure they pay claims,\u201d Cali says.\n\nThe state\u2019s legal order gives the company seven days to raise funds to boost its capital reserves to an acceptable level.\n\nModa took a major hit last year when about $90 million in financial assistance expected from the federal government for 2014 did not materialize. Though most Oregon insurers had booked only a fraction of the funds as likely to be forthcoming, Moda booked 100 percent of the funds, an approach that allowed it to justify lower rates. The company later raised its 2016 rates by an average 25 percent in the individual market, and some agents felt the firm was doing everything it could to shed members and reduce exposure to costly medical claims.\n\nIn November, Oregon Health & Science University reached a potential deal to convert its loan into a 25-percent stake in Moda. In a statement, the university expressed concern but did not directly address whether it planned to follow through or expand its involvement to address Moda\u2019s need for capital. The OHSU board is meeting today.\n\n\u201cWhile the news of Moda\u2019s fourth quarter performance is disappointing, OHSU remains committed to its vision of building an Oregon-based health care system that will include partnerships with hospitals, provider groups and payers,\u201d said the statement.\n\nKOIN 6 News received the following statement from the Portland Trail Blazers:\n\n\u201cOur partnership is with Moda, Inc., holding company for Moda Health and other subsidiaries. That relationship remains strong, and we anticipate no changes following today\u2019s news.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "Moda\u2019s finances have gotten so bad that officials will block the firm from selling or renewing policies and are moving to shift about 67,000 members to other insurers.
