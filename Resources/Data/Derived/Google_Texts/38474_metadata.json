And this time, that will be a hard deadline.\n\nIn a post published December 7 on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services blog, Healthcare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan said that the government would not be offering an extension. Since 2015 was the first year that people without insurance had to pay a tax penalty, the Obama administration decided to give those people a special enrollment period until April 30 to sign up. In 2016, the uninsured won\u2019t get that chance.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the final deadline to sign up for 2016 coverage through HealthCare.gov is January 31,\u201d Counihan wrote. \u201cA Special Enrollment Period around the April 15 tax filing deadline will not be offered this year.\u201d\n\nMost Americans get insurance from their employers, their spouses or parents, Medicare, or Medicaid, so they don\u2019t have to worry about this deadline at all. But people without such insurance must buy a health plan by Jan. 31 to be covered in 2016 and avoid the penalty in 2017. Enroll by Dec. 15 if you want coverage to start Jan. 1. You can shop for plans from private insurers on a government-run \u201cmarketplace\u201d at Healthcare.gov. The Affordable Care Act also provides for subsidies to help cover the cost of premiums on marketplace plans.\n\nGenerally, you can only buy this health insurance during \u201copen enrollment,\u201d which started in November 2015 and runs through Jan. 31, 2016. After that time period is up, you\u2019ll need to show that you experienced a \u201cqualifying life event\u201c\u2014like losing your job, getting married, or having a kid\u2014in order to buy an Obamacare plan.\n\nMiss this window, and not only will you remain uninsured, but you\u2019ll also have to pay a tax next year. The tax is called the \u201cindividual shared responsibility payment,\u201d also known as the individual mandate. People who were uninsured in 2014 had to pay either 1% of their income or $95 per adult (capped at $285), whichever was higher. If you\u2019ve been uninsured in 2015, next spring you\u2019ll have to pay either 2% of your income or $325 per adult (capped at $975).\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t get health coverage for 2016, you\u2019ll have to pay either 2.5% of your income or $695 per adult (capped at $2,085) in 2017. No matter what, the law ensures that you\u2019ll never pay more than the average total yearly premiums for an Obamacare bronze plan.\n\nSo if you\u2019re uninsured, sign up for a plan before Jan. 31, 2016: This deadline isn\u2019t moving.\n\nFor more help:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan said that the government would not be offering an extension like it did last year.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Buy a healthcare plan before open enrollment ends.", "title": "Obamacare Procrastinators Beware: There Won't Be a Deadline Extension This Time", "url": "http://time.com/money/4140978/obamacare-deadline-extension-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/151208_ff_noobamacareextension.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/151208_ff_noobamacareextension.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Buy a healthcare plan before open enrollment ends.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare Procrastinators Beware: There Won't Be a Deadline Extension This Time"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", aca, affordable care act, health care, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, open enrollment, aca, affordable care act, healthcare.gov, obamacare deadline, open enrollment deadline, aca deadline, how do i get obamacare"}, "article_summary": "People without health insurance have until Jan. 31, 2016, to buy an Obamacare plan on the government-run marketplace.\nSo if you\u2019re uninsured, sign up for a plan before Jan. 31, 2016: This deadline isn\u2019t moving.\nGenerally, you can only buy this health insurance during \u201copen enrollment,\u201d which started in November 2015 and runs through Jan. 31, 2016.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the final deadline to sign up for 2016 coverage through HealthCare.gov is January 31,\u201d Counihan wrote.\nBut people without such insurance must buy a health plan by Jan. 31 to be covered in 2016 and avoid the penalty in 2017."}
