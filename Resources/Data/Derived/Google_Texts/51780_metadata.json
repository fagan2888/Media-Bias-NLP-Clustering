J.D. Sheffield (R-Gatesville) on March 10. The bill would ban the state of Texas from participating in health care exchanges. This would erect a barrier making it more difficult for Obamacare to be properly implemented in the state.\n\nThe bill states the following:\n\nA health benefit exchange described in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. No. 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-152), may not be established in this state.\n\nHB2782 has added relevance because the Supreme Court is hearing King vs. Burwell, which pertains to state-run health care exchanges. A decision in favor of King could invalidate the subsidy regime for states refusing exchanges, and greatly disrupt Obamacare. Regardless, it is incumbent upon the states to resist. Sacrificing health care freedom to take federal money is always a terrible decision, and the opinions of some judges does not change that one bit.\n\nThe bill creates impediments to the implementation of Obamacare and lays the foundation for further action to nullify the ACA in Texas. The large number of states refusing to set up an exchange has already created problems for the feds. For instance, the widespread problems with the Obamacare website would have likely been avoided had each state set up its own exchange as intended.\n\nThe next step after HB2782 would be a bill prohibiting any state cooperation with implementation of the ACA and then move forward with the other steps in the Tenth Amendment Center\u2019s four-step plan to nullify Obamacare, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano noted that such actions were not just legal, but effective.\n\n\u201cIf enough states do this, it will gut Obamacare because the federal government doesn\u2019t have the resources\u2026to go into each of the states if they start refusing,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on the long-standing principle known as the anti-commandeering doctrine, the legislation is on strong legal grounds. In four major cases from 1842 to 2012, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the federal government cannot \u201ccommandeer\u201d states, requiring them to enforce or expend resources to participate in federal law or regulatory programs.\n\nIf HB2782 is passed, Texas residents will be well on their way toward being protected from Obamacare. However, they won\u2019t be fully safeguarded until our more comprehensive four-step plan is in full effect. That means that there is still much work that needs to be done to save the state\u2019s health freedom from federal intrusion.\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\n\n\nFor Texas: Take steps to fight Obamacare HERE.\n\nFor other states: Take steps to fight Obamacare in your state HERE.\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill to ban the creation of a state-run health insurance exchange, a key provision needed to fully enact Obamacare, was filed\u00a0in the Texas state House", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center Blog", "description": "A bill to ban the creation of a state-run health insurance exchange, a key provision needed to fully enact Obamacare, was filed\u00a0in the Texas state House last\u00a0week.
