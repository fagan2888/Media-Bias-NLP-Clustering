Lee\u2019s asthma symptoms prohibit him from playing soccer ( Heidi de Marco/KHN )\n\nChildren in California increasingly are flocking to emergency rooms for treatment of asthma, despite millions of dollars spent on programs to control the disease.\n\nStatewide, the rates of ER visits for asthma symptoms rose by about 18 percent for California children ages 5 to 17 and by 6 percent for children under 5 between 2005 and 2012, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of the latest available rates by county.\n\nIn some parts of the state, especially the Central Valley, the increases were far higher. The rate of emergency room visits for children 5 and older more than doubled in rural Madera County and nearly doubled In Merced. In Sacramento County, they rose by 48 percent and in Los Angeles, the largest county in the nation, by 17 percent.\n\nAll told, more than 72,000 California children under 18 visited the ER for asthma in 2012.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly more work to be done if this many kids are going to the emergency department,\u201d said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program of the Oakland-based Public Health Institute. \u201cWe know a lot about what works. We absolutely should be able to reduce the rates we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nAt the national level, asthma-related emergency room visit rates have declined in recent years, according to federal health data through 2010, the latest available.\n\nAlthough ER visits declined in some counties, including Alameda, San Mateo and Marin, the overall rise in California has frustrated public health experts who have spent millions of dollars and countless hours to improve and expand asthma prevention programs around the state. The state and federal governments alone spend $1.54 million annually on such projects in California, including grants to schools to improve indoor air quality and training community health workers.\n\nThe good news is fewer kids are actually being admitted into hospitals. Overnight-or-longer stays are declining statewide and nationally. That\u2019s due largely to better medicines and more aggressive treatment in the ER, asthma specialists say.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in ER visits are complex, experts say. They include parents not properly administering medications, poverty and inadequate insurance coverage, persistently high levels of indoor and outdoor pollution in some regions and the limited reach of programs that seek to manage symptoms or prevent them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rising rates don\u2019t seem to reflect an actual increase in the respiratory disease \u2013 about 15 percent of California children have been diagnosed with asthma, a number that has remained fairly steady since 2001.\n\nThe rates of ER visits vary widely by county, from a high of 300 visits per 10,000 children under age 5 (Madera County) to a low of 32 (Sutter County) in 2012. Younger children visit the ER at higher rates because they are more likely to have undiagnosed asthma and because their lung function is more difficult to measure, complicating the task of finding the right combination of medicines, Kelsey Lamb said.\n\nSome families seek treatment in the ER for symptoms that easily could be dealt with in a clinic because they can\u2019t get a timely doctor\u2019s appointment or don\u2019t have a regular doctor \u2013 especially those without health insurance. Sometimes, a bad cold and flu season can aggravate asthma that is usually well-controlled.\n\nAffected children often live in homes with dust, mold or pets, which trigger asthma symptoms. They may need two inhalers \u2013 one for school and one for home \u2013 but insurance sometimes only pays for one.\n\nIn the Central Valley, persistent poverty and outdoor air pollution levels combine to produce the highest rates of ER visits for childhood asthma in the state.\n\nWhile particulate matter and ozone air pollution levels are declining somewhat in the region, they still can be high enough to trigger asthma attacks, said John Capitman, a California State University-nono public health professor and executive director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute. In Los Angeles, the same holds true, although particulates are slightly lower than in parts of in the Central Valley .\n\nAcross California, local and regional asthma programs aim to educate families and doctors to help keep kids out of the hospital. In counties including Orange and Los Angeles, medically equipped vans called \u201cBreathmobiles\u201d provide comprehensive care in community settings and ensure children don\u2019t end up repeatedly in the ER.\n\nIt worked for Daniel Lee, 5, of Buena Park, who was still experiencing severe asthma symptoms after five trips to the ER last year. It turned out the doctors at the hospital had mixed his medications incorrectly \u2014 a common mistake when kids are treated in emergency rooms rather than by asthma-trained pediatricians, said Dr. Olga Guijon, associate medical director of the Breathmobile for Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County.\n\n\u201cAll he wants to do is play soccer,\u201d said his mother Young Lee, during a recent visit to the Breathmobile in Anaheim. \u201cBut every time he\u2019s running around on the field, he says: \u2018I feel weird\u2019. So he has to stop.\u201d\n\nDaniel has improved drastically after being treated at the Breathmobile and having his medication adjusted, his mother said.\n\nThough often effective, these programs are expensive and can\u2019t serve enough children to make a real difference statewide, Capitman said. And health outreach workers have found it difficult to get reimbursed by insurers, including Medi-Cal, for proven strategies including home visits to minimize risks, Capitman said.\n\nDr. Amy Harrison, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Orange County, suggested that the recession had driven some families to her hospital\u2019s ER, because they had lost their insurance or had high-deductible insurance that led them to forego prescriptions and regular doctor visits.\n\nBecause the data don\u2019t extend beyond 2012, it remains unclear how expanded coverage offered since last year under the Affordable Care Act and California\u2019s Medicaid program will affect emergency room visits. But experts like Capitman hope to see more funding for programs that manage or prevent asthma symptoms through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n\nAsthma care for kids has improved markedly in recent years, in part because of the wider use of steroid inhalers. Influential asthma management guidelines released in 2007 also have helped.\n\nBut some families simply don\u2019t know how to manage their child\u2019s condition at home, or know when to seek medical care before an ER visit becomes necessary, said Dr. Rami Keisari, medical director of the Pediatric Asthma Disease Management Program at the county-run Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges we have is getting parents to use the medications every day,\u201d Keisari said. \u201cWe have a really hard time convincing parents that this is a chronic condition.\u201d\n\nSome of the few large counties with declining ER visits have invested heavily in targeting kids who are at risk. Alameda County children who have been treated in ERs are referred to the county\u2019s free Asthma Start program, which offers free home visits during which health workers identify asthma triggers, offer education and provide equipment such as spacers and nebulizers \u2013 even vacuum cleaners, said program director Brenda Yamashita of the Alameda County Department of Public Health.\n\nParents learn to freeze stuffed animals to kill asthma-triggering dust mites, track their children\u2019s symptoms on a calendar, and clean surfaces without bleach, which can aggravate symptoms. Alameda Alliance for Health, the county\u2019s public, nonprofit health insurance plan, reimburses Yamashita\u2019s program for home visits.\n\nFor parents in substandard rental housing, staffers call on the county\u2019s Healthy Homes department to press landlords to get rid of vermin, fix leaks and address other code violations.\n\nIn Santa Clara County, Keisari\u2019s staff keeps tabs on kids for as long as three years. Every month, a public health nurse calls parents and asks about their children\u2019s symptoms and medications.\n\nThe county\u2019s overall child ER visit rates are low compared to other counties. Even so, the number of children the program serves is limited compared to the need. And while the county\u2019s asthma ER visit rates declined by 21 percent for children under 5, they rose 12 percent for children aged 5 to 17.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing better with all these programs, but is it adequate? No. Every time a kid winds up in the ER with bad exacerbation of asthma, it\u2019s a failure,\u201d said Stanford University child health policy researcher Dr. Paul Wise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Statewide, asthma visits to the ER went up 18 percent, and more than doubled in parts of the Central Valley.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Despite Efforts, ER Visits Spike in California Kids with Asthma\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/24\\/despite-efforts-er-visits-spike-in-california-kids-with-asthma\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-24 08:30:01\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-29 11:04:06\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":29198,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"asthma\",\"Children's Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/er-asthma-8-e1432336118626.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Statewide, asthma visits to the ER went up 18 percent, and more than doubled in parts of the Central Valley.", "title": "Despite Efforts, ER Visits Spike in California Kids with Asthma", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/24/despite-efforts-er-visits-spike-in-california-kids-with-asthma/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/er-asthma-10-400x267.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "asthma,children\\'s health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2b7\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s due largely to better medicines and more aggressive treatment in the ER, asthma specialists say.\nAll told, more than 72,000 California children under 18 visited the ER for asthma in 2012.\nThe reasons for the increase in ER visits are complex, experts say.\nIn the Central Valley, persistent poverty and outdoor air pollution levels combine to produce the highest rates of ER visits for childhood asthma in the state.\nIt worked for Daniel Lee, 5, of Buena Park, who was still experiencing severe asthma symptoms after five trips to the ER last year."}
