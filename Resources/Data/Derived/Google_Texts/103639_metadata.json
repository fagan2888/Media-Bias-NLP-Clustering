The other supported Cruz and are despondent.\n\nHow long will the Tea Party be misunderstood? For forever, apparently.\n\nI\u2019ve attended multiple Tea Parties, organizational meetings, national conventions, and national Tea Party gatherings as a reporter. Having interviewed many staunch Tea Partiers, I came to see two main \u201cTypes\u201d:\n\nThe Disaffected Republicans\n\nThese people are fiscally conservative, small government types. They felt betrayed by George W. Bush\u2019s government expansion and lavish spending. They were insulted by the term \u201ccompassionate conservative.\u201d Conservatism, in their view, is compassionate by its very nature. They disliked the Department of Homeland Security, No Child Left Behind, the TSA, and unchecked data gathering. The last straw was the big Bank Buyouts. They weren\u2019t fond of McCain or Romney who they viewed as big government types, too. They weren\u2019t Libertarian, exactly, but they distrusted the government, and wanted more fiscal control. They were socially conservative. Many former Christian Coalition types could be found here.\n\nThe Awakened\n\nThese people had never thought about politics before. They were patriotic Americans who voted for their President but didn\u2019t pay attention beyond that. They were galvanized by the Bank Bailouts and by Barak Obama\u2019s statist rhetoric. They were offended by Obamacare and Obamaphones. They were small business owners who felt worried about the future. They were people who were losing their homes and livelihoods. Many were blue collar types and former moderate Democrats who felt like they didn\u2019t have a home. These folks liked their Social Security. They were socially agnostic or liberal. Many I spoke to supported abortion or hadn\u2019t given it much thought. To them, bailing out the banks was unfair. They were sick of the Big Corporations getting the deals. They were sick of anti-Americanism.\n\nThe Disaffected Republicans were loyal conservatives and fed up and looking for decent and trustworthy candidates. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Marco Rubio, and too many house members to mention were brought in to slay the big fat GOP cats who\u2019d ignored the will of their voters for too long. These folks vote principles. They supported Ted Cruz.\n\nThese voters are not sure where to go now. Some are part of the #NeverTrump crowd. Some refuse to vote for Hillary, but don\u2019t know what to do beyond that.\n\nThe Awakened, whose poster child is Trump\u2019s spokeswoman and Dallas, Texas-area Tea Party leader Katrina Pierson, were angry. They were sick of feeling helpless for different reasons. They lost their homes. They lost their jobs. Big corporation and bank bailouts felt grossly unfair to these people. They saw an American president who didn\u2019t like America.\n\nWhat united these groups into one big Tea Party: Patriotism. Disaffection with the government. A sense that America was going the wrong direction. Saddling the next generation with debt.\n\nSo many Americans resonated with this perspective that the final two Republican candidates were Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Adding Marco Rubio\u2019s support in there, the vast majority of Republicans and some Democrats, too (many if you consider the Occupy Movement and their candidate Bernie Sanders) loathed their political leadership.\n\nThey wanted Change, alright, just not the kind Barak Obama was bringing to America. Their disaffection has not abated. Even with giving Republicans historic victories in two consecutive midterm elections, the GOP leadership had no idea what they were facing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of marchers could not get their attention.\n\nHistoric elections could not get their attention.\n\nSo now, there\u2019s Donald Trump. And Ted Cruz. And to a lesser extent Marco Rubio.\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s supporters are true conservatives. He was their chance to finally, at last, affect some real change. They were Trumped. The Awakened, moderate Republicans and Democrats, blue collar workers, and those who\u2019ve suffered and feel alienated have more numbers. The GOP leadership, caught between two candidates they disliked, did nothing to help Cruz, which helped Trump.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s flame throwing rhetoric and rage against the machine spoke to more people. If he doesn\u2019t scorch some earth, there will be blood. There may be blood, anyway.\n\nThe media that bottle fed Obama and coddles Hillary Clinton, the Democrats that bailed out Banks, gave America Obamacare, and have wussified America, the Republican leadership that cares more about appeasing Obama and the Democrats even with an overwhelming majority, the Republicans that adopted the PC language and policy of the left, the profligate GOP who spent, but just spent less, they are the enemy of these voters.\n\nOne can argue about whether their anger is justified. One can argue about whether Donald Trump is the best vehicle for their vengeance. (Personally, I think they\u2019ll be bitterly disappointed with their Deal Maker\u2013he\u2019s going to be making deals with the devil.) But this is, in part, how we got here.\n\nThe Tea Party is itself divided. And they divided between Trump and Cruz. Combined, they form the majority of the GOP electorate. It\u2019s not clear that the GOP understands the new reality.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve attended multiple Tea Parties, organizational meetings, national conventions, and national Tea Party gatherings as a reporter.\nThe Awakened, whose poster child is Trump\u2019s spokeswoman and Dallas, Texas-area Tea Party leader Katrina Pierson, were angry.\nWhat united these groups into one big Tea Party: Patriotism.\nSo many Americans resonated with this perspective that the final two Republican candidates were Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.\nHow long will the Tea Party be misunderstood?"}
