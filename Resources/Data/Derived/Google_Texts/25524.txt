There was also a picture making the rounds online Friday morning. It shows Durant in a wig with Russell Westbrook in the background.

There were also a couple of photos that were taken from his phone, including one showing Durant smoking what he says is Hookah.

This is a new story many of you will be talking about Friday. Thunder basketball star Kevin Durant says his cell phone has been hacked, and overnight, photos from that phone have been leaked online.

KD's family was also a target.

Whoever hacked into Kevin Durant's phone Thursday night went through his contacts and sent messages out to his mom, his dad and his brother.

It was just after 1 a.m. Friday when KD posted this on Twitter: "Yoooo somebody hacked my phone though...it's blowing me, not my twitter my phone."

Right after that he wrote: "Texting my contacts crazy messages, my mom, dad, brother. Disrespecting them. How can you do that?"

There were also a couple of photos that were taken from his phone, including one showing Durant smoking what he says is Hookah.

Because the Thunder played in Denver Friday night, some of his followers on Twitter are speculating it was something else being smoked. But KD went on the defense, tweeting again to say it was nothing illegal.

By the way, this isn't the first time this has happened. It wasn't that long ago Durant's Instagram account was also hacked.

Kendrick Perkins was also on Twitter just a couple hours ago, blasting a local sports writer following a harsh review of Thursday night's loss against the Nuggets. Perkins called Oklahoman reporter Darnell Mayberry a "Thunder Hater" and "snake in the grass." It's now deleted.
