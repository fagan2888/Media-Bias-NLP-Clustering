Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the newsletter\n\n\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nDucking Donald\n\n\n\nWild words by Donald Trump usually are dismissed as mere billionaire bluster. Not so when he's running for president. Macy's, Univision, NBC and others cut ties with him after he called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug smugglers. What offends many Latino activists is what's not being said about it by other GOP candidates. They seem to hope he'll just shut up. Not likely.\n\nBreaking a Bank\n\nIt seems like a government program Republicans could live with, even embrace: a \"bank\" that helps foreigners buy big U.S. goods like airplanes and, as a result, protects lots of jobs. Instead, killing the Export-Import Bank became a litmus test for far-right Republicans, who have closed it, at least for now. How did it happen? A money trail leads to the billionaire Koch brothers.\n\nBackcourt Strategy\n\nHas the Supreme Court shifted left? No, scholars say, despite big rulings for Obamacare and same-sex marriage. It's still 5-4 for the conservatives, but a solid show of unity by the left-leaning justices was a sound strategy against the divided right. A key was choosing which cases to hear. The conservatives may simply have chosen poorly.\n\nGreece and the Greeks\n\nForget \"Greece\" for a moment and consider the plight of Greeks: Their banks are closed. A quarter are unemployed. Their hospitals are broken. Their government is broke. And they're being asked to vote Sunday on a financial bailout scheme even some economists can't decipher. Some worry it's really a vote on whether they're Europeans -- or something else.\n\nDribs and Drabs Add Up\n\nShorter showers. Fewer flushes. Less lawn. It might actually be working. Residential water use in California plummeted 29% in May from a year earlier. It's the first credible sign that the state might meet tough cuts demanded by Gov. Jerry Brown because of the drought. Now comes a tougher test: the hot summer season, when outdoor watering typically is 80% of consumption.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\n-- Former state Sen.
