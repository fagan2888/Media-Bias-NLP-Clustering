John Hickenlooper in 2011.\n\nBy naming creative districts, the intent is to ignite creative entrepreneurship and innovation in communities by providing funding, professional assistance, training and networking opportunities.\n\n\u201cThese 2014 certified and candidate creative districts are great examples of how the arts create exciting places for people to visit and live,\u201d Hickenlooper said in a statement. \u201cThese districts not only increase quality of life, they also help with economic vitality of the area and attract people from all over Colorado and the country.\n\nEven after the two-year program, final certification is not guaranteed. 40 West was one of seven districts vying for four spots. The four will receive $20,000 and long-term support in helping 40 West thrive, said Colorado Creative Industries director Margaret Hunt.\n\nAlso certified this year was downtown Colorado Springs, Denver\u2019s RiNo Art District and the Greeley Creative District. They\u2019ll join seven existing districts that have been certified by Colorado Creative Industries.\n\nSeven candidate districts were also selected to begin the two-year incubation program, including the Evergreen Creative District.\n\nAustin Briggs: 303-954-1729, abriggs@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "40 West Arts District in Lakewood one of 4 new state-certified creative districts", "title": "40 West Arts District in Lakewood one of 4 new state-certified creative districts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/40-west-arts-district-in-lakewood-one-of-4-new-state-certified-creative-districts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__lakewood_artp1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__lakewood_artp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T13:48:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:19:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After a two-year incubation period and competitive selection process, the 40 West Arts District in Lakewood has been certified into the Colorado Creative District program.\nThe four will receive $20,000 and long-term support in helping 40 West thrive, said Colorado Creative Industries director Margaret Hunt.\n!\u201dColorado Creative Industries is a division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, part of legislation signed by Gov.\nBy naming creative districts, the intent is to ignite creative entrepreneurship and innovation in communities by providing funding, professional assistance, training and networking opportunities.\nThe certification was awarded by Colorado Creative Industries and the Boettcher Foundation."}
