Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or rash.\n\nChikungunya does not often result in death, but the symptoms can be severe and disabling, the CDC says. Most people recover within a week but in some cases can experience joint pain that persists for months.\n\nSymptoms typically begin three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.\n\nTo protect yourself and your family against mosquito bites, the Alamance County Health Department says:", "article_metadata": {"description": "BURLINGTON, N.C. -- North Carolina's second case of chikungunya was confirmed Wednesday in an Alamance County resident who recently traveled to the Caribbean.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "BURLINGTON, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s second case of chikungunya was confirmed Wednesday in an Alamance County resident who recently traveled to the Caribbean.
