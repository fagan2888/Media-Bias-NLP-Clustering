The 2013 housing market was Wisconsin's best since the recession, as an improving economy and job confidence prompted more consumers to buy a home.

However, the pace of growth could slow this year as interest rates and prices rise, an economist said Monday.

"I do think we're going to see sort of a moderation of the good times," said David Clark, a Marquette University economic professor who analyzes home sales data for the Wisconsin Realtors Association. "But I don't think we're going to see a reversal of good times."

Existing home sales were up 10.8% across the state last year, according to data released Monday by the state Realtors group. At the same time, the median price of homes sold in the state rose 7.2%, to $143,500 from $133,900.

A separate local report Monday from the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors showed 9.8% sales growth in the four-county Milwaukee metropolitan area, with sales of existing homes topping 18,000 for the first time since 2006.

The housing market has been one of the bright spots in the economic recovery, and serves to stimulate other businesses, such as sellers of lawn mowers, furniture and appliances.

"There is that ripple effect," Clark said.

Housing benefited from a number of factors in 2013, among them a better economy, more jobs and fewer new foreclosed properties to weigh down market prices.

Speaking along with Marquette's Clark on Monday at the annual Realtors Economic Summit at Marquette University, Russell Kashian, a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater economics professor, said the foreclosure crisis is over.

"We have finally cracked the bubble. We're back to where we were in 2006," Kashian said of new foreclosure filings. "And I will guarantee you 2014 will be lower than 2013."

Foreclosure filings in courts around the state plunged 31.9% last year, to 15,563 from 22,852. The peak year for mortgage foreclosure filings was 2009, with 28,532.

In 2012, foreclosures made up 12% of the four-county Milwaukee metro market, while last year, foreclosures accounted for 7% of sales.

But as foreclosure filings have been fading, interest rates have been rising. According to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, the interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage in December was 4.46% with 0.7 points, compared with 3.35% and 0.7 points in December of 2012.

Rates are expected to go up as the Federal Reserve cuts back on a stimulus that has helped keep rates near historical lows. Some real estate professionals say the fact rates appear headed up actually may have encouraged some buyers to make a move in 2013.

"I think the interest rate got them off the fence," said Shorewest Realtor Paula Langlois. "It didn't stop the market. It moved the market forward because they realized that probably yesterday was the best time to buy."

Costs could increase

But rising interest rates could hurt affordability this year, especially combined with prices that have climbed as demand has increased, Clark said.

Clark said there are two other factors that could affect the market this year: financial reform by Congress that sets new standards for mortgage borrowers, and the possible impact of health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act.

"The concern that housing economists have is that the pendulum has swung perhaps a bit too far, and you effectively keep some people out of homes who in less-restrictive environments would be able to qualify for a loan," Clark said of the new mortgage guidelines.

On the Affordable Care Act, he said: "The real concern that an awful lot of people have is that there's going to be sticker shock associated with the cost of health care. If, in fact, there is sticker shock, it will ultimately filter into the housing market, as you have to take into consideration those monthly expenses."

Clark said he expects Wisconsin existing home sales to grow in 2014 — just not at the double-digit percentage pace of 2013.

"I think we'll see low single-digit growth rates," Clark said.

Home prices, while increasing, still are down significantly from before the recession. The median sale price of Wisconsin homes sold in 2007 was $163,000, compared with last year's $143,500 mark.

The city of Milwaukee saw a 12.3% jump in the average sale price (the local Realtors group uses average price while the state organization uses median price) last year, to $101,197 from $90,148 in 2012. Milwaukee County's average price increased 10.5%, to $141,598 from $128,105 a year earlier.

Average sale prices in other counties, according to the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors:

■ Waukesha: $276,000, up 6.4% from $259,361 in 2012.

■ Ozaukee County: $282,220, up 8.9% from $259,102.

■ Washington: $202,848, up 2.4% from $198,138.
