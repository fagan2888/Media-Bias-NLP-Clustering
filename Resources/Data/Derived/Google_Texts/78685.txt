Dequincy Janeah King was only 19 when he went to Pansan’s Sports Bar at 3:15 E. Arvada St. in Colorado Springs on Jan. 23, 2004.

The bar remained opened after 2 a.m. because it had hosted an after-hours party, according to a Colorado Springs Gazette article.

Exhausted, King told family and friends he was going to go outside and sleep in the car until the party was over. That was at 2:40 a.m.

The car was parked in the parking lot of a nearby apartment complex that had been known as a base for prostitution and drug dealing.

His friend went out 10 minutes later to check on Dequincy and he was doing fine.

At 3:20 a.m., he checked on him again and he was okay, according to a Colorado Springs police report.

But a half hour later, the friend saw blood on his face.

She rushed him to Memorial Hospital and left him bleeding at the emergency entrance of the hospital at about 4 a.m.

Doctors pronounced Dequincy dead at 6:15 p.m.

Dequincy had moved to Colorado Springs a week earlier to find a job to support his wife and stepchildren.

No arrests have been made in his case.
