New York City Police are looking for a group of men who raped a woman who was walking inside a park with her father.

The 18-year-old woman was accosted just after 9 p.m. Thursday as the two walked inside Osborn Playground in Brooklyn, New York.

Police say five men approached the pair. They say one of the men pointed a gun at the father and told him to leave.

Authorities say each of the five men took turns raping the woman. The father returned with two police officers, but the attackers fled.

The woman was treated at Kings County Hospital and released.

Police have released surveillance video that they say shows the five men in a bodega before the rape.
