In fact, according to the Washington Post, Obama has served longer than any president in decades without a scandal, as measured by the appearance of the word \u201cscandal\u201d (or lack thereof).\n\nNow, here are 44 OTHER things that the 44th President of the United States has accomplished during his tenure:\n\n1. Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America\u2019s long-term fiscal problems.\n\n2. Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs.\n\n3. Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide \u201cliving wills\u201d to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers\u2019 money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies.\n\n4. Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country. Last troops left on December 18, 2011.\n\n5. Drawdown of War in Afghanistan: From a peak of 101,000 troops in June 2011, U.S. forces are now down to 30,000.\n\n6. Eliminated Osama bin laden: In 2011, ordered special forces raid of secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which the terrorist leader was killed and a trove of al-Qaeda documents was discovered.\n\n7. Turned Around U.S. Auto Industry: In 2009, injected $62 billion in federal money (on top of $13.4 billion in loans from the Bush administration) into ailing GM and Chrysler in return for equity stakes and agreements for massive restructuring. Since bottoming out in 2009, the auto industry has added more than 100,000 jobs. In 2011, the Big Three automakers all gained market share for the first time in two decades.\n\n8. Recapitalized Banks: In the midst of financial crisis, approved controversial Treasury Department plan to lure private capital into the country\u2019s largest banks via \u201cstress tests\u201d of their balance sheets and a public-private fund to buy their \u201ctoxic\u201d assets. Got banks back on their feet at essentially zero cost to the government.\n\n9. Repealed \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d: Ended 1990s-era restriction and formalized new policy allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military for the first time.\n\n10. Toppled Moammar Gaddafi: In March 2011, joined a coalition of European and Arab governments in military action, including air power and naval blockade, against Gaddafi regime to defend Libyan civilians and support rebel troops. Gaddafi\u2019s forty-two-year rule ended when the dictator was overthrown and killed by rebels on October 20, 2011. No American lives were lost.\n\nFor the entire list please visit http://blackdoctor.org/477384/job-well-done-44-things-president-barack-obama-accomplished/", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "North Dallas Gazette", "description": "Besides being the only president to issue reform on same sex marriage, create the affordable healthcare act forbidding insurance agencies to deny people because of age or condition, reduced the unemployment rate the the lowest its been in over 11 years, gas prices are at an all time low\u2026he\u2019s done all of this while also\u00a0avoiding \u2026", "title": "What did Obama accomplish?
