Roberts Jr.\u2019s vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax subsidies on Thursday and his dissent from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision recognizing a constitutional right of same-sex marriage on Friday. Both sides accused him of voting politically: On Thursday he was taken to task by the right, and on Friday by the left.\n\nIn fact, the chief justice\u2019s votes in both cases were entirely consistent and constitutionally principled. He embraced a bipartisan vision of judicial restraint based on the idea that the Supreme Court should generally defer to the choices of Congress and state legislatures. His insistence that the court should hesitate to second-guess the political branches regardless of whether liberals or conservatives win is based on his conception of the limited institutional role of the court in relation to the president, Congress and the states.\n\nOn Thursday, when Chief Justice Roberts wrote a 6-to-3 decision preserving a key part of the Affordable Care Act (for the second time), Justice Antonin Scalia accused him once again of engaging in liberal judicial activism. \u201cThe somersaults of statutory interpretation\u201d the chief justice had performed in both health care cases, Justice Scalia wrote, signaled to America \u201cthe discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites.\u201d\n\nThe Roberts-Scalia debate is part of a longstanding argument about how judges should interpret laws passed by Congress. As Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York argues in his recent book, \u201cJudging Statutes,\u201d the chief justice embraces an approach called \u201cpurposivism,\u201d while Justice Scalia prefers \u201ctextualism.\u201d In Judge Katzmann\u2019s account, purposivism has been the approach favored for most of American history by conservative and liberal judges, senators, and representatives, as well as administrative agencies. Purposivism holds that judges shouldn\u2019t confine themselves to the words of a law but should try to discern Congress\u2019s broader purposes.\n\nIn the 1980s, when he was a lower court judge, Justice Scalia began to champion a competing view of statutory interpretation, textualism, which holds that judges should confine themselves to interpreting the words that Congress chose without trying to discern Congress\u2019s broader purposes. (By contrast, originalism, which Justice Scalia also embraces, holds that judges should consult both text and history to understand constitutional meaning.) Textualism, in this view, promises to constrain judicial activism by preventing judges from roving through legislative history in search of evidence that supports their own policy preferences. But in the view of its critics, like Chief Judge Katzmann, textualism \u201cincreases the probability that a judge will construe a law in a manner that the legislators did not intend.\u201d Chief Judge Katzmann, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, also accuses Justice Scalia of inconsistency for consulting the intent of the framers in the case of constitutional interpretation but not statutory interpretation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChief Justice Roberts echoed these criticisms of textualism in his decision holding that federally created health exchanges were eligible for tax subsidies. \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d the chief justice wrote, in a line that enraged conservatives. \u201cIf at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.\u201d\n\nThe chief justice\u2019s embrace of bipartisan judicial restraint in the second Affordable Care Act case was consistent with his embrace of the same philosophy in the first Affordable Care Act case in 2012, where he quoted one of his heroes, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr: \u201cThe rule is settled that as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150627143205, "twitter": {"description": "He has enraged both the left and the right, but the chief
