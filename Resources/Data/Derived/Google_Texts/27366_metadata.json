Now it\u2019s in the control of Iowa state regulators, after a solvency loan from the federal government failed to stave off financial ruin. (RELATED: Obamacare-Created Insurer Is Taken Over By The State)\n\nThe co-op was hemorrhaging money \u2014 its net cash and investments fell from $121.5 million in October, after receiving a solvency loan from the Obama administration, to just $17 million on Dec. 12. But even while it was coming to the realization that it wouldn\u2019t be able to succeed financially, CoOportunity continued selling policies on the two states\u2019 federally-run Obamacare exchanges during the second open enrollment period, which began Nov. 15.\n\nBy the time CoOportunity revealed it would be taken over by Iowa, the deadline to purchase or change coverage effective Jan. 1 had passed. Customers who want to change their coverage in light of the takeover \u2014 both Iowa insurance commissioner Nick Gerhart and the company itself encourage doing so \u2014 won\u2019t be able to in time for next month\u2019s coverage.\n\nThe deadline for HealthCare.gov-run states like Iowa and Nebraska to change their coverage was Dec. 15; CoOportunity didn\u2019t announce the state takeover until Dec. 24. Customers who change their insurance plan now won\u2019t be able to start their new policies until Feb. 1 \u2014 meaning that a month into the year, they\u2019ll have to start building up their deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums all over again.\n\nThat won\u2019t be a problem for everyone, but for those who end up spending on health care in January \u2014 such as those with chronic illnesses or who suffer from an emergency \u2014 the belated shift could end up forcing them to pay thousands of dollars toward their deductible twice.\n\nThe Des Moines Register lays out the depth of the problem for one CoOportunity customer, David Fairchild, who is fighting a chronic form of leukemia. Fairchild is switching to the one other Obamacare exchange insurer in Iowa, Coventry Health Care, but can\u2019t begin the plan until Feb. 1.\n\nIn January alone, Fairchild told the Register he will spend about $3,000 out of pocket on medicine to treat his leukemia \u2014 but that won\u2019t count toward his deductible on the Coventry plan come Feb. 1. Then Fairchild will have to spend thousands more the next month before his deductible kicks in, likely pushing him over the annual out-of-pocket limits on Obamacare plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really unfortunate,\u201d Fairchild told the Register. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed.\u201d\n\nCoOportunity is the first Obamacare-created nonprofit insurer to reach such a dire financial position, but five other co-ops, out of 23 nationwide, have received funding from the Obama administration in order to remain solvent.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have given out almost $3 billion in funding to the nonprofits since Obamacare was passed.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Company's failure doesn't leave exchange customers many choices", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The first Obamacare-created nonprofit insurer announced just before Christmas that it would be taken over by the state of Iowa due to severe financial problems -- and the shift will likely cost custom", "title": "Iowa Obamacare Insurer\u2019s Collapse Could Leave Customers On The Hook For Thousands", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/29/iowa-obamacare-insurers-collapse-could-leave-customers-on-the-hook-for-thousands/", "image": {"width": 1185, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "height": 552}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Company's failure doesn't leave exchange customers many choices", "title": "Iowa Obamacare Insurer\u2019s Collapse Could Leave Customers On The Hook For Thousands Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/29/iowa-obamacare-insurers-collapse-could-leave-customers-on-the-hook-for-thousands/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-29 19:45:52", "sailthru.title": "Iowa Obamacare Insurer's Collapse Could Leave Customers On The Hook For Thousands", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare-gov,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "healthcare.gov,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The first Obamacare-created nonprofit insurer announced just before Christmas that it would be taken over by the state of Iowa due to severe financial problems -- and the shift will likely cost custom", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3f1\"", "article_summary": "Now it\u2019s in the control of Iowa state regulators, after a solvency loan from the federal government failed to stave off financial ruin.\nCoOportunity Health, a co-op created in 2013 by the Affordable Care Act with almost $150 million in loans, serves between 110,000 and 120,000 customers in Iowa and Nebraska, according to Iowa state insurance commissioner Nick Gerhart.\nFairchild is switching to the one other Obamacare exchange insurer in Iowa, Coventry Health Care, but can\u2019t begin the plan until Feb. 1.\nBy the time CoOportunity revealed it would be taken over by Iowa, the deadline to purchase or change coverage effective Jan. 1 had passed.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have given out almost $3 billion in funding to the nonprofits since Obamacare was passed."}
