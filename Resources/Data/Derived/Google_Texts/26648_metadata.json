Bobby Jindal has felt more obliged than most in this regard. Jindal is seriously considering a run for the presidency. In a recent BuzzFeed interview, he took pains to situate himself at the head of today\u2019s culture warriors, rivaling Mike Huckabee of Arkansas in his appeal to the religious right. \u201cIncreasingly the groups that are more and more picked on in society are evangelical Christians,\u201d he says.\n\nJindal has the Hobby Lobby crowd in the palm of his hands. He also has in his corner Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, who has touted Jindal\u2019s \u201ccovenant marriage.\u201d The governor is primed for Iowa, crisscrossing the Bible Belt and preaching his belief that it\u2019s the secularists who are ruining America with their extreme intolerance toward people of faith.\n\nThe governor has been seeking national attention for some time. He loves the camera. One day, with 2016 clearly in his sights, he comes out with a shockingly hopeful sound bite, such as: \u201cWe have to stop being the stupid party.\u201d More often, though, he\u2019s been doubling down on the message of the Rush Limbaugh, loud-shouting right, seeking a microphone in order to say outlandish things about the loss of liberty under the evil liberal Obama regime. Constantly traveling beyond his home state, he hopes that TV pundits won\u2019t stop throwing his name out as a possible contender. But is there anything more to Bobby Jindal, beyond his peripatetic campaign for name recognition?\n\nMany who have long histories in Louisiana politics will tell you that, coming up in the ranks, he was honest, rational and respectful, which would seem to distinguish him from the Tea Partyers he nowadays courts. A Rhodes scholar, like former Southern Gov. Bill Clinton, he eventually revealed himself to be, like Clinton, a tightly wrapped ball of ambition.\n\nJindal is not a joke. But when he doesn\u2019t know how to be himself, he embraces the stupid party. It is a bit odd, actually, that he is effectively competing with neighboring Gov. Rick Perry, whose bandwagon he joined in 2012, and who is back in the nomination-seeking saddle.\n\nTo his credit, you didn\u2019t find Jindal proclaiming that President Obama wasn\u2019t born here, though his fellow Southern Republicans could hardly get enough of that. Unprovoked, though, the governor voluntarily released his own birth certificate in 2011, and did his duty as a stupid-party conservative by backing an urgent state initiative to require proof of U.S. birth for any individual who would be listed on a Louisiana ballot and run for national office.\n\nPoor, intellectually gifted Bobby Jindal. Look at the folks he has to identify with, just to get ahead. It was during Reconstruction that white Southerners first exhibited their attachment to a latter-day peculiar institution: government-hating. A good many white Southerners persist in believing that only people born down South can truly understand their needs \u2013 there are those who are entitled to govern Southerners and those who are unentitled. The elevation of the unentitled is regarded as the sinister act of the aggressive outsider.\n\nJindal seems to believe that the way to show his good ol\u2019 boy credentials is to oppose the federal government at a more feverish pitch than anyone else. Never mind that he went off to New England and graduated from Brown. Never mind that the precocious former congressman has to know that the chemically polluted, tax-resistant, impoverished and inefficient state of Louisiana cannot thrive without federal funding. Jindal understands that in order to be acceptable to many right-wing voters, he should stage a photo op with the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d patriarch and make outlandish statements. An anti-gay position polls well? He\u2019s there, with all the stock pro-family rhetoric. Government is conspiring to take away your guns? Yep. And what\u2019s at stake? \u201cNothing less than our identity as a nation,\u201d Jindal says, less than half-convincingly.\n\nHe talks a lot about identity. American identity, the identity of the Republican Party. After Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat, Jindal deployed the memorable line, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop being the stupid party. It\u2019s time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults \u2026 We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. I\u2019m here to say we\u2019ve had enough of that.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been trying for several years to overcome his stumble out of the gate. In early 2009, Jindal bombed in reading the Republican response to President Obama\u2019s first major speech to Congress. In his tinniest, \u201cMister Rogers\u2019s Neighborhood\u201d voice, Jindal was caught, curiously, between two Democratic personae: the astute and reasonable Southern politician with broad intellectual credentials \u2013 the Bill Clinton model \u2014 and the breath-of-fresh-air, down-home governor who figures that his state-bound Southern identity should upstage any and all Washington-like trappings \u2013 that would be the Jimmy Carter effect, circa 1976.\n\nBut Georgia\u2019s Gov. Carter didn\u2019t have to put on. He ran for president as a peanut farmer who understood nuclear submarines. Jindal was (and arguably is still) trying to figure out a credible political identity. He isn\u2019t doing very well.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Louisiana vs. Texas choice for conservative voters in 2016. To gain acceptance in advance of the upcoming presidential campaign, Jindal is making his script sound more Tea Party. \u201cI can sense right now a rebellion brewing amongst these United States,\u201d he offered the Faith and Freedom Coalition the week before last.\n\nJindal seemed quite comfortable as he spoke to Ralph Reed\u2019s people. The born-again activist Reed was another \u201cboy wonder,\u201d bursting onto the conservative scene a decade before Jindal. Reed actually looks like one of the Brady Bunch, but he forfeited his squeaky clean image after his financial ties to ex-con lobbyist Jack Abramoff were publicized. At the Faith and Freedom conference, Jindal appealed to evangelicals who have been feeling abused, or at least suppressed, by social liberals: \u201cPeople are ready for a hostile takeover of Washington, D.C., to preserve the American Dream for our children and grandchildren,\u201d he demagogued.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As governor eyes big prize in 2016, he jumps from one shtick to another in effort to woo elusive Republican voters", "author": "Andrew Burstein and Nancy Isenberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As governor eyes big prize in 2016, he jumps from one shtick to another in effort to woo elusive Republican voters", "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s sad search: How he seeks political relevance in today\u2019s GOP", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/08/bobby_jindals_sad_search_how_he_seeks_political_relevance_in_todays_gop/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bobby_jindal2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As governor eyes big prize in 2016, he jumps from one shtick to another in effort to woo elusive Republican voters", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/bobby_jindal2.jpg", "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s sad search: How he seeks political relevance in today\u2019s GOP", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Bobby Jindal\u2019s sad search: How he seeks political relevance in today\u2019s GOP", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Bobby Jindal, GOP, Governor, Louisiana, Republicans, Tea Party, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2d7\"", "article_summary": "But is there anything more to Bobby Jindal, beyond his peripatetic campaign for name recognition?\nBobby Jindal has felt more obliged than most in this regard.\nPoor, intellectually gifted Bobby Jindal.\nA Rhodes scholar, like former Southern Gov.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Bobby Jindal, GOP, Governor, Louisiana, Republicans, Tea Party, The Right, Politics NewsWe all know that politicians on the make often have to do contortions as they adapt to changing circumstances, but Louisiana Gov."}
