Wachler, Esq. and Jessica C. Forster, Esq.\n\nThe Medicare home health face-to-face brief narrative requirement has been a point of contention for the home health industry since its implementation in 2011. After implementation of the requirement, home health agencies across the country experienced a deluge of denials from Medicare contractors on the basis that the face-to-face brief narratives were \u201cinsufficient.\u201d The denials applied inconsistent standards, and as a result, the National Association of Home Care & Hospice, Inc. (NAHC) filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) challenging the Department\u2019s authority to enforce the requirements. On Nov. 3, 2015 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an opinion upholding HHS\u2019s authority to require the brief narrative requirement, but also including important language that clarifies the scope of the requirement.\n\nNAHC challenged the face-to-face brief narrative requirement on the basis that it exceeds the scope of the statutory authority in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) because it obligates physicians to do more than simply attest that a face-to-face encounter took place within the required time frame. Invoking the two-step Chevron analysis, the court upheld the regulation, finding that it was a possible interpretation of the PPACA and that HHS offered a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d that the interpretation is rationally related to the goals of the statute. Yet although the court upheld the regulation, it very specifically stated that it does not allow for \u201c\u2026denials simply because of poor word choice, grammar, or sentence structure;\u201d the regulation only permits denials for inadequate documentation when a physician has not described clinical findings from the encounter and offered an explanation as to how those findings support the need for skilled services and the patient\u2019s homebound status.\n\nThe court also stated that its analysis would be very different if the regulation allowed a Medicare contractor to \u201csecond-guess the medical judgement of a patient\u2019s physician.\u201d Specifically, it would be invalid if the regulation permitted a reviewer to deny a claim on the basis of inadequate documentation because it disagreed with the physician\u2019s clinical findings or reasoning that the clinical findings supported a need for skilled services. The court found that HHS chose to require physicians to document their clinical findings and explain why those findings support the need for skilled services and homebound status \u2013 but only that. When Medicare contractors issue denials that in practice exceed that requirement, the court stated that home health agencies are \u201cfree to contest HHS\u2019s implementation.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion provides home health agencies with pending appeals with an important strategic argument to challenge Medicare contractors\u2019 invalid denials. Medicare contractors applied an expansive interpretation to the brief narrative requirement, essentially requiring the physician\u2019s brief narrative to fully describe the patient\u2019s homebound status and the medical necessity of the skilled services. The court\u2019s opinion correctly reaffirms that the requirement is that physicians must describe in the brief narrative how the physician\u2019s clinical findings support homebound status and skilled services \u2013 not that physicians provide a full description of the medical necessity of the services. However, with Medicare contractors\u2019 invalid technical denials, the entire medical record was not reviewed, and thus home health agencies were prevented from presenting the entire record to support the medical necessity of the services. Thus, the Medicare contractors were inappropriately denying certification periods based upon an expansive interpretation of the regulation and not reviewing the entirety of the record to determine the medical necessity of the services.\n\nThe opinion reaffirmed that as long as the physician\u2019s brief narrative provides his or her clinical findings and describes how those findings support the need for skilled services and the patient\u2019s homebound status, the face-to-face brief narrative meets the documentation requirements.\n\nThe conclusion bolsters the home health industry\u2019s position that Medicare contractors act improperly and overstep the regulatory bounds when they deny certification periods based on \u201cinadequate documentation\u201d for egregious and improper reasons.\n\nThe ruling marks an important step forward for home health agencies challenging improper appeal denials.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nAndrew B.
