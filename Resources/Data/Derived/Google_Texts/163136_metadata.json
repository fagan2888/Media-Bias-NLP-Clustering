The group, which opposes big government and supports repealing Obamacare, has offices in Harrisburg and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe've had staff out here since May of 2014,\u201d said state director Beth Anne Mumford. \u201cWe have a lot of active activists in Westmoreland County.\u201d\n\nThe group is expanding statewide and \u201cgrowing very fast,\u201d said Adam Nicholson, a regional communications manager with the national office.\n\nMumford said the office at 905 E. Pittsburgh St., where a grand opening was held Thursday, will be open indefinitely. \u201cOur plan is to be here for the long term,\u201d she said.\n\nThe organization is well- funded, but its impact in Western Pennsylvania is hard to measure, said Kristin Kanthak, associate professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to say what the effect will be. We haven't seen anyone with this much money before,\u201d she said.\n\nWith Pennsylvania expected to be a battleground state in the 2016 presidential election, grassroots groups that can educate and advocate as well as provide volunteers will be a big benefit to any candidate, local, state or national, Kanthak said.\n\nThe Greensburg office \u201cgives us opportunity to meet thousands more concerned citizens and better advocate ... against big labor, bureaucrats, and other special interests who want to raise their taxes, undermine shale gas economic growth and give away their tax dollars in corporate welfare,\u201d Mumford said.\n\nCounty Republicans, whose ranks have swelled in the past decade, welcomed the organization.\n\n\u201cThey are good partners, slightly different mission,\u201d said Westmoreland GOP Chairman Michael Korns. \u201cWe're always trying to get Republicans elected; they can focus on specific issues. But more boots on the ground is always welcomed.\u201d\n\nWestmoreland was a longtime stronghold for the Democrats until 2000, when George W. Bush was the first GOP presidential candidate in decades to take the county vote.\n\nSince then, the GOP has slowly gained a strong hold on county government, though its party membership still lags.\n\nDemocrats still hold a nearly 28,000 edge in voter registration. Democrats number 119,611, while Republicans have 91,941 registered voters, according to the county Elections Bureau.\n\nThat number has been trending more toward the Republican party.\n\nFive years ago, Democrats had a voter registration edge of more than 42,000 in the county. A decade ago, there were 54,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans.\n\nRepublicans in Westmoreland County scored a stunning courthouse sweep in 2011, when the party won a majority on the three-person board of commissioners for the first time in 60 years, along with all five row offices on the ballot.\n\nVoters this year will elect a board of commissioners, a sheriff, a treasurer, a controller, a recorder of deeds and a register of wills.\n\nDemocrats said the group will join what is expected to be a very spirited election season.\n\n\u201cThey have every right to be here. ... We just don't agree,\u201d said Lorraine Petrosky, vice chairwoman of the Westmoreland County Democratic Committee.\n\nCraig Smith is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
