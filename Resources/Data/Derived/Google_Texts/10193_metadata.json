Those who transport patients and clients; work alone in a facility or a patient\u2019s home; work in areas with poorly lit corridors, rooms, parking lots and other areas; and without a way to contact emergency services are also at a higher risk of violence.\n\nThe guidance released Friday says employers should have written programs for workplace violence prevention incorporated into their overall safety and health programs.\n\nOSHA said employers should conduct a workplace assessment to find existing or potential hazards that may lead to incidents, take the appropriate steps to prevent or control the hazards that were identified and educate and train employees on how to better protect themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that the people who dedicate their lives to caring for our loved ones often work in fear of injury or death,\u201d OSHA\u2019s Assistant Secretary of Labor David Michaels said in a news release. \u201cThis updated booklet will help employers implement effective measures to reduce or eliminate workplace violence hazards.\u201d\n\nUnder the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. The new guidance updates OSHA\u2019s 1996 and 2004 guidelines.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The guidelines aim to better protect healthcare and social service workers from assault.", "description": "The guidelines aim to better protect healthcare and social service workers from assault.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The guidelines aim to better protect healthcare and social service workers from assault.", "title": "OSHA issues new guidance on workplace violence", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237846-osha-issues-new-guidance-on-workplace-violence", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237846-osha-issues-new-guidance-on-workplace-violence", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-03T12:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T12:30:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Safety, Occupational safety and health, Risk, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Workplace violence, Effective safety training, Social Issues, Labor,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/237846-osha-issues-new-guidance-on-workplace-violence", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The guidelines aim to better protect healthcare and social service workers from assault.", "card": "summary", "title": "OSHA issues new guidance on workplace violence"}, "dcterms.title": "OSHA issues new guidance on workplace violence"}, "article_summary": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration released new guidance on Friday to help healthcare and social service workers better protect themselves from workplace violence.\nThe guidance released Friday says employers should have written programs for workplace violence prevention incorporated into their overall safety and health programs.\nADVERTISEMENTBetween 2011 and 2013, OSHA said workplace assaults ranged from 23,540 to 25,630 annually, with 70 to 74 percent occurring in healthcare and social service settings.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 27 out of the 100 fatalities in the healthcare and social service fields in 2013 were due to assaults and violent acts.\n\u201cThis updated booklet will help employers implement effective measures to reduce or eliminate workplace violence hazards.\u201dUnder the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees."}
