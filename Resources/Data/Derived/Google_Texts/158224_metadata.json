Several Republican candidates have recently come out in favor of the policy as a method of expanding women\u2019s access to contraception, leading Democratic groups to accuse them of merely paying lip service to reproductive health to win over female voters. Now, the nation\u2019s leading group of women\u2019s health care professionals is weighing in.\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the advocacy arm of the largest group of OB-GYNs in the country, is warning political candidates against endorsing this particular birth policy without advocating for other important methods of protecting women\u2019s health, like supporting Obamacare. In a statement released this week, the group reiterates its position on over-the-counter (OTC) birth control, but emphasizes that it shouldn\u2019t be used as a \u201cpolitical tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cOTC availability of oral contraceptives will help more women get the contraceptives they need, which have long been proven safe enough to use without a prescription \u2014 especially emergency contraception,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe feel strongly, however, that OTC access to contraceptives should be part of a broader dialogue about improving women\u2019s health care, preventing unintended pregnancies, and increasing use of contraception, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Over-the-counter access should not be used as a political tool by candidates or by elected officials.\u201d\n\nThe statement comes just a week after North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis (R) invoked ACOG\u2019s position on OTC birth control during a political debate. \u201cI think over-the-counter oral contraception should be available without a prescription,\u201d Tillis said, noting that will help \u201creduce the barriers\u201d to contraception. He was the fourth Republican contender to come out in favor of the policy this campaign season.\n\nBut ACOG\u2019s statement points out that prescriptions aren\u2019t the only barrier currently standing between women and their birth control. Cost is another major factor, and many women simply can\u2019t afford birth control pills regardless of whether they\u2019re available OTC. Plus, the most effective forms of contraception, like intrauterine devices, will always require a trip to the doctor\u2019s office. Those are the two issues at play in the current controversy over the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Hobby Lobby decision, which allowed some for-profit companies to eliminate insurance coverage for expensive forms of long-lasting birth control like IUDs.\n\n\u201cACOG strongly supports the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provision that mandates insurance coverage of birth control, as well as other preventive services, without cost-sharing for the patient,\u201d the doctors\u2019 group explains. \u201cRecent political discussions on the importance of OTC access to contraceptives are welcome, but ACOG remains firmly in support of comprehensive strategies to increase adoption of more-effective methods and to provide all women with the contraceptives they need at no cost.\u201d\n\nACOG\u2019s new statement echoes Planned Parenthood\u2019s recent response to the current conversation about OTC birth control. In a memo entitled \u201cThe Truth About Over-The-Counter Access To Birth Control\u201d released last week, the national women\u2019s health organization notes that these GOP candidates \u201cvoted repeatedly to repeal the new health care law\u201d and \u201chave consistently voted to take away the birth control benefit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't want Republicans to use contraception as a \"political tool.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't want Republicans to use contraception as a \"political tool.\"", "title": "OB-GYNs Warn Candidates Against Pretending To Support Birth Control For Political Gain", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/10/3565561/ob-gyns-birth-control-political-tool/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/birth-control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't want Republicans to use contraception as a \"political tool.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/birth-control-321x214.jpg", "title": "OB-GYNs Warn Candidates Against Pretending To Support Birth Control For Political Gain", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/birth-control.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/birth-control.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-10T08:58:55+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health OB-GYNs Warn Candidates Against Pretending To Support Birth Control For Political Gain CREDIT: ShutterstockEveryone\u2019s been talking about over-the-counter birth control lately.\nCost is another major factor, and many women simply can\u2019t afford birth control pills regardless of whether they\u2019re available OTC.\nBut ACOG\u2019s statement points out that prescriptions aren\u2019t the only barrier currently standing between women and their birth control.\nNow, the nation\u2019s leading group of women\u2019s health care professionals is weighing in.\n\u201cACOG strongly supports the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provision that mandates insurance coverage of birth control, as well as other preventive services, without cost-sharing for the patient,\u201d the doctors\u2019 group explains."}
