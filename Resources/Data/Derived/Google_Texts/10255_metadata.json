Tapper began by asking the radio host what he thought of the president\u2019s speech last night. Although Hewitt largely panned the address, he gave President Barack Obama credit for highlighting the tremendous sacrifice of Sgt. First Class Cory Remsburg, who was grievously wounded fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nBut even here he added a caveat, telling Tapper that while \u201cit was wonderful they applauded [Remsburg], where was the president on the rest of the troops [of] whom he is the Commander-in-Chief, defending these men and women who served 20 years against a Congress looking to spend $6 billion on pork?\u201d\n\nThe radio host also claimed that Republicans in Congress should fight Obama\u2019s call for a \u201cyear of action\u201d with their own year of inaction. \u201c\u2018Masterly inactivity\u2019 comes from a great prime minister of the 19th century, Lord Salisbury, who believed in doing \u2018nothing\u2019 well,\u201d Hewitt explained. \u201cAnd the Republicans need to do nothing well right now on immigration, right now on spending. They need to focus all of their activity on Obamacare\u2019s rollout and the actual facts about it, and on the aftermath of Benghazi, which you and I have talked about many times on the air,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to advance an immigration bill. They don\u2019t need to walk into the president\u2019s Roosevelt Room and get hammered again, as happened last year during the shutdown when they thought they made progress and the president emerged and basically clipped \u2019em, hit from the blindside.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Boehner\u2019s been hit by the blindside so many times by the president, he probably won\u2019t ever engage in a serious conversation with him again,\u201d the radio host declared. \u201cSo I think now is the time wait for November 2014 and see what the country thinks about Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMany commentators speculate that Republican leadership intend to meet Obama at least halfway on immigration reform this year, perhaps providing a pathway to legal status \u2014 if not outright citizenship \u2014 to the millions of illegal immigrants residing unlawfully in the U.S. To hear Hewitt tell it, such cooperation would a severe miscalculation on the part of Republican lawmakers, with Obama using any deal to score political points at their expense.\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
