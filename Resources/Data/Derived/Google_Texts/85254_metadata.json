But director Michel Franco thinks a reluctance to look at the end of life is unhealthy.\n\nThe Mexican filmmaker\u2019s Cannes Film Festival entry \u201cChronic\u201d stars Tim Roth as a homecare nurse to the dying. It\u2019s an unflinching film \u2014 no music, sparse dialogue \u2014 that plants the camera in bathrooms and bedrooms where Roth\u2019s character, David, shares his patients\u2019 most intimate moments.\n\n\u201cWhen I watch a film, the minute I sense that I am being manipulated, I step back,\u201d Franco said at a Cannes hotel poolside. \u201cI was avoiding (trying) to manipulate the audience. You just show it. I think that\u2019s the most powerful, the purest, way to approach this material.\u201d\n\nMany reviews of the film have included the word \u201cchallenging.\u201d Variety noted that the film asks \u201caudiences to do the heavy lifting required to arrive at a meaningful emotional response.\u201d\n\nNot everyone will embrace the film, but 35-year-old Franco has the firm loyalty of his crew. Sarah Sutherland, who plays the estranged daughter of Roth\u2019s character, said she knew from her first audition that this would not be a run-of-the-mill job.\n\n\u201cImmediately afterwards, I got an email saying \u2018We\u2019d like you to come back. Please don\u2019t brush your hair, take off your makeup, wear flat shoes,'\u201d said Sutherland, best known as the daughter of Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 politician on the HBO comedy \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew that Michel and I would really click,\u201d she added.\n\nRoth praised Franco for looking where many others would flinch.\n\n\u201cDeath is the last taboo,\u201d Roth said. \u201cNobody wants to talk about it. \u2026 We have no vocabulary. We do not know what to do. We are helpless, floundering around.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At Cannes, Michel Franco\u2019s \u2018Chronic\u2019 looks death in the face", "title": "At Cannes, Michel Franco\u2019s \u2018Chronic\u2019 looks death in the face", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "At Cannes, Michel Franco\u2019s \u2018Chronic\u2019 looks death in the face", "title": "At Cannes, Michel Franco\u2019s \u2018Chronic\u2019 looks death in the face", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/at_cannes_michel_francos_chronic_looks_death_in_the_face/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-chronic-photo-call.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At Cannes, Michel Franco\u2019s \u2018Chronic\u2019 looks death in the face", "title": "At Cannes, Michel Franco\u2019s \u2018Chronic\u2019 looks death in the face", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-chronic-photo-call.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jill Lawless", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd026d\"", "article_summary": "The Mexican filmmaker\u2019s Cannes Film Festival entry \u201cChronic\u201d stars Tim Roth as a homecare nurse to the dying.\nBut director Michel Franco thinks a reluctance to look at the end of life is unhealthy.\nIt\u2019s an unflinching film \u2014 no music, sparse dialogue \u2014 that plants the camera in bathrooms and bedrooms where Roth\u2019s character, David, shares his patients\u2019 most intimate moments.\nSarah Sutherland, who plays the estranged daughter of Roth\u2019s character, said she knew from her first audition that this would not be a run-of-the-mill job.\n\u201cWhen I watch a film, the minute I sense that I am being manipulated, I step back,\u201d Franco said at a Cannes hotel poolside."}
