He has dropped all pretense of what he was promising in 2009 \u2013 a net spending cut, closing Guantanamo Bay, reforming entitlements. His ideas are so tired that the climax of his speech\u2014literally\u2014was to let a grateful nation know that he still believes the same stuff he said in a speech 10 years ago.\n\nThe good news is that everyone will have forgotten this turd sandwich by the end of the week.
