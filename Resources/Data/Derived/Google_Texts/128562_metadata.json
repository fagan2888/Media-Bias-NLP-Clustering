A regulation under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) called \u201cAdoption of Operating Rules\u201d was one. The administration reportedly received 281 comments after the rule was finalized.\n\n\u201cGenerally, issuing any regulation without first proposing a rule is reserved for rare circumstances,\u201d Batkins said in the report. \u201cAfter at least 67 instances, it appears this practice has grown more common.\u201d\n\nAmit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, said AAF is unfairly blaming agencies for not going through the notice and comment rulemaking steps Congress explicitly told them to skip in order to provide disaster relief or respond to another urgent issue.\n\nFor the ACA rule, which AAF used as an example, Narang said the agency states flatly that they are statutorily required to go directly to an interim final rule with no proposed rule stage.\n\n\u201cThe notice and comment rulemaking process for major rules has slowed to a grinding halt with numerous laws from Obama\u2019s first term still without implementing regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the numerous congressional proposals to add even more delay to the rulemaking process, agencies may have to increasingly forego notice and comment rulemaking to meet congressional deadlines or respond to pressing public health and safety threats.\u201d\n\nThe GAO would not comment on AAF\u2019s report and instead directed The Hill to a 2012 GAO report, which found that agencies frequently cite the \"good cause\" exception and other statutory exceptions for publishing final rules without a notice of proposed rulemaking.\n\n\u201cAgencies may use the good cause exception when they find that notice and comment procedures are 'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest,' the report said. \u201cIn practice, agencies may find an NPRM 'impracticable' when the rule must be issued by a statutory deadline, 'unnecessary' when the rule pertains to technical corrections, and 'contrary to the public interest' in an emergency situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The American Action Forum says the rules have imposed nearly $7 billion in costs.", "description": "The American Action Forum says the rules have imposed nearly $7 billion in costs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The American Action Forum says the rules have imposed nearly $7 billion in costs.", "title": "Report: Agencies skipped steps on 67 major regulations", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/278679-report-agencies-skipped-rulemaking-steps-on-67-major-rules", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/epa_pollution_regulations.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-04T12:22:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-04T12:22-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/278679-report-agencies-skipped-rulemaking-steps-on-67-major-rules", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-04T11:51-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Notice of proposed rulemaking, Federal Register, Rulemaking, Public comment, Regulations.gov,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-04T11:51:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-04T12:22:36-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/278679-report-agencies-skipped-rulemaking-steps-on-67-major-rules", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The American Action Forum says the rules have imposed nearly $7 billion in costs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Agencies skipped steps on 67 major regulations"}, "dcterms.title": "Report: Agencies skipped steps on 67 major regulations"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf 67 sounds like a high number, it represents roughly 11 percent of all major rules,\u201d he said in his report.\nThe Obama administration skipped legally required steps when issuing 67 major regulations, the conservative American Action Forum (AAF) says in a new report.\nAAF, however, did find some major rules that weren\u2019t notices that later received public comment.\nADVERTISEMENTSam Batkins, AAF\u2019s director of regulatory policy, said the policy group reviewed all of the major rules catalogued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and found 20 major rules, 12 of which were listed as \u201cnotices,\u201d that had no public comments, and 47 major rules that had public comments but were issued without a proposal.\n\u201cThe notice and comment rulemaking process for major rules has slowed to a grinding halt with numerous laws from Obama\u2019s first term still without implementing regulations,\u201d he said."}
