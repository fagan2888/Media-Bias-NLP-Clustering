We won\u2019t be content until all Coloradans can access and afford high-quality mental health care \u2013 not just in response to a crisis, but before the crisis hits. Or, as we like to say, before stage 4.\u201d\n\nThe Climb Out of Darkness Expedition Team is made up of Anthony Reinert, Aaron McDowell, Seth Pooler, Matthew Cranston and Daniel Frauenhoff.\n\nThe group has attracted wide media attention to their efforts and mental illness advocacy and awareness, said MHAC. The groups sponsors include Mountainsmith, Osprey, Backcountry Banter, Durango Outdoor Exchange, Chinook Medical Gear, Tailwind Nutrition, Postpartum Progress, Smartwood, Mountain Chalet, Goddess Garden Organics and Confluence.\n\nColorado Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar was an honoree, along with Colorado College, at last year\u2019s Tribute Gala. She introduced the Climb Out of Darkness Expedition team at Saturday night\u2019s gala at the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel.\n\nMental Health Awareness\n\n\u201cMental health has many facets, and encompasses a large number of specific illnesses, conditions and diseases. This expedition has chosen this area of concern because in some way we are all touched by mental illness in its many forms. Most will never know what it means to struggle with these unseen illnesses that affects so many others. This is a very personal situation for the team members and is a relatable cause that this expedition can firmly rally around. It is the hope of the team to be able to use the media that comes with an endeavor such as this to be able to bring to light information about these diseases and work to educate and inform. Also through our partnerships, we hope to connect individuals with the organizations that are making a difference in the areas of mental health awareness and treatment.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Climb Out of Darkness Expedition Team\n\nAccording to MHAC, \u201cWith more than one million Coloradans experiencing a mental health or substance use disorder each year, MHAC seeks to promote universal screening and early intervention, expand access to affordable treatment and services, and eradicate stigma and discrimination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andrew Romanoff,Climb Out of Darkness Expedition Team,Colorado College,Fourteen,Marguerite Salazar,Mental Health America Colorado,mountaineering", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Mental Health America Colorado, the state's leading advocates for those with mental health issues, recognized the Out of Darkness Expedition Team Saturday.", "title": "Mental Health American lifts up Out of Darkness team", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/10/04/mental-health-america-colorado-lifts-up-climb-out-of-darkness-team/123195/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Mental Health America Colorado, the state's leading advocates for those with mental health issues, recognized the Out of Darkness Expedition Team Saturday.", "title": "Mental Health America of Colorado lifts up Climb Out of Darkness team", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/10/04/mental-health-america-colorado-lifts-up-climb-out-of-darkness-team/123195/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Mental Health America Colorado, the state's leading advocates for those with mental health issues, recognized the Out of Darkness Expedition Team Saturday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd208d\"", "article_summary": "Mental Health Awareness\u201cMental health has many facets, and encompasses a large number of specific illnesses, conditions and diseases.\nShe introduced the Climb Out of Darkness Expedition team at Saturday night\u2019s gala at the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel.\nWe won\u2019t be content until all Coloradans can access and afford high-quality mental health care \u2013 not just in response to a crisis, but before the crisis hits.\nOr, as we like to say, before stage 4.\u201dThe Climb Out of Darkness Expedition Team is made up of Anthony Reinert, Aaron McDowell, Seth Pooler, Matthew Cranston and Daniel Frauenhoff.\n\u201cAt Mental Health America of Colorado, we say yes \u2013 we can do better,\u201d Andrew Romanoff, the former Colorado House speaker who has been president and CEO of MHAC since April."}
