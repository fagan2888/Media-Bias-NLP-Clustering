So it\u2019s not particularly surprising that a study of recent hit recordings finds nearly a quarter of them mention alcohol\u2014and almost always in a positive light.\n\nWhat is striking is that a substantial percentage of those chart-topping numbers reference specific brands of alcohol\u2014and only four brands account for more than half of all such mentions.\n\nA lot of hit songs, in effect, have alcohol ads embedded within them.\n\n\u201cMany of the artists of these songs\u2014particularly within the urban genre\u2014have agreements with alcohol companies to promote their brand,\u201d a research team led by Dr. Michael Siegel of the Boston University School of Public Health writes in the journal Substance Use and Misuse. \u201cThus, alcohol companies may be indirectly promoting brand-specific alcohol use among underage youth through sponsorship of popular artists.\u201d\n\nUtilizing Billboard magazine\u2019s year-end charts from 2009 to 2011, Siegel and his colleagues selected the most popular songs released each year in four genres (pop, rock, country, and \u201curban,\u201d which combined R&B/hip-hop with rap).\n\nThat gave them a total of 720 songs, 167 of which referenced alcohol. Of those, 46 (or 6.4 percent of the total) mentioned a specific brand of booze.\n\nThose references \u201care concentrated among a small number of brands,\u201d the researchers report. \u201cFour brands alone\u2014Patron tequila, Hennessy cognac, Grey Goose vodka, and Jack Daniel\u2019s whiskey\u2014accounted for more than half of all alcohol brand mentions.\u201d\n\nMore than two-thirds of these references occurred in urban songs; surprisingly, \u201cthere were no alcohol brand mentions in any of the rock songs,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cWithin urban songs, alcohol brand mentions were concentrated among a small number of artists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research reveals many Billboard chart-toppers have alcohol ads embedded within them", "title": "Hit songs may be brainwashing you to drink more", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Research reveals many Billboard chart-toppers have alcohol ads embedded within them", "title": "Hit songs may be brainwashing you to drink more", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/01/hit_songs_may_be_brainwashing_you_to_drink_more_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/music_alcohol_brands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research reveals many Billboard chart-toppers have alcohol ads embedded within them", "title": "Hit songs may be brainwashing you to drink more", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/music_alcohol_brands.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alcohol, cognac, hit songs, Music, Pacific Standard, recording artists, Research, study, tequila", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Alcohol, cognac, hit songs, Music, Pacific Standard, recording artists, Research, study, tequila, Business News, Life News, Entertainment NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\n\u201cWithin urban songs, alcohol brand mentions were concentrated among a small number of artists.\nA lot of hit songs, in effect, have alcohol ads embedded within them.\nThat gave them a total of 720 songs, 167 of which referenced alcohol.\nSo it\u2019s not particularly surprising that a study of recent hit recordings finds nearly a quarter of them mention alcohol\u2014and almost always in a positive light."}
