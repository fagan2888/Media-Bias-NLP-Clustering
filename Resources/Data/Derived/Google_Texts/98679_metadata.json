Customers are complaining about the recent switch from sugar to stevia.\n\nThe Coca Cola subsidiary, Glac\u00e9au, the company that makes Vitaminwater, started producing and placing the new product on shelves last month. The reformulated sports drink now contains 1 gram less of sugar \u2014 the original was 32 grams \u2014 but each bottle is still 120 calories. Consumers on the company's Facebook page are saying the new Vitaminwater tastes like \u201ccough syrup\u201d and \u201cbug spray.\u201d \u201cHEY-HEY, HO-HO, THE NEW FORMULA HAS GOT TO GO!!\u201d said David F. Brown, one commenter.\n\nAnother customer by the name of Erin Samuelsen also wrote: \u201cChanging the recipe was the worst idea ever! It is AWFUL! So nasty tasting, and the XXX actually tastes like it is rotten. I drink 1-2 bottles on my work shifts, and now I can barely choke down half of one. It took me forever to find a good drink for when I work and now it looks like I am going to have to start all over. Seriously. What were you guys thinking!? So gross. And obviously I am not the only one who thinks so!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first backlash that the makers have received. Coca Cola\u2019s ongoing lawsuit that started in 2009 has caused them a tremendous amount of grief. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) filed a suit against the company, claiming that Vitaminwater misled customers by labeling its drink \u201chealthy.\u201d \u201cGlac\u00e9au have engaged in the deceptive labeling and marketing of \u201cvitaminwater,\u201d which defendants promote as a \u2018nutrient-enhanced water beverage.\u2019\u201d\n\nMost drinks, depending on the flavor, have between 29 and 31 grams of sugar. So the company tried to win back its adversaries by using stevia. \u201cIt\u2019s still a high-sugar soft drink,\u201d said Steve Gardner, litigation director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, The Huffington Post reported. \u201cNow it\u2019s just junk plus stevia.\u201d\n\nStevia is a plant-derived sweetener found mostly in South America. It doesn\u2019t add calories and is sometimes used by natives of South America to treat burns, colic, and stomach issues. Stevia also provides 200 times the sweetness than compared to traditional sweeteners, so a little goes a long way.\n\nStevia might be a better alternative, especially if it\u2019s not processed, like the famous Truvia brand. The source of Vitaminwater\u2019s stevia is unknown, but one thing is for sure \u2014 customers hate it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vitaminwater, sports drinks", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vitaminwater customers hate the new flavor change the company has made, saying it tastes like \"cough syrup.\"", "title": "Vitaminwater Replaces Sugar With Artificial Sweetener Stevia", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vitaminwater-replaces-sugar-artificial-sweetener-stevia-customers-say-new-taste-cough-syrup-287732", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/shutterstock175067573.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vitaminwater customers hate the new flavor change the company has made, saying it tastes like \"cough syrup.\"", "title": "Vitaminwater Replaces Sugar With Artificial Sweetener Stevia", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vitaminwater-replaces-sugar-artificial-sweetener-stevia-customers-say-new-taste-cough-syrup-287732", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/shutterstock175067573.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/11/shutterstock175067573.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-11T12:19:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-11T15:03:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vitaminwater customers hate the new flavor change the company has made, saying it tastes like \"cough syrup.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e7a\"", "article_summary": "In an effort to switch to a healthy sweetener, Vitaminwater made a huge, gross mistake, apparently.\nConsumers on the company's Facebook page are saying the new Vitaminwater tastes like \u201ccough syrup\u201d and \u201cbug spray.\u201d \u201cHEY-HEY, HO-HO, THE NEW FORMULA HAS GOT TO GO!\nCustomers are complaining about the recent switch from sugar to stevia.\nThe Coca Cola subsidiary, Glac\u00e9au, the company that makes Vitaminwater, started producing and placing the new product on shelves last month.\nThe reformulated sports drink now contains 1 gram less of sugar \u2014 the original was 32 grams \u2014 but each bottle is still 120 calories."}
