Most respondents said the ECB won't cut its -0.40 percent deposit rate again.\n\nStill, with a debate now raging on how useful negative rates are as a policy tool, most said the ECB's negative rate deposit rate will probably do more good than harm.\n\nIt is still early days for the global negative rate experiment, pursued by policymakers grappling with low inflation and even the threat of deflation.\n\nCentral banks in Japan, Sweden and Switzerland have all cut key interest rates below zero, so far with mixed results, and in the case of Japan, triggering an unwanted 10 percent rally in the yen since the policy was announced by surprise in January.\n\nA slim minority in the Reuters poll highlighted the risks of the ECB's negative rate policy.\n\n\"We detect a growing sense of frustration with the 'lower for longer' approach to monetary policy, and not before time. Equity investors have favored those economies that have begun the normalization process, and punished those that have dallied with negative rates,\" said Fathom Consulting economist Florian Baier.\n\nThe euro zone economy is predicted to expand just 0.4 percent in each quarter until Q2 2017 and average 1.5 percent this year and 1.6 percent next -- an outlook that has shown no signs of improvement this year.\n\nThose predictions also match the International Monetary Fund's latest projections for 2016 and 2017.\n\nInflation is not expected to pick up either, averaging 0.3 percent this year and 1.4 percent next, unchanged from last month's medians.\n\nAnd despite swathes of ECB stimulus, aimed at getting inflation back up to its target of around 2 percent, an increasing number of respondents now predict deflation in 2016.\n\nBut not all economists are downbeat.\n\n\"Euro zone growth has slowed recently as external demand has weakened, however domestic demand has steadily been improving. The impact of fiscal policy is now on the whole neutral, and household spending is recovering as unemployment continues to fall,\" said Azad Zangana, senior economist at Schroders.\n\nIRELAND'S LIGHT FADING?\n\nGrowth predictions for individual economies within the euro zone were also mostly trimmed in this month's poll.\n\nGrowth in Germany's economy is expected to slow this year to 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent last year. Inflation is also expected to remain low at 0.4 percent in 2016.\n\nThe second largest economy, France, will grow 1.2 percent this year, missing the government's 1.5 percent prediction.\n\nEconomists also cast doubt over whether the government would keep to its fiscal targets, forecasting it would fail to cut its public deficit to less than three percent of economic output next year as Paris has promised its EU partners.\n\nItaly, which emerged from a three-year recession at the start of 2015, is forecast to continue to post listless economic growth of 1.0 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2017.\n\nSpain's economy, a leading light for revival in the euro zone over the past year, is expected to grow 2.7 percent this year and 2.2 percent next, a slight downgrade from the previous poll.\n\nIreland, which has had some of the fastest growth rates across the bloc recently, is expected to do much better than earlier estimates with a 5 percent increase in GDP this year but slow to 3.8 percent next.\n\n(For other stories from the Reuters global economic poll:)\n\n(Polling and analysis by Shrutee Sarkar and Krishna Eluri in Bengaluru; Additional polling by Viviana Venturi in Milan and Cirsten Pahlke in Berlin; Additional reporting by Leigh Thomas in Paris, Gavin Jones in Rome and Michael Nienabar in Berlin; Editing by Ross Finley and Jeremy Gaunt)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - It is lackluster demand that is holding back the euro zone economy, not av", "title": "Weak demand holding back euro zone; no more rate cuts ahead: Reuters poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Weak-demand-holding-back-euro-zone-no-more-rate-cuts-ahead-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/france-economy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/15/Weak-demand-holding-back-euro-zone-no-more-rate-cuts-ahead-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/france-economy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - It is lackluster demand that is holding back the euro zone economy, not av", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1052\"", "article_summary": "\"Euro zone growth has slowed recently as external demand has weakened, however domestic demand has steadily been improving.\nA slim minority in the Reuters poll highlighted the risks of the ECB's negative rate policy.\nGrowth predictions for individual economies within the euro zone were also mostly trimmed in this month's poll.\nIt is still early days for the global negative rate experiment, pursued by policymakers grappling with low inflation and even the threat of deflation.\n\"We detect a growing sense of frustration with the 'lower for longer' approach to monetary policy, and not before time."}
