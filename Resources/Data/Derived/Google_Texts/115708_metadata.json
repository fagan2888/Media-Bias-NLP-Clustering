Some were breathing by virtue of machines; others had feeding tubes; a couple were in wrist restraints to prevent them from pulling off the equipment.\n\nFor a man at a highly rated hospital surrounded by the technology of medical miracles, Marik sounded a note of striking skepticism: Patients too often suffer in vain attempts to prolong life, he said, because of the mandate to \u201cdo everything\u201d for patients.\n\nThe urge to deploy every last aggressive medical technique, in other words, was hurting people.\n\n\u201cI think if someone from Mars came and saw some of these people, they would say, what have they done to deserve this punishment?\u201d said Marik, gesturing to the surrounding rooms. \u201cPeople might say we are prolonging life, but we end up prolonging death.\u201d\n\nCritics of U.S. health care have long marshaled evidence against the overuse of aggressive end-of-life care, but the idea that many Americans are dying badly \u2014 subjected to desperate treatments in ways that are not only expensive but painful and medically futile \u2014 has gained currency of late.\n\nMedicare proposed this year that doctors be paid for discussing with patients their options for treatment \u2014 or not \u2014 at the end of life. And on the best-sellers lists is \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d a surgeon\u2019s critique of the way the United States handles decline and death.\n\nIn it, author Atul Gawande warns, among other things, that \u201cspending one\u2019s final days in an ICU because of terminal illness is for most people a kind of failure.\u201d\n\nTOO MANY ICU BEDS?\n\nMarik\u2019s longstanding argument, notable in part for coming from an ICU doctor, is this: The nation has double or triple as many ICU beds per capita as other Western nations, it spends inordinate amounts of money in the last months of life, and worst of all, this kind of care isn\u2019t what patients want.\n\nHis doubts about end-of-life care appear to be widely shared among his ICU colleagues.\n\nA 2013 survey conducted in one academic medical center, for example, found that critical care clinicians believed that 11 percent of their patients received care that was futile; another 9 percent received care that was probably futile, it said.\n\nMarik blames, in part, people\u2019s unwillingness to face up to the inevitable.\n\n\u201cAmericans not only don\u2019t want to die, they are unwilling to accept the reality of death,\u201d said Marik, who is also a professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School and chief of critical medicine at the school. \u201cUnfortunately, old people get diseases and die.\u201d\n\nThe remedy lies, in part, with hospices, which are hired to take care of patients after they opt out of aggressive end-of-life care.\n\nAmid rapid growth, that industry has been marked by infrequent government inspections and, in places, lapses in quality. But when the service has been properly provided, families sometimes describe it as a godsend, and experts say hospices serve a critical role in the U.S. health system.\n\nA number of factors, economic and personal, keep many patients from enrolling in hospice care, however.\n\nFor starters, it pays to keep dying patients undergoing more treatment, according to experts.\n\n\u201cFinancial incentives built into the programs that most often serve people with advanced serious illnesses \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 encourage providers to render more services and more intensive services than are necessary or beneficial,\u201d according to Dying in America, a massive report issued in September by the Institute of Medicine.\n\nBut strains at a more personal level also keep patients in treatment.\n\nDoctors are reluctant to disappoint a patient with the grim truth, and knowingly or not, keep false hopes alive. Families meanwhile sometimes overestimate the power of modern medicine.\n\nTake, for example, the use of CPR, the technique that can restart a heart, but which, particularly in the elderly, can result in broken ribs, and even if successful in reviving a patient, may lead to a much-diminished quality of life.\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen it done on television?\u201d Marik asks, rolling down a corridor with a class of students behind him. \u201cThey all wake up right away. But in real life, only about 5 to 10 percent of people \u2014 if they\u2019re over 70 \u2014 leave the hospital alive.\u201d Indeed, a 1996 New England Journal of Medicine an analysis of popular shows like \u201cER,\u201d showed that two-thirds treated by CPR survived until discharge.\n\n\u201cWhen CPR became widespread in the \u201960s, it wasn\u2019t considered ethical to perform it on people who are unlikely to recover,\u201d Marik said. \u201cNow it\u2019s done all the time, regardless of the consequences.\u201d\n\nCAUSING MORE PAIN\n\nMarik has been making his argument in published papers at least as far back as 2006, and his criticism echoes others in the field. An ICU doctor in Gawande\u2019s book, for example, complains that she is running \u201ca warehouse for the dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of powerless to change the system \u2014 this is what society expects of us and what we are legally required to do,\u201d Marik said. \u201cBut many clinicians are frustrated.\u201d\n\nNurses, who interact with patients more, may be just as adamant about the issue. They see patients grimacing as they clean wounds around tubes into the lungs or stomach; they see confused patients trying to remove breathing equipment; they treat the bed sores of patients immobilized for long periods.\n\n\u201cThere are cases where you honestly feel like you are just causing more harm or pain to the patient and you wonder if their family really understands what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Karen Richendollar, a nurse at the intensive care unit at Sentara Leigh Hospital here.\n\nSurveys of intensive care nurses at 14 ICUs in Virginia, published in 2007 in the journal Critical Care Medicine, found that the leading cause of moral distress arises from the pressure to continue aggressive treatment in cases where the nurses do not think such treatment is warranted.\n\n\u201cThe distress comes when there is no hope that whatever we are going to do will provide any different outcome,\u201d said Becky Devlin, the supervisor in the ICU here. \u201cThe patient is going to die anyway, and we are just prolonging things. That\u2019s where the distress comes in.\u201d\n\nFor example, Devlin and Richendollar said, a woman then in their care was more than 90 years old, with blood pressure and severe kidney problems as well as severe dementia. She was being fed through a tube and had a urinary catheter.\n\nMost imposingly, the woman was breathing via a ventilator, and to prevent her from removing the tube that had been inserted into her mouth and down her throat, restraints tied her hands to the sides of the bed.\n\n\u201cNo one can be comfortable with all of that,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cSome of the family members are against further treatment, but there are others that make the decisions and they want to keep going.\u201d\n\nENDING THE TORMENT\n\nOne key way to avoid unwanted treatment, according to experts, is to solicit a person\u2019s preferences for end-of-life care before a crisis arrives.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately when these situations come up, families will say, \u2018Doc, what should I do?\u2019 But that\u2019s not something that doctors can really answer,\u201d said David Murray, director of the Advance Care Planning Coalition of Eastern Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe need to hear from the patients or their representatives \u2014 earlier than we do now.\u201d\n\nTake, for example, one of Marik\u2019s patients, a 72-year-old woman who\u2019d come into the emergency room last month after her family found her confused.\n\nLiving at home, she\u2019d long been beset by multiple health woes, mainly congestive heart failure and respiratory problems and bipolar disorder.\n\nGiven her fragility, it would have been natural to have elicited her end-of-life wishes.\n\nNo one did, however, and at the hospital last month the hospital staff and the family spent several anguishing days discussing how best to proceed with her care.\n\nHer labored breathing \u2014 her inability to draw in oxygen \u2014 was the central problem for the doctors. As she struggled for air, the carbon dioxide levels in her blood rose to dangerous levels. She grew anxious as a result, and this only worsened her breathing.\n\nShe was moved to the ICU.\n\nThe staff placed an oxygen mask called a biPAP around her head, fitting it snugly around her mouth and nose. The device forces oxygen from a hose into the nose and mouth, but it is often uncomfortable.\n\nAs a result, the patient was at risk of removing it. So in addition to being sedated, her hands were restrained \u2014 tied by cloth belts to the sides of her bed.\n\nShe could be heard calling out, at times, unintelligibly.\n\n\u201cThe nurses and I were really uncomfortable \u2014 this poor little old lady,\u201d Marik said. \u201cShe was an elderly demented lady with chronic end-stage lung disease. . . . We were subjecting her to a lot of pain and indignity with very little potential for gain. We shouldn\u2019t be forced into that kind of situation, but we often are.\u201d\n\nIn the coming days, the patient\u2019s sister and daughter decided to forgo aggressive treatment and opt for measures meant primarily to keep her comfortable. Placed under hospice care, she was sent to a nursing home.\n\nThere, the patient seemed to rally, regaining the ability to interact with family members. The color returned to her face. She even said she was enjoying music they brought in.\n\nA few days later, after the family had the chance to call in distant relatives, she died.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t without the torment before the family decided that the aggressive measures may be introducing more pain than relief. Sometimes frail elderly patients languish weeks or months before family members opt for the comfort measures. Sometimes they die hooked up to multiple machines. In this sense, this patient constituted a success.\n\n\u201cWe all knew she was dying, and that was the tragedy,\u201d Marik said. \u201cWe knew we were just prolonging her death.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/12/agin-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3229\"", "article_summary": "Of 10 patients Paul Marik saw that morning, five had end-stage kidney disease, three had chronic respiratory ailments, some had advanced dementia.\nMedicare proposed this year that doctors be paid for discussing with patients their options for treatment \u2014 or not \u2014 at the end of life.\nBut it wasn\u2019t without the torment before the family decided that the aggressive measures may be introducing more pain than relief.\nAnd on the best-sellers lists is \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d a surgeon\u2019s critique of the way the United States handles decline and death.\nA number of factors, economic and personal, keep many patients from enrolling in hospice care, however."}
