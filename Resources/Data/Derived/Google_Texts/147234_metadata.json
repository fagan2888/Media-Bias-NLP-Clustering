They show the House and Senate claimed to have only 45 employees each.\n\nA box is checked on the forms next to the confirming statement, \u201cI attest that I employ 50 or fewer full time equivalent employees.\u201d\n\nBut Judicial Watch notes Congress employs upward of 20,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe applications also falsely state that the House and Senate are \u2018local/state governments,'\u201d Judicial Watch said when the case developed.\n\nThe case charges: \u201cSince November 2013, the Exchange Authority has allowed the U.S. House of Representatives (\u2018the House\u2019) and the U.S. Senate (\u2018the Senate\u2019) (collectively \u2018Congress\u2019) to use the Small Business Exchange to provide health insurance to members of Congress, certain congressional staffers, and their spouses and dependents.\u201d\n\nIt says that when Congress applied to participate in the Small Business Exchange, representatives \u201cfalsely asserted that the House and the Senate each employ 50 or fewer full-time employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, records provided by the Exchange Authority in response to a Freedom of Information Act request show that both the House and the Senate falsely claimed that they each employ only 45 full-time employees.\u201d\n\nLast winter, the district government \u201cadmitted that the law does not allow for Congress to obtain benefits on the exchange, but also argued that the Office of Personnel Management could override the district\u2019s law,\u201d Judicial Watch said.\n\nThe new filing explains that district municipal funds continue to be spent on the exchange, which \u201cexpressly limits participation to employers with 50 or fewer employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefendants have allowed at least 12,359 congressional employees and their spouses and dependents to obtain health insurance\u201d through the plan, it alleges.\n\nThe exchange, however, was created by the council in Washington \u201cto help small businesses operating in the District of Columbia provide health insurance to their employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing Congress to participate in the Small Business Exchange violates the law that created the exchange. In effect, defendants are spending \u2018municipal funds\u2019 on Congress\u2019s health insurance,\u201d the complaint continues.\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest in a long series of court cases \u2013 some of which appear to be destined to continue for years \u2013 against Obamacare, which was adopted in 2010 with support only from Democrats in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Did Congress really lie on the forms it used to set up its own Obamacare coverage?
