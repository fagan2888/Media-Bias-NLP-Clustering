Documents released by the investigative panel in April show Planned Parenthood's traffic in aborted baby parts results in \"pure profit\" for the abortion giant, contrary to Planned Parenthood's claims.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/planned-parenthood-ceo-abortion-essential-to-americas-success", "image": "http://www.churchmilitant.com//images/social_images/2016-05-18-Pelletier-A.png", "description": "Cecile Richards is criticizing", "title": "Planned Parenthood CEO: Abortion Essential To America's Success"}, "twitter": {"site": "@church_militant", "image": "http://www.churchmilitant.com//images/social_images/2016-05-18-Pelletier-A.png", "description": "Cecile Richards is criticizing", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Planned Parenthood CEO: Abortion Essential To America's Success"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK (ChurchMilitant.com) - The CEO of Planned Parenthood is claiming access to abortion is \"essential\" to America's success.\n\"You can't grow the economy and shrink women's reproductive health options at the same time,\" she claimed.\nFor this reason, she maintains, \"empowering women\" via access to so-called reproductive health care \"empowers families, communities and our entire country.\"\n\"When you work to limit access to contraception and sex education, wipe out access to abortion, and refuse to support paid leave or affordable childcare, you're not just holding back women,\" Richards asserted.\nFor the remainder of her opinion piece, Richards promoted the Clinton presidential platform, as, in her opinion, Clinton is the only \"person up to the job.\""}
