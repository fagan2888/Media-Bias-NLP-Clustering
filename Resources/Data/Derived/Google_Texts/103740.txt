GENESEE COUNTY, MI - The deadline to enroll or re-enroll for the federal health insurance programs -- commonly referred to as Obamacare -- is quickly approaching.

Open enrollment closes on Feb. 15.

A few local organizations want to help with any questions or concerns residents may have before the deadline.

Hamilton Community Health Network is hosting one final Affordable Care Act education and enrollment event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Feb. 14 at Hamilton's main location at 2900 N. Saginaw St. between Leith Street and East Dartmouth Street.

The event will be focused on heart health as well, and there will be free blood pressure screenings and a Fitbit give-a-way.

The public will be able to sit down with someone to go over their options for the plans on the Marketplace and receive education about the Affordable Care Act as well as get all their questions answered.

Another event focusing on college students will be held at University of Michigan-Flint Michigan Rooms A&B. The event will take place 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 10.

Students can learn more about the plans they already have or the best way to approach health care after graduating, as well as learn about the Affordable Care Act, Healthy Michigan and tax penalties, among other topics.

Students are asked to bring their ID, Social Security number and proof of income.

This is the second open enrollment period for Obamacare.

Roughly 8,600 Genesee County residents registered for a federal health insurance plan during the last open enrollment period, but the estimate was that roughly 17,000 would qualify -- double the number that actually signed up, said Jim Milanowski, vice president of development and marketing for Genesee Health Plan in a previous interview.
