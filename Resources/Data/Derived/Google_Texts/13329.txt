It was North Dakota’s first win over an FBS opponent in eight tries.

Santiago ran for a 52-yard touchdown and bullied in from the 1 for a score, and finished with 148 yards rushing on 24 carries. Keaton Studsrud was 13 of 23 for 153 yards passing, and added a 44-yard touchdown run to help North Dakota build a 21-0 lead with 13:25 to play.

Wyoming’s Cameron Coffman completed 19 of 37 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns. He threw a 92-yard touchdown pass to Tanner Gentry, the second-longest in school history.

The Cowboys offense took only four snaps in North Dakota territory through the first three quarters.
