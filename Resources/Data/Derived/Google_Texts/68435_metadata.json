Employer medical plans \u2014 where most working-age folks get coverage \u2014 are changing too.\n\nRising costs, a looming tax on rich benefits packages and the idea that people should buy medical treatment the way they shop for cellphones have increased odds that workplace plans will be very different in 2015.\n\n\"If there's any year employees should pay attention to their annual enrollment material, this is probably the year,\" said Brian Marcotte, CEO of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers.\n\nIn other words, don't blow off the human resources seminars. Ask these questions.\n\n1) Is my doctor still in the network?\n\nSome employers are shifting to plans that look like the HMOs of the 1990s, with limited networks of physicians and hospitals. Provider affiliations change even when companies don't adopt a \"narrow network.\"\n\nInsurers publish directories, but the surest way to see if docs or hospitals take your plan is to call and ask.\n\n2) Is my employer changing where I get labs and medications?\n\nFor expensive treatments \u2014 for diseases such as cancer or multiple sclerosis \u2014 some companies are hiring preferred vendors. Getting infusions or prescriptions outside this network could cost thousands extra, just as with doctors and hospitals.\n\n3) How will my out-of-pocket costs go up?\n\nIt's probably not a question of if. Shifting medical expenses to workers benefits employers because it means they absorb less of a plan's overall cost increases. By lowering the value of the insurance, it also shields companies from the so-called Cadillac tax on high-end coverage that begins in 2018.\n\nHaving consumers pay more is also supposed to nudge them to buy thoughtfully \u2014 to consider whether procedures are necessary and to find good prices.\n\n\"It gets them more engaged in making decisions,\" said Dave Osterndorf, a benefits consultant with Towers Watson.\n\nHow well this will control total costs is very unclear.\n\nYour company is probably raising deductibles \u2014 the amount you pay for care before your insurance kicks in. The average deductible for a single worker rose to $1,217 this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. One large employer in three surveyed by Marcotte's group planned to offer only high-deductible plans (at least $2,600 for families) in 2015.\n\nEmployers are also scrapping copayments \u2014 fixed charges collected during an office or pharmacy visit.\n\nOnce you might have made a $20 copay for a $100 prescription, with the insurance company picking up the other $80. Now you might pay the full $100, with the cost applied against your deductible, Marcotte said.\n\n4) How do I compare medical prices and quality?\n\nCompanies concede that they can't push workers to shop around without giving information on prices and quality.\n\nTools to comparison shop are often primitive. But you should take advantage of whatever resources, usually an online app from the insurance company, are available.\n\n5) Can I use tax-free money for out-of-pocket payments?\n\nWorkers are familiar with flexible spending accounts (which aren't that flexible). You contribute pretax dollars and then have to spend them on medical costs before a certain time.\n\nEmployers increasingly offer health savings accounts, which have more options. Contribution limits for HSAs are higher. Employers often chip in. There is no deadline to spend the money, and you keep it if you quit the company. So you can let it build up if you stay healthy.\n\nDon't necessarily think of HSAs as money down the drain, says Osterndorf. Think of them as a different kind of retirement savings plan.\n\n6) How is my prescription plan set up?\n\nDrugs are one of the fastest-rising medical costs. To try to control them, employers are splitting pharma benefits into more layers than ever before. Cost-sharing is lowest for drugs listed in formulary's bottom tiers \u2014 usually cheap generics \u2014 and highest for specialty drugs and biologics.\n\nIf you're on a long-term prescription, check how it's covered so you know how much to put in the savings account to pay for it. Also, see if a less-expensive drug will deliver the same benefit.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Menlo Park, Calif.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Even if your health insurance is provided by an employer, your plan may be changing quite a bit in 2015.
