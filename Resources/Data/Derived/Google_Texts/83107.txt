Requiem for an American sniper

Until we walk in another man's shoes, we can never truly know what shapes and motivates who he is and what he does. But as Americans, we have a sense of what it means to love our country, our freedom, and our fellow man. I love my fellow man. I love my family, and I love my country. I want to see them valued and protected.

I thank God for men like Chris Kyle, who was killed two years ago next month. These are men who should always be honored and respected. War must be hell. How often must we ask the question, "What the hell are we fighting for?" How we must hold our elected officials accountable to We the People! As long as evil lies in the hearts of men, a strong and ready defense will always be warranted. We fight today that we may see tomorrow. It may be argued that Chris Kyle should have kept a low profile upon his return from active duty, for his own safety as much as anything else (as the enemies of America both foreign and domestic abound in our day). But can we justly argue against Kyle's right to freely and boldly express himself? You may be able to kill the God-fearing patriot, but you will never silence him! Let us also remember that Kyle was a Navy SEAL and a trained killer. If those he was forced to shoot and kill were not the enemy (or a threat to his brothers-in-arms), then why were we there? Kyle did what he was trained to do and did what his country asked of him. Those who throw stones at the man, his memory, and his service, while hiding in their own sinful shadows, are deplorable. May God bless the wounded, weary, and faithful soldier and keep 'em till He summons them Home!
