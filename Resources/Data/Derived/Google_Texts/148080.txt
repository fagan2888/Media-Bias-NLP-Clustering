Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump brought his campaign to Florida over the weekend. Sarasota residents waited in lines that stretched a quarter-mile. Even Sarasota’s largest venue was too small for the crowd. Organizers split the 6000 people into two rallies, one inside and one out.

Wearing suit jacket, no tie and a red baseball cap pulled low, Trump the billionaire drew big applause for saying he’s free of outside political influence.

“There’s nobody that gave me money,” said Trump. “There’s nobody that said I’m going to give you a campaign contribution. But if I get elected I’m going to be the ambassador to Italy. There’s none of that going on folks.”

Trump spoke for nearly two hours. Among his targets was Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is also running for the Republican nomination.

“He hasn’t even warmed up his seat in the Senate,” said Trump”. “He told you people, ok, I’m gonna this, I’m gonna fight. The seat isn’t even warm and he’s running for another office. And he’s not gonna win because I really believe Trump is gonna win. I really do. I really do.”

Trump promised the Sarasota crowd an end to ObamaCare, a wall on the border with Mexico and lower taxes for all. A half-dozen protesters were escorted peacefully out of the rally.

An elephant greeted guests at the Robarts Arena front gate while Trump offered helicopter rides for kids around back.

“Let’s watch these kids take off,” said Trump. “They’re all waving and they’re scared stiff.”
