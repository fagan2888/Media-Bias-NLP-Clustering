But the partisan divisions among state chief executives appear to be just as sharp as those on Capitol Hill these days.\n\nDuring a dinner with governors in town for the annual National Governors Association Winter Meeting on Sunday, the president remarked that the partnership between the administration and the states held added importance given the gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019ve got a Congress that sometimes seems to have a difficult time acting, I want to make sure that I have the opportunity to partner with each of you in any way that I can to help more Americans work and study and strive, and make sure that they see their efforts and their faith in this country rewarded,\u201d Mr. Obama told the group.\n\nBut while the president attempts to follow through on his call to make 2014 a year of action, in part through the increased use of executive power, Republican governors appear to be as critical of that approach as their GOP colleagues in Washington.\n\nIn a National Review op-ed published Monday Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal outlined 10 ways the president could use his executive power to improve the economy, a list that includes approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline and delaying all of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandates for a year.\n\n\u201cSo if President Obama is determined to use his executive power to the fullest, we ask at least that he use the power of the phone and pen to free the American people from the yoke of excess regulation, to open up new avenues for investment and education, and to give the economy the jump start it needs,\u201d Jindal wrote.\n\nLast week the president criticized Republican governors for \u201cpursuing the same top-down, failed economic policies that don\u2019t help Americans get ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re paying for it by cutting investments in the middle class, oftentimes doing everything they can to squeeze folks who are bargaining on behalf of workers,\u201d he told a group of Democratic governors. \u201cThey\u2019re making it harder for working families to access health insurance. In some states, they\u2019re making it harder even for Americans to exercise their right to vote.\u201d\n\nHe also charged Republican governors with being \u201cout of touch\u201d with their constituents on raising the minimum wage.\n\nOn Friday\u2019s NewsHour, Govs. Pat Quinn, D-Ill., and Bill Haslam, R-Tenn., debated the minimum wage hike and more.\n\n\u201cIf you work 40 hours a week, if you\u2019re a mom or dad raising kids, you shouldn\u2019t have to live in poverty,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI think this is a value issue. And I think some of the Republican governors need to take another look at this issue, because we really should raise the minimum wage. It\u2019s a fundamental issue for everyday people.\u201d\n\nHaslam, meanwhile, noted the Congressional Budget Office study released earlier in the week that estimated lifting the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could result in 500,000 lost jobs.\n\n\u201cYou always have to look at the consequences of an action like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWill this make a dramatic difference in the income inequality issue that we\u2019re talking about? I think it will make some, but I think there\u2019s a lot of other issues that will make more difference.\u201d\n\n63830 63782 63782 Can state leaders avoid partisan gridlock? In comparison to the dysfunction of Congress, how productive are state leaders, and how willing are they to work across party lines?

He attended several events on Saturday and was trailed by a throng of reporters as he shuffled around downtown Washington. But as WNYC\u2019s Matt Katz points out in his \u201cChristie Tracker,\u201d the subdued Christie may be returning to his old ways with the press.\n\nMeanwhile, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the other governor whose 2016 ambitions have been questioned recently, tried to distance himself from Christie. After the release of fresh emails showing his staff did campaign work on government time, Time\u2019s Zeke Miller writes, \u201cWalker came to Washington this weekend with a clear message to deliver to the national press: He\u2019s not New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\u201d\n\nOutgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told Politico he was open to a future White House bid. And Missouri\u2019s Democratic governor, Jay Nixon, also refused to rule out a run.\n\nLINE ITEMS\n\nFor the first time, fewer Americans think other countries\u2019 leaders respect Mr. Obama, according to a Gallup Poll released Monday.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Phil Rucker looks at Bill Clinton\u2019s role in this year\u2019s Kentucky Senate race.
