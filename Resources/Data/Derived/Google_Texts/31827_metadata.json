The United States will send in planes, advisers, and special ops guys, but it would be best \u2014 and this varies depending on which pseudo-strategist you cite \u2014 if the Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Sunnis, and/or Shias would please step in soon and get America off the hook.\n\nThe idea of seeing other-than-American boots on the ground, like Washington\u2019s recently deep-sixed scheme to create some \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels out of whole cloth, is attractive on paper. Let someone else fight America\u2019s wars for American goals. Put an Arab face on the conflict, or if not that at least a Kurdish one (since, though they may not be Arabs, they\u2019re close enough in an American calculus). Let the U.S. focus on its \u201cbloodless\u201d use of air power and covert ops. Somebody else, Washington\u2019s top brains repeatedly suggest, should put their feet on the embattled, contested ground of Syria and Iraq. Why, the U.S. might even gift them with nice, new boots as a thank-you.\n\nIs this, however, a realistic strategy for winning America\u2019s war(s) in the Middle East?\n\nThe Great Champions of the Grand Strategy\n\nRecently, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton openly called for the U.S. to round up some Arab allies, Kurds, and Iraqi Sunnis to drive the Islamic State\u2019s fighters out of Iraq and Syria. On the same day that Clinton made her proposal, Bernie Sanders called for \u201cdestroying\u201d the Islamic State, but suggested that it \u201cmust be done primarily by Muslim nations.\u201d It\u2019s doubtful he meant Indonesia or Malaysia.\n\nAmong the Republican contenders, Marco Rubio proposed that the U.S. \u201cprovide arms directly to Sunni tribal and Kurdish forces.\u201d Ted Cruz threw his support behind arming the Kurds, while Donald Trump appeared to favor more violence in the region by whoever might be willing to jump in.\n\nThe Pentagon has long been in favor of arming both the Kurds and whatever Sunni tribal groups it could round up in Iraq or Syria. Various pundits across the political spectrum say much the same.\n\nThey may all mean well, but their plans are guaranteed to fail. Here\u2019s why, group by group.\n\nThe Gulf Arabs\n\nMuch of what the candidates demand is based one premise: that \u201cthe Arabs\u201d see the Islamic State as the same sort of threat Washington does.\n\nIt\u2019s a position that, at first glance, would seem to make obvious sense. After all, while American politicians are fretting about whether patient IS assault teams can wind their way through this country\u2019s two-year refugee screening process, countries like Saudi Arabia have them at their doorstep. Why wouldn\u2019t they jump at the chance to lend a helping hand, including some planes and soldiers, to the task of destroying that outfit? \u201cThe Arabs,\u201d by which the U.S. generally means a handful of Persian Gulf states and Jordan, should logically be demanding the chance to be deeply engaged in the fight.\n\nThat was certainly one of the early themes the Obama administration promoted after it kicked off its bombing campaigns in Syria and Iraq back in 2014. In reality, the Arab contribution to that \u201ccoalition\u201d effort to date has been stunningly limited. Actual numbers can be slippery, but we know that American warplanes have carried out something like 90% of the air strikes against IS. Of those strikes that are not all-American, parsing out how many have been from Arab nations is beyond even Google search\u2019s ability. The answer clearly seems to be not many.\n\nKeep in mind as well that the realities of the region seldom seem to play much of a part in Washington\u2019s thinking. For the Gulf Arabs, all predominantly Sunni nations, the Islamic State and its al-Qaeda-linked Sunni ilk are little more than a distraction from what they fear most, the rise of Shia power in places like Iraq and the growing regional strength of Iran.\n\nIn this context, imagining such Arab nations as a significant future anti-IS force is absurd. In fact, Sunni terror groups like IS and al-Qaeda have in part been funded by states like Saudi Arabia or at least rich supporters living in them. Direct funding links are often difficult to prove, particularly if the United States chooses not to publicly prove them. This is especially so because the money that flows into such terror outfits often comes from individual donors, not directly from national treasuries, or may even be routed through legitimate charitable organizations and front companies.\n\nHowever, one person concerned in an off-the-record way with such Saudi funding for terror groups was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton back in 2009. In a classified warning message (now posted on WikiLeaks), she suggested in blunt terms that donors in Saudi Arabia were the \u201cmost significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.\u201d\n\nOne who thinks the Saudis and other Gulf countries may be funding rather than fighting IS and is ready to say so is Russian President Vladimir Putin. At the recent G20 meeting, he announced that he had shared intelligence information revealing that 40 countries, including some belonging to the G20 itself, finance the majority of the Islamic State\u2019s activities. Though Putin\u2019s list of supposed funders was not made public, on the G20 side Saudi Arabia and Turkey are more likely candidates than South Korea and Japan.\n\nMost recently, the German vice chancellor has explicitly accused the Saudis of funding Sunni radical groups.\n\nExpecting the Gulf Arab states to fight IS also ignores the complex political relationship between those nations and Islamic fundamentalism generally. The situation is clearest in Saudi Arabia, where the secular royal family holds power only with the shadowy permission of Wahhabist religious leaders. The latter provide the former with legitimacy at the price of promoting Islamic fundamentalism abroad. From the royals\u2019 point of view, abroad is the best place for it to be, as they fear an Islamic revolution at home. In a very real way, Saudi Arabia is supporting an ideology that threatens its own survival.\n\nThe Kurds\n\nAt the top of the list of groups included in the American dream of someone else fighting IS are the Kurds. And indeed, the peshmerga, the Kurdish militia, are actually on the battlefields of northern Iraq and Syria, using American-supplied weapons and supported by American air power and advisers in their efforts to kill Islamic State fighters.\n\nBut looks can be deceiving. While a Venn diagram would show an overlap between some U.S. and Kurdish aims, it\u2019s important not to ignore the rest of the picture. The Kurds are fighting primarily for a homeland, parts of which are, for the time being, full of Islamic State fighters in need of killing. The Kurds may indeed destroy them, but only within the boundaries of what they imagine to be a future Kurdistan, not in the heartlands of the Syrian and Iraqi regions that IS now controls.\n\nNot only will the Kurds not fight America\u2019s battles in parts of the region, no matter how we arm and advise them, but it seems unlikely that, once in control of extended swaths of northern Iraq and parts of Syria, they will simply abandon their designs on territory that is now a part of Turkey. It\u2019s a dangerous American illusion to imagine that Washington can turn Kurdish nationalism on and off as needed.\n\nThe Kurds, now well armed and battle-tested, are just one of the genies Washington released from that Middle Eastern bottle in 2003 when it invaded Iraq. Now, whatever hopes the U.S. might still have for future stability in the region shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously. Using the Kurds to fight IS is a devil\u2019s bargain.\n\nThe Turks\n\nAnd talking about devil\u2019s bargains, don\u2019t forget about Turkey. The Obama administration reached a deal to fly combat missions in its intensifying air war against the Islamic State from two bases in Turkey. In return, Washington essentially looked the other way while Turkish President Recep Erdogan re-launched a war against internal Kurdish rebels at least in part to rally nationalistic supporters and win an election. Similarly, the U.S. has supported Turkey\u2019s recent shoot-down of a Russian aircraft.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives bellow for troops on the ground.
