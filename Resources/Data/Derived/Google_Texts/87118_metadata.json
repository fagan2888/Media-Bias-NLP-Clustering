He feels ready to play, even if his sprained left foot is not 100 percent. Had Sunday been a regular-season game, Marshall might not be available. But after progressing slowly during the week, Marshall is expected to be active for divisional playoff against the Colts.\n\nThe question remains: How effective can he be? Marshall, who missed the final two regular-season games after getting hurt on a tackle against the Chargers, told the Post that he expects to play either base or nickel, but likely not both. The Broncos need to keep him on a play count, and monitor him closely. Marshall sprinted for the first time on Friday. Even he doesn\u2019t know how his foot will respond in coverage, when he must move laterally and make quick, decisive cuts.\n\nMarshall is a tackling machine and excels in coverage. But, again, he must be watched. Linebackers Todd Davis and Steven Johnson figure to see plenty of snaps regardless of Marshall\u2019s health.\n\nThe Broncos should be able to beat the Colts with a limited Marshall. It\u2019s hard to see Denver beating the Patriots in New England \u2014 if Denver wins Sunday \u2014 without Marshall. Getting him back in the lineup is a start. Keeping him healthy in limited duty is equally important.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brandon Marshall,Steven Johnson,Todd Davis", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall will return from a foot injury to face the Colts in a divisional playoff Sunday.", "title": "Brandon Marshall expects to return, but could be limited", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/11/eyes-brandon-marshall-attempts-return-foot-injury/32026/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/01/460116710-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall will return from a foot injury to face the Colts in a divisional playoff Sunday.", "creator": "@troyrenck", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/11/eyes-brandon-marshall-attempts-return-foot-injury/32026/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/01/460116710-495x329.jpg", "title": "All eyes on Brandon Marshall as he attempts return from foot injury", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall will return from a foot injury to face the Colts in a divisional playoff Sunday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04a6\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos should be able to beat the Colts with a limited Marshall.\nIt\u2019s hard to see Denver beating the Patriots in New England \u2014 if Denver wins Sunday \u2014 without Marshall.\nHad Sunday been a regular-season game, Marshall might not be available.\nBut after progressing slowly during the week, Marshall is expected to be active for divisional playoff against the Colts.\nBrandon Marshall spoke with confidence Friday, unable to hide his smile."}
