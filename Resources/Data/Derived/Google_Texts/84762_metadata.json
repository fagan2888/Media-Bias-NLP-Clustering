Bob Nonini, a Republican.\n\nNonini has no opponent in Tuesday\u2019s primary, nor is there a Democratic challenger blocking his way to re-election in November. But some of Nonini\u2019s Kootenai County legislative colleagues are in contested races, and we encourage voters to examine their options closely.\n\nOver the past few months, The Press has published weekly op-ed pieces providing detailed background on issues vital to Idaho. The columns have included charts that show how our legislators have voted on those issues. If you\u2019ve been studying them, you can\u2019t help but have noticed some clear trends. Several incumbents have not worked well with others to get things done. They have objected to investment that will make our state more productive; they have supported legislation that fits their ideological profile.\n\nWe think that\u2019s a mistake, one which is costing Idaho dearly today and will cost even more tomorrow.\n\nThe single most important issue going forward isn\u2019t gay marriage, sharia law or Obamacare. It is preparing our citizens for a world that is changing so rapidly, ideologues are sure to be left behind.\n\nWorking with other people to continue bolstering our education and workforce training will take Idaho to the promised land. More Idahoans filling good Idaho jobs improves their quality of life. It generates additional tax dollars to support cities, counties and the state. There isn\u2019t a downside. What\u2019s required is the understanding of our state\u2019s shortcomings followed by the determination to invest wisely, demand accountability and constantly assess and revise.\n\nLegislators with vision are needed. Legislators with energy are required to keep up and get ahead. Legislators who work hard to represent all of their constituents are prized.\n\nIf you\u2019re among the legion of independent voters, we encourage you to register with the party of your choice on Tuesday. Simply go to your polling place and register as a Republican or Democrat and receive the ballot for that party\u2019s candidates. If you don\u2019t know your affiliation or where to go to vote, call the elections office at 446-1030 or email kcelections@kcgov.us. They\u2019ll help you.\n\nDecide for yourself who is best prepared to make our good state great. There\u2019s too much at stake now to sit this primary election out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kootenai County\u2019s longest serving active legislator spoke wisely in a recent column by political writer Chuck Malloy.", "og": {"site_name": "Coeur d'Alene Press", "description": "Kootenai County\u2019s longest serving active legislator spoke wisely in a recent column by political writer Chuck Malloy.", "title": "For you and Idaho, voting matters", "url": "http://cdapress.com/opinion/editorial/article_8d85b3fe-1a24-11e6-8b56-6ff3a2642384.html", "image": "http://cdapress.com/app/CDAPress_200x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 145597345537708}, "keywords": "editorial", "news_keywords": "editorial"}, "article_summary": "Over the past few months, The Press has published weekly op-ed pieces providing detailed background on issues vital to Idaho.\nWorking with other people to continue bolstering our education and workforce training will take Idaho to the promised land.\nWe think that\u2019s a mistake, one which is costing Idaho dearly today and will cost even more tomorrow.\nNonini has no opponent in Tuesday\u2019s primary, nor is there a Democratic challenger blocking his way to re-election in November.\nBut some of Nonini\u2019s Kootenai County legislative colleagues are in contested races, and we encourage voters to examine their options closely."}
