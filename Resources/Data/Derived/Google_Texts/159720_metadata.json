Do they want to be kept alive by any means possible, are they ready to stop treatment, or do they want to consider some options in between? ... Providers can skip the requirement if talking about death conflicts with a patient\u2019s religion or if the patient has said they aren\u2019t interested. But there is widespread agreement in Massachusetts that more end-of-life planning is a good idea and that this requirement will help.\n\nIf 2014 should be remembered for anything in health policy, it's the year that marked a turning point in how we talk about dying. There was the Institute of Medicine report recommending an overhaul to end-of-life care, the story of the terminally ill 29-year-old Brittany Maynard choosing physician-assisted suicide, Zeke Emanuel declaring he won't try to extend his life past 75, and Atul Gawande's book \"Being Mortal.\"\n\nYou only have to think back to 2009 when the far right said a proposal to have Medicare pay doctors for holding end-of-life conversations amounted to \"death panels.\"\n\nThat payment provision was stripped from health-reform legislation and immediately earned \"third rail\" status. That was until this year, though, when Medicare said last month it will consider adding the reimbursement policy for 2016.\n\nSmart and reasonable people will continue to disagree on end-of-life care issues. But 2014 showed we could at least turn the volume down when doing so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five years after \"death panels,\" the conversation around death has thankfully become more nuanced.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Five years after \"death panels,\" the conversation around death has thankfully become more nuanced.", "title": "2014: The year we finally learned how to talk seriously about dying", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/20/2014-the-year-we-finally-learned-how-to-talk-seriously-about-dying/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/12/hospicephoto-800x533.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jasonmillman"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/20/2014-the-year-we-finally-learned-how-to-talk-seriously-about-dying/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "Smart and reasonable people will continue to disagree on end-of-life care issues.\nIf 2014 should be remembered for anything in health policy, it's the year that marked a turning point in how we talk about dying.\nBut there is widespread agreement in Massachusetts that more end-of-life planning is a good idea and that this requirement will help.\nProviders can skip the requirement if talking about death conflicts with a patient\u2019s religion or if the patient has said they aren\u2019t interested.\nThat was until this year, though, when Medicare said last month it will consider adding the reimbursement policy for 2016."}
