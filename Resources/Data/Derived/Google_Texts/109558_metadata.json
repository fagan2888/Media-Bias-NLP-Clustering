Chris Christie, who killed the $12.4 billion ARC project in the fall of 2010 under the premise that New Jersey taxpayers were shouldering too much of the financial burden.\n\nNow the massive infrastructure project is back on the drawing board but the projected cost has risen to more than $20 billion and the new tunnels won\u2019t be completed for another decade and a half, perhaps longer.\n\n\u201cWe will have lost 13 years or so as a result of the decision making that led to the cancellation of the ARC project,\u201d said Martin E. Robins, a leading architect of New Jersey\u2019s rail transit system over the past 25 years and the chief designer of the ARC tunnel.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe new project dubbed Gateway is needed \u201cbeyond badly,\u201d according to Robins, regardless of the escalating costs, the political and bureaucratic difficulties and all the logistical nightmares that need to be overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe need has long since been identified going back around 20 years. It\u2019s absolutely urgent that the project be built now,\u201d he added.\n\nThere are currently just two rail tunnels connecting Manhattan with New Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and beyond. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for more than 100 years -- the same two tunnels.\n\nIn other words, as the population of the metro New York/New Jersey area has multiplied during the past century, a linchpin of the region\u2019s commuter rail transportation system has remained unchanged.\n\nEvery weekday during the morning and evening rush hours those century-old tunnels are running at maximum capacity, funneling an estimated 90,000 NJT commuters and thousands more Amtrak passengers in and out of Penn Station underneath Midtown Manhattan.\n\nIf something goes awry in one of those tunnels \u2013 as it frequently does \u2013 thousands of commuters are left stranded, sometimes for hours, on either side of the river, frequently on badly over-crowded trains.\n\nIronically, a primary reason for the overcrowded trains is that New Jersey Transit (NJT) has significantly improved its service in and out of the city over the past two decades.\n\nInitiated 20 years ago under Robin\u2019s direction, NJT\u2019s Midtown Direct service has proven a boon to a number of suburban towns along NJT\u2019s web of train lines. Luxury condominium complexes within walking distance of train stations have attracted nearby retail shopping, restaurants and coffee shops, re-energizing once-sleepy downtowns in places like Morristown, Montclair and South Orange.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that the influx of residents, folks fleeing the ever-higher cost of living in Manhattan or Brooklyn but who still work in the city, has created a sharp increase in the number of commuters trekking back and forth each day across the Hudson River.\n\nThat surge in commuters prompted renewed calls for construction of another rail tunnel under the Hudson.\n\nWith momentum seemingly headed in that direction in the late 2000s, Christie\u2019s decision to kill the ARC project infuriated many. Former U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) called it \u201cone of the biggest policy blunders in New Jersey history.\u201d\n\nMany suggested the decision was politically motivated, an effort by the ambitious governor with presidential aspirations to boost his 2013 re-election chances and raise his national profile by allowing him to divert billions of dollars in ARC money to help bail out the state\u2019s troubled finances without having to raise the state\u2019s gasoline tax. The Christie administration has denied any political motivation, but that\u2019s water under the bridge, so to speak.\n\nThe issue now at hand, according to Robins, is moving the Gateway project forward as quickly as possible. \u201cTime is a tremendous issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many problems but they can be surmounted.\u201d\n\nA primary concern is completing at least one of the two proposed Gateway tunnels before one or both of the existing tunnels becomes incapacitated, a situation made all the more likely when both existing tunnels were flooded with salt water in 2012 by Hurricane Sandy, causing extensive damage.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the congestion that would occur each day if there was only one rail tunnel open to NJT commuter and Amtrak trains beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe Gateway project gained a good bit of momentum in the latter half of 2015 when Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo agreed to split 50% of the total costs if the federal government agreed to cover the rest, an important first step. Meanwhile, the Gateway Development Corporation was set up within the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to oversee the project and Congress in December passed a massive transportation spending bill that officials say will provide funding for the new tunnels.\n\nRobins said that in addition to likely construction issues and the \u201cmany questions\u201d that still remain concerning the financing, one of the most challenging hurdles will be negotiating with the owners of underground land that currently abuts the existing Penn Station in Manhattan. In order to build the additional tunnels and create terminals for the increased passenger traffic, Penn Station will have to be expanded, and that won\u2019t happen on the cheap.\n\nFortunately, according to Robins, the debate is no longer whether to build the tunnels but rather how to build them.\n\n\u201cCertainly in our region there is a realization that this project needs to get done. There\u2019s a lot of pent up demand here,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people strongly favor rail travel and understand that rail travel is the future. All that makes it a much easier sell than it was 20 years ago.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/POLITICS/Congress,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Government
