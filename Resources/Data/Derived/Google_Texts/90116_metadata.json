Soon, perhaps, he will decide it\u2019s time to let that secret out.\u201d\n\nObama adds: \u201cWhat happens next depends on him, his family, as well as his friends and his teachers and his community. But it also depends on us \u2014 on the kind of society we engender, the kind of future we build.\u201d\n\nThe White House petition, which has more than 120,000 signatures, calls for enactment of \u201cLeelah\u2019s Law to Ban All LGBTQ+ Conversion Therapy.\u201d\n\nAlcorn wrote a lengthy Tumblr post\u2014now removed\u2014before her suicide revealing that her parents had forced her to attend conversion therapy.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm,\u201d Obama\u2019s senior aide Valerie Jarrett said.\n\nJarrett continued that the administration will dedicate itself to outlawing the process.\n\n\u201cAs part of our dedication to protecting America\u2019s youth, this Administration supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is President Obama\u2019s third major move as president regarding the LGBT community. He sparked the repeal of the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d military policy during his first term. Later on, in an interview with Robin Roberts, the president came out in support of same-sex marriage.\n\n8 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
