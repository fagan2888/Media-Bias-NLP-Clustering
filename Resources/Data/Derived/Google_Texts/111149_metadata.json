That means a lot of independent physicians aren't feeling the pressure from payers to be in any type of risk arrangements.\n\nYet Houston Methodist brought Andrieni in because senior leadership realized that their days of risk-free provision of services are numbered, and without a primary care network, the health system is vulnerable.\n\nHere and now, Andrieni's experience in risk contracting is on the back burner as she works to build an employed primary care network and an alignment model for those who want to stay independent.\n\nThose physicians, in addition to the employed cohort, make up the Physicians Alliance for Quality, an internal physician organization at Methodist. Employed and independent doctors work together to improve handoffs and the care continuum generally, and independents pay a small membership fee to be part of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At self-insured Houston Methodist, a population health pilot designed for staff members saw 50% of high-risk participants move into the low-risk pool within the first six months.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "business, health plan, leadership", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a5d\"", "article_summary": "Population Health Really Does WorkAt self-insured Houston Methodist, a population health pilot designed for staff members saw 50% of high-risk participants move into the low-risk pool within the first six months.\nAs the new vice president of population health and primary care, she was tasked not only with building population health-based teams and treatment protocols, but also with building up a primary care network that didn't really exist when she arrived.\n\"We realized immediately the need for new models of team-based care, the patient-centered medical home, [advanced-practice registered nurses, and] nurse practitioners as we were developing our primary care network.\"\nJulia Andrieni, MD\"In Massachusetts, I was there at a time when everyone had to have primary care overnight under the Mitt Romney plan,\" she says.\nYet Houston Methodist brought Andrieni in because senior leadership realized that their days of risk-free provision of services are numbered, and without a primary care network, the health system is vulnerable."}
