A longtime commissioner at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey resigned on Monday, people familiar with the matter said.

Anthony Sartor submitted his resignation just days after a new investigation into activity at the Port Authority by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, including the agency’s work rebuilding the World Trade Center, came to light.

Mr. Sartor is a New Jersey appointee who has long chaired the agency’s subcommittee on World Trade Center redevelopment.

His attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Sartor’s resignation had been expected by people familiar with Mr. Vance’s probe, which sought a broad swath of records about the authority’s major projects in New York and New Jersey.

Mr. Vance’s investigation comes as the Port Authority already faces an investigation by federal prosecutors in New Jersey.

That probe, emanating from a political payback scheme engineered by Mr. Christie’s subordinates at the George Washington Bridge, has evolved to trigger new levels of scrutiny from lawmakers, the press and prosecutors into how private and public interests are segregated at the bi-state authority.
