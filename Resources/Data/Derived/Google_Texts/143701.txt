The Florida Republican Party is recruiting demonstrators to greet former Gov. Charlie Crist at his Broward and Palm Beach county book signings this week. And it’s prescribing the messages that they’re supposed to put on their homemade signs.

Emails from Diana Ramos, the party’s Southeast Florida field director, are circulating in both counties. Her warning at the end, to “please be careful who you forward to” hasn’t been heeded.

In the emails, Ramos calls on Republican sign wavers to “rally against him. I know I don't need to tell you what a horrible Governor Charlie was and the fact that he is an opportunist.”

In the Broward email she acknowledges Broward “may seem” Democratic blue, and in Palm Beach County she said it “may seem” Democratic blue. But in both places, “he will encounter resistance.”

Ramos also instructs people what to write on their homemade signs:

Charlie Crist: Obama’s Favorite Democrat

Charlie Crist: Obamacare’s Biggest Fan

Charlie = Opportunist

You Can’t Trust Charlie

Failed Governor

3 Parties, 3 Years, Lousy Governor

Charlie 2010 or Charlie 2014, Which One Do You Believe?

Crist was a Republican during his term as governor from 2007 to 2011. He’s now a Democrat seeking his party’s nomination to return to his old job.

The state Republican Party has had surrogates offering a negative view of Crist at his book tour stops last week. A spokeswoman said that would continue during the South Florida swing.
