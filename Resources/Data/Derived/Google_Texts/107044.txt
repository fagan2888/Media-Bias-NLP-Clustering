Are you sitting on a Chick-fil-A cup? You just might be.

In 2012, Chick-fil-A began recycling polystyrene drink cups. The cups are great for keeping beverages cold, but they end up in the landfill if they're not recycled. Chick-fil-A recycles the cups into benches, according to a video posted by the company on YouTube.

The recycling process is complex and requires the cups to be sent to three facilities located across the country. A different recycling procedure is performed at each one until the finished product is a bench.
