And the results held when researchers accounted for parents\u2019 mental health and other factors.\n\n\u201cWe showed a significant and substantial dose\u2013response association between (secondhand smoke) exposure in the home and a higher frequency of global mental problems,\u201d the authors write in Tobacco Control.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two of every five children in the US are exposed to secondhand smoke regularly.\n\nAlicia Padron of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida and colleagues in Spain analyzed data from the 2011 to 2012 Spanish National Health Interview Survey, in which parents of 2,357 children ages four to 12 reported the amount of time their children were exposed to secondhand smoke every day.\n\nThe parents also filled out questionnaires designed to evaluate their children\u2019s mental health. According to the results, about eight percent of the kids had a probable mental disorder.\n\nAbout seven percent of the kids were exposed to secondhand smoke for less than one hour per day, and 4.5 percent were exposed for an hour or more each day.\n\nAfter taking the parent\u2019s mental health, family structure and socioeconomic status into consideration, children who were exposed to secondhand smoke for less than one hour per day were 50 percent more likely to have some mental disorder compared to kids not exposed at all.\n\nAnd children who were habitually exposed to secondhand smoke for an hour or more each day were close to three times more likely to have a mental disorder.\n\nIn addition, kids exposed less than one hour per day were twice as likely to have ADHD as kids who weren\u2019t exposed, and children exposed for an hour or more on a daily basis were over three times more likely to have ADHD.\n\n\u201cThe association between secondhand smoke and global mental problems was mostly due to the impact of secondhand smoke on the attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThe study looks at a single point in time and cannot prove that secondhand smoke exposure causes mental health problems, the study team cautions.\n\nFrank Bandiera, a researcher with the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston who was not involved in the study, liked that the researchers \u201ccontrolled for parents\u2019 mental health in the new study because that could be a confounder.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, the study might be limited because, although the questionnaires are thought to be valid, the mental disorders were not actually diagnosed by physicians.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s causal or not,\u201d Bandiera told Reuters Health. \u201cI think (the research) is still in the early stages and the findings are inconclusive.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, since secondhand hand smoke has been related to a lot of physical diseases, parents should avoid smoking around their kids.\n\n\u201cWe need to sort it out more, so we\u2019re not sure yet, but just as a precaution, I don\u2019t think parents should smoke at home - they should keep their kids away from secondhand smoke,\u201d Bandiera said.\n\nLucy Popova, from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said there is a lot of evidence about the harms of secondhand smoke on physical wellbeing.\n\n\u201cBut research on effects of secondhand smoke on mental health have been really just emerging and this study really contributes to this growing body of evidence that exposure to secondhand smoke in children might be responsible for cognitive and behavioral problems,\u201d she said.\n\nPopova, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said no amount of secondhand smoke is safe \u2013 any exposure is bad.\n\n\u201cSo parents should not expose their children \u2013 the best thing to do is quit,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this will not only not expose their children to the secondhand smoke, but will also let them enjoy their life with their children longer.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bmj.co/1ajZCX4 Tobacco Control, online March 25, 2015.\n\n(By Shereen Lehman)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "childhood, adhd, linked, secondhand, smoking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Children exposed to secondhand smoke at home are three times more likely to have ADHD, according to a new study.", "title": "Childhood ADHD Linked To Secondhand Smoking", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/childhood-adhd-linked-secondhand-smoking-328104", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/adhd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Children exposed to secondhand smoke at home are three times more likely to have ADHD, according to a new study.", "title": "Childhood ADHD Linked To Secondhand Smoking", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/childhood-adhd-linked-secondhand-smoking-328104", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/adhd.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/04/adhd.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-04-04T10:18:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-04T10:20:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Children exposed to secondhand smoke at home are three times more likely to have ADHD, according to a new study."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe association between secondhand smoke and global mental problems was mostly due to the impact of secondhand smoke on the attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder,\u201d the authors write.\nChildren exposed to secondhand smoke at home are three times more likely to have ADHD, according to a new study.\nThe association was stronger for kids with one or more hours of secondhand smoke exposure every day, the authors found.\nAnd the results held when researchers accounted for parents\u2019 mental health and other factors.\nPopova, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said no amount of secondhand smoke is safe \u2013 any exposure is bad."}
