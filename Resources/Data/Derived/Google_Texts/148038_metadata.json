Nationally, as in Connecticut, a majority of the agencies fall \u201cin the middle\u201d with a three or 3.5 star rating, the data released in late January show. Of the 12,201 home care agencies rated nationally, only 2,512 received five stars.\n\nPatricia Adams, administrator for home care and hospice at McLean Home, said, \u201cOur team is really thrilled\u201d with the five-star rating. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot of hard work and heart, year in and out.\u201d The agency also received above average patient satisfaction scores.\n\nThe new five-star rating system, first unveiled last summer, is based on nine of 29 quality measures, including starting care in a timely manner, educating patient and caregiver about medications, and patient outcomes such as improved mobility in walking, getting in and out of bed, bathing, and no hospital readmission.\n\nAs the state\u2019s population ages and the length of time patients spend in hospitals and rehabilitation centers grows shorter, more families and individuals find themselves needing home health care services. The new tools are designed to bring more transparency for consumers tasked with making home care decisions.\n\n\u201cHome health care provides care at the lowest cost setting, compared to hospitals and rehab facilities,\u201d said Deborah Hoyt, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home in Wallingford. \u201cPatients are happiest at home, outcomes are better and quicker, and there are fewer infections. And your own family members are around you. They can be trained how to continue the therapy and perform tasks such as changing bandages.\u201d\n\nBut even such a seemingly objective system can be imperfect, Hoyt pointed out. The rating system assesses the cost appropriateness of services, measuring how well providers use money and resources. The system also measures patient outcomes. \u201cSome may never get better or cured, but they may become stable. The rating system may not always allow for that positive outcome to be read as such,\u201d Hoyt said.\n\nThe new data also includes for the first time a consumer assessment of care.\n\nOn the post-care survey, Hoyt said, \u201cThis part is based on human perception, and some people are harder scorers than others.\u201d\n\n\u201cConnecticut is a very tough state to do business in\u201d because of its stringent regulation of home health care services. There\u2019s also a lot of economic disparity that influences the kind and quality of care patients have access to. Given all that, Hoyt said, Connecticut home care agencies are in line with others nationally.\n\nLee Bridgewater, administrator of the 4.5-star Lighthouse Home Health Care in Old Saybrook, said the ratings are of particular use to people from out of town or out of state who are researching options for their aging parents. Reviewing the ratings allows them to learn, for instance, \u201chow quickly care is initiated after discharge from the hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one [of the criteria] that helped us get the 4.5 stars.\u201d\n\nBridgewater said of the rating system, \u201cWe take it very seriously and work hard to maintain our rating. That\u2019s a real team effort on the part of the staff, and it reflects on the quality and hard work we do.\u201d\n\n\"If you want to demonstrate that you provide quality care, but you don't improve while other providers do, your star rating will slip.\"\n\nKate Jones\n\nMark Appellhof, director of sales and marketing for Visiting Nurses of the Lower Valley, said receiving a 4.5-star rating gives the agency \u201cbragging rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re matched up against the competition and you get recognition like that, you toot your own horn,\u201d Appellhof said, adding that he will incorporate that distinction in his outreach to referral sources such as hospitals and physicians.\n\nAppellhof said that the agency posts its rating in the lobby \u201cso as the public and nurses come in, they see how we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, as with any measurement tool, there\u2019s going to be some subjectivity to it. But as an overall barometer of how an agency\u2019s doing, it\u2019s fairly accurate,\u201d he said.\n\nAdams said, \u201cThe star rating system not only lets consumers see that we\u2019re at the top of our game, but it also tells our team what they have to do to stay there.\u201d For instance, Adams said, data recently revealed \u201ca few more readmissions over the past quarter,\u201d a cause for concern that the agency is taking steps to remedy. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly trying to look at the numbers and how we can improve,\u201d she added.\n\nKate Jones, chief clinical officer at Amedisys in Baton Rouge, La., whose Stamford facility received a four-star rating, said consumers are starting to use the Internet to access rating information. She noted that a patient who used Medicare.gov to compare home health care agencies found that Amedisys was among the best rated in the area.\n\n\u201cI promise you that the staff in Stamford is working toward five stars,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Medicare intended\u2014the rating system is a quality improvement effort. If you want to demonstrate that you provide quality care, but you don\u2019t improve while other providers do, your star rating will slip.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Jones said, the star rating system makes for \u201ca better informed consumer who is ready and willing to be engaged in their own care. That sets us up for success.\u201d\n\nNew federal data show Connecticut has 86 Medicare-eligible home health providers, the second highest number in New England after Massachusetts. Most providers are concentrated in western part of the state, with only seven in Windham County and 10 in Tolland County. New Haven County has 42, Middlesex County, 20.\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Two-thirds of Connecticut\u2019s 99 licensed home health care agencies provide average or above-average care, while 19 were rated below average, according to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/most-home-health-care-agencies-providing-average-care-new-data-show", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201603/florence_jamieson.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two-thirds of Connecticut\u2019s 99 licensed home health care agencies provide average or above-average care, while 19 were rated below average, according to", "title": "Most Home Health Care Agencies Providing Average Care, New Data Show"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Jennifer LaRue", "wordCount": 1063, "dc": {"title": "Most Home Health Care Agencies Providing Average Care, New Data Show"}, "nid": 55614, "datePublished": "2016-03-14", "story_id": 470384599, "keywords": "The Daily, health care, home, Connecticut, jobs", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Two-thirds of Connecticut\u2019s 99 licensed home health care agencies provide average or above-average care, while 19 were rated below average, according to new Medicare five-star rating data.\n\u201cHome health care provides care at the lowest cost setting, compared to hospitals and rehab facilities,\u201d said Deborah Hoyt, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home in Wallingford.\nShe noted that a patient who used Medicare.gov to compare home health care agencies found that Amedisys was among the best rated in the area.\nThat sets us up for success.\u201dNew federal data show Connecticut has 86 Medicare-eligible home health providers, the second highest number in New England after Massachusetts.\nGiven all that, Hoyt said, Connecticut home care agencies are in line with others nationally."}
