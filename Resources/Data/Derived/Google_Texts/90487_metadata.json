Chris Murphy used a placard with a depiction of the \u201cshruggie\u201d or: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af . The symbol was accompanied by a caption that read, \u201cThe Republican King v. Burwell Plan Summarized.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe Republican response to King v. Burwell is simply to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Murphy said Thursday on the floor of the \u201cmost deliberative body in the world.\u201d\n\nMurphy is referring to King v Burwell, a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case is challenging an IRS regulation imposed under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, that allows subsidies on both state and federally-established health insurance exchanges. The case also claims that the IRS regulation violates the plain language of the law enacted by Congress, which gave states the choice to either set up such exchanges themselves or stay out of the program.\n\nFor his part, Murphy was sure that the Supreme Court would side with Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to read the Affordable Care Act other than to believe that subsidies go to both state and federal exchanges,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, if Murphy was concerned about a lack of a plan, it seems that he should be more concerned with the fact that President Obama himself has said he\u2019s made no plan in case the court rules against his signature take over of the nation\u2019s health care system.\n\nIn fact, early in March, Obama was defiant about not having a \u201cPlan B\u201d in case his law was shot down by the Supreme Court.\n\nIt may seem shocking that the president has no backup plan in case his health care law fails to pass\u2014until one considers the possibility that he may be planning to simply forge ahead and ignore whatever the court decides.\n\nOn Thursday, Wyoming\u2019s Republican Sen. John Barrasso pointed out to Murphy that it was Obama, not the GOP, that is just shrugging off making any plans.\n\n\u201c[Murphy] said that the Republicans don\u2019t have a plan. Where\u2019s the president\u2019s plan? He\u2019s the guy that made the mess,\u201d Barrasso said.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrat Sen.
