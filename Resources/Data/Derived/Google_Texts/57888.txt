NEW DELHI (AP) — President Barack Obama says the political vacuum in Yemen hasn’t affected U.S. counterterrorism operations inside the Middle Eastern country.

He says that news reports to the contrary are inaccurate, and he says the U.S. continues to pursue terrorist targets inside Yemen.

Yemen was thrown into a state of political turmoil last week after Shiite rebels overran the capital and President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi (HAD’-ee) and his ministers resigned.

Hadi had worked with the U.S. in the fight against terrorism. Washington says Yemen is the base of operations for the most dangerous offshoot of al-Qaida.

Obama spoke Sunday in New Delhi during an appearance with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (nah-REN’-drah MOH’-dee).
