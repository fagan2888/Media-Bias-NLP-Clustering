And I think what is going on with health care right now has the potential of Barack Obama losing the trust of the American people.\"\n\nRepublicans so far, though, have muffed their chance to sink the president, Goeas added, thanks to the mission by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to defund the law that resulted in a very unpopular 16-day government shutdown.\n\n\"Cruz for awhile put [Republicans] off on the wrong tangent, which was de-funding as opposed to the tangent of what's wrong with Obamacare and driving it home and reminding people of that and we're back to that point now and I feel very positive about it,\" he said.\n\nBut Lake, who runs Lake Research, said there is still time for Democrats to win the messaging war on Obamacare, despite its current unpopularity, bug-riddled website and rash of notices to some people that their insurance plan is either being canceled or subject to increased premiums to meet the federal law's new minimum coverage standards.\n\n[READ: Republicans Seek New Strategy for Campaigns]\n\n\"For the life of me I do not understand why we as Democrats are not aggressively blaming that on the insurance companies,\" she said. \"They are a fantastic enemy here. We ought to say the insurance companies are absolutely undermining this, they don't want to have policies that meet the minimum requirement and we're not going to stand for it.\"\n\nDemocrats, Lake said, still have an advantage when it comes to credibility over Republicans on health care, according to the polling data.\n\n\"We still have an 8-point advantage on health care and an even bigger advantage among women voters,\" she said, adding that \"80 percent of the health care decision-makers in this country are women.\"\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters across the country between Oct. 27-31 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "elections", "title": "Obama's Plummeting Popularity Threatens His Presidency, Pollsters Say", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Pollster: Democrats should demonize insurance industry to improve 2014 chances.", "title": "Obama's Plummeting Popularity Threatens His Presidency, Pollsters Say", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/11/04/obamas-plummeting-popularity-threatens-his-presidency-pollsters-say", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/9c/50941e93924cdb9d42a7880e89e885/49319widemodern_celinda_131104.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Pollster: Democrats should demonize insurance industry to improve 2014 chances.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's Plummeting Popularity Threatens His Presidency, Pollsters Say"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 4, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Pulse,elections,Rebekah Metzler,Rebekah Metzler,Pulse,elections", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Pollster: Democrats should demonize insurance industry to improve 2014 chances."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2a3\"", "article_summary": "\"We still have an 8-point advantage on health care and an even bigger advantage among women voters,\" she said, adding that \"80 percent of the health care decision-makers in this country are women.\"\nDemocrats, Lake said, still have an advantage when it comes to credibility over Republicans on health care, according to the polling data.\nGoeas said historically speaking, second-term presidents struggle to improve their popularity as it slips later in their presidency, hindering their ability to lead.\nAnd I think what is going on with health care right now has the potential of Barack Obama losing the trust of the American people.\"\nPresident Barack Obama and perception about his signature domestic policy, the Affordable Care Act, are at a critical public opinion juncture, a bipartisan pair of pollsters said Monday."}
