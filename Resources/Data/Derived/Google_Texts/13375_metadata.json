Tim Huelskamp still holds a sizable fundraising advantage.\n\nMarshall raised $151,465 between July and September, $50,000 of which was a loan from himself to his campaign. He didn\u2019t receive any money from political action committees but got $96,455 in donations from 63 individual donors.\n\n\u201cMy family and I continue to be humbled by the continued financial support we have received,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cEvery week we meet the greatest people, people who care about our country and state.\u201d\n\nMarshall, an obstetrician from Great Bend, currently has $192,485 on hand. The Federal Election Commission requires candidates for federal office to reveal the funds they have accumulated every three months.\n\nHuelskamp raised $63,738 last quarter and has raised $291,736 this election cycle. He currently has $700,001 on hand.\n\n\u201cWith the strong support of a record number of grassroots conservatives, I am well-positioned to raise the resources necessary to win in 2016,\u201d Huelskamp said.\n\nLast quarter, $58,238 of Huelskamp\u2019s itemized donations came from 93 individual donors and $5,500 came from political action committees. This election cycle, he has received $228,286 from individuals and $63,450 from PACs.\n\n\u201cI have earned the support of the people in the Big First, because I continue to fight against Washington\u2019s big spending, regulation-loving, open borders, gun confiscating, anti-values agenda,\u201d Huelskamp said.\n\nChapman Rackaway, a political science professor at Fort Hays State University, said the figures show Marshall is still having success raising money, but Huelskamp shouldn\u2019t be concerned.\n\n\u201cHuelskamp is definitely not asleep,\u201d Rackaway said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to be aggressive right now. He can be aggressive later.\u201d\n\nAlan LaPolice, a student retention specialist from Clyde, raised $14,500 last quarter, his first quarter of fundraising. All of the money came from 47 individual donors. LaPolice\u2019s campaign currently has $13,169 on hand.\n\n\u201cI raised far less than the other candidates, one who is a career politician, the other a very wealthy doctor,\u201d LaPolice said. \u201cEvery penny I raised came from friends, family or regular voters who just believed in me, who believed in my message.\u201d\n\nLaPolice has been hesitant to raise funds and has been critical of the role large donors and special interests play in modern American elections.\n\n\u201cLaPolice and Marshall are continuing to split the I-don\u2019t-like-Huelskamp vote,\u201d Rackaway said.\n\nMarshall\u2019s campaign spent $64,485 in operating expenditures last quarter and has spent $147,920 since Marshall launched his campaign this spring. Marshall paid three campaign staffers last quarter, in addition to Oklahoma-based consulting firm CMS strategies.\n\nBy comparison, Huelskamp\u2019s campaign spent $30,557 in operating expenditures last quarter and has spent $121,725 this election cycle. Huelskamp had only one paid staffer last quarter, former state Rep. Joshua Powell.\n\nAll four members of the U.S. House from Kansas are running for re-election, as is Sen. Jerry Moran, and all hold significant fundraising advantages.\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins raised $226,495 last quarter and has $857,002 on hand. Jenkins, a Republican, doesn\u2019t yet have a Republican or Democratic challenger.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kevin Yoder of the easternmost 3rd District has more than $2 million on hand, the most of any congressional candidate in the history of Kansas at this stage in the campaign cycle, according to campaign spokeswoman Cate Stark.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support,\u201d Yoder said in a statement. \u201cThe confidence from my constituents is humbling and I appreciate the opportunity to serve the Third District of Kansas.\"\n\nThough no one has filed a statement of candidacy to challenge Yoder, Democrat Nathaniel McLaughlin has announced he will run for the seat.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Pompeo of south-central Kansas raised $90,961 last quarter and has $1,141,890 on hand. Dan Giroux, a Democrat challenging Pompeo, hasn\u2019t yet filed a quarterly fundraising report.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "For the second consecutive quarter, 1st District congressional challenger Roger Marshall outraised his two Republican opponents, but incumbent U.S. Rep.
