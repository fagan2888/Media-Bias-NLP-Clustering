In a statement provided by his office, McConnell suggested Yellen's policies would be more of the same \u2014 and said that her confirmation should be an opportunity to \"scrutinize the recent actions and the historic mission of the Fed.\"\n\n\"I will not be supporting Janet Yellen\u2019s confirmation to the Fed, in large part over serious concerns I have about her commitment to the most important job of the central bank \u2014 maintaining the purchasing power of the dollar,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"After years of federal stimulus, we need a Fed chairman who is unquestionably committed to a strong dollar.\n\n\"The confirmation of a new Fed chief is a perfect time for the Senate to scrutinize the recent actions and the historic mission of the Fed. That\u2019s why I support Senator Paul\u2019s bill to audit the Fed and challenge the Democrats to allow it to come up for debate.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is a co-sponsor of Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) Federal Reserve Transparency Act. In late October, Paul said he was considering putting a \"hold\" on Yellen's nomination to get a vote on the bill, which supporters argue would bring more transparency to the Fed.\n\nA vote on Yellen's confirmation is expected to come later this week. Because of the recent Senate rules change on filibusters, Democrats can now confirm most judicial and executive-branch nominees by simple majority votes rather than the previous 60 needed to break a filibuster.\n\nYellen's nomination passed the Senate Banking Committee by a 14-8 vote on Nov. 21. Republican Sens. Tom Coburn (Okla.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), and Mark Kirk (Ill.) joined 11 of the 12 Democrats on the panel in voting to advance Yellen's nomination.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Brett LoGiurato", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Janet Yellen's confirmation will be opposed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.", "creator": "brettlogiurato", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-janet-yellen-vote-confirmation-2013-12", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/52b0916669bedd0f509b44c3-506-253/mitch-mcconnell-will-vote-against-janet-yellens-confirmation.jpg", "title": "Mitch McConnell Will Vote Against Janet Yellen's Confirmation", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics,moneygame,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Congress, Janet Yellen, Mitch McConnell, Brett LoGiurato", "description": "Janet Yellen's confirmation will be opposed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.", "author": "Brett LoGiurato", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-17", "sailthru.title": "Mitch McConnell Will Vote Against Janet Yellen's Confirmation", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/52b0916669bedd0f509b44c3-50-50/mitch-mcconnell-will-vote-against-janet-yellens-confirmation.jpg", "news_keywords": "Congress, Janet Yellen, Mitch McConnell, Brett LoGiurato", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/52b0916669bedd0f509b44c3/mitch-mcconnell-will-vote-against-janet-yellens-confirmation.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-12-17", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/brett-logiurato"}, "sailthru.description": "Janet Yellen's confirmation will be opposed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Janet Yellen's confirmation will be opposed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.", "title": "Mitch McConnell Will Vote Against Janet Yellen's Confirmation", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/mitch-mcconnell-janet-yellen-vote-confirmation-2013-12", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/52b0916669bedd0f509b44c3-1190-625/mitch-mcconnell-will-vote-against-janet-yellens-confirmation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Mitch McConnell Will Vote Against Janet Yellen's Confirmation", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/52b0916669bedd0f509b44c3/mitch-mcconnell-will-vote-against-janet-yellens-confirmation.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8826\"", "article_summary": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will vote against confirming Janet Yellen to chair the Federal Reserve, his office told Business Insider on Tuesday.\nA vote on Yellen's confirmation is expected to come later this week.\nYellen's nomination passed the Senate Banking Committee by a 14-8 vote on Nov. 21.\nTom Coburn (Okla.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), and Mark Kirk (Ill.) joined 11 of the 12 Democrats on the panel in voting to advance Yellen's nomination.\nIn late October, Paul said he was considering putting a \"hold\" on Yellen's nomination to get a vote on the bill, which supporters argue would bring more transparency to the Fed."}
