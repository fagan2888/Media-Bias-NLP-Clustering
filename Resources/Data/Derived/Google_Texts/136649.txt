This is like the time that they tried calling ObamaCare an "opportunity". That sort of thing is fine when a bunch of ad agency hipsters kick around positive sounding words for a toxic waste dump. Renaming a toxic waste dump "opportunity" doesn't work as well when you're living next to the toxic waste dump.

So here's Germany's opportunity.

German society and the economy stand to benefit from the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees, chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday, repeating her optimistic mantra “we can do this”.

We can do this. There have been more optimistic suicide pacts with a better future.

“I am convinced that if we tackle the formidable task posed by the influx and integration of so many people in the right way today, then this will represent an opportunity for us tomorrow,” Ms Merkel said in the text of a speech supplied by the government before she spoke.

Let's not forget the opportunity for police manhunts.

German police are hunting seven suspected suicide bombers who planned to blow themselves up in Munich train stations during the New Year's Eve celebrations, it has been reported. French and US intelligence agencies are said to have given Germany the names of the seven suspects, thought to be from Iraq and Syria, and Munich police believe they may be linked to ISIS.

We can do this! ISIS can help!

That speech included Arabic subtitles, because opportunity translates much better for all those Iraqis and Syrians who want welfare and the occasional terror attack.
