This is true whether they are progressive or conservative, and throughout most of American history there have been both. (You\u2019d think that the conflicting claims about what God wants would lead to more doubting, but here we are.) Looking over the long history of people claiming to be speaking for God\u2019s wishes, it quickly becomes evident that Christians are frequently on the wrong side of history. Here are 10 things that American Christians of the conservative stripe got completely wrong when they were so sure they were speaking on God\u2019s behalf.\n\n1) Slavery. Both sides of the American slavery debate claimed to be speaking from profound Christian conviction. The Bible clearly has a positive view of slavery, something pro-slavery Christians routinely pointed out. Abolitionists took a broader, less literal view of the Bible. Unsurprising that this divide led to the South being, to this day, home of the most people who take a literalist, fundamentalist view of Christianity.\n\nOf course, nowadays you can\u2019t find even the most literalist fan of the Bible who is willing to agree with their predecessors in the 19th century who believed the Bible endorsed slavery. Of the many things conservative Christians have gotten wrong over the years, the pro-slavery argument is probably the one that is least likely to be revived by modern fundamentalists.\n\n2) Women\u2019s suffrage. Unsurprisingly, conservative Christianity was hostile to women\u2019s suffrage, just as it\u2019s been hostile to women\u2019s progress every step of the way. Women\u2019s \u201cGod-given\u201d roles were routinely referenced in arguments against giving women the right to vote, such as when Susan Fenimore Cooper\u2014daughter of James Fenimore Cooper\u2013wrote in Harper\u2019s that \u201cChristianity confirms the subordinate position of woman, by allotting to man the headship in plain language and by positive precept.\u201d\n\nWhile the argument is clearly wrong in retrospect and disavowed by most modern conservatives, there are still some Christian conservatives who continue to believe that the issue isn\u2019t resolved and should still be up for debate.\n\n3) Evolution. From the second it became evident that the Biblical story of creation was wrong and life on earth evolved over millions of years of random mutation, many Christians were aghast and resisted the truth getting out as hard as they could. Because of this, there have been multiple times throughout history where Christians embarrassed themselves by being wrong in a dramatic courtroom setting. The Scopes monkey trial is the most famous, but the Dover trial of 2005 over the teaching of intelligent design in schools is up there in terms of sheer humor. The Republican-appointed judge even went so far as to describe the Christian conservative defenders of creationism as liars pushing a theory of \u201cbreathtaking inanity.\u201d\n\n4) Pain relief for childbirth. The Bible explicitly lays out pain in childbirth as Eve\u2019s punishment for sin, so unsurprisingly, that\u2019s what many Christians in the 19th century believed had to be so. Once reliable pain relief in childbirth began to be developed, therefore, there was a lot of resistance to it from Christians who feared it defied God to let women have some relief. The truth is that pain in childbirth is not a punishment from God, but the product of evolution, which is a far from perfect process. Eventually, the argument that women owed it to God to suffer through childbirth faded to the fringes of right-wing Christianity. \u201cNatural\u201d childbirth has seen a resurgence in popularity in the secular world since the 1960s, but that was more of a reaction to some medical overreach than a belief that women are sinful and deserve to suffer.\n\n5) Catholics. Modern American conservative Protestants embrace Catholics and have even started to borrow some Catholic arguments against things like abortion and contraception. But in the early 19th and 20th centuries, there was widespread anti-Catholic sentiment, much of it tied up in hostility to Catholic immigrants. There was even an anti-Catholic political party in the early 19th century. Catholics were viewed as idolaters and drunkards by many Protestants, but by far the most bizarre relic of anti-Catholic paranoia is the fear that evil shenanigans were going on in nunneries. A woman writing under the pseudonym \u201cMaria Monk\u201d penned a best-selling book where she claimed to have escaped a convent where she was forced to be a sex slave and pressed into the act of killing babies and hiding their corpses. Needless to say, none of her accusations should be taken as anything approaching true. Anti-Catholic paranoia also led to another Christian-led folly\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "Evangelicals and their ilk have used God to justify everything from Prohibition and segregation to slavery", "title": "10 things conservative Christians got horribly wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Evangelicals and their ilk have used God to justify everything from Prohibition and segregation to slavery", "title": "10 things conservative Christians got horribly wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/09/10_things_conservative_christians_got_horribly_wrong_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/06/jim_crow_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Evangelicals and their ilk have used God to justify everything from Prohibition and segregation to slavery", "title": "10 things conservative Christians got horribly wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/06/jim_crow_rect.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Christianity, prohibition, Segregation, slavery", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4245\"", "article_summary": "Of the many things conservative Christians have gotten wrong over the years, the pro-slavery argument is probably the one that is least likely to be revived by modern fundamentalists.\nHere are 10 things that American Christians of the conservative stripe got completely wrong when they were so sure they were speaking on God\u2019s behalf.\nBecause of this, there have been multiple times throughout history where Christians embarrassed themselves by being wrong in a dramatic courtroom setting.\nModern American conservative Protestants embrace Catholics and have even started to borrow some Catholic arguments against things like abortion and contraception.\nLooking over the long history of people claiming to be speaking for God\u2019s wishes, it quickly becomes evident that Christians are frequently on the wrong side of history."}
