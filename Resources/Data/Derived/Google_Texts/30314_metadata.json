Enjoy!\n\n10) \u201cA lethargic membership is more cancerous than reforms, charter schools, and excessing. Members\u2019 expectation of any president must be tempered with what they are willing to do for themselves.\u201d \u2013 Nathan Saunders, outgoing president of the Washington Teachers Union. (July 31 letter to members)\n\n9) \u201cWe\u2019re not about picking a mayor. We\u2019re about making a mayor, making the winner. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do\u2026.

We were founded to engage in the political process in order to create an organized system of public instruction and to elevate the profession of teaching in California.\u201d \u2013 Carolyn Doggett, executive director of the California Teachers Association, in a January 27 speech to the union\u2019s State Council.\n\n5) \u201cAnytime there\u2019s an audit of Title I dollars, you\u2019re going to see errors at the school level because schools spend money for what they need, and then sometimes they worry about if it fits the parameter of the grant later.\u201d \u2013 Andres Alonso, CEO of the Baltimore City Schools, after a federal audit revealed that Title I and stimulus dollars were used for dinner cruises, meals, theater performances and a mother/daughter makeover.

(November 27 La Crosse Tribune)\n\n2) \u201cBecause maybe these teachers have an ungodly fear of interviews. Or maybe they\u2019re on vacation in the Netherlands and don\u2019t want to return for an interview. Or maybe they think interviews are a sham. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u2013 Lynn Nordgren, president of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, explaining to school district negotiators why unplaced tenured teachers who refuse to show up for job interviews should not be dismissed. (September 27 MinnPost)\n\n1) \u201cSince a teacher\u2019s working conditions are a child\u2019s learning conditions, attacking teachers is the same as attacking children.\u201d \u2013 Randy Mousley, president of United Teachers of Wichita.
