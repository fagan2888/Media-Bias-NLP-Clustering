There have been numerous times that after 2 1/2 hours of waiting the phone call drops and I\u2019ve had to start the process over.\n\nTax professionals have access to the Priority Hotline, but this number has also resulted in two hours or more of wait time and dropped calls.\n\nThe IRS website offers a lot of information for completing forms and obtaining needed forms; however, when dealing with collection issues, the website falls short.\n\nSo why is this year so different from other years and getting assistance from the IRS?\n\nThe IRS is reporting that the Affordable Care Act has taken most of the IRS\u2019s resources to enact. Additional budget cuts also factor into reduced assistance from the IRS.\n\nThe best days and time to call the IRS with shorter wait times are Wednesdays and Thursdays early morning or late afternoon.\n\nIf wanting to be put on a payment arrangement and the tax debt is lower than $50,000 a taxpayer can go online and request a payment arrangement at www.irs.gov and put payment arrangement into the search engine. In order to qualify for a payment arrangement the taxpayer cannot have defaulted on a previous arrangement and must have all tax returns filed for previous years.\n\nFor those taxpayers submitting the Innocent or Injured Spouse requests, the turnaround time for a resolution is greater than nine months. This area of the IRS has been extremely slow in resolving the requests. Even with the extended wait times it is important for taxpayers to try and contact the IRS to help resolve issues, especially tax debt.\n\nIgnoring or doing nothing will only result in liens or levies being placed on a taxpayer\u2019s property. To get the lien or levy lifted is another long process.\n\nWhen a taxpayer owes a tax debt, calling the number on the notices received will help the taxpayer connect to the proper department and the person assigned to the case. Going directly to a service center is not always the best option. The service centers have been affected by the budget cuts and the wait times in these centers have been very long. In addition, the centers are not familiar with the taxpayer\u2019s case and this can result in addition visits being needed to get the needed information to the center.\n\nFor the best results in getting a tax issue resolved, first visit the IRS\u2019s website to see if the information can be obtained online. If the taxpayer cannot get the needed information and has received a notice from the IRS call the number in the upper right hand corner of the letter.\n\nIf a phone call is dropped, call back or call on an alternate day that may be less busy. If the taxpayer has received a certified letter, going to the service center may be helpful to get the taxpayer\u2019s account noted and placed on a collection hold until all information or arrangements can be made.\n\nA final thought is to document all attempts to contact the IRS with time and dates and make copies of any correspondence mailed or faxed. If visiting a service center, make sure that the visit and results are notated into the taxpayer\u2019s tax account. Most importantly, write down the representative\u2019s name and ID number when calling the IRS or visiting a service center.\n\nTracy Bunner is an enrolled agent and tax preparer with an office in Harrisville.
