Decades of Congressional gerrymandering have carved and crafted ever more partisan districts \u2013 and then pols pretend to wonder why there are ever more partisan elected officials. The Tea Party and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders exist in large part because DC drew uber-partisan districts \u2013 and then ignored the voters they emplaced therein.\n\nThat said, there is in fact a lot of DC bipartisanship \u2013 and the results are nigh uniformly terrible. Because the Republicans are largely not conservative \u2013 and live to preemptively cringe in the face of the slightest Democrat feign. So they race to cave.\n\nSure, Republicans in the hopeless minority make a good show of standing strong \u2013 because they know it ultimately means nothing. To wit: their 2009 fight against Obamacare. Having not the numbers to alter the outcome \u2013 they were steadfast. When We the Electorate gave them a fortieth Senator to filibuster \u2013 they allowed Democrats to execute a highly dubious procedural move to end-run that impediment.\n\nRepublicans then campaigned saying \u201cGive us the House majority \u2013 and the power of the purse \u2013 and we will stop Obamacare (and the over-spending, and\u2026).\u201d So We the Electorate did. And the Republicans then did\u2026nothing.\n\nExcept campaign saying \u201cWell, we really need a Senate majority \u2013 then we will stop Obamacare (and the over-spending, and\u2026).\u201d Prospective Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even promised to use the same maneuver that delivered Obamacare \u2013 to undo Obamacare. We the Electorate delivered them the Senate majority. And the Republicans then did\u2026nothing. And Senator McConnell forgot all about hoisting Obamacare on its own procedural petard.\n\nRepublican invertebrate-ness has ceaselessly fed another cause of DC partisanship \u2013 Democrat obstinance. But can you blame the Donkeys? Why on Earth would they move off of their way-Left positions \u2013 when they know Republicans will soon be arriving right beside them?\n\nTo wit: President Barack Obama\u2019s ridiculously partisan Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC is supposed to be a non-political, expert agency that exists to execute law written by Congress for the highly sophisticated world of all things Tech.\n\nJust like every other executive branch agency, the FCC is actually a creation and a creature of the legislative branch. Which means they must act within the strict bounds of the laws Congress passes \u2013 only executing what has been first legislated. In other words, the FCC can\u2019t do anything unless and until Congress first says \u201cYo, FCC \u2013 do this.\u201d\n\nThe FCC is made up of five voting Commissioners (one of whom also serves as Chairman). Three are of the President\u2019s party \u2013 two of the opposing party. They aren\u2019t elected by us \u2013 they are named by the President (who usually takes suggestions on the opposing Party nominees) and approved by the Senate.\n\nSo it is right now a 3-2 unelected Democrat majority. And this FCC is pressing that slim, undemocratic advantage \u2013 to slam through many unlawful power grabs.\n\nAgain, the FCC is supposed to be a technically expert agency \u2013 far removed from politics so as to render sophisticated decisions based upon facts and figures. This FCC has been fraudulently creating facts and figures \u2013 to allegedly justify their subsequent uber-partisan usurpations.\n\nHow partisan has been this iteration of the FCC? \u201cIn the past, votes at the FCC tended to be unanimous\u2014under both Democratic and Republican chairs\u2026.Under (past) Democrats, about eight percent of votes on major orders split along party lines. Under Republicans, only four percent split on party lines. Under (current Democrat) Chairman (Tom) Wheeler, 26 percent of votes (have split along party lines).\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s three or four times more partisan than past Commissions. \u201cBut wait,\u201d you say \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s still only one in four.\u201d First, the vast majority of FCC votes are pro forma \u2013 on things totally devoid of any political content. So this jump in partisanship represents just about every vote that can at all be construed as political.\n\nSecond, much like with President Obama\u2019s executive orders, it\u2019s not the number \u2013 it\u2019s what they cover. Yes, this President is only slightly more active on his number of fiats. But when one single fiat all but shuts down the entire coal industry \u2013 we see it\u2019s quality, not quantity.\n\nSo too is it with the FCC\u2019s partisan votes. One single such vote \u2013 unilaterally rewrote law and placed the entirety of the World Wide Web under 1934 landline telephone law. Which has set the table for a slate of subsequent partisan votes \u2013 each grabbing ever more control of different facets of the Internet.\n\nAnd when the FCC\u2019s Republican Commissioners attempt bipartisanship \u2013 Chairman Wheeler actively squashes it. In a recently released statement on a recent partisan vote, GOP Commissioner Ajit Pai said:\n\n\u201cYesterday, my office finalized a bipartisan compromise with (Democrat) Commissioner (Mignon) Clyburn and (Republican) Commissioner (Michael) O\u2019Rielly on a way to modernize the Lifeline program while staying faithful to our core principles. It was not an easy agreement to reach.\n\n\u201cI had offered my proposal to all five commissioners last week. Our three offices began working on a compromise yesterday morning. My staff worked with theirs through the night revising the Order in order to implement that bipartisan agreement.\n\n\u201cAt 9:49 a.m., all three offices formally agreed to a document that, to quote the official chain, \u2018memorializes the exact contours\u2019 of the compromise\u2026.At 12:00 p.m., when Commissioner O\u2019Rielly and I came down for the meeting and were ready to vote, that agreement remained in place.\n\n\u201cNow, Commissioner Clyburn has backed out of the agreement.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that since early this morning, perhaps even late last night, Chairman Wheeler and his staff have been actively working to unwind that bipartisan compromise. Those efforts started with leaking nonpublic information to the press. The Chairman\u2019s Office then encouraged lawmakers and stakeholders, from left-wing special interests to former FCC Commissioners, to blast the deal before the votes could be cast\u2014indeed, before they even knew what the deal was.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing to refuse to work toward bipartisan compromise\u2014something that, for some reason, the Chairman wears with a badge of honor that distinguishes him from every other Chairman, Republican and Democrat alike, who has ever held that seat. It is quite another thing to launch a political campaign to force a Democratic FCC Commissioner to renege on a bipartisan compromise on her signature issue.\u201d\n\nThis is just one instance of a near-ceaseless flood of Democrat obstinance in their push for terrible, unilateral power grabs. Are any Republicans doing anything at all about any of it? In fact they are \u2013 and in bipartisan fashion:\n\nWalden and Clarke Request Nonpartisan Government Watchdog to Examine FCC\u2019s Set-Top Box Proposal. (Congressman Greg Walden is a Republican \u2013 his colleague Yvette D. Clarke a Democrat.)\n\nThis would be a fine thing. We need much more than more hearings. And we need even more than even more of these called-for independent counsels.\n\nWe need Congress to use their Constitutional power of the purse \u2013 and start docking the allowances of these out of control agencies.\n\nWe need far fewer Elephants acting like they keep seeing mice. If we got it \u2013 we might get a little less Donkey obstinance. And a little more actual, useful bipartisanship.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2016/04/washington-d-c-bipartisanship-they-say-someone-tell-the-fcc/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/setonm.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Washington, D.C.
