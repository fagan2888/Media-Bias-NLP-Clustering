The financial incentives are intended to encourage these doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions to keep patients healthy rather than primarily treat illnesses, which is what Medicare payments traditionally have rewarded. ACOs that save a substantial amount get to keep a share of the savings as a bonus.\n\nThe Obama administration touts ACOs as one of the most promising reforms in the 2010 federal health care law. The administration set a goal that by the end of 2018, half of Medicare spending currently based on the volume of procedures a doctor or hospital performs will instead be linked to quality and frugality. But so far the ACO program generally has been a one-way street, with most doctors and hospitals happy to accept bonuses while declining to be on the hook for a share of any excessive costs run up by their patients.\n\nLast year, Medicare paid $60 billion to 353 ACOs to take care of nearly 6 million Medicare beneficiaries. Some ACOs made significant strides in reducing use of hospitals and other costly resources. But patients at 45 percent of groups cost Medicare more than the government had projected based on their patients\u2019 historic costs, records show. After paying bonuses to the strong performers, the ACO program resulted in a net loss of nearly $3 million to the Medicare trust fund, government records show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s turning out to be tougher to transform care and realign delivery than people had expected,\u201d said Eric Cragun, an analyst with The Advisory Board Company, a consulting group based in Washington.\n\nMedicare officials said most ACOs are still in their infancy, and that performances will improve with experience and ultimately save significant sums for Medicare while improving care for beneficiaries. \u201cIn the long run we\u2019re shooting to achieve those goals,\u201d Sean Cavanaugh, CMS\u2019s deputy administrator, said in an interview.\n\nNonetheless, the results are short of what Medicare projected in 2011 as it launched the program. Those estimates anticipated that the government would save between $10 million and $320 million during 2014.\n\n\u2018Bearing Risk Is a Big Leap\u2019\n\nThe ACO program\u2019s bottom line has been hurt by the reluctance of most ACOs to accept financial responsibility for their patients. Only 7 percent of ACOs opted last year for a high-risk/high-reward deal in which they had the potential to earn larger bonuses but would have to reimburse the government should their patients instead cost Medicare more than expected.\n\nThe rest of the ACOs opted to avoid the potential of financial punishment even though it meant their potential bonuses would be smaller. The risk aversion proved so widespread that Medicare has given ACOs up to six years to participate without fear of penalties, instead of phasing out that option.\n\n\u201cMany of these ACOs are newly formed groups of doctors and hospitals, and bearing risk is a big leap,\u201d Cavanaugh said.\n\nLast year, 196 ACOs saved Medicare money, while 157 ACOs cost more than expected. Medicare ultimately did not realize any savings because it paid out bonuses to 97 ACOs, but only three of the costly ACOs had to repay Medicare for losses their patients incurred.\n\nIn Oregon, North Bend Medical Center ACO patients cost Medicare $9 million. Spending for those patients was 12 percent more than projected, the largest gap of any ACO. In Los Angeles, the government spent $20 million, or 11 percent, more than expected for ACO patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Care Foundation. That was the largest amount in dollars. Both ACOs had chosen to be exempt from financial penalties.\n\nNorth Bend dropped out of the program earlier this year.\n\nCedars-Sinai said its ACO patients ended up more expensive than other previous patients because the hospital added new physician practices specializing in cancer and heart disease, which are among the most costly conditions to treat. In a statement Thursday, Cedars said it unintentionally failed to include those patients in the comparisons it sent to Medicare and was revising its calculations.\n\nEven some of the ACOs that saved the most money have yet to accept financial risk. Costs for patients at Winchester Community ACO in Massachusetts were 16 percent less than Medicare estimated. The ACO earned a bonus of $5 million. Catharine Robertson, an executive with Winchester Hospital, said their cost-saving initiatives were created when the ACO was formed. One team at the ACO identified patients as high-risk to get sick and sought to intercede before they ended up requiring hospitalization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely thrilled with our success the last few years, but the reality is there\u2019s a lot to learn about population-based management,\u201d she said.\n\nThe largest bonus in dollars, $23 million, went to Memorial Hermann Accountable Care Organization in Houston, which was 11 percent below Medicare\u2019s cost expectations. Christopher Lloyd, the CEO of Memorial Hermann\u2019s ACO, credited its success to a decade\u2019s worth of changes that improved cooperation among physicians and the hospital, as well as the creation of systems to share medical details of patients.\n\n\u201cThe ACO when we formed it in 2012 was just an extension of what we were already doing,\u201d Lloyd said. He said committed ACOs could make the same improvements in three to four years. \u201cWhat took us 10 years to build does not take 10 years to replicate,\u201d he said. Still, Memorial Hermann, like Winchester, is not yet accepting risk.\n\nDifficulties in Implementing the Program\n\nTo wring overall savings for Medicare, the government faces a bind, analysts said. If Medicare makes the potential of repayments mandatory, many existing ACOs may drop out of the program, and new ones will be less likely to join. If the majority of ACOs continue to risk no financial repercussions, they have less incentive to save the government money. And without showing savings, it will be hard for Medicare to expand the program.\n\nClif Gaus, president of the National Association of ACOs, said Medicare should be making it easier for ACOs to earn bonuses as they assemble their operations. \u201cAny start-up company, I don\u2019t care who they are, never makes profits in the early years,\u201d Gaus said. \u201cStarting a health care delivery system is just as hard, if not harder, than starting a Facebook or an Amazon.\u201d\n\nBecause Medicare sets its expectations based on national spending averages, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to save money in some parts of the country,\u201d said David Muhlestein, an executive at the consulting firm Leavitt Partners based in Salt Lake City. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to ACOs that have joined the program, started to make changes and decided that it\u2019s really too much work right now.\u201d\n\nSharp Healthcare, a well-regarded five-hospital system in San Diego, dropped out of the program last year after concluding that it might not be able to avoid penalties. In a financial statement, Sharp said that because Medicare\u2019s assessments are \u201cbased on national financial trend factors that are not adjusted for specific conditions that an ACO is facing in a particular region (e.g., San Diego), the model was financially detrimental to Sharp ACO.\u201d\n\nJeff Goldsmith, a health industry analyst and professor at the University of Virginia who is a longtime ACO critic, said the ACO model is flawed. Consumers do not actively opt to participate in the ACOs and do not share in any savings, so they lack financial incentives to help keep costs down, he said. ACOs also have limited leverage to control the costs incurred by highly paid specialists such as surgeons and cardiologists. Patients in ACOs can still go to any doctor who accepts Medicare\u2019s regular method of paying, in which they receive a set fee based on the nature of the service without regard to its outcome.\n\n\u201cFaux managed care is actually harder to do than real managed care,\u201d Goldsmith said. The ACO program, he said, \u201chas a bad enough reputation in the provider community that is not going to grow sufficiently to replace regular Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration is more optimistic. The administration said patients are benefiting with better care, as most quality measures Medicare is using to track ACO performance improved between 2013 and 2014.\n\nCMS\u2019s actuaries believe that the ACOs are performing better than they appear when compared to the historical benchmarks that the health law established, which CMS has been using. The actuaries employed an alternative method in a report issued last spring, comparing Medicare spending trends in places with ACOs and those without, and concluded that, overall, ACOs were saving money.\n\nStill, ACOs\u2019 appetite for taking risk remains small. The number of ACOs opting for the largest potential bonuses and penalties has shrunk from 32 at the start of the program to 19. Rob Lazerow, an Advisory Board consultant, said, \u201cIn a world where ACOs are still optional, CMS still has to make it attractive for providers to want to participate.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A high-profile Medicare experiment pushing doctors and hospitals to join together to operate more efficiently has yet to save the government money.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A high-profile Medicare experiment pushing doctors and hospitals to join together to operate more efficiently has yet to save the government money.", "title": "Medicare Yet to Save Money Through Heralded Medical Payment Model", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150915_HealthCare.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-15T10:50:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LcYOC7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A high-profile Medicare experiment pushing doctors and hospitals to join together to operate more efficiently has yet to save the government money.", "title": "Medicare Yet to Save Money Through Heralded Medical Payment Model", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150915_HealthCare.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "medicare", "published_time": "2015-09-15T03:01:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T10:50:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health care, ACO, Medicare"}, "article_summary": "Last year, Medicare paid $60 billion to 353 ACOs to take care of nearly 6 million Medicare beneficiaries.\nIn Oregon, North Bend Medical Center ACO patients cost Medicare $9 million.\nIn Los Angeles, the government spent $20 million, or 11 percent, more than expected for ACO patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Care Foundation.\nLast year, 196 ACOs saved Medicare money, while 157 ACOs cost more than expected.\nIf the majority of ACOs continue to risk no financial repercussions, they have less incentive to save the government money."}
