Health Benefit Exchange, which operates the city\u2019s version of the Obamacare health insurance program, an insurer she declined to identify agreed to drop a practice federal regulators have called \u201cadverse tiering\u201d of drug co-insurance payments.\n\nKofman said a team of officials with her agency; the D.C. Department of Health; and the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking initiated \u201cextensive discussions with this one particular insurance company\u201d after learning the company was placing HIV medications in its highest tier of co-payments for patients.\n\nWhen asked why she was reluctant to identify the insurer, Kofman said her objective was to persuade the company to end a practice that AIDS advocacy groups have said is aimed at evading the Obamacare law\u2019s strict ban on denying insurance to people based on a pre-existing condition.\n\nAdvocacy groups, including the Florida and D.C.-based AIDS Institute, have said a growing number of insurers have sought to discourage people with HIV from purchasing their health insurance policies by charging prohibitively high co-payments for AIDS-related drugs.\n\n\u201cIt could have happened with any insurer,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure naming a particular company is helpful because they changed their policy,\u201d she told the Washington Blade.\n\n\u201cThey also reviewed their formulary and eventually changed their formulary,\u201d she added, referring to a process health insurance companies use to determine how much of the cost of a drug the patient should pay under their insurance plan.\n\n\u201cAnd so what they did was they moved the HIV medications to the generic or the preferred tiers. So anything that\u2019s not injectable they moved to the tiers that would result in low co-payments and the lowest co-insurance for patients,\u201d Kofman said.\n\nShe said an investigation by three agencies found that the company in question applied its \u201cadverse tiering\u201d policy only to policies sold to individuals and families but not for group policies sold mostly to employers.\n\nAs of 2014, when the company in question reportedly began its adverse tiering policy for AIDS drugs, there were just three insurers enrolled in the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange that provided health plans for individuals \u2014 CareFirst, Kaiser Permanente and Aetna.\n\nAccording to a June 11, 2015 article in Health Affairs Blog, which is considered an authoritative journal on U.S. health policy issues, a D.C. man with HIV reported being hit with excessively high co-insurance payments under a plan he had with Aetna.\n\n\u201cRoger Thompson (not his real name), a middle-aged, HIV-positive freelance artist who lives in Washington, D.C., experienced adverse tiering when he enrolled in an Aetna plan on the D.C. Health Link, the D.C. health insurance marketplace, in 2014,\u201d the article states.\n\n\u201cTo his surprise, when he enrolled in an Aetna plan, he was told HIV medications would cost over $20,000 annually,\u201d according to the article. \u201cUnable to afford this, he opted not to take HIV medications for four months. Ultimately he traveled to Canada to purchase medications at a significantly lower cost to avoid ending up sick and in the hospital,\u201d the article says.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, Roger decided to change plans in 2015,\u201d it says.\n\nA spokesperson for Aetna couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Health Affairs Blog article, which reports on a study of adverse tiering practices published in the New England Journal of Medicine, says that in addition to being harmful to consumers, the practice puts insurers that don\u2019t engage in it at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIt notes that people with serious medical conditions that require expensive drugs to treat who drop out of health plans from insurers who engage in adverse tiering often flock to the insurers that don\u2019t engage in that practice, forcing them to absorb the higher drug costs.\n\n\u201cAs a result, adverse tiering is increasing in popularity among insurers,\u201d the article says.\n\nKofman is calling on D.C. residents who believe they may be facing adverse tiering policies under their health insurance policies to contact the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange.\n\n\u201cIf there is discrimination we\u2019re in a good position to review the policy and if there is discrimination we can address it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd no consumer should be by themselves and try to figure this out by themselves. We advocate for them and for their interests.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At least three D.C. government agencies \u201ctook aggressive steps\u201d earlier this year to stop a health insurance company from discriminating against . . .", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "At least three D.C. government agencies \u201ctook aggressive steps\u201d earlier this year to stop a health insurance company from discriminating against . . .", "title": "D.C. intervenes in HIV drug bias case", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/08/Mila_Kofman_460x470_courtesy_C-Span.jpg", "height": 470}, "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/08/12/d-c-intervenes-in-hiv-drug-bias-case/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least three D.C. government agencies \u201ctook aggressive steps\u201d earlier this year to stop a health insurance company from discriminating against . . .", "creator": "@WashBlade", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/08/Mila_Kofman_460x470_courtesy_C-Span.jpg", "title": "D.C. intervenes in HIV drug bias case", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Roger Thompson", "published_time": "2015-08-12T16:49:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, Aetna, Affordable Care Act, AIDS, AIDS Institute, CareFirst, D.C.
