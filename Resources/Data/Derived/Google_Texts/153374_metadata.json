After shipping her three children off to school, she had taken a brisk three-mile walk before heading downtown to her job as a marketing director at National Geographic Expeditions.\n\nObserving her, it is hard to reconcile her apparently robust health with the heart-stopping advice a doctor gave her last year: Get your affairs in order, your life expectancy is measured in months.\n\nIn July 2012, Deighton, now 44, developed rashes followed by severe joint and stomach pain. Later that year, she was told she had lupus, an autoimmune disorder that can damage organs.\n\nThe correct diagnosis, made in April 2013, was infinitely grimmer. Deighton vividly remembers sitting with her husband in the Northern Virginia office of a specialist as he lay out her future. \u201cThis really sucks,\u201d Deighton remembers him saying. Treatment would be arduous. If she was lucky, she might live another 16 months.\n\nDeighton singles out that meeting, among scores of encounters with more than a dozen doctors at hospitals in the Washington area, Baltimore and New York, as the worst moment of the past 2 1/2 years. She said she remembers thinking, \u201cIf I can get out of here in the next two minutes, I\u2019m going to be making a lot of phone calls.\u201d Her approach to her health has been driven by a simple set of rules: Do lots of research, ask tons of questions and don\u2019t settle for something that doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a problem-solver, and I just felt I was different,\u201d Deighton said. \u201cThis was just too weird and random.\u201d\n\nTo Mohan Suntharalingam, the Baltimore specialist who has gotten to know Deighton well during the 18 months he has overseen her care, her response to treatment is as uncommon as her strong will, her clear-eyed understanding of her disease and her ability to advocate for herself.\n\n\u201cI think we all recognize that there\u2019s something unusual about Dana\u2019s case\u201d that defies explanation, said Suntharalingam, who is also known as Suntha. \u201cIs there something different about her biology? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDeighton has always been extremely healthy, careful about her diet and an athlete who loved playing sports and ran 25 miles each week. In July 2012, when she developed a silver-dollar-sized rash on her arm, Deighton assumed it was a bug bite and brushed it off. During a trip to Glacier National Park in Montana, she noticed that her joints hurt and thought she might have overdone the hiking.\n\nA month later, she woke up with excruciating pain and swollen joints in her elbows, wrists and fingers. A crimson rash covered the back of her neck, then spread to her face. Her internist, who ordered blood tests, ruled out Lyme disease and told Deighton she suspected lupus. Deighton promptly made appointments with rheumatologists at three area hospitals. \u201cI wanted the best, and I wanted to get this figured out right away,\u201d she said.\n\nTests confirmed the lupus diagnosis, and Deighton began taking medication. She was depressed by her inability to move easily \u2014 or sometimes at all \u2014 a hallmark of lupus, which causes achy, swollen joints. She tried to ignore her worsening fatigue, which she chalked up to her job, her kids and caring for her grandfather, who was in his late 90s.\n\nIn February 2013, Deighton awoke one morning with a terrible stomachache. Initially she assumed it was the aftereffects of the previous night\u2019s restaurant dinner. But a week later, the wringing pain had spread to her back. She made an appointment with the gastroenterologist who had performed her colonoscopies.\n\nA decade earlier, Deighton\u2019s mother, a 61-year-old nurse, had died of colon cancer just six weeks after she was diagnosed. Deighton described her mother as a timid person who never questioned her doctors or sought a second opinion and who had suffered a horrible death from sepsis after botched cancer surgery. \u201cI never wanted to fall into that trap,\u201d Deighton said. She arrived at doctors\u2019 appointments armed with a list of questions, and took careful notes.\n\nThe gastroenterologist suspected the pain might be irritable bowel syndrome, a catchall diagnosis for stomach pain and other digestive problems. Deighton, who had her doubts, tried to tamp down the feeling that something more serious was wrong.\n\nSeveral days later, she said, she was \u201cfeeling like crap and having trouble getting through the day\u201d when she put her hands on her neck and froze. On her right side was a painless, immobile lump the size of a Brussels sprout. \u201cI knew it was bad,\u201d she recalled.\n\nA CT scan indicated probable cancer. Deighton then underwent a fine-needle biopsy, which extracts tissue samples for analysis. The results stumped the pathologist: The cancer was aggressive, but its primary location elusive. A full body scan revealed a large ovarian cyst and abnormal abdominal lymph nodes.\n\nA gynecologic oncologist scheduled Deighton for chemotherapy to treat ovarian cancer, although other doctors weren\u2019t sure what kind of cancer she had. \u201cHe said he was sure it was ovarian cancer\u201d and urged her not to delay starting treatment, Deighton said. She didn\u2019t trust him, took her records and left.\n\nShe consulted a second gynecological oncologist, who ordered additional tests, which ruled out ovarian cancer; the cyst would later disappear. Deighton consulted several cancer specialists who thought she might have two forms of cancer, including lymphoma, which can present as a swollen neck lymph node. Doctors removed the lump on Deighton\u2019s neck; tests indicated a gastrointestinal origin.\n\nIn April, pathologists at Johns Hopkins, where her tissue samples had been sent by her oncologist for a second opinion, settled on a shocking diagnosis: an aggressive esophageal cancer, classified as Stage 4, the most advanced and lethal form of any malignancy. The grape-sized tumor on her esophagus had spread to her neck and there were numerous cancerous lymph nodes in her abdomen. No one was sure what had caused the joint pain or rash, which had largely disappeared.\n\nA few days later, Deighton and her husband were given the dismal prognosis by the Northern Virginia oncologist she was then seeing. She and her husband could not speak as the doctor told Deighton, not unkindly, to enjoy the time she had left with her children, the oldest of whom was 12.\n\nAs devastating as the diagnosis was, Deighton said, \u201ca tiny voice said, \u2018You cannot be right.'\u201d Nothing fit: Esophageal adenocarcinoma, a rare cancer, typically affects men older than 60, many of them overweight smokers or heavy drinkers, or those with a history of acid reflux disease. Even their symptoms were different: They typically had trouble swallowing and lost considerable amounts of weight.\n\n\u201cI knew I was different and I had a chance,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I was having trouble\u201d getting doctors to buy into that vision. The oncologists she consulted recommended immediate chemotherapy; the average life expectancy for people with Deighton\u2019s cancer is about six to 12 months. Another option is palliative care, which aims not to cure disease but to relieve pain and suffering.\n\nIn May, Deighton sought out esophageal cancer experts in Baltimore, including Suntha, a professor of radiation oncology at the University of Maryland Medical Center and associate director of the Greenebaum Cancer Center there, whom a close friend had recommended. He advised that she start chemo and told her he would be available for further consultation should the need arise.\n\nDeighton began treatment at another Baltimore hospital, undergoing eight cycles of chemotherapy \u2014 two more than recommended because she tolerated it so well. Although her hair fell out and she was tired, Deighton had no nausea. Her response was deemed excellent: The metastases shrank significantly and no new tumors appeared. Deighton broached the idea of radiation as a possible way to eliminate her cancer.\n\n\u201cDana, my radiation oncologist isn\u2019t even going to talk to you,\u201d she said her oncologist told her. Her disease was simply too advanced. Her best bet, he advised, was a new chemo regimen.\n\nUnconvinced, Deighton traveled to New York in September 2013 to consult a prominent specialist in esophageal cancer. Echoing the other oncologist, he told her radiation was out of the question.\n\nShe returned to Suntha, with whom she had kept in touch. Unlike other doctors, he and his colleagues seemed willing to consider other options. \u201cThey saw I had a lot more energy and a lot of life. Suntha said, \u2018We just can\u2019t treat you like a typical patient,'\u201d Deighton recalled. \u201cHe said I was not fitting into any of the data buckets. And he was willing to think outside the box.\u201d\n\nBased on her response to chemotherapy and her overall good condition, Suntha believed it was worth trying radiation in an effort to eradicate the tumor and wipe out any lingering metastases. The treatments, begun in December 2013, shrank the tumor and eliminated the metastases.\n\nBy February 2014, 10 months after she was diagnosed, Deighton was preparing to run a 10-mile race. \u201cI felt great, like my old self,\u201d she said. She wanted to try surgery, a major operation called a transthoracic esophagectomy, usually reserved for patients with early-stage cancer. The procedure is one of the most complicated and difficult operations in medicine. It involves removing most of the esophagus (and with it the tumor) and pulling up part of the stomach to fashion a new esophagus. Serious digestive and other complications are common, and the procedure has an overall mortality rate of about 9 percent.\n\nBecause Deighton had done unusually well, \u201cthe conversation then became: \u2018Should you even think about doing surgery?'\u201d Suntha recalled. \u201cThis is on the far end of the spectrum of the approach we\u2019d consider. But here is this patient who, instead of having disease progression, had only one area of active disease. She was otherwise healthy and physically and emotionally strong.\u201d Deighton, who knew the risks, pushed for surgery. Suntha and the thoracic surgeon on her medical team thought it was worth a shot.\n\nBut her medical oncologist was strongly opposed. She told Deighton she feared the operation would mar her quality of life \u2014 or worse. After much soul-searching, Deighton decided surgery was the only hope for eliminating her cancer. \u201cI want to keep living for my kids,\u201d she said. The doctors knew \u201cthat if they didn\u2019t get that tumor out, there was no other option.\u201d\n\nOn June 9, Deighton underwent a 15-hour operation, which was deemed a success. She went back to work in July and began another round of standard chemotherapy, which she described as punishing, to kill any lingering cancer cells. For the next year she will receive Herceptin, an immunotherapy drug. Immunotherapy, an active area of cancer research and treatment, harnesses a patient\u2019s immune system to attack malignant cells.\n\nThe first measure of her progress came last month, when Deighton underwent a series of scans. The results could not have been better. They showed no sign of cancer anywhere in her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling great,\u201d she said recently. Surgery made her feel \u201cstronger and healthier. It gave me a new lease on life.\u201d Even if the next scan shows that the cancer has returned, Deighton said, the operation \u201cabsolutely\u201d was worth it.\n\nIn addition to luck and several excellent doctors, especially Suntha and the other members of the Maryland team, Deighton said she believes her willingness to ask questions and to advocate for herself has played a major role in how well she has done.\n\n\u201cI asked the gross stuff, the silly stuff, and a lot of people laughed at me,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m stubborn \u2014 and fortunate.\u201d\n\nTo Suntha, Deighton\u2019s case remains a mystery \u2014 not the first he has encountered. \u201cWe have had other patients with something unique about their biology who have quote, \u2018beaten the odds\u2019 . . . but they are the exception rather than the rule.\u201d\n\nOnly a few have gone three years without a recurrence, Suntha said. He and Deighton hope she will, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sitting in a Washington coffee shop, Dana Deighton looks fit, a stylish gold pin affixed to her black wool cape.
