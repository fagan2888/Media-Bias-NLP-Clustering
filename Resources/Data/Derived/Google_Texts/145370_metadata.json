However, the most unlikely warriors in the women\u2019s movement are nuns challenging the Vatican and the patriarchal structure to which they are devoted.\n\nThe documentary \u201cRadical Grace,\u201d which recently screened at the District\u2019s AFI Docs film festival, follows the mission of three fearless nuns, sisters Simone Campbell, Jean Hughes and Chris Schenk, as they explore \u201cnundom\u201d in the 21st century. The sisters and film director Rebecca Parrish spoke at the U.S. premiere in Washington Saturday.\n\nMs. Parrish encourages people to not think of the Catholic Church as \u201cover there,\u201d but as a powerful influence over the everyday lives of women and social issue debates, such as empowerment within the family structure and access to contraception.\n\nSEE ALSO: Christian\u2019s message on Dylann Roof\u2019s Facebook page goes viral: \u2018Give your heart to Jesus\u2019\n\n\u201cThe oppression that happens within the institution isn\u2019t just about what happens for people at Sunday Mass, it affects people\u2019s everyday lives in a really deep way,\u201d Ms. Parrish told The Washington Times.\n\nMs. Parrish classifies herself as a \u201cnone,\u201d or a nonreligious \u201cspiritual seeker\u201d who never predicted her first feature would center on Catholic nuns.\n\nOriginally seeking out unique acts of social justice for her documentary, Ms. Parrish first came across the work and life of Sister Hughes, who worked with formerly incarcerated felons in Chicago to help get their lives back on track after serving jail time.\n\nSEE ALSO: \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 composer Alan Silvestri basks in NSO rendition\n\n\u201cMy goal is to love people as unconditionally as I can so they have that experience at least once in their life,\u201d Sister Hughes, who passed away in January, said in the film.\n\n\u201cWhat drew me to this story as a nonreligious person [was] what I saw in the sisters a model for how social justice work could be approached as a spiritual practice,\u201d Ms. Parrish said.\n\n\u201cBefore that, my image of Catholic nuns was drawn entirely by Hollywood,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought they all wore habits, lived a cloistered life of prayer and ritual and were very conservative. Sister Jean exploded my stereotypes. Her passion for justice and deep, irreverent spirituality had me hooked.\u201d\n\nCensure\n\nIn 2012 the Vatican reprimanded American nuns for promoting \u201cradical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.\u201d U.S. bishops also opposed the nuns\u2019 defiance.\n\nIn the film, Thomas Paprocki, Bishop of the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois, said, \u201cThe sisters say that religious life is changing and evolving. The question is, are you still religious? Are you still nuns? Are you still Christian?\u201d\n\nSister Schenk rebutted such accusations that the feminist nuns were \u201cradical,\u201d claiming that their search for equal opportunity should not be considered an absurd idea.\n\n\u201cWhat do they mean by feminist? The radical notion that women are equal? That women are people like other people are people? If that\u2019s a sin, then I\u2019m guilty as charged,\u201d Sister Schenk said.\n\nThe Vatican investigation specifically cited Sister Campbell\u2019s organization Network, a lobby in D.C. that supported the Affordable Care Act, thus challenging U.S. bishops\u2019 opposition to the bill.\n\n\u201cThe girls played the boys, and for once the girls won, and they [the cardinals] were pissed,\u201d Sister Campbell said of Obamacare\u2019s passage.\n\nRather than backing away from the Vatican\u2019s threat to excommunicate the nuns, Sister Campbell launched a cross-country \u201cNuns on the Bus Tour,\u201d focusing on economic inequality in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Sister Schenk traveled to Rome to promote women\u2019s equality in the Church, flaring pink smoke while the world awaited a new Pope.\n\nWhen Pope Francis was instated in 2013, Sister Schenk noted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get [her] expectations up\u201d about women gaining equal opportunities within the Catholic Church. However, Francis turned out to be \u201cmore inclusive, engaging [and] welcoming\u201d than his predecessors.\n\nThe nuns are ecstatic for Francis\u2019 U.S. trip in September to address both chambers of Congress \u2014 presumably including his calling on the world to take action on climate change.\n\n\u201cThe pope gives me hope,\u201d Sister Campbell said. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s walking toward his biggest critics with love, within the Church and within Congress. There is going to be this fabulous Holy Spirit moment when we really focus on what matters for our nation.\u201d\n\nMillennials are less religious than previous generations, with younger women dropping out of Catholicism at faster rates than young men. The nuns voiced their concern, noting that the structure of the Catholic Church needs change to hang on to young people.\n\n\u201cHow do we have young women stay in the Church?\u201d Sister Schenk said. \u201cIt all goes to the perception in the public mind that institutional church is anti-woman and sexist. We need to stay and fight this out. We have to get involved and change the structures.\u201d\n\nSister Campbell encourages everyday people to engage in \u201choly curiosity\u201d for what others think and believe, followed by \u201csacred gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we need to spend our time on is this: Are we spreading love?\u201d Sister Campbell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just within the Catholic Church, it\u2019s all of us together. We are one, and we cannot separate ourselves from each other or from creation. We have a huge task in front of us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catholicism and feminism don't exactly go hand in hand.
