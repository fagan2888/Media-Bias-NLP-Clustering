Wall Street isn\u2019t taking any excuses, sending HRB stock down by about 15% in afternoon trading Wednesday.\n\nYes, it\u2019s brutal; but this could actually be an opportunity for value investors, especially since HRB sports a decent dividend yield of nearly 4%. But let\u2019s first see what\u2019s happening with the core business.\n\nAccording to a preliminary release, HRB suffered a 5.8% drop in tax-return volume to 12.2 million (keep in mind that the full earnings report will come out on June 9). The fall came early in the year, in which there was weakness with 1040EA filings as well as the returns for the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why this happened, but it could be an ominous sign that lower-income people are moving increasingly toward electronic alternatives. This category has seen lots of price competition from rivals like TurboTax from Intuit Inc. ( INTU ) and TaxAct from Blucora Inc ( BCOR ).\n\nFor example, Intuit raised its revenue guidance to 8% to 9%, up from the prior forecast of 5% to 7%. Something else to consider: During the tax season, HRB saw a 2.6% drop \u2014 to 6.72 million \u2014 in the software/web business.\n\nHRB is swiftly moving to cut costs, reducing its workforce by 250, or 13%, and to also be more circumspect about new initiatives. But interestingly enough, investors in HRB had some warning.\n\nBack in early March, the company\u2019s shares plunged by nearly 16% on news of its disappointing earnings report for the fiscal third quarter. HRB reported a 6.8% fall in revenues to $475 million and an adjusted loss of 34 cents. The Street was looking for revenues of $502 million and a per-share loss of 24 cents.\n\nHRB: Not Doomed\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that H&R Block has many key advantages. After all, it is the largest tax prep firm in the U.S., has a trusted brand and the EBITDA margins are a juicy 28%. There should also be growth catalysts over the next couple years, from dealing with the complexities of the Affordable Care Act to its investments in mobile technologies for the Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) and Alphabet Inc ( GOOG , GOOGL ) platforms.\n\nAnd yes, HRB is a strong cash generator, with about $1 billion in EBITDA for the past year. In fact, for 213 straight quarters, the company has paid a dividend. That\u2019s for over 53 years! There is also a $3.5 billion share repurchase program in effect.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the valuation on HRB is only about 11 times forward earnings. Then again, the stock price has lost about 45% of its value during the past seven months or so. In other words, it looks like much of the bad news is already discounted into the stock.\n\nSo, for investors looking for an interesting value play, HRB looks like a good choice. In the meantime, the nearly 4% dividend yield is very attractive.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook.
