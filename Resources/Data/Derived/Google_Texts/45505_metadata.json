Like any other large coalition, the interests of the main players are sometimes in conflict. But they remain bound together by a shared opposition to religious pluralism, the rights of individual conscience, and the separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nCourt challenges often rely on the phrase \u201csincerely held religious beliefs\u201d \u2013 which comes from the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act that was overwhelmingly passed in response to a court ruling three years earlier that allowed Oregon to deny benefits to Native American employees who used peyote for religious ceremonies.\n\nHowever, the phrase has taken on a new meaning after it was used by Hobby Lobby to challenge the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConservative lawmakers \u2013 at the urging of religious right activists \u2013 have pushed for legislation allowing corporations and individuals to discriminate against LGBT customers using language adapted from the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nThe reaction to a marriage equality court ruling from last year reveals that the Christian conservatives don\u2019t want to share religious freedom with groups that don\u2019t share their right-wing views, according to the investigative report.\n\n\u201cThose who embrace what theocratic evangelicals call a biblical worldview or what Catholics call the magisterium of the Church see their particular religious traditions as the sources of law to which all law must conform,\u201d Clarkson wrote.\n\nA federal judge ruled last year in favor of the United Church of Christ, which had challenged a 2012 North Carolina constitutional amendment that effectively made same-sex marriage ceremonies illegal \u2013 and the Christian right was livid.\n\nTony Perkins, a talk radio host and president of the anti-LGBT Family Research Council, rebuked a caller who had asked him about the Christian organization that had filed the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI would use that term \u2018Christian\u2019 very loosely,\u201d Perkins told the caller. \u201cHere\u2019s a test of what is a true religious freedom: a freedom that\u2019s based on orthodox religious viewpoints. It has to have a track record \u2013 it has to come forth from religious orthodoxy.\u201d\n\nMike Huckabee, the Republican presidential candidate and former Arkansas governor, has made similar claims and warned that legal marriage equality would lead to the \u201ccriminalization of Christianity.\u201d\n\nReligious institutions have long enjoyed ministerial exemptions to certain labor laws \u2013 but conservative Christian activists and church leaders are pushing to expand the definition of a religious ministry and even teaching employers how to \u201creligify\u201d their organizations.\n\nCatholic prelates in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Honolulu, Oakland, and San Francisco have declared their schoolteachers are ministers and must conform to church teachings in their personal lives after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling expanded the legal definition of teachers.\n\nThe Christian right sees the ruling in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as an opportunity to potentially expand the definition of ministries to include charities, hospitals, and even for-profit businesses \u2013 leaving them out of reach of labor and civil rights laws.\n\nThe conservative Liberty Institute urged Christian-owned organizations to include religious references in job descriptions and other official documents to protect them from civil lawsuits and government regulation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fox_fns_perkins_marriage_141012e-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "\u2018We live in theocratic times\u2019: Right-wing Christians are claiming religious freedom to ignore any laws they wish"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb603\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHere\u2019s a test of what is a true religious freedom: a freedom that\u2019s based on orthodox religious viewpoints.\nTony Perkins of the Family Research Council (Fox News)Right-wing Christians are claiming the religious freedom to carve out special rights for themselves and ignore any laws they don\u2019t like.\nConservative lawmakers \u2013 at the urging of religious right activists \u2013 have pushed for legislation allowing corporations and individuals to discriminate against LGBT customers using language adapted from the Hobby Lobby ruling.\nWhat\u2019s different about recent legal challenges is that the Christian right \u2014 which includes evangelicals and conservative Catholics \u2014 is claiming that individuals and for-profit corporations should be allowed to decide for themselves which laws to follow.\n\u201cWe live in theocratic times,\u201d wrote the paper\u2019s author, Frederick Clarkson."}
