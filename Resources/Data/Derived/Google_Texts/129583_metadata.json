Different types of starfish, also known as sea stars, were affected, from wild ones along the coast to those in captivity, according to Jonathan Sleeman, director of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s National Wildlife Health Center.\n\n\u201cThe two species affected most are Pisaster ochraceus (purple sea star or ochre starfish) and Pycnopodia helianthoides (sunflower sea star),\u201d he wrote in a statement in December.\n\nThe sunflower sea star is considered among the largest starfish and can span more than a meter in diameter.\n\nThe most commonly observed symptoms are white lesions on the arms of the sea star. The lesions spread rapidly, resulting in the loss of the arm. Within days, the infection consumes the creature\u2019s entire body, and it dies.\n\nEntire populations have been wiped out in Puget Sound off the coast of Washington state, in the Salish Sea off Canada\u2019s British Columbia as well as along the coast of California. The mortality rate is estimated at 95 percent.\n\nScientists who have spent decades studying the local ecosystem have yet to identify the cause.\n\n\u201cWhat we currently think is likely happening is that there is a pathogen, like a parasite or a virus or a bacteria, that is infecting the sea stars and that compromises in some way their immune system,\u201d Pete Raimondi, chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told AFP.\n\nThen, the creatures become more susceptible to bacteria which is \u201ccausing a secondary infection that causes most of the damages that you see.\u201d\n\nA barometer of sea health\n\nThe 2013 phenomenon has not been observed solely along the West Coast; a smaller outbreak also killed East Coast sea stars last year.\n\nPrevious cases were believed to be associated with warmer waters \u2014 sea stars have sensitive skin and prefer cooler water \u2014 but this was not the case in 2013.\n\nAnd when the die-offs happened previously, the geographic span of the infections was much smaller, and far fewer sea stars were affected.\n\nIn 1983, an epidemic nearly wiped out the Pisaster ochraceus from tidal pools along the southern coast of California.\n\nAnother, smaller die-off in 1997 may have been caused by warmer waters in an El Nino year, scientists said.\n\nSea stars are important because \u201cthey play a key role in this ecosystem on the West Coast,\u201d Raimondi said.\n\nSea stars eat mussels, barnacles, snails, mollusks and other smaller sea life, so their health is considered a measure of marine life on the whole in a given area.\n\nWhen sea stars decline in number, \u201cthe mussel population has the potential to dramatically increase, which could significantly alter the rocky intertidal zone,\u201d according to Sleeman.\n\nWhile sea stars make up an important component of the base of the ocean food chain and are considered a top predator, they are in turn eaten by other starfish, shorebirds, gulls, and sometimes sea otters.\n\nIn an effort to find out what is causing the mass deaths, scientists are collecting reports from the public, taking specimens to the lab for analysis and doing genetic sequencing to find out whether a toxin or an infection may be to blame.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What\u2019s killing all the starfish on the West Coast?", "title": "What\u2019s killing all the starfish on the West Coast?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/01/whats-killing-all-the-starfish-on-the-west-coast/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__p_9bbcd53f-cd4e-4513-8188-cc9b4ba74ff7lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__p_9bbcd53f-cd4e-4513-8188-cc9b4ba74ff7lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-01T13:04:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:09:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4227\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe two species affected most are Pisaster ochraceus (purple sea star or ochre starfish) and Pycnopodia helianthoides (sunflower sea star),\u201d he wrote in a statement in December.\nSea stars are important because \u201cthey play a key role in this ecosystem on the West Coast,\u201d Raimondi said.\nStarfish have been mysteriously dying by the millions in recent months along the West Coast, worrying biologists who say the sea creatures are key to the marine ecosystem.\nThe sunflower sea star is considered among the largest starfish and can span more than a meter in diameter.\nThe most commonly observed symptoms are white lesions on the arms of the sea star."}
