Officially known as the Affordable Care Act, what it\u2019s been doing is taking the added costs of insurance companies and reimbursing those companies with government funding.\n\nSadly, part of that funding comes from taxpayers who chose not to sign up for the healthcare system because they are among the lucky ones who never really need to see a doctor. The Affordable Care Act hasn\u2019t been repealed yet, as much of a headache as it is for the very low-income U.S. citizens it was meant to help, but it\u2019s one step closer.\n\nRELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR:\n\nUnitedHealth Group Pulls Out Of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 Exchanges Amid Big Losses\n\nChelsea Clinton Admits That Obamacare Is Way Too Expensive [Video]\n\nObamaCare: Republican Critics Say It\u2019s Breaking The Law\n\nBernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton Debate The Merits Of Berniecare Vs. Obamacare [Video]\n\nSince the Obamacare challenge is still in its early stages, you can still reduce your tax penalty for next year if you haven\u2019t signed up yet. The fee in 2017 will be over $600, which, if you\u2019re single and living alone, is probably more than you\u2019ll pay for coverage for the same year. In 2015, the fee was less than a hundred, so it actually cost less at the time to ignore the new law. This year, if you weren\u2019t aware due to actually having coverage, the fee was $325, over triple what it was the previous year.\n\nJudge Rosemary Collyer, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, said that the money being used to reimburse insurance companies was never appropriated by Congress and is actually a violation of the Constitution the way it was set up.\n\n\u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury is where you send the money you owe in taxes, a reservoir of funds maintained by the Internal Revenue Service. Collyer stated that it\u2019s actually against federal laws to use that money to reimburse insurance companies due to Congress having not approved.\n\nThe Obama administration responded by saying that said appropriation was obvious because of the way it was worded as a whole. The judge rejected this, calling it a \u201cconvoluted argument.\u201d\n\nAn appeal is expected to be made, as the government has been having this same fight for the past six years. The Obamacare challenge hasn\u2019t been signed yet, but Federal Judge Rosemary Collyer says it violates the Constitution the way the law is funded.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown if whoever succeeds President Barack Obama will fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act along with Collyer, and a few have said they will. Of course, at this point, a potential candidate for the 2016 elections will likely say anything to gain the approval of voters.\n\nOne said candidate, Donald Trump, has stated that he will repeal every word of the Affordable Care Act, which will undoubtedly help move the Obamacare challenge along.\n\n\u201cI would end Obamacare and replace it with something terrific, for far less money for the country and for the people.\u201d\n\nU.S. judge hands win to Republicans in Obamacare challenge https://t.co/jhmWYaKRxw pic.twitter.com/AXRTg8taPQ \u2014 Reuters Top News (@Reuters) May 12, 2016\n\nIt\u2019s unknown if this will eliminate the tax penalty for uninsured citizens, but it may be a positive change for those dreading the automatic addition of over $600 to their 2017 taxes just because they couldn\u2019t afford the premium.\n\nMany have stated that the Affordable Care Act is ironically named, actually costing more than what had existed previously. For those being affected the most, the Obamacare challenge will likely be a welcome direction in healthcare reform.\n\n[Image via Mike Flippo/Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obamacare challenge has begun to possibly pave the way for a Republican victory.
