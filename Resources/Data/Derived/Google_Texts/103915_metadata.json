More are likely to follow, as at least 10 governorships will change hands in January, including those in Arkansas, Hawaii and Texas.\n\nCIOs direct the rare corner of state government that holds out the promise of greater efficiency, better service, cost savings and innovation. State computer systems process everything from tax returns to driver\u2019s licenses to welfare cases, and contain the personal information of millions of citizens.\n\nRelated: In a Fickle Shift, Tech Titans Embrace the GOP\n\n\u201cTechnology does hold great promise,\u201d said Otto Doll, now CIO for the city of Minneapolis and a former president of the National Association of Chief Information Officers (NASCIO). \u201cPeople have to be careful not to overstate it. But there are great opportunities for technology. And it\u2019s often not really about technology, it\u2019s about a better way for \u2026 (state government) to operate.\u201d\n\nStates trail the private sector in harnessing information technology to deliver faster, better, more cost-efficient operations and customer service. Several factors prevent them from catching up, but one is that the many CIOs who come from the private sector often choose to return after completing a short stint in public service.\n\nCIO = Career Is Over\n\nDoll was CIO of South Dakota before going to Minneapolis. But his tenure was a rarity. He was in the job for 15 years, having been appointed and reappointed starting in 1996 by former Republican South Dakota governors Bill Janklow and successor Mike Rounds.\n\nAt the time, the joke was CIO meant \u201cCareer Is Over.\u201d A state CIOs\u2019 tenure then averaged 26 months. Today, it remains under three years, at 32 months.\n\nRelated: Google Spends More Than Any Other Tech Giant to Influence Congress\n\nHaving a new governor of the same party doesn\u2019t guarantee reappointment. Current South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard, also a Republican, chose to emphasize priorities different from his predecessors and brought in his own CIO, Doll said. Such a move also is natural, he said. \u201cNobody likes to ride the coattails of his predecessor.\u201d And that\u2019s true in the private sector, too, he said. A new CEO often wants his own CIO to push his priorities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating quite a bit of turnover,\u201d Stu Davis, Ohio CIO and NASCIO president, said of this week\u2019s elections. \u201cI think any time you have a position tied to an administration (that\u2019s elected), you are going to see that.\u201d\n\nBut elections aren\u2019t the only factors driving turnover. Delaware\u2019s governorship wasn\u2019t up for election this year. But James Sills, the state\u2019s CIO the last five years, announced in August he was leaving to return to his \u201cfirst love,\u201d banking. He\u2019s now CEO of Mechanics & Farmers Bank in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nSills said governors often attract CIOs from the private sector, where they often return for better pay or to take on new challenges, such as start-up ventures, after giving time to public service and achieving some goals for the state. Although turnover can be disruptive, Sills sees an upside. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy thing to bring in somebody new from time to time to challenge the status quo,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Keystone Pipeline Debate Can End with New Tech\n\nOther factors also prevent states from quickly adopting new technology and moving at the private sector\u2019s innovative pace, Sills said. And it\u2019s a challenge for state CIOs, regardless of how long they\u2019re on the job.\n\nInformation technology is a huge, expensive and sometimes politically risky proposition\u2014when it fails, as it did during the rollout of the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange website, the fallout can cost people their jobs. For states, investment in it often involves legislative signoffs and byzantine purchasing requirements not found in business. And applying it to new or different ways of operating often meets resistance from a bureaucratic culture reluctant to change, he said.\n\nFaster Turnover in Cybersecurity\n\nIf there\u2019s a state job with an even higher turnover rate than CIOs, it is chief information security officers, or CISOs. They\u2019re the people who police against cyberattacks on state databases and react to breaches.\n\nHalf the states have new CISOs compared to two years ago, according to a report last month from the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP and NASCIO. And half the ones in the jobs two years ago were new compared to two years before that. The main reason for the rapid turnover: money. CISOs can make $250,000 to $500,000 a year in the private sector, said Srini Subramanian, a state cybersecurity specialist with Deloitte who co-authored the report. That\u2019s far more than state governments can pay.\n\nIt\u2019s a crucial job because state databases are under constant attack by hackers trolling for people\u2019s personal identities, as Stateline has reported. And it\u2019s harder to fill than the CIO post, Subramanian said. Even when a state has a CISO, that person struggles to attract and retain a staff. Recruiting any information technology staffer is an ongoing challenge for states, but attracting cybersecurity professionals is even more difficult.\n\n\u201cThe cybersecurity professional is in top demand in the private sector,\u201d Subramanian said. \u201cSo it takes the government all the more effort to attract qualified people to serve.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the pay deficit compared to the private sector, state cybersecurity staffers are especially prone to burnout because they tend to work longer, harder hours than other information technology workers.\n\nWhile states might offer better pay, clearer career paths and somewhat better benefits to attract and hold on to cybersecurity professionals, Subramanian said, there\u2019s one trump card states have that the private sector doesn\u2019t: the lure of public service.\n\nIt\u2019s what attracted Davis, Doll and Sills to be state CIOs, they said, and why Doll said he stays in public service rather than returning to the private sector. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the money,\u201d he said. The chance to serve a community, give something back, help people or keep them safe, and maybe change lives is \u201cabout the only selling point,\u201d Davis said. But, he said, it\u2019s a good one. \u201cIt does get me out of bed every day.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Another shake-up is underway in what\u2019s become one of the most crucial jobs in state go", "title": "Why Your State May Have Just Lost Its Top IT Officer", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/06/Why-Your-State-May-Have-Just-Lost-Its-Top-IT-Officer", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122013_Binary_Dollar_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/06/Why-Your-State-May-Have-Just-Lost-Its-Top-IT-Officer", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122013_Binary_Dollar_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Another shake-up is underway in what\u2019s become one of the most crucial jobs in state go", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d8b\"", "article_summary": "Another shake-up is underway in what\u2019s become one of the most crucial jobs in state government: the top information technology officer.\nAnd it\u2019s a challenge for state CIOs, regardless of how long they\u2019re on the job.\nAt the time, the joke was CIO meant \u201cCareer Is Over.\u201d A state CIOs\u2019 tenure then averaged 26 months.\nIt\u2019s what attracted Davis, Doll and Sills to be state CIOs, they said, and why Doll said he stays in public service rather than returning to the private sector.\n\u201cNobody likes to ride the coattails of his predecessor.\u201d And that\u2019s true in the private sector, too, he said."}
