So many campaign ads these days sound the same, so 30 seconds of grateful fans of prosecutor/coach/friend Ken Buck stands out. The campaign ad began airing this week.

Buck is the GOP nominee for the 4th Congressional District, which is so conservative he’s a heavy favorite, but Democrat Vic Meyers has been campaigning feverishly in the border-to-border district. The two squared off on Aaron Harber’s show. Also running in the 4th District are Jess Loban, a libertarian, and Grant Doherty, who is unaffiliated.

Buck, the Weld County district attorney, lost the 2010 Senate race by 2 percentage points. He ran again this year against U.S. Democrat Mark Udall until he withdrew from the race to make way for Congressman Cory Gardner, who is challenging Udall. Buck is now running for Gardner’s seat.
