(AP) \u2014 Travis Trice received a text message Sunday from Golden State Warriors forward and former Michigan State player Draymond Green that read: \u201cDon\u2019t let this be your last game.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans\u2019 senior guard texted back, \u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrice made sure of that Sunday, scoring 23 points and helping Michigan State knock second-seeded Virginia out of the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year, 60-54.\n\nThe 6-foot, 175-pound Trice scored 13 of his team\u2019s first 15 points on 5-of-5 shooting, including three 3-pointers, to help the Spartans build a 15-4 lead.\n\nBranden Dawson added 15 points and nine rebounds for the seventh-seeded Spartans, who advanced to the Sweet 16 for the seventh time in the last eight seasons under coach Tom Izzo. The Spartans will play the winner of the Oklahoma-Dayton game in Syracuse, New York on Friday.\n\n\u201cOur thing was attack from the get go and get a lead,\u201d said Trice, in his first full season as a starter after three years as a reserve.\n\n\u201cIt was his time to shine,\u201d said Dawson, who started playing with Trice in AAU ball.\n\nWith top seed Villanova having lost Saturday, it is the first time a No. 1 and 2 seed from the same region didn\u2019t advance to the Sweet 16 since Kentucky and Gonzaga in 2004.\n\nThe Cavaliers (30-4), the first Atlantic Coast Conference team to lose after a 9-0 start in the tournament, were led by Anthony Gill\u2019s 11 points and Darion Atkins\u2019 10 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nIzzo made some defensive tweaks to his game plan after Michigan State\u2019s first-round win over Georgia, and the Spartans (25-11) stole a page from last year\u2019s regional semifinal win by limiting the Cavaliers to 29.8 percent shooting. Virginia finished 2 of 17 from 3-point range.\n\nIzzo said the Spartans \u201cchanged what we do\u201d defensively in a day-and-a-half.\n\nInstead of having his guards jump to the ball and give help, Izzo relied more on his big men in the middle to stay disciplined \u2014 and not cheat or go for steals \u2014 and guard against Virginia\u2019s flare screens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not as talented as we\u2019ve been so we are always cheating to find a way to get an edge,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cCoaches can tell you what to do, but when muscle memory tells you to do it another way \u2026 your focus has to be incredible. And that was incredible focus if you asked me.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Spartans upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in the regional semifinal by holding Virginia to 35.1 percent shooting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54", "title": "Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54", "title": "Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/trice_leads_michigan_state_over_virginia_again_60_54/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ncaa-michigan-st-virginia-basketball.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54", "title": "Trice leads Michigan State over Virginia again 60-54", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ncaa-michigan-st-virginia-basketball.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steve Reed", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaba7\"", "article_summary": "The 6-foot, 175-pound Trice scored 13 of his team\u2019s first 15 points on 5-of-5 shooting, including three 3-pointers, to help the Spartans build a 15-4 lead.\nAnd that was incredible focus if you asked me.\u201dLast year, the Spartans upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in the regional semifinal by holding Virginia to 35.1 percent shooting.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCHARLOTTE, N.C.
