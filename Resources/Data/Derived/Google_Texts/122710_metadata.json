She \u201csaw a need\u201d and decided to act.\n\nWhat started out as a small endeavor with just six students has blossomed into three Arizona campuses with 200 special-needs students.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to offer something different to families,\u201d says the founder of Pieceful Solutions.\n\nHow did she do it?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d heard a lot of struggles from families\u2014things that they wished could be changed, things they wished public schools would do,\u201d Cothrun told The Daily Signal. \u201cI took all of that information and created Pieceful Solutions. And so, really, just to offer something, bigger, better, different is really kind of my philosophy.\u201d\n\nCothrun also credits Education Savings Accounts for playing a role in the success and growth of Pieceful Solutions.\n\nA tailor-made education\n\nIn Arizona, qualifying families can get the state\u2019s share of a student\u2019s per pupil amount deposited into a savings account. Parents are then given a debit card loaded with these funds. They can individually select the educational products, services and resources they consider appropriate for their child.\n\n\u201cEducation Savings Accounts are empowering parents to completely customize their children\u2019s educational experience,\u201d said Lindsey Burke, the Will Skillman fellow in education at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cFamilies are able to construct a tailor-made educational experience for their children by virtue of the fact that they can direct every dollar in their child\u2019s ESA.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening at Pieceful Solutions.\n\nThe school was created in 2008 to help children with autism and other disabilities. It takes a different approach from public schools, utilizing innovative teaching techniques to improve learning.\n\nFrustrated with \u2018bureaucracy\u2019\n\nCothrun, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in speech and language and a master\u2019s in special education, taught in Mesa, Ariz., public schools for five years but became frustrated with the \u201cbureaucracy\u201d as she tried to teach students with special needs.\n\nThat led her to start a new K-12 school\u2014the first in Arizona specifically for autism. Today, she serves as the school\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cI was struggling with the bureaucracy of a public school district,\u201d said Cothrun. \u201cI really wanted to offer something different to families.\u201d\n\nShortly after it was founded in 2008 with six students, Cothrun began seeking ways she could help her fledgling school grow.\n\n\u201cGrowing the school was tough,\u201d she said. \u201cStarting off with six students, obviously that\u2019s not enough to fund a teacher and to pay for the light bill.\u201d\n\nCothrun had a second mortgage on her home and borrowed money. She \u201cdid whatever I could to basically keep the doors open knowing that at some point it would be worth it.\u201d\n\nThe growth of Education Savings Accounts\n\nA year after she opened the school, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s voucher program for special-needs students was unconstitutional. The setback for school-choice advocates actually paved the way for Education Savings Acccounts, which Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law in 2011 and have withstood court challenges from teachers unions.\n\nUnlike a voucher\u2014which the state would pay directly to a private or religious school\u2014Education Savings Accounts put parents in complete control of the money.\n\nCothrun said that Education Savings Accounts gave her the freedom to provide more for her students and their families. Today, Pieceful Solutions offers classes such as \u201ckarate, yoga, music therapy, cooking, lots and lots of speech and language, small class sizes and a high student-teacher ratio.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has allowed me, as the founder of the school, to be able to offer our program to so many more families,\u201d Cothrun said. \u201cWhen I first started Pieceful Solutions six years ago, ESA didn\u2019t exist and so for families to afford a private education, it was rare. It was nearly impossible.\n\n\u201cWith the ESA, these families can get the specific individualized education that their child needs using the dollars straight for the school,\u201d she said.\n\nVideo by The Daily Signal\u2019s Jamie Jackson in conjunction with Patchbay Media.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kami Cothrun, the founder and executive director of a school called Pieceful Solutions, decided to open a school because she \u201csaw a need.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Kami Cothrun, the founder and executive director of a school called Pieceful Solutions, decided to open a school because she \u201csaw a need.\u201d", "title": "School Uses Education Savings Accounts to Benefit Students", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141215_PiecefulSolutions.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-15T13:44:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uFHVmA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Kami Cothrun, the founder and executive director of a school called Pieceful Solutions, decided to open a school because she \u201csaw a need.\u201d", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141215_PiecefulSolutions.jpg"}, "title": "School Uses Education Savings Accounts to Benefit Students", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "school choice", "published_time": "2014-12-15T03:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T13:44:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "School choice, Education savings accounts, esa\u2019s, esa, pieceful solutions, autism, special education, education innovations, learning Innovations"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e60\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEducation Savings Accounts are empowering parents to completely customize their children\u2019s educational experience,\u201d said Lindsey Burke, the Will Skillman fellow in education at The Heritage Foundation.\nCothrun said that Education Savings Accounts gave her the freedom to provide more for her students and their families.\nKami Cothrun was a frustrated public school teacher when she decided to open a school of her own.\nThe setback for school-choice advocates actually paved the way for Education Savings Acccounts, which Gov.\nIt takes a different approach from public schools, utilizing innovative teaching techniques to improve learning."}
