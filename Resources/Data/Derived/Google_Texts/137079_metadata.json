Tucker during the first half of a game Wednesday, Jan. 27. Tony Dejak/Associated Press\n\nFast-food chain Carl\u2019s Jr. will continue to cook up the \u201cofficial burger\u201d of the Phoenix Suns basketball team even though a bankrupt franchisee that bought that promotional right has fallen behind on monthly sponsorship payments.\n\nLawyers who put the Carl\u2019s Jr. franchisee, which operates 85 restaurants in Texas and Arizona, into chapter 11 last year have struck a deal with Phoenix Suns officials that will preserve the fast-food chain\u2019s affiliation while it searches for buyers.\n\nThe Carl\u2019s Jr. operator, which is partly owned by founder Carl Karcher\u2019s three grandchildren, made a sponsorship deal with the team in August 2013, giving it access to game tickets, advertising in programs, mentions during games and appearances by players, dancers and the Suns Gorilla team mascot. Carl\u2019s Jr. also sponsors the Phoenix Mercury women\u2019s basketball team.\n\nThat sponsorship deal happened well before the franchise hit financial troubles so deep that it needed to turn to bankruptcy. Frontier Star LLC filed for chapter 11 protection in July, blaming escalating food costs, minimum wage increases and the financial consequences of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn September, the franchise operator fell behind on payments to the team required under the sponsorship deal, putting the sponsorship in jeopardy.\n\nUnder the recent deal, the affiliation lives a little longer. As part of the bargain, the Carl\u2019s Jr. operator agreed to return 288 game tickets and 132 parking passes for the 2015-2016 Phoenix Suns season. Team officials are also trying to sell its TV and radio spots to others.\n\nKeeping the sponsorship deal intact, the Carl\u2019s Jr. franchisee lawyers said in court papers, could make the company more attractive to potential buyers. Several investors are circling, according to court documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix.\n\nThe Arizona franchise operator and its affiliates are also preparing to sell their 79 Hardee\u2019s restaurants in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The restaurants altogether employ more than 3,700 people, according to court papers.\n\nA potential sale could wipe out the 40% ownership stake in the restaurant operator held by Mr. Karcher\u2019s grandchildren: Carl LeVecke, Jason LeVecke, and Margaret R. Edgar. The rest of the ownership, per a 2010 agreement, is held by investor Eric Lester.\n\nThe sponsorship deal\u2019s new terms still need approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Eddward P. Ballinger Jr.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.Follow her on Twitter at @KatyStech", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Fast-food chain Carl\u2019s Jr. will continue to cook up the \u201cofficial burger\u201d of the Phoenix Suns basketball team even though a bankrupt franchisee that bought that promotional right has fallen behind on monthly sponsorship payments.", "title": "Carl\u2019s Jr. Keeps Sponsorship Deal With Phoenix Suns", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2016/01/28/carls-jr-keeps-sponsorship-deal-with-phoenix-suns/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MI267_sunds0_P_20160128133014.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Carl\u2019s Jr. Keeps Sponsorship Deal With Phoenix Suns", "description": "Fast-food chain Carl\u2019s Jr. will continue to cook up the \u201cofficial burger\u201d of the Phoenix Suns basketball team even though a bankrupt franchisee that bought that promotional right has fallen behind on monthly sponsorship payments.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Katy Stech", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Bankruptcy Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.summary": "Fast-food chain Carl\u2019s Jr. will continue to cook up the \u201cofficial burger\u201d of the Phoenix Suns basketball team even though a bankrupt franchisee that bought that promotional right has fallen behind on monthly sponsorship payments.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-01-28T18:58:30-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2016/01/28/carls-jr-keeps-sponsorship-deal-with-phoenix-suns/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-BANKB-21702", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Fast-food chain Carl\u2019s Jr. will continue to cook up the \u201cofficial burger\u201d of the Phoenix Suns basketball team even though a bankrupt franchisee that bought that promotional right has fallen behind on monthly sponsorship payments.", "title": "Carl\u2019s Jr. Keeps Sponsorship Deal With Phoenix Suns", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2016/01/28/carls-jr-keeps-sponsorship-deal-with-phoenix-suns/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-MI267_sunds0_P_20160128133014.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.id": "BL-BANKB-21702", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-01-28T19:12:44-05:00"}, "article_summary": "As part of the bargain, the Carl\u2019s Jr. operator agreed to return 288 game tickets and 132 parking passes for the 2015-2016 Phoenix Suns season.\nKeeping the sponsorship deal intact, the Carl\u2019s Jr. franchisee lawyers said in court papers, could make the company more attractive to potential buyers.\nThat sponsorship deal happened well before the franchise hit financial troubles so deep that it needed to turn to bankruptcy.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 Kevin Love, left, is stopped by the Phoenix Suns\u2019 P.J.\nIn September, the franchise operator fell behind on payments to the team required under the sponsorship deal, putting the sponsorship in jeopardy."}
