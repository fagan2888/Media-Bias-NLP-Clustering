But for firms like Akron's Apple Growth Partners, employers' seemingly daunting task of complying with those requirements also means new business opportunities that could attract and retain customers.\n\n\n\nThe new reporting process now involves calculating every full-time employee's monthly expense for an employer's health plan for the first time. The first reports are due in January.\n\n\n\nApple Growth unveiled its own reporting tool this summer called \u201cmy aca partner,\u201d a software-based service designed to help employers collect information, test for compliance and even mail forms out to employees as it relates to health care reform.\n\n\n\nLed by Susan Burnoski, Apple Growth's director of assurance, my aca partner opens up a slew of new business. Burnoski said the firm already is garnering interest from employers of all types and sizes, from trade groups and school districts to large companies, including a couple with several thousand employees each. Contracts are in the works, she said.\n\n\n\nApple Growth primarily deals with small to midsize, privately held companies on the accounting front, but its ACA product could be applied to any employer of any size.\n\n\n\nRehmann, a Michigan-based accounting firm with offices in Northeast Ohio, is the first to private-license the product. Additional licenses with other accounting firms will remain an ongoing goal, Burnoski said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a natural fit for us,\u201d said Carl Sorboro, Rehman's director of operations. \u201cWhy would we sink development costs to satisfy a client when (Apple Growth was) already so far ahead of the game?\u201d\n\n\n\nSorboro added that there's \u201cdefinitely a client need\u201d for reporting help and the partnership with Apple Growth will create \u201ca revenue stream for the firm that reaches far beyond 2015.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat goes for Apple Growth, too.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're focusing on Ohio,\u201d said Apple Growth Partners CEO Harold Gaar. \u201cBut in terms of working with other accounting firms, it really has no border limits.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning out of time\n\nWhether through consulting or offering special, proprietary reporting tools, firms providing accounting, payroll and benefits services are busy helping employers clamoring for ACA compliance. Those without their own niche ACA practices are increasingly partnering with those who do.CBIZ Inc., a large, Cleveland-based professional service firm, began ACA consulting and analysis in 2012.But \u201cthe urgency factor has significantly increased\u201d in 2015, said Jim King, vice president and chief operating officer of CBIZ's national employee benefits practice in Cleveland.Through a partnership with SyncStream Solutions LLC, which has established its own ACA reporting tools, CBIZ unveiled its CBIZ ACA CheckPoint tool in December.And those combined efforts already are paying off.\u201cWhat we found was from 2012 on, our retention is steadily improving, and we believe a lot of that has to do with our work around healthcare reform,\u201d King said.\n\nWith federal fines soaring as high as $3,000 per individual not offered an affordable health plan, consultants are telling employers \u2014 particularly those with small to midsize and highly nuanced workforces that might include lots of part-time or seasonal staff or collective bargaining units \u2014 to evaluate their reporting procedures now, if they haven't already, lest they set themselves up for costly penalties.\n\n\n\nJohn McGowan Jr., a Cleveland partner with BakerHostetler specializing in employee benefits, said clients have been calling in droves this year about how the new ACA reporting requirements affect them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd we're telling people they need to do their darndest to comply,\u201d he said.\n\nMany are worried, he said. Some want to know if the new requirements apply to them. Others are asking about what penalties they face if found non compliant. Some are asking about what recourse they have if their vendor botches the reports.\n\nThese changes have been looming for years, though. So why the rush now?\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say many employers are simply playing catch-up.Large companies either have internal staff dedicated to the new requirements or have been more proactive in finding solutions because of their scale and large staffs. By industry, McGowan said staffing and restaurant companies are among those who have been ahead of the curve.But those smaller and midsize employers with a combination of unique employment arrangements and greater turnover \u2014 which can include nonprofits that already tend to be a bit slower on the compliance front, McGowan said, as well as governmental organizations and schools \u2014 are more likely to be behind.Some employers have been resistant to implement changes, McGowan said. Some may be negligent. But the reasons why some are behind vary.The IRS didn't actually release the new W2-esque reporting forms (the various 1094 and 1095 forms) until February, so that created some lag.Some have likely dragged their feet because of the fluid deadlines. The smallest tier of affected employers (50 full-time equivalent employees and more) has an extra year to comply compared with their larger counterparts (100 FTE employees and more) who need to be compliant this year to complete their 2016 reports. Those showing at least a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to be compliant, though, as deemed by the IRS, won't be penalized their first year despite any possible errors.Meanwhile, those straddling the border between 50 to 100 FTE employees may just be realizing they're affected after reviewing their books.Others were banking on legal challenges tearing the ACA down, McGowan said. However, the recent Supreme Court ruling proves the ACA is here to stay \u2014 at least with the current administration.\u201cI think a lot of people, because of the complexities of it, have buried their heads in the sand and have ignored the requirements and said \"I'll deal with it later,'\u201d said David Reyes, a CPA in the tax consulting services group for accounting firm Maloney Novotny.\u201cSome people might not do it until the early part of next year, but there's so much data to gather that it makes sense to be gathering it on a monthly basis as you go along instead of trying to do it once at the end of the year,\u201d Reyes said.Added CBIZ's King, \u201cFor those who have been stalling or thinking this is going to go away, they're running out of time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The Affordable Care Act has employers scrambling to implement procedures to collect and organize the myriad data tied to health plans that the Internal Revenue Service expects to see starting next year.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "The Affordable Care Act has employers scrambling to implement procedures to collect and organize the myriad data tied to health plans that the Internal Revenue Service expects to see starting next year.", "title": "Vendors see chance as employers rush to complete ACA compliance", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150712/NEWS/307129976/vendors-see-chance-as-employers-rush-to-complete-aca-compliance", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "published_time": "2015-07-12T04:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-13T21:53:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/staff/1"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "theme-color": "#a91d38"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfff6\"", "article_summary": "Rehmann, a Michigan-based accounting firm with offices in Northeast Ohio, is the first to private-license the product.\n\u201cWe're focusing on Ohio,\u201d said Apple Growth Partners CEO Harold Gaar.\nJohn McGowan Jr., a Cleveland partner with BakerHostetler specializing in employee benefits, said clients have been calling in droves this year about how the new ACA reporting requirements affect them.\nThe new reporting process now involves calculating every full-time employee's monthly expense for an employer's health plan for the first time.\nBut for firms like Akron's Apple Growth Partners, employers' seemingly daunting task of complying with those requirements also means new business opportunities that could attract and retain customers."}
