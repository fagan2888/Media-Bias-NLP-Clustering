(The capital\u2019s own Ebola scare at Howard University hospital turned out to be all okay. The guy only had Malaria.)\n\nPresident Obama is on it with just weeks to go until the midterms, appointing a Solyndra-tainted Ebola czar with no medical background, reminding America that flu season is coming up in a baldly political televised statement that Chris Matthews likened to FDR\u2019s Fireside chats, and even saying that he kissed the Ebola nurses in Atlanta (where\u2019s Chris Christie to exchange a Latex-gloved handshake when you need him?).\n\nHis administration knew that there was nearly a 25 percent chance that Ebola would be imported to the United States and he still told us that the risk was \u201cextremely low.\u201d His Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted inaccurate safety instructions about what to do if you\u2019re exposed to Ebola. The Nebraska Ebola hospital can only take so many patients due to staff constraints after it laid off staff due to Obamacare\u2019s funding cuts. When thed CDC flew Amber Joy Vinson to Atlanta for treatment, a man with no Hazmat suit was handling trash bags on the runway. Heck, Vinson flew on a damn commercial plane after treating an Ebola patient because the CDC told her she could.\n\nAnd now, the Left is agitating for yet another political appointee to mismanage the Ebola outbreak from the halls of bureaucracy: Surgeon General nominee Vivek Murthy.\n\nMore than 24 House Democrats are calling for Murthy to be confirmed immediately \u201cto disseminate information that is desperately needed\u201d and to \u201ccombat misinformation here at home.\u201d Lefty social media is blowing up with a pro-Murthy pressure campaign. Paragon of health Michael Moore tweeted, \u201cDid u know we don\u2019t have a perm Surgeon General during this crisis? Obama nom Dr Vivek Murthy 1yr ago but the NRA & Repubs have blocked him.\u201d The mainstream media is echoing the \u201cNRA killed him\u201d line.\n\nBut Vivek Murthy\u2019s 2013 nomination was not delayed only by the NRA after Murthy\u2019s anti-gun tweets were publicized. Not even close. The Left doesn\u2019t want to talk about how Senate Republicans raised objections to Murthy, who is in his mid-thirties, due to his lack of medical experience.\n\nThe young man\u2019s career has been distinguished mostly by pro-Obamacare activism on the president\u2019s behalf, like founding the photo op-friendly activist group \u201cDoctors For Obama,\u201d which became \u201cDoctors for America.\u201d As The Daily Caller reported, half of the doctors in his own Hospitalist Services specialty at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital have more medical experience than him. The guy is basically J.D. from \u201cScrubs\u201d if he started retweeting Huffington Post reporters.\n\nDoctors for America\u2019s Ebola fact sheet simply directs people to various CDC information pages. Its most recent Ebola-related tweet above stuff about Medicaid expansion and Obamacare enrollment is just a retweet of the White House.\n\nWhen Doctors for America held its 2013 national conference it featured Judd Legum, editor of the pro-Obama propaganda blog ThinkProgress and, in Murthy\u2019s words, a \u201csocial media guru\u201d who taught the doctor-activists how \u201cto use twitter for advocacy.\u201d\n\nWhat did social media guru Judd Legum tell the doctor-activists in the conference\u2019s \u201cSocial Media 101\u201d class?: \u201cFigure out the issues you care about and connect them to issues people are already talking about.\u201d Murthy favorited the tweet quoting Legum\u2019s journalistically egregious statement.\n\nWhat a game for the nation\u2019s potential top doctor to be playing. It could work with any piece of health information! Let\u2019s try it:\n\n\u201cHeart-disease is the number-one killer in America\u2026Fortunately, Michelle Obama\u2019s school lunch program is standing up to heart disease by making school lunches smaller and less popular. For more information, visit letsmove.gov.\u201d\n\n\u201cSiblings are ideal candidates for kidney donation\u2026Would Charles Koch give David a kidney so they can continue corrupting our democratic processes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly 300,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed this year\u2026But did you know that breast cancer is 100 times less common in men than in #Women? It\u2019s time to stand up to breast cancer inequality. Here\u2019s Sandra Fluke to explain more\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWill liver disease patients be forced to show photo ID at polling places? #YesAllLivers\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first Ebola outbreak occurred in the Sudan in 1976\u2026But isn\u2019t Rush Limbaugh really the one who spreads rhetorical Ebola every day?\u201d\n\nEnough of this insanity. This is Rahm Emanuel \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste\u201d politics. This is an outbreak being used as an activist break-in. I trust Vivek Murthy to stop Ebola like I trust Hunter Biden with a payday loan. If the government wants to \u201ccombat misinformation,\u201d they should stop telling Ebola nurses to go ahead and fly on a plane with other passengers with a 99 degree fever. Or, you know, institute a flight ban from the countries where Ebola is.\n\nOr maybe don\u2019t confirm a Surgeon General nominee Kate Hudson\u2019s age who came to prominence advocating for a health care law that is going to kill the medical technology industry\u2019s research and development capabilities before we\u2019ve cured cancer, AIDS, or Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAre you listening, Democrats? Or am I going to have to tweet at you?\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Will social media confirm the thirtysomething Surgeon General pick?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Liberals are squeezing every last drop of infected bodily fluids out of the Ebola blanket that is the American news cycle to push their own political objectives, and if they succeed, we'll end up conf", "title": "Democrats\u2019 Ebola-Based Campaign To Confirm Obama Surgeon General Pick Is Stupid, Dangerous", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/18/democrats-ebola-based-campaign-to-confirm-obama-surgeon-general-pick-is-stupid-dangerous/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Moore.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Do we want someone Kate Hudson's age to be Surgeon General?", "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/18/democrats-ebola-based-campaign-to-confirm-obama-surgeon-general-pick-is-stupid-dangerous/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Moore.jpg"}, "title": "Democrats\u2019 Ebola-Based Campaign To Confirm Obama Surgeon General Pick Is Stupid, Dangerous Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-18 12:39:55", "sailthru.title": "Democrats' Ebola-Based Campaign To Confirm Obama Surgeon General Pick Is Stupid, Dangerous", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "ebola,vivek murthy", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "patrick-howley", "sailthru.description": "Liberals are squeezing every last drop of infected bodily fluids out of the Ebola blanket that is the American news cycle to push their own political objectives, and if they succeed, we'll end up conf", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Moore.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf026\"", "article_summary": "I trust Vivek Murthy to stop Ebola like I trust Hunter Biden with a payday loan.\nAnd now, the Left is agitating for yet another political appointee to mismanage the Ebola outbreak from the halls of bureaucracy: Surgeon General nominee Vivek Murthy.\nParagon of health Michael Moore tweeted, \u201cDid u know we don\u2019t have a perm Surgeon General during this crisis?\nWhen Doctors for America held its 2013 national conference it featured Judd Legum, editor of the pro-Obama propaganda blog ThinkProgress and, in Murthy\u2019s words, a \u201csocial media guru\u201d who taught the doctor-activists how \u201cto use twitter for advocacy.\u201dWhat did social media guru Judd Legum tell the doctor-activists in the conference\u2019s \u201cSocial Media 101\u201d class?\nObama nom Dr Vivek Murthy 1yr ago but the NRA & Repubs have blocked him.\u201d The mainstream media is echoing the \u201cNRA killed him\u201d line."}
