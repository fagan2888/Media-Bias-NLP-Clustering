Fitness trackers have been all the rage in the past couple of years. Though some research shows that you won’t be wearing your new tracker after six months, fitness tracker sales have never been higher and companies continue to churn them out. Though many focus on walking or other types of land-based movement, a new tracker from Speedo and Misfit allows you to take your tracker into the pool and count your laps.

The Speedo Shine looks a lot like the other fitness trackers that Misfit creates, with the thin wristband and circular face that is reminiscent of a watch face. The Shine will work with Misfit’s Android and iOS apps, as well as the Speedo Fit app. It’ll be waterproof up to 50 meters and is designed specifically for the swimmer or aspiring swimmer in your life.

“The new Speedo Shine is a big step forward and will give swimmers the information they have always wanted, the ability to accurately track their laps, distance, calories, and time,” Jamie Cornforth, Vice President of Product and Marketing at Speedo International said in a press release. “The new Speedo Shine also allows swimmers to take this information and seamlessly add it to their wider fitness data, providing an accurate and complete view of their total health and fitness regime.”

Though the Shine is designed specifically for swimmers, it can also track walking, cycling, while automatically detecting light and deep sleeps. Unlike other fitness trackers, you won’t ever have to charge it. The Shine runs on a regular watch battery and will only require you to change it every six months. It will also seamlessly sync to your smartphone via Bluetooth, without the use of dongles or a computer connection.

The Speedo Shine will be released worldwide on Sept. 1 and cost $79.99, but will only be available for physical purchase in Apple stores.
