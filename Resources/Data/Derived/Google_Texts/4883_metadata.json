But it both concedes and formalizes what the All-Star Game had become \u2014 and will remain short of raising the stakes with such things as a winning-team-takes-all pool rivaling a huge Powerball payoff.\n\nFun. Fast. Devoid of emotion or edge. And if it serves as an advertisement for the league\u2019s popular new overtime format, great.\n\nRoy\u2019s view of Pickard. My feature on Avalanche goalie Calvin Pickard is on Page 4CC.\n\nI also asked Patrick Roy about Pickard.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing really well,\u201d the Avalanche coach said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with him. First of all, his attitude off the ice is phenomenal. He\u2019s working really hard, he competes every time he touches the ice. \u2026 I think he has a future in the NHL. I\u2019d like to think one day it will be for us, but for that to happen, we\u2019re going to have to make decisions.\u201d\n\nRoy noted that Pickard has accepted his sometimes strange role the last two seasons.\n\n\u201cI think he understands the situation,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like this for a lot of goaltenders. Goaltenders always take a little bit more time than forwards or defensemen. Last year, I think he set the tone for himself in a way that he proved to us that he was capable of playing at that level. I\u2019m not saying it was a surprise, but we did not expect him to play as well as he did. Now, he\u2019s kind of forcing us to keep playing him and that\u2019s all he can do for now.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision two years ago to go with (Reto) Berra and Reto\u2019s been playing well for us as well. Unfortunately for him, he\u2019s been hurt the past two years, but eventually Joe (Sakic) and the organization is going to have a decision to make.\u201d\n\n(Aside: Roy had just turned 20 when he stuck with the Canadiens at the outset of the 1985-86 season \u2026 and never played another game in the AHL.)\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen when Berra recovers from his ankle injury?\n\nAfter a long pause, Roy said: \u201cI will let you ask me the question when that happens.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost.com or @tfrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nAnze Kopitar, C, L.A. Kings\n\nWhen: The Avalanche faces Kopitar and the Kings on Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Kopitar recently signed an eight-year, $80 million contract extension that will keep him off the free-agent market this summer. The Kings now have him locked up through the 2023-24 season, when he will be 36. Kopitar will receive $9 million in bonuses July 1 this year and in 2017. His salary cap number will be $10 million each season, and his front-loaded salaries will begin at $14 million next season and gradually decrease, to \u201conly\u201d $7 million in the final two years of the deal.\n\nBackground: The deal is another comparative for future unrestricted free agents, most notably Tampa Bay\u2019s Steven Stamkos. Chicago\u2019s Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane are in the first seasons of similarly constructed eight-year, $84 million contract extensions they signed in 2014.\n\nFrei\u2019s take: Kopitar has come a long way \u2014 literally and figuratively. He was raised in Jesenice, Slovenia, near the Italy and Austria borders, when Slovenia was considered part of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Yugoslav troops attempted to quash Slovenia\u2019s attempt to become an independent nation again. In 1992, when Kopitar was 5, the United Nations finally recognized Slovenia.\n\n\u201cObviously, we were scared when those things were going on,\u201d Kopitar once told me in the Kings\u2019 dressing room. \u201cBut everything turned out fine. \u2026 When the war was going on, it was only for about 10 days and it didn\u2019t impact us. But all the people were happy.\u201d\n\nThat was about the time when he was beginning to pick up the sport under the tutelage of his father, Matjaz.\n\n\u201cMy dad made me an ice surface as big as this room,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I would come home from school or kindergarten, I would just put on skates and play there. \u2026 Hockey was not that big in Slovenia. There was always soccer and basketball before hockey.\u201d\n\nSomething tells me he has made it bigger.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: NHL All-stars going 3-on-3 will be fun", "title": "Frei: NHL All-stars going 3-on-3 will be fun", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/frei-nhl-all-stars-going-3-on-3-will-be-fun/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T18:16:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "\u201cObviously, we were scared when those things were going on,\u201d Kopitar once told me in the Kings\u2019 dressing room.\n\u2026 When the war was going on, it was only for about 10 days and it didn\u2019t impact us.\nWhat\u2019s up: Kopitar recently signed an eight-year, $80 million contract extension that will keep him off the free-agent market this summer.\nHe was raised in Jesenice, Slovenia, near the Italy and Austria borders, when Slovenia was considered part of Yugoslavia.\n\u201cEvery time I would come home from school or kindergarten, I would just put on skates and play there."}
