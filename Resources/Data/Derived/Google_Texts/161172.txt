By mid-afternoon Saturday, Mathieu Stanoch had seen close to 100 little girls in Princess Elsa costumes. The character, from the Disney movie “Frozen,” seems to be the most popular costume this year, he said. And he would know.

Stanoch, co-organizer of the annual Little Monsters Pumpkin Patch and Trick-or-Treating event, helped hand out more than 1,000 free pumpkins to kids in costume at Centro Ybor on Saturday. Children and their parents decorated the pumpkins before taking photographs with a scarecrow in the pumpkin patch and trick-or-treating at participating Ybor City businesses.
