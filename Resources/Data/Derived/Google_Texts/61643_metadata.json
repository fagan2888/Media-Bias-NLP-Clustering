We camped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wonderful, just wonderful.\u201d\n\nLocated in a former Westminster elementary school building, the center, known as KDEP, offers a roster of 65 classes and activities each week to keep people with MS and other acquired neurological conditions active and engaged.\n\nTrips like the Crested Butte visit, where therapeutic riding specialists helped the group on their ride, are part of an increased effort by the KDEP staff to add more vacation-style experiential trips. To that end, the center\u2019s staff recently led their first out-of-state trip, taking eight participants to San Diego, where they visited Sea World, went sightseeing, dined out and visited the beach.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of our clients, if they weren\u2019t coming to us, they would be watching daytime television and being bored,\u201d said program manager Michelle King, who is not related to the family the center is named for. \u201cWe give them a chance to try new things or do those things they used to do.\u201d\n\nThe center\u2019s offerings include recreation and exercise classes such as bowling and hydrotherapy, art, cooking, yoga and computer courses.\n\nMany of the classes, such as cooking, focus on using modified equipment and methods to allow clients with decreased motor ability to continue doing the things they love or to acquire new skills to help them be more independent.\n\n\u201cWe help them learn ways to do what they\u2019ve always done or wanted to do \u2014 just adapted so they can succeed,\u201d King said.\n\nMost of the center\u2019s participants use Medicaid to pay for a portion of their program costs, with the center making up the difference in costs through charitable contributions. The center is a past recipient of Season to Share funding.\n\nKDEP courses are offered through a course catalog and selected by participants based on interest. The average participant visits the center three days a week, and participants can be at any stage in their diagnosis. Breakfast and lunch are served daily at the center.\n\nWhile the courses are a critical element of KDEP\u2019s mission, Stephens, 60, said the social interaction is a big draw.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place,\u201d said Stephens, 60, a former social worker and counselor. \u201cI\u2019ve made so many friends here, and it gets me out of the house and doing things.\u201d\n\nKristi Arellano: 303-954-1902, karellano@denverpost.com or twitter.com/karellano_dp\n\nKing Adult Day Enrichment Program\n\nName of agency: Rocky Mountain MS Center\u2019s King Adult Day Enrichment Program\n\nAddress: 8845 Wagner St., Westminster\n\nIn operation since: Rocky Mountain MS Center, 1978; King Program, 1991\n\nNumber served last year: 180\n\nStaff: 16 (13 full time, 3 part time)\n\nYearly budget: $1.2 million\n\nPercentage of funds directly given to clients and services: 100 percent of Season to Share dollars went to supplement the gap between service fees and program costs at King", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "King program provides social connection for MS patients", "title": "King program provides social connection for MS patients", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/14/king-program-provides-social-connection-for-ms-patients/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131214__20131215_B2_CD15STSROCKYMTNMSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131214__20131215_B2_CD15STSROCKYMTNMSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-14T18:36:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T10:43:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce698\"", "article_summary": "That changed this summer, when Stephens was among a group from the Rocky Mountain MS Center\u2019s King Adult Day Enrichment Program that traveled to Crested Butte.\nMost of the center\u2019s participants use Medicaid to pay for a portion of their program costs, with the center making up the difference in costs through charitable contributions.\nWhile the courses are a critical element of KDEP\u2019s mission, Stephens, 60, said the social interaction is a big draw.\nThe average participant visits the center three days a week, and participants can be at any stage in their diagnosis.\n\u201cWe help them learn ways to do what they\u2019ve always done or wanted to do \u2014 just adapted so they can succeed,\u201d King said."}
