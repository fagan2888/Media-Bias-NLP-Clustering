They were reduced again in the current budget.\n\nHowever, the deputy finance minister for fiscal policy said a decline in international oil prices would account for the bulk of the reduced subsidy spending in the next fiscal year.\n\n\"Most of the savings in petroleum product subsidies will be a result of lower global oil prices,\" the deputy minister, Ahmed Kojak, told Reuters.\n\n\"There is also a saving of about 8-10 billion (Egyptian) pounds that will come as a result of new reforms that the Petroleum Ministry will outline in agreement with us,\" he added.\n\nEgypt is struggling to revive its economy since a popular uprising in 2011 shook investor confidence and drove tourists and foreign investors away. Its foreign currency reserves stood at $16.56 billion in March, down from about $36 billion in 2011.\n\nThe government has been trying to cut subsidies, which eat up a big chunk of the budget.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has approved a draft state budget that reduces the budget deficit in the 2016/17 fiscal year to 9.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from the current 11.5 percent.\n\n(Reporting by Ehab Farouk; Writing by Asma Alsharif; Editing by Helen Popper)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will reduce spending on fuel subsidies by nearly 43 percent in", "title": "Egypt to cut fuel subsidies as government seeks to reduce deficit", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/Egypts-finance-minister-says-petroleum-subsidies-be-slashed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-women-gas-station_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/Egypts-finance-minister-says-petroleum-subsidies-be-slashed", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-women-gas-station_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will reduce spending on fuel subsidies by nearly 43 percent in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will reduce spending on fuel subsidies by nearly 43 percent in the 2016/17 budget due mainly to lower global energy costs, officials said on Saturday.\nFinance Minister Amr al-Garhy told a news conference state energy subsidies would fall to 35 billion Egyptian pounds ($3.94 billion) from about 61 billion pounds in the 2015/16 budget.\nThe government has been trying to cut subsidies, which eat up a big chunk of the budget.\nConsumers reacted angrily when the government cut spending on energy subsidies in mid-2014, a measure that caused domestic prices of natural gas, diesel and other fuels to rise by as much as 78 percent.\n\"Most of the savings in petroleum product subsidies will be a result of lower global oil prices,\" the deputy minister, Ahmed Kojak, told Reuters."}
