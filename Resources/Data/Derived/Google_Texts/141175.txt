COLUMBIA — It’s going to begin to look a lot like Christmas at the Statehouse on Monday when the state’s Christmas tree arrives on the grounds.

For the tenth year, Bruce Vollnogle, owner of TimberTech in Greer, will deliver the 35-foot white fir from Pinetum Christmas Tree Farm in Swanton, Md., to the Statehouse. It’s expected to arrive at 9 a.m.

For the rest of the week, South Carolina Electric & Gas crews will string 10,000 LED lights as members from Columbia Garden Club and Garden Club of South Carolina assist in hanging 900 ornaments.

Pinetum owners Marshall and Cindy Stacy own a vacation house in the Lowcountry and decided to donate the tree this year in light of the historic flooding that hit the state last month.

Gov. Nikki Haley will light the tree during a ceremony the evening of Nov. 30.
