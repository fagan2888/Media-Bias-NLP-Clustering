BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) — Dave Chappelle’s return to the comedy stage comes at a racially charged time in the U.S., but the comedian, who never shied away from racial issues, says that’s just a coincidence.

“I think it is important to be out now, but what’s going on in the world isn’t why I initially came back out,” Chappelle told The Associated Press on Saturday. He was on Long Island at the Art For Life benefit, where he received an award from Russell Simmons’ Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation.

“This is a very surprisingly emotionally charged time, so people like me, I think, are very relevant and necessary in sorting through all this information and emotional content,” he said. “And when we are at our best, hopefully we are doing a great service to many people.”

During his acceptance speech Chappelle said the arts education he received in high school in Washington, D.C., saved him.
