Days after Starbucks announced the ritual switch from white cups to red that signals the traditional end of Pumpkin Spice season \u2014 complete with custom emoji and everything \u2014 the paranoid culture warriors found this season\u2019s cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. This year\u2019s #redcups are just that \u2014 red cups, vaguely reminiscent of the lowly Solo cup, even, stripped of decoration other than the ubiquitous Starbucks logo. And people are pissed.\n\nNot just any people, of course, but the people who readily share videos on Facebook posted by a guy named Joshua Feuerstein. If you were thinking that it was time the Christian right found its very own Guy Fieri, wait no longer. Feuerstein\u2019s a professional fundamentalist Christian social media evangelist \u2014 sure, that\u2019s a thing \u2014 specializing in carefully-orchestrated videos designed to go viral like \u201cDear Mr. Atheist \u2026 allow me to destroy evolution in 3 minutes!\u201d Feuerstein, who is quite a bit rougher around the edges than your average Duggar, sports a kind of Fred Durstian throwback bro-aesthetic to go with his incredibly shallow sense of where faith and public life should and could intersect. And now he\u2019s taking Starbucks down, because the coffee chain had the audacity to eschew the \u201cwinter seasonal\u201d graphic designs that decorated red cups in previous years in favor of a simpler look.\n\nWhere have the snowmen and reindeer of yesteryear gone? Why does Starbucks hate Jesus?!\n\nIn a video that has been viewed more than 7 million times at this time, Feuerstein opens with a little joke that he\u2019s hoping will get him a job on the Trump campaign: \u201cI think in the age of political correctness we\u2019ve become so open minded our brains have literally fallen out of our head. Did you realize Starbucks wanted to take CHRIST and Christmas off of their brand new cups? That\u2019s why they\u2019re just plain red.\u201d\n\nFeuerstein continues: \u201cIn fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn\u2019t allowed to say Merry Christmas to customers?\u201d Shots. Fired. \u201cI decided instead of boycotting, why don\u2019t we start a movement?\u201d St. Paul would be proud, bro.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to this guy, Starbucks went too far when they debuted a plain red cup this season", "author": "Erin Keane", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "According to this guy, Starbucks went too far when they debuted a plain red cup this season", "title": "#MerryChristmas Starbucks!
