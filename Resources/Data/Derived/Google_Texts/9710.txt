While everyone’s howling at the moon these days about health insurance, a certain voluntary benefit no longer resembles that lonely puppy with sad eyes in the pet store that gets passed over by customer after customer.

The benefit is pet insurance, which continues to grow in popularity with employees — and employers — around the country and at companies both large and small.
