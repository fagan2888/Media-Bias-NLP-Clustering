Giuliani accused Obama of always criticizing and apologizing for the United States and never defending the country or extolling its \u201cexceptional values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe that the president loves America. He doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me. He wasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country.\u201d\n\nReacting to Giuliani\u2019s statement, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he felt \u201csorry\u201d for the former mayor and that he had tarnished his legacy by making the statement.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today. It\u2019s sad to see when somebody who\u2019s attained a certain level of public stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly.\u201d\n\nGuiliani\u2019s critics, including Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, described his statement as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d Speaking on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Robinson said that Giuliani, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008, committed a \u201cstrategic blunder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Mayor, It is racist, and it sounds, frankly, kind of unhinged. This is a President who was elected twice, with more than 50 percent of the popular vote both times. Just as politics, it seems crazy to me.\u201d\n\nRecalling the fact that Giuliani ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008, other critics, such as Jay Smooth, writing on the website Fusion, argue that Giuliani\u2019s statement was a calculated act of political demagoguery with a white American target audience.\n\nIn Smooth\u2019s analysis, Giuliani\u2019s statement that he doubts that \u201cObama loves America\u201d and that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t love you, and he doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d was dog whistle political talk that can be decoded, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love white America; he doesn\u2019t love us white folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember him, right? The one who crashed and burned trying to court you in 2008? The one whose online profile seemed so charming until you met him in person? That\u2019s right, he\u2019s back. Whispering in your ear about how you\u2019re the most beautiful, exceptional country, and that tall, dark, possibly socialist stranger you\u2019re with now will never love you like old Rudy can.\u201d\n\nBut as critics point out, even Giuliani himself admitted that his suggestion that \u201cObama does not love America\u201d was a \u201chorrible thing to say.\u201d So liberal critics ask: Why are conservatives defending a man who has admitted that his statement was a \u201chorrible thing to say\u201d?\n\nHowever, Giuliani responded to accusations that his comment was racist, saying that it couldn\u2019t be racist because Obama \u201cwas brought up by a white mother, a white grandfather, went to white schools, and most of the time he learned from white people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people thought it was racist \u2014 I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother, a white grandfather, went to white schools, and most of this he learned from white people. This isn\u2019t racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.\u201d\n\nHow do you react to the argument that Giuliani was playing dog whistle politics when he said he doubts that Obama loves America, and that \u201che [Obama] doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me\u201d?\n\n[Image: Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Wednesday, at a private fundraiser dinner in New York City, that he does not believe President Obama loves", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Wednesday, at a private fundraiser dinner in New York City, that he does not believe President Obama loves", "title": "\u2018Obama Doesn\u2019t Love America\u2019 \u2013 Was Giuliani Blowing The Same Old Racist Dog Whistle?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1864385/obama-doesnt-love-america-was-giuliani-blowing-the-same-old-racist-dog-whistle/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/giuliani2.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T09:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T09:25:01+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/giuliani2.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-02-22T09:00:40+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "dog whistle,giuliani,racist,rudy giuliani,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/giuliani2.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Wednesday, at a private fundraiser dinner in New York City, that he does not believe President Obama loves"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a06\"", "article_summary": "In Smooth\u2019s analysis, Giuliani\u2019s statement that he doubts that \u201cObama loves America\u201d and that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t love you, and he doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d was dog whistle political talk that can be decoded, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love white America; he doesn\u2019t love us white folks.\u201d\u201cYou remember him, right?\nThis is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.\u201dHow do you react to the argument that Giuliani was playing dog whistle politics when he said he doubts that Obama loves America, and that \u201che [Obama] doesn\u2019t love you.\nHe doesn\u2019t love you.\nAnd he doesn\u2019t love me\u201d?\nAnd he doesn\u2019t love me."}
