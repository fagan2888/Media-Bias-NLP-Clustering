The manager of a local Bank of America branch suggested Richard Nixon, a lawyer and Navy veteran. Hoover and his son Herbert Jr. traveled to Pasadena to meet this promising young man and urge him to run for the House of Representatives. Nixon would always remember the meeting fondly and revere the former president for his role in jump-starting his career.\n\nNixon won his first campaign by ousting Congressman Jerry Voorhis, the idealistic Social Gospeler and former Socialist who, as a supporter of striking lettuce workers, had been menaced by angry vigilantes in front of an El Centro hotel in 1934. Nixon painted Voorhis as a stooge of labor unions and the Soviet Union. He repeatedly denounced him for his supposed alliance with the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and its \u201ccommunist principles.\u201d It did not matter to Nixon that Voorhis had written a tough Communist registration law in 1940, or that the CIO Political Action Committee had actually refused to endorse Voorhis. \u201cMr. Nixon had to win. Nothing else would do at all,\u201d Voorhis wrote later.\n\nNixon admitted privately that he misrepresented his opponent\u2019s beliefs, but he made no apologies for doing so. \u201cOf course, I knew that Jerry Voorhis wasn\u2019t a Communist,\u201d he told one of Voorhis\u2019s aides. But political candidates, he said, needed to play rough sometimes. \u201cThe important thing is to win,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou\u2019re just being nai\u0308ve.\u201d Nixon enjoyed support from the same California business interests that helped defeat Upton Sinclair in 1934. Oil companies, movie studios, and agribusiness conglomerates were among his biggest backers. Grower Robert Di Giorgio contributed to Nixon\u2019s earliest campaigns, while Philip Bancroft and a friend formed \u201cFarmers for Nixon\u201d to help funnel agribusiness money to him.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times, a longtime enemy of California liberals and radicals, championed Nixon\u2019s career from the beginning. The Times\u2019s political editor, Kyle Palmer, believed that he saw the potential for national greatness in the Orange County native. Nixon understood that portraying Democrats as dupes and traitors could help put the Republicans back in power.\n\nOnce in office, Congressman Nixon served on the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he played a major role in the exposure of an actual Communist spy. Alger Hiss, the one-time nemesis of the growers at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, was investigated by the committee and ultimately convicted of perjury for denying that he had been part of an underground Communist group in the 1930s. Journalist Whittaker Chambers swore that Hiss had been a spy as well as a secret Red. Much later, documents from the former Soviet Union confirmed that Hiss had indeed passed information to the Communists while working in various government agencies, including the State Department.\n\nThe conviction of Hiss, a New Dealer known for his public support of farmworkers in the 1930s and international institutions in the 1940s, gave conservatives ammunition for their charge that the New Deal was, at its core, a Communist project.\n\nOpponents of Hiss from his days at the AAA were thrilled by news of his conviction. \u201cTime has caught up with our enemies,\u201d chortled one cotton grower to another. Herbert Hoover felt vindicated. \u201cAt last the stream of treason that existed in our Government has been exposed in a fashion that all may believe,\u201d he wrote Nixon. After the Hiss case, conservatives recognized Nixon as \u201cAMERICA\u2019S GREATEST ENEMY OF COMMUNISM,\u201d according to a flyer advertising one of his speeches.\n\nNixon continued to battle against real and imagined Communists and their alleged liberal enablers when he ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1950. In a television commercial for his race against Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, he promised voters that he would \u201crepresent you and your interests in Washington and not the half-baked theories of left-wing intellectuals at pinko cocktail parties.\u201d He labeled Douglas the \u201cpink lady\u201d; she called him \u201cTricky Dick.\u201d\n\nDouglas had no idea how tricky Nixon could be. Years later, in 1962, the California attorney general seized General Van Deman\u2019s secret files in San Diego, saying they had been used \u201cby unauthorized persons for political purposes.\u201d Democrats charged that the unauthorized persons worked for Nixon, and their purposes had been to smear Voorhis in 1946 and Douglas in 1950. These charges were never proven, but left-liberal California Democrats continued to view him as a reckless and sinister Red-baiter.\n\nAs Nixon rose from senator to vice president, he fulfilled the dreams of Hoover and other business conservatives who had chosen him back in 1946. When Vice President Nixon won reelection in 1956, Hoover congratulated him and expressed his sense of personal satisfaction. \u201cEver since our interview in Pasadena years ago when I added my urging that you should run for Congress,\u201d he wrote Nixon in a private letter, \u201cI have grown stronger and stronger in my belief in your immense value to the American people. And they have now shown their full acceptance of that view.\u201d\n\nHoover also grew stronger in his belief that the Democratic Party tolerated and even nurtured treasonous ideas. In 1960, as GOP presidential nominee Nixon prepared for a debate against John F. Kennedy, Hoover wrote Nixon that Kennedy\u2019s goals were \u201cevil.\u201d To left-liberals, Kennedy\u2019s policies of tax cuts, increased spending on defense, and indifference (at the time) to civil rights seemed to put him at the center or even slightly to the right on the political spectrum. But to Hoover, Kennedy\u2019s agenda was nothing more than \u201csocialism disguised as a \u2018welfare state.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNixon\u2019s top aides, who followed him to the White House, learned their craft in California\u2019s culture of frenzied Red-baiting. Murray Chotiner, a prote\u0301ge\u0301 of Clem Whitaker and known for his mantra of \u201cattack, attack, attack, and never defend,\u201d served as Nixon\u2019s consultant or manager for most of his campaigns from 1946 through 1972. His fellow UCLA graduates John Ehrlichman and Bob Haldeman\u2014the latter the grandson of a founder of the anti-Red group Better America Federation\u2014worked on Nixon\u2019s unsuccessful 1960 run for the presidency and later became his chief advisers when he won the White House eight years later.\n\nAlong with his virulent anticommunism, Nixon\u2019s attention to the politics of image marked him as a California product. With its weak party system, fondness for Hollywood glitz, and rootless, diverse residents, the state helped nurture a style of campaigning that emphasized appearance over substance. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve got isn\u2019t a party,\u201d a Democratic official told Theodore White in 1956. \u201cIt\u2019s a star system, it\u2019s a studio lot. They don\u2019t run candidates\u2014they produce them, like movie heroes.\u201d Nixon was one of the first politicians to \u201cembrace the new tools of political artistry\u201d and \u201cfoster our current image-obsessed political culture,\u201d as historian David Greenberg has said. Nixon and his public relations staff created an image of the candidate as a \u201cpopulist everyman\u201d and helped to unite the wealthy with the disaffected middle classes in a broad, successful coalition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The roots of our modern nightmarish politics can be found in Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon's early campaigns", "title": "Fox News, liberal-baiting and the politics of populist fear: Here\u2019s where it all began", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The roots of our modern nightmarish politics can be found in Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon's early campaigns", "title": "Fox News, liberal-baiting and the politics of populist fear: Here\u2019s where it all began", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/28/fox_news_liberal_baiting_and_the_politics_of_populist_fear_heres_where_it_all_began/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/ronald_reagan_10.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The roots of our modern nightmarish politics can be found in Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon's early campaigns", "title": "Fox News, liberal-baiting and the politics of populist fear: Here\u2019s where it all began", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/ronald_reagan_10.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kathryn S.
