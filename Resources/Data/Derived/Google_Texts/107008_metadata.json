Getting in fights with the most valuable player in the National League doesn\u2019t strike me as a team-building exercise,\u201d he asserted.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBack in September Papelbon, a relief pitcher for the Nats, heckled teammate and eventual 2015 NL MVP Bryce Harper for not hustling down the line after hitting a lazy pop fly out. The razzing turned to skirmishing and Papelbon began choking Harper.\n\nThe Nationals suspended the 35-year-old right-handed reliever for his actions. Papelbon, joined by the MLBPA, subsequently filed a grievance against the Nationals. Yahoo Sports reported that the Nats owe Papelbon $11 million in 2016. A hearing on the matter is expected in the spring.\n\nThe senior senator from Kentucky found time to talk baseball on a Tuesday despite his busy schedule. McConnell opined on what the team needs to do during the off season and how they can turn things around to make the playoffs next year.\n\n\u201cI think they need a solid, good-hitting outfielder because Jayson Werth is getting older and not playing many games anymore. We could use another starter, although I think this young guy Lucas Giolito in the minors may be the answer to Jordan Zimmermann\u2019s departure.\u201d\n\nMcConnell added that he sometimes gets to watch the games with top political pundits George Will and Charles Krauthammer. He admitted, \u201cthey know a lot more about [baseball] than I do\u2014and a lot more about other things than I do.\u201d\n\nBefore last season some predicted that the Nationals would win over 100 games and dominate the National League. Instead they finished barely above .500 (83-79) and failed to make the playoffs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the Washington Nationals disappointing 2015 season at the Politico Playbook breakfast.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the Washington Nationals disappointing 2015 season at the Politico Playbook breakfast.", "title": "Mitch McConnell Talks Nats Baseball: \u2018Get Rid of Jonathan Papelbon\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_mitch-mcconnell_ap-photo2-wi.jpg", "height": 853}, "updated_time": "2015-12-15T18:43:47-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/16/mitch-mcconnell-talks-nats-baseball-get-rid-of-jonathan-papelbon/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the Washington Nationals disappointing 2015 season at the Politico Playbook breakfast.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_mitch-mcconnell_ap-photo2-wi.jpg", "title": "Mitch McConnell Talks Nats Baseball: \u2018Get Rid of Jonathan Papelbon\u2019", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "bryce harper, jonathan papelbon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Washington Nationals,Big Government, Breitbart Sports,Mitch McConnell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-16T00:01:30-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T18:43:47-07:00", "tag": "Washington Nationals", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart Sports"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cdb\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the Washington Nationals\u2019 disappointing 2015 season at a Monday Politico breakfast.\nYahoo Sports reported that the Nats owe Papelbon $11 million in 2016.\n\u201cI think they need a solid, good-hitting outfielder because Jayson Werth is getting older and not playing many games anymore.\nGetting in fights with the most valuable player in the National League doesn\u2019t strike me as a team-building exercise,\u201d he asserted.\nThe senior senator from Kentucky found time to talk baseball on a Tuesday despite his busy schedule."}
