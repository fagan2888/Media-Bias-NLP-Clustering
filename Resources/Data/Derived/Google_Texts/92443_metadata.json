McGuigan | Oklahoma Watchdog\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Oklahoma Commissioner of Insurance John D. Doak says individual health insurance premium rates in the state will jump dramatically in the coming year because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe estimate from the state Department of Insurance is based on filings from insurance firms selling health policies in the Sooner State.\n\n\u201cOur fears have been confirmed,\u201d Doak said. \u201cFor some consumers, the cost of health insurance will increase significantly. This is more proof that ObamaCare will hurt Oklahoma families and businesses. I continue to support Attorney General Scott Pruitt\u2019s lawsuit to overturn this overreaching and potentially disastrous federal law.\u201d\n\nPruitt is a leading national critic of ACA implementation. Under his direction the state has filed a lawsuit challenging many provisions of the law, including the Internal Revenue Service rules punishing \u201clarge employers\u201d \u2014 including governments \u2014 with penalties if exchanges are not created within a state.\n\nOklahoma is one of 34 states challenging ACA, also known as Obamacare.\n\nWhile actual rates for individuals will vary depending on factors such as age, location and tobacco use, the projected cost hikes will include both new policies in 2014 and renewal policies, due to ObamaCare.\n\nDoak said the increased rates are driven by several factors, including:\n\nThe morbidity factor or market risk of guaranteed-issue entrants with no annual or lifetime limits;\n\nThe incorporation of Essential Health Benefits to make plans ACA compliant;\n\nTaxes and fees being passed through the rates to the consumer.\n\nFrank Stone, chief actuary for the state agency, said, \u201cFrom an actuarial standpoint, this confirms the obvious. Insurers must increase their premiums due to the additional requirements of ObamaCare,\u201d said Frank Stone, the chief actuary for the state agency.\n\nIn the small group market, the rate hike will range from 10-25 percent, Stone said.\n\nDoak\u2019s staff pointed out that consumers may not have to pay the full premium because of federal tax credit subsidies. As Doak pointed out, the subsidies create \u201cadditional hidden cost to Oklahoma taxpayers.\u201d\n\nContact Patrick McGuigan, bureau chief for the Watchdog.org network in Oklahoma City, at Patrick@CapitolBeatOK.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "By Patrick B.
