Champ Bailey, the former Bronco and 12-time Pro Bowler who was released by the Saints last weekend, worked out with the Detroit Lions on Thursday, The National Football Post reported.

The 36-year-old was released by the Broncos in March primarily for financial reasons, and he dealt with a foot injury that kept him out of the first two preseason games with New Orleans. His game has waned in recent years, but he is still widely regarded as one of the best cornerbacks in history and seems a Hall-of-Fame lock.

Bailey’s younger brother, Rodney “Boss” Bailey, was drafted by the Lions in the second round of the 2003 draft and played four full seasons as a linebacker in Detroit before signing with the Broncos in 2008. Boss’ career ended when he was released in 2009.

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport confirmed the news of Bailey’s workout in Detroit, adding that it went well but that no deal is imminent.

The #Lions sounded like they liked Champ Bailey’s workout, that it went well. Source tells me no signing imminent, though. — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 4, 2014
