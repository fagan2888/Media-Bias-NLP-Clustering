One round hit Flores.\n\nFlores was treated at Denver Health Medical Center for the wound and released the same day.\n\nStovall, a 14-year-veteran of the sheriff\u2019s office and a ten year SWAT officer, used \u201cverbal commands before the physical force\u201d before the incident in an attempt to apprehend Flores, the letter said.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that Deputy Stovall had his finger on the trigger during the incident,\u201d investigators said. \u201cIt is evident that an object other than Deputy Stovall\u2019s finger pulled the trigger during the struggle.\n\n\u201cBecause there was no evidence that Deputy Stovall made a conscious decision or failed to perceive a risk that resulted in the injury, there will be no filing of criminal charges against him,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is clear that this all happened in a matter of seconds and (Stovall) did not have time to activate the safety on his rifle before going hands on with Mr. Flores.\u201d\n\nThe 17th Judicial District Critical Incident Team investigated the incident and presented its finding to the DA\u2019s Office.\n\nInvestigators found three bags of cocaine, weighing a combined 376 grams, a loaded 9mm handgun and and $2,300 in the residence.\n\nFlores was free on a $250,000 bond pending sentencing for a felony conviction in Denver involving a drive-by shooting when the officer involved shooting occurred.\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "SWAT member cleared in Adams County officer-involved shooting", "title": "SWAT member cleared in Adams County officer-involved shooting", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/03/swat-member-cleared-in-adams-county-officer-involved-shooting/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T15:33:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-03T15:33:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "An Adams County SWAT officer did not commit a criminal act during an incident this spring in which a drug suspect was shot in the thigh, according to the Adams County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\nFlores was free on a $250,000 bond pending sentencing for a felony conviction in Denver involving a drive-by shooting when the officer involved shooting occurred.\nThe shooting happened on May 17 when SWAT officers executed a non-knock search warrant at 8510 Corona St., according to investigators.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that Deputy Stovall had his finger on the trigger during the incident,\u201d investigators said.\nA physical struggle between SWAT officers and Flores ensued and Adams County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Jeff Stovall\u2019s M16 rifle, which was set on \u201cfull automatic,\u201d discharged a three-round burst."}
