Saturday 1st March 2014





A car dealer who was reported to Derbyshire County Council trading standards, has received a hefty fine for selling a car that was unworthy to be on the road.



At a hearing at Chesterfield Magistrates Court on Thursday 27th February, Carl Matthew Herring, 33, of Peak Close, Pilsley, pleaded guilty to charges relating to the sale of a used car.



A customer who bought the 'N' registered Peugeot 106 from the defendant's garage, complained to Derbyshire County Council trading standards officers after a mechanic found a number of faults with it.



The council's consultant automotive engineer confirmed that the car was not safe to drive and officers pressed charges against the defendant.



Herring also broke the law by attempting to restrict the customer's rights by using the expression, "Trade sale - Sold as seen."



Any second hand car buyer has legal rights which cannot be restricted - the car must be as described and free from defects bearing in mind its age and condition.



Derbyshire County Council Cabinet Member for Health and Communities Councillor Dave Allen, (left), said: "It's a good day for motorists when a trader who is prepared to sell dangerous vehicles is held to account.



"I'm just relieved that the customer took sensible steps to check the condition of the car before risking lives on the road.



"We always take action when used car buyers report serious defects that compromise the safety of drivers and other road users."



The defendant who formerly traded as CMH Motors Unstone, was ordered to pay £550 compensation as well as a £110 fine and £500 costs.



The county council has published a guide to motorists' consumer rights which is available to download at www.derbyshire.gov.uk/consumeradvice
