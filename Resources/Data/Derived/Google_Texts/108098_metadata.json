We take it very seriously. A lot of families may have issues with punishment and the whipping of the children. We know the difference between maybe a red mark that may occur from a spanking as opposed to bruising and things and in different areas than just the bottom.\"\n\n\n\nMs. Baughman is also employed at her husband's Promise Pediatrics in Ringgold.\n\n\n\nAttorneys Adam Cathey and John Robert Wiggins issued this statement in behalf of the Baughmans:.\n\n\n\nThis release is being written in response to recent media reports regarding our clients, Dr. Henry Baughman and his wife, Ms. Christine Baughman:\n\nOn Nov. 25, 2014, Dr. and Ms. Baughman were contacted by Catoosa County child protection and law enforcement authorities. At that time, Dr. and Ms. Baughman were informed of allegations having been made by an unknown third party regarding their son. Notwithstanding their full compliance with the investigation, Ms. Baughman was hastily arrested at 10:00 p.m. that evening. While the charges made against Ms. Baughman appear very serious, she wants to assure the community that she is innocent of these allegations that have been made against her.\n\nThe Baughman family remains supportive of their wife and mother during this very stressful time. They trust that as more light is cast upon this situation, her innocence will become apparent. With that in mind, however, the Baughmans understand that there is a process that must be followed in order to ensure the safety of all involved. They remain committed to working with local authorities to resolve this situation.\n\nAs these matters will pose challenges for the Baughman family for the indefinite future, they desire the continued trust of the local community which they have enjoyed for nearly 15 years.\n\nDr. and Ms. Baughman will not respond personally to any media inquiries at this time. All questions may be directed to their respective counsel: Adam C. Cathey on behalf of Christine Baughman and John Robert Wiggins on behalf of Dr. Henry Baughman.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2014/12/3/289682/Wife-Of-Ringgold-Pediatric-Physician.aspx", "article": {"section": "Breaking News", "published_time": "2014-12-04T00:52:56.1602283Z", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T00:59:51.2035493Z"}, "type": "article", "title": "Wife Of Ringgold Pediatric Physician Faces Child Abuse Charge"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0eb0\"", "article_summary": "Wednesday, December 3, 2014The wife of a Ringgold pediatric physician is facing a child cruelty charge for allegedly abusing her own adopted 11-year-old son.\nNotwithstanding their full compliance with the investigation, Ms. Baughman was hastily arrested at 10:00 p.m. that evening.\nMs. Baughman is also employed at her husband's Promise Pediatrics in Ringgold.\nDr. and Ms. Baughman will not respond personally to any media inquiries at this time.\nAt that time, Dr. and Ms. Baughman were informed of allegations having been made by an unknown third party regarding their son."}
