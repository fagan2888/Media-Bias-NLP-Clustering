(Then the story gets a little weird, noting, \u201cAmong other things, she believes most women are likely to have sex with their husbands or partners more frequently when they get more help at home \u2014 a phenomenon she has branded as \u2018choreplay.\u2019 \u201d)\n\n\n\nJames, Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry and other basketball players will deliver \u201cLean In\u201d messages in public service announcements aired during NBA games over the next few months.\n\n\n\nBloomberg notes that LeanIn.org is using #LeanInTogether to drive discussion on social media.\n\n\n\nThe campaign, its promotional literature states, \u201cwill emphasize how men benefit from supporting women at home and at work\u2014happier marriages, more successful children, and better team outcomes\u2014and provide practical information on how men can do their part.\u201d\n\n\n\nBloomberg says it furnishes a lifestyle magazine\u2019s worth of practical, downloadable tips for \u201cMen at Work, Men at Home, and Managers,\u201d as well as videos on \u201cGetting to 50/50,\u201d developed in conjunction with Stanford\u2019s Institute for Gender Studies.\n\n\n\nRachel Thomas, the co-founder and president of LeanIn.Org, tells Bloomberg that there\u2019s no way \u201cwe can get to true equality if men don\u2019t actively participate.\u201d She says that \u201cwomen face pushback when they take the lead, and men often face pushback when they nurture,\u201d and that we need to twist that around.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and that\n\nHey, good lookin\u2019: Downtown Cleveland looks mighty sharp in a new ad campaign launched by the Horseshoe Cleveland Casino.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign launched this week on television and soon will launch on radio, billboards and in print. The TV spot features gorgeous images of downtown nightlife set to the sounds of Petula Clark\u2019s 1964 hit \u201cDowntown.\u201d Stern Advertising of Cleveland created the campaign.Here\u2019s the TV spot:Politico.com notes that four-and-a-half months after its original publication, the Associated Press \u201chas issued corrections to an article in which it misconstrued remarks made by Ohio Gov. John Kasich .\u201dThe AP story, published Oct. 20, 2014, \u201cquoted the Ohio Republican saying he did not believe the Affordable Care Act would be repealed if Republicans took control of the Senate,\u201d Politico.com says.Kasich, however, had been referring to the expansion of Medicaid.\"When he said he thought 'it' would not be repealed, the AP initially understood him to be referring to the entire health care law, known formally as the Affordable Care Act, since Medicaid expansion is part of that law and not a separate piece of legislation,\" the AP reported on Wednesday. \"Kasich later told the AP he had been referring only to the expansion of Medicaid. The AP's initial story should have made this distinction.\"Paul Colford, director of media relations for the Associated Press, wouldn\u2019t comment to Politico.com on why it took the AP so long to correct the story. \"We're going to let the clarification speak for itself,\" he said.A Cleveland band played a key role in the development of the highly regarded record label Carpark Records , according to this Washington Post profile of the company.The Post says Carpark Records, founded in Manhattan in 1999 but now based in Washington, \u201chas had quite a 16-year run, helping break the careers of indie mainstays like Beach House, Toro y Moi and Dan Deacon.\u201dIn addition to albums from those three, The Post says one of Carpark\u2019s most influential releases was \u201cAttack on Memory,\u201d the 2012 album from Cleveland\u2019s Cloud Nothings From the story:After two releases of bratty, bouncy lo-fi \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cTurning On\u201d (reissued on Carpark in 2010) and 2011\u2019s self-titled album \u2014 the Cleveland band embraced a grittier punk sound with \u201cAttack,\u201d a record that helped contextualize its live sound. \u201cI drove out to see them (perform) in Virginia in 2010 and I thought they were awesome,\u201d (founder Todd) Hyman says. \u201cSo much energy. After that [show] I asked if we could work together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In campaign hopes to persuade men they'll be better off financially and emotionally if they take more responsibility for housework and child care, while also backing equal rights for women at work.
