Starts treaded water in the latest month, which is unusual given CMD\u2019s long-term May-to-June gain, due to seasonality, of 4.5%.\n\nJune\u2019s month-to-month inertia was a pause after May\u2019s extraordinary 37.3% leap. May included a couple of mega-sized project groundbreakings, the likes of which weren\u2019t repeated in June.\n\nYear-to-date starts in 2015 have also been -1% relative to the same January-to-June period of last year. Compared with its counterpart month last year, standalone June in 2015 was -4.8%.\n\nThe starts figures throughout this report are not seasonally adjusted (NSA). Nor are they adjusted for inflation. They are expressed in what are termed \u2018current\u2019 as opposed to \u2018constant\u2019 dollars.\n\n\u2018Nonresidential building\u2019 plus \u2018engineering/civil\u2019 work accounts for a considerably larger share of total construction than residential activity. The former\u2019s combined proportion of total put-in-place construction in the Census Bureau\u2019s May report was 63%; the latter\u2019s was 37%.\n\nCMD\u2019s construction starts are leading indicators for the Census Bureau\u2019s capital investment or put-in-place series. Also, the reporting period for starts (i.e., June 2015) is one month ahead of the reporting period for the investment series (i.e., May 2015.)\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment in the U.S. construction sector also stayed flat in June relative to May. The year-over-year increase, however, has been a more-than-respectable 259,000 jobs. The first half of 2015 has contributed 105,000 net new positions.\n\nTotal non-farm employment nationwide has been 2.1% year over year. Construction\u2019s increase has been exactly twice as fast, 4.2%. The unemployment rate in construction is currently 6.3% (not seasonally adjusted), a decline of almost two percentage points from last year\u2019s 8.2% in the same month.\n\nBefore there can be on-site construction activity, projects must be contemplated and planned by owners and rendered into working drawings by design professionals. In June, the year-over-year rise in architectural and engineering services employment maintained a strong pace, 3.6%.\n\nMonth to month in June, the commercial (14.8%) and institutional (10.9%) type-of-structure categories recorded increases in starts. They were offset by engineering\u2019s decline (-8.5%).\n\nIndustrial starts also dropped, by half (-50.5%), but this category of work plays a smaller role in the total. There were no industrial project starts in June equivalent to the initiation of work on Tesla Motors\u2019 Nevada battery gigafactory in May, carrying an estimated value of $2 billion. Although that\u2019s not to slight a $1 billion start on a methanol plant in St. James, La.\n\nWhen this year\u2019s individual month of June is compared with the same month last year, the sub-category percentage changes are muted. Institutional work advanced (2.6%), but the heavy engineering/civil category declined (-1.1%), as did commercial (-2.2%).\n\nThe smaller category of industrial starts took a nosedive (-54.8%). Industrial percentage changes are often highly variable depending on the presence, or absence, of a large project or two.\n\nWith respect to year-to-date starts, heavy engineering (10.2%) has been \u2018riding point\u2019. Institutional (-12.9%) and commercial (-9.4%) have been less eager to keep up.\n\nIndustrial (61.2%) year-to-date starts are a source of encouragement.\n\nWithin engineering starts, the biggest subcategory by far is road/highway work. In June, it was -4.1% month to month (m/m) and only 0.8% when compared with the same month of last year (y/y); but it was an expansive 14.4% through this year\u2019s first half versus last year\u2019s (ytd).\n\nNext most important in engineering, water/sewage starts were also so-so in the individual month of June (0.1% m/m and -4.9% y/y), but more promising on an accumulated basis (6.2% ytd).\n\nAs for institutional, the year-to-date dollar volume of educational facility starts is currently five times greater than for health care projects. School/college starts in June were 5.3% m/m; -14.1% y/y; and -8.5% ytd. So far this year, in contrast to college/universities (-13.1% ytd) and junior/senior high schools (-20.2% ytd), elementary/pre-schools have been upbeat (11.5% ytd).\n\nHospital/clinic starts surged in the individual month of June (29% m/m and 79.6% y/y), but remained lower by one-quarter (-25.4%) year-to-date. The recent Supreme Court ruling to solidify the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides more stability for investment decisions. Besides, employment growth in the health care field is a robust 2.9% year over year.\n\nRetail starts in commercial work leapt forward in June (118.8% m/m; 63.4% y/y; and 2.3% ytd), as did the miscellaneous commercial category (10.7% m/m; 107.8% y/y; and 5.6% ytd). A major subcomponent within the latter is sports/convention centers (67.7% ytd).\n\nElsewhere in commercial, though, there were hiccups. Private office buildings may have been 23.5% m/m, but they were -42.3% y/y and -35.5% ytd. Government office buildings were -8.3% m/m; 6.8% y/y; and -18.6% ytd.\n\nAccording to June\u2019s Employment Situation report from the BLS, construction\u2019s average hourly earnings in June, at 2.4% year over year, modestly outpaced the gain for all sectors, 1.9%. Construction displayed a frothier advance in average weekly earnings, 2.9% versus 1.6%.\n\nThe value of construction starts each month is summarized from CMD\u2019s database of all active construction projects in the U.S. Missing project values are estimated with the help of RSMeans\u2019 building cost models.\n\nCMD\u2019s nonresidential construction starts series, because it is comprised of total-value estimates for individual projects, some of which are mega-sized, has a history of being more volatile than many other leading indicators for the economy.\n\nA \u201cstart\u201d is determined by taking the announced bid date and adding a short time lag (30 to 60 days). CMD continues to follow the project via its network of researchers. If it is abandoned or re-bid, the start date is updated to reflect the new information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The construction industry typically grows from May to June, so it was unusual for construction starts to tread water", "og": {"site_name": "ForConstructionPros.com", "description": "The construction industry typically grows from May to June, so it was unusual for construction starts to tread water", "title": "June Nonresidential Construction Starts Relatively Unchanged", "url": "http://www.forconstructionpros.com/press_release/12093614/june-nonresidential-construction-starts-relatively-unchanged", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://r2.forconstructionpros.com/files/base/FCP/image/2015/07/16x9/1280x720/Screen_Shot_2015_07_17_at_9.47.38_AM.55a9188bddaec.jpg", "height": 720}, "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 101409449906175}, "keywords": "new construction starts, construction economics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The value of construction starts each month is summarized from CMD\u2019s database of all active construction projects in the U.S.\nJune\u2019s $30.3 billion of construction starts, excluding residential work, was almost unchanged versus May, -1%, according to CMD Group.\nCMD\u2019s construction starts are leading indicators for the Census Bureau\u2019s capital investment or put-in-place series.\nCMD\u2019s nonresidential construction starts series, because it is comprised of total-value estimates for individual projects, some of which are mega-sized, has a history of being more volatile than many other leading indicators for the economy.\n\u2018Nonresidential building\u2019 plus \u2018engineering/civil\u2019 work accounts for a considerably larger share of total construction than residential activity."}
