It also approved a package of tax breaks that includes a two-year pause in Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, giving device manufacturers a temporary break from the unpopular tax that many would like to eliminate permanently. The House passed that bill on Thursday.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nThe House passage of the spending bill was always considered the most difficult step, since it needed a combination of Republican and Democratic votes \u2014 due to deep ideological concerns on both sides over other issues. It was uncertain as recently as Thursday that there would be enough votes.\n\nBy Friday, though, it wasn\u2019t a problem. The legislation passed the House on a vote of 316 to 113, with a nearly even split of Republican and Democratic support. Ninety-five Republicans and 18 Democrats voted against it.\n\nThe bill gives NIH a $2 billion increase, including a $350 million increase dedicated to Alzheimer\u2019s research, and it contains $200 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative and an $85 million increase for the BRAIN Initiative. It also includes a $303 million increase for programs to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nIn a statement, NIH director Francis Collins called the funding bill \u201cthe most encouraging budget outcome in 12 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis increase comes at just the right time to take advantage of remarkable opportunities to improve human health, powered by dramatic advances in scientific knowledge and technological innovation,\u201d Collins said.\n\nHere\u2019s how the package breaks down:\n\nMedical device tax: The tax bill would put Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax on hold for two years, as part of a broader package of tax breaks. The change would give medical device makers temporary relief from the 2.3 percent tax on the sales price of medical devices that has been in place since January 2013.\n\nIt\u2019s not the full repeal that medical device manufacturers have been requesting for years, but it\u2019s a small victory for the opponents of the tax \u2014 including most Republicans and some Democrats who represent states with strong medical device industries, like Minnesota and Massachusetts.\n\nResearch tax credit: The tax bill would also make the research and development tax credit permanent, a change that Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the tax-writing Finance Committee, called \u201ca booster shot for the innovation economy in America.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Congress has only managed to keep the tax credit alive through a series of temporary extensions. The credit, which helps companies with increases in research expenses, is expected to cost the federal government $113 billion over 10 years.\n\nGun violence research: House Democrats had made the end of the restrictions on gun violence research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a top priority, but the final spending package leaves the restrictions in place. \u201cToo many times, the Republicans say we can\u2019t make a decision on this because we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said at a press conference last week. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get the data. Lift the ban.\u201d\n\nAccording to a history compiled by the American Psychological Association, the ban stemmed from a 1993 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, which was funded by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention, found that keeping a gun in one\u2019s home led to an increased risk of homicide by a family member or close acquaintance.\n\nThe National Rifle Association launched a public-relations campaign in response to the study, seeking to have the injury-prevention subagency completely eliminated. That didn\u2019t happen, but in 1996 then-Representative Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican, had an amendment inserted into a government spending bill that barred CDC funding from being used for research that \u201cmay be used to advocate or promote gun control.\u201d The spending bill also redirected funding that had previously been used for firearm research.\n\nThe provision has been kept in government spending bills ever since. While it isn\u2019t an explicit prohibition on gun violence studies, it has in effect prevented any government funding from being used for any such research. Dickey said in a letter this month that he \u201cregrets\u201d his role in restricting CDC studies and argued that Congress should \u201cslowly but methodically fund such research.\u201d\n\nE-cigarettes: The legislation dropped a provision to rein in an upcoming Food and Drug Administration regulation on e-cigarettes by limiting its premarket reviews, which are supposed to prove that potentially risky products are safe. The proposal, included in an earlier version of the bill, would have prevented the agency from requiring premarket reviews of any e-cigarettes that are already being sold in stores.\n\nThe provision was part of the House version of the bill, and was added after Republicans complained that the premarket review process is lengthy and bad for businesses. But it comes at a time when the public is convinced that e-cigarettes are bad for people\u2019s health, a view that is driving strong support across party lines for new government regulations.\n\nGenetically engineered salmon: The bill orders the FDA not to allow genetically engineered salmon to be sold until it develops guidelines for labeling it so consumers know what it is.\n\nThe main funding highlights of the bill NIH Current funding: $30 billion\n\nNew funding: $32 billion Precision Medicine Initiative Current: $200 million\n\nNew: $200 million Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Current: $471 million\n\nNew: $774 million CDC Current: $7 billion\n\nNew: $7.2 billion FDA Current: $2.6 billion\n\nNew: $2.7 billion National Science Foundation Current: $7.3 billion\n\nNew: $7.5 billion Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Current: $364 million\n\nNew: $334 million\n\nThis story was updated after President Obama signed the bill into law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers passed\u00a0a\u00a0federal spending bill Friday with the biggest funding increase for the NIH budget in 12 years.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "Lawmakers passed\u00a0a\u00a0federal spending bill Friday with the biggest funding increase for the NIH budget in 12 years.", "title": "Congress clears bill that would increase NIH budget by $2b", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CapitolBuilding_AP-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-09T16:22:50-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/18/nih-increase-congress-vote/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers passed\u00a0a\u00a0federal spending bill Friday with the biggest funding increase for the NIH budget in 12 years.", "creator": "@DavidNather", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CapitolBuilding_AP-1024x576.jpg", "title": "Congress clears bill that would increase NIH budget by $2b", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Politics", "tag": "NIH", "published_time": "2015-12-18T09:53:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T16:22:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "alzheimer\u2019s, congress, nih"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s how the package breaks down:Medical device tax: The tax bill would put Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax on hold for two years, as part of a broader package of tax breaks.\nIt also approved a package of tax breaks that includes a two-year pause in Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, giving device manufacturers a temporary break from the unpopular tax that many would like to eliminate permanently.\nThe Senate cleared the bill on vote of 65 to 33, just hours after the $1.1 trillion bill passed the House.\nPresident Barack Obama signed the massive spending bill into law Friday afternoon, after a day in which Congress moved with unusual speed to approve the legislation that will keep the federal government funded through Oct. 1.\nThe bill gives NIH a $2 billion increase, including a $350 million increase dedicated to Alzheimer\u2019s research, and it contains $200 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative and an $85 million increase for the BRAIN Initiative."}
