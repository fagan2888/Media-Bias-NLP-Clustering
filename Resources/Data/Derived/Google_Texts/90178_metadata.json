Predicting how the justices will rule is an uncertain and ultimately pointless endeavor, but after oral arguments last week, it appears likely that the high court will end up striking down the gay marriage bans. That would represent a huge step forward for gay rights, and the 2016 Republican candidates are split on how they\u2019d react to such a ruling.\n\nRight now there are a few factions within the group of Republican presidential wannabes that are jockeying for position. The first is the \u201crespect the rule of law\u201d faction represented by presumptive candidates John Kasich and Lindsey Graham. Neither seem particularly enthused at the prospect of fighting yet another drawn-out battle over gay marriage, probably because public opinion has swung overwhelmingly in favor of marriage equality over the last decade. And so rather than dig in and make a last stand, they\u2019re encouraging Republicans and conservatives to accept the court\u2019s decision if they strike down the bans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for marriage being defined as between a man and a woman,\u201d Kasich said last week, \u201cif the Supreme Court changes that, those changes have to be respected.\u201d Graham was even more direct, saying that this is just where society is going and that it\u2019s pointless to fight the inevitable. \u201cThings are changing, so at the end of the day, being for traditional marriage without animosity is where I stand,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cIf the Supreme Court rules sometime this year that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, then that will be a defining moment in that debate. It will be time for us to move forward as a society.\u201d\n\nRepresenting the more activist strain of 2016 Republican thinking is Sen. Ted Cruz. If the justices do strike down the gay marriage bans, Cruz wants Republicans and conservatives to use every tool at their disposal to fight back against the \u201clawless\u201d and \u201cfundamentally illegitimate\u201d actions of the high court. This includes a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would leave all marriage decisions exclusively to the states, and a more exotic proposal to have Congress \u201cstrip federal courts of jurisdiction\u201d over same-sex marriage issues.\n\nAnd then there are the aimless dead-enders \u2013 the candidates who think that the Supreme Court can just be ignored if it rules that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional. This faction is represented by two of the newest entrants to the race: Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Carson, since he at least offered something approximating a justification for why elected officials wouldn\u2019t have to adhere to a Supreme Court ruling. Speaking to Newsmax, Carson laid out his view of the Constitution, which allows for the president to simply ignore the courts:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fight? Flee?
