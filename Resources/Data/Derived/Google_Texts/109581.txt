State Representative Matt Gaetz (R–Fort Walton Beach) announced today that he will run for Florida’s 1st Congressional District following the decision of Congressman Jeff Miller to forgo another term.

“Washington’s failures have left the American people with trillions in debt, illegal immigrants sucking us dry, and attacks from Muslim terrorists rising. While I planned to continue serving in the Florida Legislature, the fights we must win to save this country are in Washington. Our Constitution is being ignored, our veterans have been abandoned, and our 2nd Amendment rights are under attack,” said Gaetz in the press announcement.

“When Donald Trump is President, Northwest Florida’s voice in Congress must ring loud and clear for bold, conservative reform. Mine will. Whether it was banning Obamacare-funded abortions, blocking attempts to repeal Stand Your Ground, cutting taxes by over $1 Billion, or supporting military families, I’ve been an effective leader in the Florida House. I’m ready to fight and win for Northwest Florida in Congress,” he continued.

Matt Gaetz is an attorney from Fort Walton Beach and represents portions of Okaloosa County in the Florida House of Representatives. He currently chairs the Finance & Tax Committee.

The press release pushed Gaetz’s conservative record:

Known as one of the most skilled advocates in the Florida Legislature, Gaetz has been referred to as a “Conservative Firebrand” by Saintpetersblog.com and “One of the most pro-gun members to have ever served in the Florida Legislature” by Marion Hammer, past President of the NRA. Gaetz has received top legislative honors from the Florida Sheriffs Association, Florida Police Chiefs Association and Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association. The American Conservative Union deemed Matt Gaetz the “Defender of Liberty.”
