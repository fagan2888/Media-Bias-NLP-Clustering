Output from fracked wells represents 43% of all US oil production and 67% of natural gas production; its oil could reach 10 million bopd by 2016, the Energy Information Administration says.\n\n* The global economy saves $4.9 billion per day in oil spending because of the shale oil boom. Without it there would be a 3 million barrel per day shortfall and prices would likely be 55% higher: $150/barrel.\n\n* Constantly improving hydraulic fracturing technologies continue to increase production. For example, Cabot Oil & Gas refracked a 2013 Pennsylvania well, increasing its output to 30.3 million cubic feet (mcf) of gas per day; that\u2019s four times the output from the best well drilled in 2003. Fracking is even being used in decades-old onshore and offshore wells, to keep them producing for many more years.\n\n* Rust Belt cities and industries \u2013 from manufacturing, real estate and law to hotels, restaurants and many others \u2013 are rebounding because of drilling, fracking and production in nearby shale areas. In Ohio unemployment fell to 5.7% in July from 10.6% four years ago; oil output increased 26% just from the previous quarter, while gas production rose 31% \u2013 generating billions in state and local revenues.\n\n* The US oil and natural gas boom means jobs and business for almost 30,000 companies within the industry\u2019s vast and complex supply chain. Indeed, the petroleum industry accounts for nearly 10 million jobs and almost 8% of all domestic economic activity, including states far from actual drilling activities.\n\n* The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers launched a new website to help veterans and other men and women find high-paying jobs in the booming oilfield, fuel and petrochemical industries.\n\nThere are numerous other benefits, while the alleged risks are exaggerated or even fabricated. So what drives anti-fracking zealots who seem to emerge from under rocks whenever a new project is announced?\n\nFollow the money \u2013 and the ideology. Big Green is big business. The US environmental activist industry alone is a $13.4-billion-a-year operation. It pours that money into determined campaigns to eliminate fossil fuels, gain ever greater control over our lives, reduce our living standards, and end free-enterprise capitalism. It employs clever but phony crises to drive its agenda: catastrophic climate change, unsustainable development, imminent resource depletion, poisonous frack chemicals and dozens of others.\n\nFracking obliterates its claim that we are about to run out of oil and gas \u2013 and so must slash our living standards, spend billions on crony-corporatist \u201crenewable energy\u201d schemes, and put radical green bureaucrats and activists in charge of our lives, livelihoods, living standards and remaining liberties. They are incensed that fracking guarantees a hydrocarbon renaissance and predominance for decades to come. They can\u2019t even bring themselves to acknowledge that \u201cfrack gas\u201d helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nExaggerations and fabrications, confrontations and callous dismissal of other people\u2019s needs are their stock in trade. In angry torrents of outrage and demands for total and totally one-sided precaution, they denounce any suggestion that fracking is safe or beneficial.\n\nWhatever alternative technologies they support comply with their \u201cprecautionary principle.\u201d Whatever they oppose violates it. They trumpet endless alleged risks of using fracking and hydrocarbon technologies, but ignore even the most obvious risks and consequences of not using them.\n\nThey tend to be well-off, and largely clueless about the true sources of modern living standards. They think electricity comes from wall sockets, food from grocery stores, iPhones from Apple Stores. You can count on one hand the number of farmers and utility or factory workers they ever met personally.\n\nThey are callously dismissive about people who are jobless because of their war on affordable energy \u2013 and about poor rural New York families that are barely hanging onto their farms, unable to tap the Marcellus Shale riches beneath their land, because these zealots detest fracking.\n\nThey are equally uncaring about the world\u2019s impoverished billions, whose hope for better lives depends on the reliable, affordable electricity that drilling and fracking can help bring. Worldwide, 1.4 billion people still do not have access to electricity including 300 million in India and 550 million in Africa. Millions die from lung and intestinal diseases that would largely disappear if they had electricity.\n\nWhat the frack is wrong with this picture? This is not the same environmental movement that Ron Arnold, Patrick Moore and I belonged to decades ago. Big Green has become too rich, too powerful, too driven by perverse, inhumane notions of ethics, social responsibility and compassion. Their claims about ethanol and wind power being environment-friendly are just as out of touch with reality.\n\nBut what about their incessant claims that fracking contaminates groundwater and drinking water? Even EPA has not been able to cite a single \u201cproven case where the fracking process itself has affected water.\u201d A September 2013 report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences further confirms this. After carefully examining water wells in heavily fracked areas of Pennsylvania and Texas, researchers concluded that rare cases of methane (natural gas) contamination were not due to fracking.\n\nInstead they resulted from improper cement and pipe installation near the surface, thousands of feet above the frack zone \u2013 a problem that is covered by regulations and is preventable and easy to correct. Petroleum industry and state officials are already collaborating to further strengthen the regulations where necessary, enforce them more vigorously, and improve well completion practices.\n\nMoreover, some of the contamination resulted from water wells being drilled through rock formations that hold naturally occurring methane. Indeed, there have been very few cases of any contamination, out of more than one million wells hydraulically fractured since the first \u201cfrack job\u201d was done in 1947, and out of 20,000 wells fracked in Pennsylvania since the Keystone State\u2019s boom began in 2008.\n\nOf course, none of this is likely to assuage anti-fracking factions or end their fictions. These zealots are driven by motives that have nothing to do with protecting people\u2019s health or environmental quality. In fact, what they advocate would further impair human health and environmental quality.\n\nThe great Irish statesman Edmund Burke could have been talking about these \u201cfracktivists\u201d when he said: \u201cBecause half a dozen grasshoppers make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great cattle \u2026 chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that they are the only inhabitants of the field \u2026 or that they are other than little, shriveled, meager, though loud and troublesome, insects of the hour.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, these definitely loud and troublesome insects have also grown powerful, meddlesome and effective. So fracking supporters must continue to battle the anti-energy ideologues \u2013 by becoming better community organizers and persuaders themselves, to counter the anti-fossil fuel lies and insanity, and the destructive policies, rules and moratoria imposed by ill-advised or ideological politicians and regulators.\n\nWe fracking supporters are clearly on the side of humanity, morality, true sustainability and real environmental progress. We also know that \u2013 no matter how hard eco-activists despise it and rail against it \u2013 they cannot put the fracking genie back in the bottle.\n\nAmerica and the world have awakened to its potential \u2013 and to the critical need for this technology. Let us applaud this incredible progress, and champion it throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and worldwide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They want to end fossil fuels and capitalism, control our lives and impose eco-utopia \r\n.05/25/2016 21:30:59PM EST.", "author": "Paul Driessen", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "They want to end fossil fuels and capitalism, control our lives and impose eco-utopia", "title": "- What Drives Anti-Fracking Zealots?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2014/09/21/what-drives-antifracking-zealots-n1894512", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/9/46a99d8c-e3c7-4d14-9c6d-1e90dcf489ca.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "They want to end fossil fuels and capitalism, control our lives and impose eco-utopia", "title": "- What Drives Anti-Fracking Zealots?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2014/09/21/what-drives-antifracking-zealots-n1894512", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/9/46a99d8c-e3c7-4d14-9c6d-1e90dcf489ca.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "What Drives Anti-Fracking Zealots? , Paul Driessen, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00f3\"", "article_summary": "So what drives anti-fracking zealots who seem to emerge from under rocks whenever a new project is announced?\nMoreover, some of the contamination resulted from water wells being drilled through rock formations that hold naturally occurring methane.\nThey can\u2019t even bring themselves to acknowledge that \u201cfrack gas\u201d helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\nThese zealots are driven by motives that have nothing to do with protecting people\u2019s health or environmental quality.\nOutput from fracked wells represents 43% of all US oil production and 67% of natural gas production; its oil could reach 10 million bopd by 2016, the Energy Information Administration says."}
