A longtime President of Gulf Coast State College passed away Sunday.

Dr. Robert McSpadden started his education at what was then Gulf Coast Junior College in the fall of 1963. He joined the Gulf Coast faculty in 1969 first as a teacher, then administrator.

McSpadden served as president of the college from 1988 until his retirement in 2007. While president, McSpadden was known for his fundraising prowess, elevating Gulf Coast to one of the top 10 most financial stable community colleges in the country.

McSpadden is survived by his wife Bernice, his two daughters Jennifer and Kelly and three grandchildren. He was 71.
