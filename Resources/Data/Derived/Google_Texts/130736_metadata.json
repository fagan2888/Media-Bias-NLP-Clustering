A bold claim from Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude as other nations seem readier to learn lessons from the UK than parts of its own government.\n\nTiming is everything of course.\n\nYesterday we reported that tensions between the UK government\u2019s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and its Government Digital Service (GDS), the body responsible for accelerating digital delivery of services, had resulted in the latter pulling out quickly from the (politely understated) debacle that is the Universal Credit programme.\n\nNow don\u2019t worry. This isn\u2019t another UC article as such. But it\u2019s lovely timing that 24 hours after news broke of the DWP\u2019s decision that it could manage without the help of GDS experts, comes a bravado claim from the Cabinet Office \u2013 GDS\u2019 home \u2013 that the UK government will be the most digital among all the G8 nations \u2013 including the US \u2013 by this time next year.\n\nSo while DWP is footling along with its \u2018twin track\u2019 strategy of clinging to the wreckage of its existing IT spend on UC while attempting to rustle up enough in-house digital expertise to have a stab in that direction, the message is that the rest of central government is moving along quite nicely, thank you very much.\n\nCutting costs\n\nThe \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 agenda was set down by the Cabinet Office with the intention of encouraging and enabling digital delivery of public services across government as the default channel.\n\nBehind this is a need to gouge costs out of the public sector budget with the Cabinet Office arguing that on average, an online service is 20 times cheaper than a phone transaction, 30 times cheaper than by post and 50 times cheaper than face-to-face.\n\nThe Cabinet Office now reckons it\u2019s on track to save a cumulative \u00a31.2 billion by 2015, rising to around \u00a31.7 billion each year after the next General Election which is due in May 2015.\n\nFrom an individual taxpayer\u2019s perspective of course those are enormous numbers that are rendered almost meaningless by their sheer size so the Cabinet Office has supplied some \u2018real\u2019 examples.\n\nFor example, it cites the case of digitising paper-based \u2018lasting power of attorney\u2019, which allows people to appoint someone to take decisions for them if they lose capacity.\n\nDigital efficiencies are passed to customers through reduced application fees with the government able to reduce the cost of this service this year from \u00a3130 to \u00a3110. The first wave of 25 \u201cexemplar\u201d public services \u2013 a list of which can be found here \u2013 will be live online in 2015, supporting an estimated 1.3 million students applying for loans, 46 million people registering to vote and 10 million self-assessing their taxes.\n\nDriving ahead\n\nThe trigger for this latest announcement isn\u2019t the UC debacle of course \u2013 that\u2019s just a coincidence that might raise a right smile or two in corners of the Cabinet Office today \u2013 but the news that the latest public service, driving records, is prepared for public testing online in the next few weeks.\n\nAll of the country\u2019s 40 million drivers will be able to access their licence data online once the service fully launches in June.\n\nDrivers will be able to provide their driving licence number when they apply for insurance, so insurers can check their data and provide accurate quotes, which \u2013 assuming the insurance companies play ball here and pass on the efficiency savings \u2013 should reduce premiums for clean drivers.\n\nOliver Morley, Chief Executive and Digital Leader at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), explains:\n\n\u201cOur aim is to maximise the use of digital to deliver high quality, customer-focussed services that work for everyone. Although some services cannot be delivered digitally, such as assessing a customer\u2019s fitness to drive, we can improve the processes supporting the delivery of these services through making greater use of digital tools.\u201d\n\nAs the 2015 election is now around the corner in political terms, Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, is obviously keen to play up the contribution digital transformation can make to economic recovery:\n\n\u201cOur Digital by Default agenda is part of our long-term economic plan to tackle the deficit we inherited. I\u2019m pleased to announce today that we expect to save at least \u00a3500 million from IT spend this year, on top of the \u00a3500 million we saved from government\u2019s IT spend last year and \u00a3250 million the year before.\n\n\u201cTo win the global race and save hard-working taxpayers more money, we need world-class public services available online 24/7 from anywhere. That\u2019s why it\u2019s great news that DVLA is about to launch online driving records which can be used by anyone with a driving licence as well as by the insurance industry.\u201d\n\nHe ends with a nice plug for the work of GDS and how it can help drive effective digital transformation:\n\n\u201cBack in 2010 our digital offering was limited at best and government IT was a by-word for disaster. \u201cThere are still challenges but with the help of the Government Digital Service I am determined that the UK will be the G8\u2019s most digital government by next year.\u201d\n\nBut did he say it loud enough for it be heard in the bunker over at the DWP?\n\nVerdict\n\nA bold claim \u2013 the most digital government in the G8 by next year. It\u2019s a claim that may well be contested throughout the rest of the G8 of course.\n\nIt would be interesting to know, for example, how responsive the US government will be to Maude flagging up the shortcomings of its IT \u2013 as he did when diginomica met with the minister in December.\n\nYesterday he stated that Washington\u2019s IT services are \u201csome distance behind\u201d the UK and that America had relinquished its role as global leader in digital, citing the Obamacare website as a prime example. Let\u2019s hope the special relationship\u2019 stands up better than the Obamacare website!\n\nBut there\u2019s little doubt that the UK government\u2019s digital agenda is setting a good example for other nations.\n\nWriting in the Guardian this week, Maude highlighted that the New Zealand government is taking its lead from the UK with its Govt.nz single government portal project, that country\u2019s version of the UK\u2019s award-winning GOV.UK. In his article Maude states:\n\nGOV.UK was built for sharing. Most of its code is open source so other countries can use it, rather than having to develop their own. The New Zealand team adapted GOV.UK\u2019s basic design elements, saving time, money and resources.\n\nWhether it will be the most digital government or not, there is clearly a lot of good practice that can be learned from the UK digital strategy and the work of GDS.\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame that overseas officials seem readier to take it on board than certain parties do closer to home\u2026", "article_metadata": {"contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"UK to trump the US as the G8's most digital government?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/diginomica.com\\/2014\\/01\\/09\\/uk-takes-lead-government-boasts-digital-g8\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-09 03:01:11\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-02-16 10:25:19\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":4042,\"author_id\":\"7\",\"author_name\":\"Stuart Lauchlan\",\"author_display_name\":\"Stuart Lauchlan\",\"tags\":[\"Digital by default\",\"Universal Credit\"],\"categories\":[\"Digital government and public services\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/diginomica.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/01\\/g8logo.jpg\"}", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "diginomica", "description": "The UK as the most digital government in the G8 family?
