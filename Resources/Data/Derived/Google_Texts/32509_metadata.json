The report found that while many insurance carriers in California, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey and Texas are covering contraceptives cost-free, some do not fully cover Depo-Provera shots, the OrthoEvra patch, certain types of intrauterine devices or IUDs, and emergency contraception.\n\nWithout coverage, the contraceptives can be expensive. An IUD, for example, costs up to $1,000\u2014which means that without insurance coverage, one of the most effective forms of birth control is unavailable to some of the women who want to use it.\n\n\u201cWe encourage the administration to provide guidance and clarity to insurance companies to ensure all women can access the birth control methods that work for them without cost barriers, as the law intended,\u201d Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.\n\nThe Kaiser report notes that insurance carriers are permitted to limit the forms of birth control they cover under Obamacare, but the companies should still offer leeway to consumers who have a medical need for certain devices, the report found.\n\nThe report also found that despite the widespread attention to the effect the contraceptive mandate would have on religious institutions that oppose birth control, few groups have applied for a religious exception to the law.\n\nRead more: Why You\u2019re Still Paying for Birth Control Even Though It\u2019s \u2018Free\u2019 Now", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds not all birth control is covered without costs or copay", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "A report found that some IUDs and emergency contraceptives are not covered", "title": "Not All Birth Control Covered by Insurance Companies Under Obamacare", "url": "http://time.com/3825544/obamacare-not-all-birth-control-covered-insurance-companies/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/birth-control.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/birth-control.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Not All Birth Control Covered by Insurance Companies Under Obamacare", "description": "A report found that some IUDs and emergency contraceptives are not covered", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "depoprevara, obamacare, hobby lobby, birth control, kaiser family foundation, kaiser report, birth control report, plan b, plan b pill insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Depoprevara, Obamacare, Hobby Lobby, Birth control, Kaiser Family Foundation, Kaiser report, Birth Control report"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde929\"", "article_summary": "Most health insurance companies are offering the free birth control required under the Affordable Care Act, but gaps still remain, according to a new report.\nRead more: Why You\u2019re Still Paying for Birth Control Even Though It\u2019s \u2018Free\u2019 Now\nThe free birth control requirement is both a key and controversial piece of President Obama\u2019s signature health law, seen as one of the many ways the law helps lower health costs for women.\nThe Kaiser report notes that insurance carriers are permitted to limit the forms of birth control they cover under Obamacare, but the companies should still offer leeway to consumers who have a medical need for certain devices, the report found.\nAn IUD, for example, costs up to $1,000\u2014which means that without insurance coverage, one of the most effective forms of birth control is unavailable to some of the women who want to use it."}
