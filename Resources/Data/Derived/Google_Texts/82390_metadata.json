To fit in with the change of events, words, too, had to change their usual meanings.\u201d \u2014Thucydides, Greek historian (c. 460 \u2013 c. 400 BC)\n\nToday\u2019s \u201cDemocrats\u201d are both lip service experts and linguistic contortionists. Ironically, despite the donkey mascot, they don\u2019t believe in democracy or the pioneering American spirit. That unfortunately ended with JFK\u2019s New Frontier optimism and the subsequent tragedy of his and brother Bobby\u2019s assassinations. Recall that Kennedy\u2019s Camelot was quickly appropriated and replaced by something unrecognizable, Mr. Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society.\u201d Mind you, LBJ also still conveniently called himself a \u201cDemocrat,\u201d but he was the first modern-day progressive, and his hard leftist policies were a radical departure from Mr. Kennedy\u2019s.\n\nWhat did LBJ do? As any good fascist, he cleverly exploited the memory of his murdered predecessor into a governing mandate for his own policies. After all, how could the American people have realized then the radical differences? (They don\u2019t even realize them now!) LBJ promised superficial hope and continuation; a calm voice in calamitous times. Reeling from existential grief, the voters did what they thought to be a reasonable thing: they elected Mr. Kennedy\u2019s V. P. Specifically, in 1964, LBJ garnered 61% of the vote: the widest popular margin in American history.\n\nOn the level of policy, what did LBJ do? For starters, he nearly doubled JFK\u2019s government spending to $42 billion and added 13% to the national debt. (These figures are quaint compared to Mr. Obama\u2019s $9 trillion of $19 trillion in total, and counting.) Similarly, Mr. Obama has also expanded government with, for example, his takeover of 1/6 of the economy soon to be known as the Obamacare debacle. Likewise, LBJ had his failed War on Poverty. Related to the latter, what is clear in hindsight 50 years later? Per the 2013 U.S. Census Bureau, 14.5% of Americans are poor, basically unchanged since 1967. In the interim, $22 trillion has been squandered, and generations of the nuclear family in the black community have been economically and socially decimated. This phenomenon is known as the Democrat\u2019s poverty plantation.\n\nFast forward to today to see the stark parallels between both men. Ironically, under America\u2019s first black president, the black community has suffered the most of any segment of our society. Look to the unprecedented, black-on-black murder rate of Mr. Obama\u2019s community-organized Chicago. Another telling sign: the black teen unemployment rate hit a staggering 39% in July 2012. Likewise, in a report for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, economist Dean Baker writes, \u201cThe drop in labor force participation was sharpest for African Americans, who saw a decline of 0.3 percentage points to 60.2 percent, the lowest rate since December of 1977.\u201d To this end, Obamacare\u2019s restrictive employer mandates have contributed mightily to generally declining hiring practices. Equally astonishing is the fact that better than 90% of black voters choose Mr. Obama despite their unmistakably diminished prospects.\n\nIn any case, as with LBJ \u2014 and the fresh-faced Mr. Obama \u2014 with Kennedy nostalgia, the electorate saw what it wanted to see: a fun house mirror for its own hopes and dreams. In this regard, lacking the specifics of a track record was only a boon to BHO. He was a virtual unknown, totally untested, a political neophyte. He was also a polished, empty suit that symbolized what black people aspired to be. Likewise to white voters, Mr. Obama appeared to be the manifestation and realization of MLK\u2019s \u201cDream.\u201d Once again, understandably, the trusting American public pulled the lever. A mistake made twice to our collective detriment. What America wanted was another unifier, ideally perhaps JFK and MLK rolled into one. What we got was the opposite: another big government ideologue, a Johnson style bait-and-switch.\n\nBy the totality of his political philosophy, JFK would likely be a left of center mainstream Republican in today\u2019s world. He was pro-military, supported economy-stimulating tax cuts, was against deficit spending and was rabidly anti-Communist \u2014 and specifically, anti-Castro. In what universe could one imagine JFK going on a bended knee \u201capology tour\u201d to America\u2019s geo-political foes? (To that end, he would have rightfully fired Hillary for her embarrassingly inept Russian \u201creset button\u201d stunt.) Furthermore, what\u2019s the probability Mr. Kennedy would ever vacation in Cuba or embrace authoritarian Castro in warm friendship? How about that U.S. military Mr. Obama has gutted? Or those Obama hell-freezing-over-first tax cuts? Our current president calls himself a \u201cDemocrat,\u201d but he also claims a Christian faith for what that\u2019s worth. But, what of an apples to apples comparison of Mr. Obama to true Democrat Mr. Kennedy, or Ben Carson as a typical Christian? What is then seen in the former is a pretender who doesn\u2019t know the meaning of these concepts beyond lip service to them.\n\nObama, Clinton and Sanders are all ruling class elitists, happy to play obscuring word game patty-cake with the MSM. Notice the nebulous and fluid labels they use to define themselves:\n\n\u201cOK, well what\u2019s the difference between a socialist and a Democrat?\u201d Chris Matthews asked again.\n\n\u201cI can tell you what I am, I am a progressive Democrat,\u201d Hillary Clinton responded.\n\n\u201cHow is that different than a socialist?\u201d The MSNBC talking head asked a third time.\n\n\u201cI am a progressive Democrat who likes to get things done.\u201d\n\nWell, isn\u2019t that a bit like hubby Bill\u2019s \u201cIt depends upon what the meaning of the word \u2018is\u2019 is.\u201d? \u201cDemocrat-Socialist\u201d indeed! That\u2019s about as contrary and nonsensical as Big Brother\u2019s title for his Ministry of Peace that, in actuality, makes war. (Incidentally, that\u2019s why neither DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz nor front-runner Hillary Clinton can articulate the nonexistent difference.) More to the point, when a term like \u201cliberal\u201d loses its sale value (as during the Reagan years) these chameleons \u2014 anti-American, big government fascists, one and all \u2014 shift to the common usage of a different, positive-sounding buzz word like \u201cprogressive.\u201d The fact that this word is very similar to the word \u201cprogress\u201d is intentional. Given, as examples, the widespread advancements in medicine and technology, who in the 21 century is not for more of that? The fact that both ideas have nothing whatsoever to do with each other is the point. Language becomes imprecise and overtly hazy. Therefore, a progressive is a good association code word to confuse \u2014 and ultimately dupe \u2014 uninformed voters. (Millennials, this means you!) Likewise was Mr. Obama\u2019s vacuous hope and change slogan. Or Mr. Obama\u2019s ominous fundamental transformation of America. Sound-good surface words that have brought wheels-falling-off ruin to America.\n\nThink of a curse word for a donkey and that\u2019s the only aspect that has remaining relevance to these would-be \u201cDemocrats.\u201d Their ilk only believe in one thing: perpetual top-down rule of an ever-expanding debt-ridden government they control. It\u2019s Uncle Sam reconstituted as nanny state wet-nurse. Recall that economics is freedom. As is peaceful self-expression and individual choice-making. In the final analysis, are Americans more free or less so after Mr. Obama\u2019s almost eight years in office? For a strong indication, the able-bodied 93 million unemployed can check their bank account balances, the rest can check their part-time paycheck stubs.\n\nIn no way do progressives/socialists resemble Democrats' roots: \u201cgo your own way\u201d Classic Jeffersonian Liberalism. They are, in reality, their opposite number. Specifically, today\u2019s \u201cDemocrats\u201d are that in name only. Mr. Obama has enjoyed and exploited an unquestioning quasi-religious fanaticism by the propagandist MSM and his fellow political travelers in government. The state is their God, and political power (via faceless, unaccountable bureaucratic government) is their catnip. Make no mistake, they are against all traditional American ideals: Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness (via self-determination).\n\nThese folks use soft, meaningless euphemisms like \u201cclimate change\u201d and political correctness as political smoke \u2014 sleights of hand \u2014 to distract from the abject failures of their policies. Hence, \u201cleadership from behind,\u201d and America\u2019s economics, military strength and political power are in absolute contraction. Specifically, a corrupt IRS that continues to target conservative groups is just the tip of the iceberg. Politicians like Mr. Obama lie about Obamacare and globally about his failed record as president. His would-be successor, Hillary Clinton, lies about her roles in Benghazi, Server-gate and Charity-gate. Added mightily by a sycophantic, water-carrying MSM, they know: say the lie loud enough and long enough and the sludge filters down as \u201ctruth\u201d to the voters. Words mean what they say they mean. And, in this chaotic background, Black Lives Matter anarchists openly proclaim disorder and \u201cPigs in a blanket. Fry \u2018em like bacon.\u201d Overseas, radical Islam similarly chants \u201cDeath to America.\u201d Lefties habitually destroy and loot. Contrarily, conservatives and the Tea Party preserve and protest peacefully. They don\u2019t target cops for assassination or burn down American cities like Ferguson and Baltimore. They also don\u2019t vote for responsibility-phobic, two-faced politicians to whom truth is a foreign concept. Want more of the faceless, lawless mob mentality we have now? Ignore my honest, unvarnished words. Keep voting for Hillary\u2019s caliber of person who promises a dystopian Obama third term.\n\nDavid L.
