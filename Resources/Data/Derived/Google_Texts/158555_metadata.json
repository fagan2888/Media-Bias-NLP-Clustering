It\u2019s most recent project is identifying the status of Ms. Abedin, who appears to have had an unconventional arrangement with the State Department, which allowed her to work both for the government and for private employers, including the Clinton Foundation and a consulting firm run by a close associate of the former president.\n\nRelated: Clinton Tries to Brush Off Email Affair as She Wads Deeper into the Morass\n\nAccording to a declaration filed Wednesday by Joseph E. Macmanus, the Executive Secretary of the Department of State, the department\u2019s Office of Information Resource Management \u201cbelieves\u201d that Blackberries were issued to Abedin and Mills. However, it \u201chas not located any such device\u201d at State.\n\n\"If the State Department was not providing secure email devices to Mrs. Clinton, who was? Best Buy? Target?\"\n\nMacmanus says standard procedure at State dictates that when a Blackberry device is returned, technicians perform a factory reset to remove all identifying information stored on it. Then either the device is reissued or, if it is out of date, it is \u201cexcessed.\u201d MacManus confirmed that the devices issued to Mills and Abedin would be considered outdated.\n\nMcManus also noted that no such device was issued to Clinton, and that the former secretary of state, as is now widely known, did not use an official email account.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Scandal Watch \u2013 Get Used to Hearing Huma Abedin\u2019s Name\n\nJudicial Watch was quick to jump on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe questions just keep popping up. Every time the State Department tries to justify its stonewalling, one more bit of information arises,\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in a statement. \u201cIf the State Department was not providing secure email devices to Mrs. Clinton, who was? Best Buy? Target? Mrs. Clinton clearly did whatever she wanted, without regard to national security or federal records keeping laws.\u201d\n\nWhile the possible destruction of the devices will probably headline many stories about Clinton\u2019s email controversy, the fact that they cannot be located is 1) relatively unimportant and 2) a good example of why Clinton\u2019s decision not to use an official State Department email account is so problematic.\n\nRelated: As Trump Surges, New Clinton Ad Takes Aim at the Rich\n\nYes, Abedin and Mills\u2019 Blackberries may have been destroyed, but records of their State.gov email accounts, which the Blackberries handled exclusively, were not. That\u2019s because the State Department has such accounts backed up.\n\nThe server on which the emails were stored was under Clinton\u2019s personal control, not the State Department\u2019s, creating what amounts to a break in the chain of custody.\n\nMacmanus claims the State Department is cooperating with the information request from Judicial Watch; the department simply searched the State.gov accounts of Abedin and Mills and was able to identify responsive documents. Because Clinton made the decision not to use a State.gov account for her official email, and instead relied on a private email server, similar requests for her records can\u2019t be handled so cleanly.\n\nThe server on which the emails were stored was under Clinton\u2019s personal control, not the State Department\u2019s, creating what amounts to a break in the chain of custody. Clinton insists that she turned over all emails relevant to her work at State when she was asked to do so, and erased those that were not relevant.\n\nRelated: Trump Is Forcing GOP Candidates into an Immigration War Nobody Wants\n\nThere, of course, is the glaring problem. Because State didn\u2019t have continuous control of the server (which is now in the hands of the FBI, after having data \u201cwiped\u201d from it by technicians working for Clinton) anyone interested in the State Department-related contents of the machine has to take Clinton\u2019s word when she says that it was all turned over.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The announcement that key Clinton aides\u2019 Blackberries have gone missing perversely demonstrates why Clinton\u2019s decision to use a private email server was so problematic.", "title": "State Dept.
