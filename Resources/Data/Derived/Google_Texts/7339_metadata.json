Two officers were reprimanded along with a pair of coaches. Those involved, though, avoided more serious punishments, including dismissal from the academy for cadets and courts-martial for officers.\n\nThe football players involved, including Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago, are expected to be on the field at West Point\u2019s Michie Stadium when Army takes on the Air Force Academy on Nov. 1.\n\nThe nation\u2019s oldest military academy said that it dealt with the cadets involved harshly.\n\n\u201cAlthough seen as a minor infraction by the NCAA, the U.S. Military Academy takes this very seriously and adjudicated this at the highest level of the disciplinary code,\u201d the institution said in a statement. \u201cWe adjudicated this under article 10 of the cadet disciplinary code, and all cadets appeared before the commandant\u2019s disciplinary board.\u201d\n\nArmy spokeswoman Theresa Brinkerhoff said the school didn\u2019t disclose the misconduct to the public because it was handled \u201cadministratively.\u201d\n\nShe said the administrative punishments involved didn\u2019t impact athletic eligibility.\n\nThe Pentagon had no immediate comment on the West Point incident.\n\nThe revelations out of West Point come as military academy athletic programs, including at the Air Force Academy, face increasing scrutiny for player misconduct. An August Gazette investigation into athlete conduct at Air Force found that a core group of football players had engaged in drug use, binge drinking, sexual assault and academic cheating.\n\nAir Force superintendent Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson reacted to the player misconduct by launching a review of athletic programs and cracking down on player behavior.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Scandal surfaces with Army football", "title": "Scandal surfaces with Army football", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/25/scandal-surfaces-with-army-football/", "image": {"width": 594, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141025_092708_army-football.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141025_092708_army-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-25T21:32:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:00:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The football players involved, including Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago, are expected to be on the field at West Point\u2019s Michie Stadium when Army takes on the Air Force Academy on Nov. 1.\nThe nation\u2019s oldest military academy said that it dealt with the cadets involved harshly.\nThe revelations out of West Point come as military academy athletic programs, including at the Air Force Academy, face increasing scrutiny for player misconduct.\nThe Pentagon had no immediate comment on the West Point incident.\nAir Force superintendent Lt.
