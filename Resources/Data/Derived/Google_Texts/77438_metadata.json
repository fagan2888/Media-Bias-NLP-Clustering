Admittedly, few older dogs have the physique to endure emergency surgery, and even fewer owners have the wherewithal to pay for it. That said, advancements in veterinary science often parallel those of human medicine, and it is now possible to save pets from complications that would have killed them less than 10 years ago.\n\nOne example is Naki\u2019o \u2013 an abandoned 5-week-old puppy who lost all four paws to frostbite when he powered through a Nebraskan winter in 2010. After a successful fundraiser organized by his eventual savior, veterinary technician Christie Tomlinson, Naki\u2019o underwent extensive surgery and was fitted with four prosthetic legs. Today, he is enjoying a second shot at life as the world\u2019s first bionic dog.\n\nBut limbs can also be saved. According to Alan Cross, a board-certified surgeon specializing in veterinary orthopedics at Georgia Veterinary Specialists, vets now have the resources and technology to treat a wide variety of musculoskeletal complications. Speaking to Mother Nature Network, he said that stem cell therapy, tibial-plateau leveling osteotomy, and cold laser therapy are only some of the methods currently used to delay the woes of old age for man\u2019s best friend. \u201cWe asked 20 clients with dogs that had hip issues to try it for free; if there was an improvement they could come back,\u201d one practitioner said of cold laser therapy. \u201cNineteen clients returned. You really can\u2019t beat that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these developments are in no way limited to trauma care. Even if Family Guy\u2019s writers were to afflict the show\u2019s animals with cancer, the prognosis would likely be positive. Just look at Nemo the Pig \u2013 a 730-pound Hampshire swine who made recently made history as the first-ever porcine lymphoma survivor. According to the medical resident who administered Nemo\u2019s chemotherapy treatment, the bill for an adult Golden Retriever would be about $5,000.\n\nWhether such expenses can be managed by a man who once blew his life savings on a brain damaged racehorse is for the show\u2019s writers to decide.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "family guy brian dead, save, veterinary science, replace limbs, cure cancer, alan cross veterinary orthopedics, nakio bionic dog, nemo pig cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Did Family Guy's decision to kill off Brian fly in the face of veterinary science?", "title": "How Family Guy Could Have Saved Brian", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-family-guy-could-have-saved-brian-breakthrough-technology-allows-vets-replace-limbs-cure-cancer", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/family-guy.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Did Family Guy's decision to kill off Brian fly in the face of veterinary science?", "title": "How Family Guy Could Have Saved Brian", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-family-guy-could-have-saved-brian-breakthrough-technology-allows-vets-replace-limbs-cure-cancer", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/family-guy.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/family-guy.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-25T18:59:48-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-25T19:03:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Did Family Guy's decision to kill off Brian fly in the face of veterinary science?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe051d\"", "article_summary": "Even if Family Guy\u2019s writers were to afflict the show\u2019s animals with cancer, the prognosis would likely be positive.\nWhether such expenses can be managed by a man who once blew his life savings on a brain damaged racehorse is for the show\u2019s writers to decide.\n\u201cI am so upset right now, I may never watch Family Guy again.\u201dBut did all of this have to happen?\n\u201cHe sucks and I don't trust him at all,\u201d one internet commenter said of Vinny, the dog that will be replacing Brian.\nAccording to the medical resident who administered Nemo\u2019s chemotherapy treatment, the bill for an adult Golden Retriever would be about $5,000."}
