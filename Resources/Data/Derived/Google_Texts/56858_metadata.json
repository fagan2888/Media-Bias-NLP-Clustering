Pleasant, Texas, in February 2007. Reuters\n\nLazard and FTI Consulting will be advising the committee of unsecured creditors in Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy, one of the largest Chapter 11 proceedings on record.\n\nThe Texas power company arrived in bankruptcy April 29 after months of restructuring talks aimed at trying to build support for a strategy to offload some of the debt piled on in a 2007 leveraged buyout. Lazard advised the board of directors and the strategic-transactions committee of what was then called TXU Corp. in connection with the LBO, which didn\u2019t work out so well.\n\nNatural gas prices went down, fracking boomed and Energy Future couldn\u2019t pay the freight on its debt load. Next stop, Chapter 11.\n\nLazard\u2019s new job requires it to advise Energy Future\u2019s official creditors\u2019 committee, which will turn over every stone looking for money for folks that otherwise won\u2019t get paid. Could Lazard\u2019s past work on the Energy Future LBO complicate its new assignment as adviser to the creditor\u2019s committee? Probably not. Lazard advised the board of the former TXU, directors whose job it was to get the best possible price for public shareholders that owned the company. How much debt was involved in the LBO was not the board\u2019s concern.\n\nMorrison & Foerster\u2019s Brett Miller, lead lawyer for the committee, declined to discuss how the issue will be addressed in advance of the formal filing of Lazard\u2019s application to be hired. Lazard spokeswoman Judi Frost Mackey declined comment.\n\nUnder the company\u2019s current scenario, upward of $6 billion worth of debt will be erased by way of a restructuring that will be outlined by June 13. The committee will be heard from for the first time Thursday when Energy Future goes to court with a full agenda of matters that need to be dealt with as the company pushes to get out of bankruptcy by early next year. Thursday, the company will have to contend with calls from unhappy creditors to move the big bankruptcy case from Delaware to Dallas and to answer questions.\n\nThe questions are coming from all sides, Energy Future said in court papers Tuesday. Among other things, creditors are asking about \u201cessentially all\u201d of the negotiations on bankruptcy financing, the company\u2019s current business plan, and what happened in the talks that brought some key creditors on board with Energy Future\u2019s restructuring strategy.\n\nWilmington Savings Fund Society, trustee for $1.6 billion worth of endangered debt, was the first to fire off questions at Energy Future, with a formal \u201cRule 2004\u201d motion filed the day Energy Future filed for bankruptcy protection. Rule 2004 is a powerful bankruptcy investigative tool that allows creditors to get answers from companies that have sought court protection.\n\nIn a detailed, 34-page motion, the bond trustee said it needs answers now about what sent Energy Future spiraling into insolvency. Though it took place more than half a decade ago, the deal on which Lazard advised was not spared when it came to the barrage of queries Wilmington Savings Fund Society aimed at the company.\n\n\u201cCompounding the extraordinary risks inherent in the debt burden assumed to effect the sponsor group\u2019s speculative investment, management has failed to deal with key operational imperatives, which explains in large measure the debtors\u2019 immediate financial predicament,\u201d wrote Brown Rudnick\u2019s Ed Weisfelner, lawyer for the bond trustee.\n\nBy \u201csponsor group,\u201d the bond trustee meant the investment firms that own energy future: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., TPG Capital, LP and Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nThe private equity firms pleaded with the court for help against the Rule 2004 probe. \u201cWhile it is sometimes said that Rule 2004 permits \u2018fishing expeditions,\u2019 what is proposed here is to scour the Pacific Ocean, in a matter of days, in search of any and all fish regardless of the size, shape or species,\u201d wrote the trio of law firms representing the trio of Energy Future leading owners.\n\nWrite to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Lazard Freres & Co. and FTI Consulting Inc. will be advising the committee of unsecured creditors in Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy, one of the largest Chapter 11 proceedings on record.", "title": "Lazard, FTI to Advise Creditors Committee in Energy Future Bankruptcy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/05/20/lazard-fti-to-advise-creditors-committee-in-energy-future-bankruptcy/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CO592_efhban_P_20140429065101.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Lazard, FTI to Advise Creditors Committee in Energy Future Bankruptcy", "description": "Lazard Freres & Co. and FTI Consulting Inc. will be advising the committee of unsecured creditors in Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy, one of the largest Chapter 11 proceedings on record.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Peg Brickley", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Bankruptcy Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.summary": "Lazard Freres & Co. and FTI Consulting Inc. will be advising the committee of unsecured creditors in Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy, one of the largest Chapter 11 proceedings on record.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-05-20T20:28:06-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/05/20/lazard-fti-to-advise-creditors-committee-in-energy-future-bankruptcy/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-BANKB-19729", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Lazard Freres & Co. and FTI Consulting Inc. will be advising the committee of unsecured creditors in Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy, one of the largest Chapter 11 proceedings on record.", "title": "Lazard, FTI to Advise Creditors Committee in Energy Future Bankruptcy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/05/20/lazard-fti-to-advise-creditors-committee-in-energy-future-bankruptcy/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CO592_efhban_P_20140429065101.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.id": "BL-BANKB-19729", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-20T21:09:39-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83ac\"", "article_summary": "Could Lazard\u2019s past work on the Energy Future LBO complicate its new assignment as adviser to the creditor\u2019s committee?\nReutersLazard and FTI Consulting will be advising the committee of unsecured creditors in Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s bankruptcy, one of the largest Chapter 11 proceedings on record.\nIn a detailed, 34-page motion, the bond trustee said it needs answers now about what sent Energy Future spiraling into insolvency.\nLazard\u2019s new job requires it to advise Energy Future\u2019s official creditors\u2019 committee, which will turn over every stone looking for money for folks that otherwise won\u2019t get paid.\nBy \u201csponsor group,\u201d the bond trustee meant the investment firms that own energy future: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., TPG Capital, LP and Goldman Sachs & Co."}
