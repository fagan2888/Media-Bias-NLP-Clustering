Even Iran\u2019s foreign minister dismissed the administration\u2019s talking points describing the framework agreement as \u201cspin.\u201d Obama is warning that the only alternative to his deal is \u201canother war in the Middle East ,\u201d even though he has yet to reveal the key details: Will sanctions relief be front-loaded, as Iran insists, or will sanctions come off gradually, as the Iranians meet certain performance benchmarks? Will there be any transparency into Iran\u2019s past secret nuclear activity, information that is critical to verifying its compliance today? Will there be \u201csnap inspections\u201d and access to all Iranian facilities, both civilian and military? Iran says no. Obama is counting on the fact that Americans won\u2019t be able to follow all the details about \u201ccentrifuges\u201d and \u201cdomestic enrichment capacity.\u201d He won\u2019t share the details but wants us to trust him that there will be \u201cunprecedented verification.\u201d If you believe that, you probably still think that if you like your health plan, you can keep your health plan.\n\nPresident Obama addresses the Summit of the Americas in Panama, highlighting change in Cuba policy as a hallmark in wider shift in Latin America. (Reuters)\n\nObama is also counting on exploiting the \u201clack of understanding of the American voter\u201d when it comes to his normalization of relations with the Castro regime in Cuba. At a news conference in Panama this weekend, Obama declared that \u201cThere is majority support of our policy in the United States\u201d and that \u201cthe American people don\u2019t need to be persuaded that this is in fact the right thing to do.\u201d A new poll commissioned by my American Enterprise Institute colleague Roger Noriega for InterAmerican Security Watch finds that Americans do support Obama\u2019s plan by a margin of 51 to 38 percent . . . until they learn some basic facts about Cuba. When Americans are told that Cuba is hosting Russian ships in its harbors, opposition to normalization jumps to 58 percent while support sinks to 30 percent. When Americans are told of Cuba\u2019s attempts to smuggle 240 tons of weaponry to North Korea, opposition jumps to 63 percent and support drops to 26 percent. When Americans are told that Cuba is harboring a cop-killer and terrorists, opposition jumps to 63 percent, and support plummets to 23 percent. When asked whether sanctions should be maintained pending Cuba\u2019s progress on human rights and free elections, Americans agree by a margin of 64-16. And when asked whether Cuba\u2019s designation as a supporter of terrorism should be maintained because it harbors terrorists, respondents agreed 68 percent to 16 percent.\n\nIn other words, Noriega says, \u201cWhen Americans hear basic facts about Castro\u2019s hostility and human-rights violations, they know that the president\u2019s unilateral concessions only emboldened a dangerous, despotic regime.\u201d\n\nLook for Obama to continue employing Gruberesque tactics to sell his appeasement of Cuba and Iran. No doubt the final Iran deal will be presented in a \u201ctortured way\u201d to \u201cmislabel\u201d Obama\u2019s concessions to Tehran and make the inspections seem more intrusive than they are. The same will be true of Obama\u2019s coming decision to lift Cuba\u2019s designation as a state sponsor of terror. There will be no mention from the White House of terrorists being protected and supported by the Castro regime, such as Joanne Chesimard \u2014 who murdered a New Jersey state trooper and was named in 2013 by Obama\u2019s own FBI as one of its Most Wanted Terrorists . There will be no mention of the 70 other U.S. fugitives that Obama\u2019s own State Department reports \u201cThe Cuban government continued to harbor\u201d while providing \u201csupport such as housing, food ration books, and medical care\u201d \u2014 or of the Spanish and Colombian terrorists receiving similar support from the Castro brothers.\n\nWhy would they tell Americans these things? Obama\u2019s attitude, to paraphrase Gruber, is that \u201cI wish . . . we could make it all transparent, but I\u2019d rather have [these agreements with rogue regimes] than not.\u201d Obama and his foreign policy team know what is good for us. And if we\u2019re too \u201cstupid\u201d to catch the deception, that\u2019s our problem, not theirs.\n\nIt worked for Obamacare, they figure, so why not Iran and Cuba?\n\nRead more from Marc Thiessen\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president is relying on the ignorance of the American public to sell his appeasement policies.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The president is relying on the ignorance of the American public to sell his appeasement policies.", "title": "Obama\u2019s deceptions on Iran and Cuba", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamas-gruber-doctrine-for-iran-and-cuba/2015/04/13/77377550-e1e6-11e4-905f-cc896d379a32_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/11/Editorial-Opinion/Images/205733982-3029.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcthiessen"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamas-gruber-doctrine-for-iran-and-cuba/2015/04/13/77377550-e1e6-11e4-905f-cc896d379a32_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obama cuba, obama iran, jonathan gruber, jonathan gruber obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marcthiessen"}, "eomportal-uuid": "77377550-e1e6-11e4-905f-cc896d379a32", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marc Thiessen, obama cuba, obama iran, jonathan gruber, jonathan gruber obamacare"}, "article_summary": "That is precisely what Obama is doing when it comes to Iran and Cuba.\nIt worked for Obamacare, they figure, so why not Iran and Cuba?\nWith Iran, the administration is once again relying on a \u201clack of transparency\u201d to ram through its nuclear deal.\nWhen Americans are told that Cuba is harboring a cop-killer and terrorists, opposition jumps to 63 percent, and support plummets to 23 percent.\nThe same will be true of Obama\u2019s coming decision to lift Cuba\u2019s designation as a state sponsor of terror."}
