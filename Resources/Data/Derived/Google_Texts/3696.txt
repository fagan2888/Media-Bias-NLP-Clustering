Although snow froze some Colorado Easter plans in their tracks, the bunny shouldn’t have to navigate new snow Sunday to deliver baskets in the Denver metro area.

Inclement weather prompted the cancellation of the Red Rocks Easter Sunrise Service and the Sunrise Service at the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park in Cañon City.

But the snow wasn’t all bad news.

Loveland Ski Area announced Saturday afternoon that it had reached the 300-inch mark for snowfall accumulation, with 24 inches falling in the last 72 hours. Copper Mountain announced 13 inches of new snow fell in the past 72 hours to bring the mountain’s March total to 52 inches.

Snow fell Saturday in the southern foothills and Monument Ridge, including Jefferson, Douglas and eastern Elbert counties, adding 2 to 4 inches in those areas. The rapidly falling snow made for slushy roads, poor driving conditions and the cancellation of some holiday egg hunts and festivities throughout the Pikes Peak Region, including Teller and El Paso counties. Black ice and poor road conditions is blamed for several crashes along Interstate 25 that caused big delays.

But Sunday’s forecast promises a return to spring-like weather with a high expected to reach 52 degrees under sunny skies in the Denver metro area, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder. Expect snow to return Wednesday.
