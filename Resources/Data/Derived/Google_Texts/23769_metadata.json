Puerto Ricans won\u2019t vote in the presidential election, but their 23 delegates could mean the difference between life and campaign death in a field as crowded as the GOP\u2019s is, and the Democratic Party\u2019s is likely to become; and both Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio appeared determined to stake their claim.\n\nTheir events were only miles apart, but represented stark differences in the way the two candidates are courting voters. Marco Rubio played to a packed neighborhood bar, and made his speech (mostly in Spanish) while unabashedly wiping the sweat from his face. He made a point to jab at Clinton, referencing the scandal surrounding her private server, and predicting that her vision for Puerto Rico would be limited to the same policies that have contributed to the country\u2019s current fiscal crisis.\n\nFrom the AP:\n\nRubio said the island faces multiple challenges, but remained firm that allowing its municipalities and agencies to declare bankruptcy is not the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Chapter 9 would solve Puerto Rico\u2019s problems,\u201d he said, adding that the island has spent more money than it had available. \u201cUltimately, if there is no other option left, Chapter 9 is a viable option at that point.\u201d Asked about Clinton at a brief news conference after his speech, Rubio said he didn\u2019t have details about her plan for Puerto Rico. \u201cI think it was on her server, and it was wiped clean,\u201d he jabbed, a reference to the Clinton email server that is now the subject of a federal investigation.\n\nWatch:\n\nClinton\u2019s meet and greet was a more subdued, invite-only policy roundtable; however, she won the commonwealth\u2019s 2008 Democratic primary, so she could be banking on residual support, as well as her rejection of \u201causterity\u201d measures as a method of bringing balance back to the struggling economy.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\nA 10-minute drive down the highway, Mrs. Clinton held a round-table event at the Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico y del Caribe, where she focused on the health and economic challenges facing Puerto Rico, whose government is in a financial crisis and struggling to pay $72 billion in debt. After arriving an hour late, Mrs. Clinton sat and did more listening than talking at first \u2014 \u201cI came here to listen,\u201d she told the panel \u2014 nodding and taking notes as seven health officials and practitioners listed issues plaguing Puerto Rico\u2019s health care system, from struggling with Affordable Care Act regulations to an exodus of talented doctors to the mainland. One of the panelists handed her a magazine, and while Mrs. Clinton recognized it was in Spanish, she said she got the message. \u201cI can read crisis and crisis,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, to a few laughs from the crowd.\n\nRepublican candidate Jeb Bush and Democratic candidate Martin O\u2019Malley have also visited the island.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio hit at Hillary Clinton during a campaign trip to Puerto Rico.
