Carly Fiorina gets the last laugh after awkward interview with Chuck Todd on ‘Meet the Press’

Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday morning where all host Chuck Todd wanted to talk about was her failure to register her domain name and how that related to her “failures” at Hewlett-Packard.

News broke this week that CarlyFiorina.org was purchased by Michael Link, assistant director of digital strategy at SEIU. He used the website to feature 30,000 frown faces –one for every person she laid off while CEO at HP.

Todd tried to use the website and the layoffs as examples of her failed leadership, but Fiorina pushed back in an awkward interview.

Fiorina also ultimately got the last laugh.

She took to Twitter to let Todd know that he might want to check on his own domain names.

Thanks, @chucktodd, for having me on @meetthepress this morning. Btw, check out http://t.co/m9C6LxE89J. #domaingate — Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) May 10, 2015
