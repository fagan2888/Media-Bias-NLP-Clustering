In office since: 2008. Leadership: Chairwoman of House Education Committee. Career: Retired assistant chief probation officer for Mohave County. Other offices: Has served on the Kingman Unified School District Governing Board.\n\nPHOENIX \u2013 Recovering from a stroke that limits mobility on her left side, Rep. Doris Goodale, R-Kingman, has had a lot to face.\n\nBut one thing she hasn\u2019t faced is defeat.\n\n\u201cMy world just turned completely around. I\u2019d never even thought about a stroke. I have low blood pressure,\u201d Goodale said.\n\nA month after colleagues welcomed her with a standing ovation at the first day of legislative session, she sat in her office after a long day of physical therapy, drafting bills and heading the House Education Committee.\n\nThe days have been long since she suffered a stroke on Sep. 29.\n\nThree days a week, Goodale wakes at 6 a.m. for physical or occupational therapy, followed by a day of legislative work. She\u2019s not a morning person but is determined to progress in her treatment, though she wishes it would progress more quickly.\n\n\u201cIt just goes so painfully slow. I\u2019m a person who really wants to just get back to where I was, but I\u2019m working hard to get my health restored,\u201d Goodale said.\n\nWhile out to lunch with her sister at a Kingman restaurant, she suddenly felt dizzy, lost consciousness and woke up several hours later at Sunrise Medical Center in Las Vegas. For now, she uses a wheelchair to get around the Capitol.\n\nAs soon as she got clearance from her doctor, Goodale said she was determined to recover as quickly as possible and return to her job at the Legislature.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, I was elected so I\u2019m going back to work,\u2019 because I love being a representative,\u201d she said.\n\nHer administrative assistant, Jana Babel, said the doctors are impressed with Goodale\u2019s recovery.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s determined to get well, she\u2019s determined to continue her life and to do what she loves to do,\u201d Babel said. \u201cAnd not a lot of people would have done that. A lot of people would have stopped.\u201d\n\nEven before the stroke, Goodale dealt with loss and struggle.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with a lot of things last year. You don\u2019t leave your personal life at home just because you\u2019re here,\u201d she said.\n\nIn May 2012, her 27-year-old son and 31-year-old daughter were arrested for possessing and trafficking heroin. Released from prison in November last year, Stephanie Goodale now helps with her mother\u2019s recovery, while Michael Goodale remains behind bars.\n\nSeveral months after the arrests, Goodale\u2019s husband, Bill, passed away from a stroke.\n\nThese personal tragedies stacked on top of a tense legislative session in 2013, Goodale said. She was one of few Republicans who sided with Gov. Jan Brewer and voted to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cLast year was very stressful down here. I was battling the academic standards and the health care bill. I didn\u2019t realize I was so stressed,\u201d she said.\n\nThough Goodale uses a wheelchair to get around the Capitol, she can walk with the help of a walker and hopes to be dancing in time for Kingman\u2019s Andy Devine Days rodeo dance in September.\n\nBefore she returned to Phoenix for the legislative session, her family had been taking care of her in Kingman. She credits her assistant Babel for keeping her life together at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cJana of course does the lion\u2019s share. She moves me about in my chair, my wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s my angel, actually, because she drives me to and from work.\u201d\n\nBabel said she and Goodale have become friends since she started working for her four years ago.\n\n\u201cI would do anything for her and so would most of the people down here,\u201d Babel said.\n\nRep. Heather Carter, R-Cave Creek, has a desk next to Goodale on the House floor and sometimes helps her stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Carter said she respects Goodale\u2019s attention to detail, informed perspective on education and commitment to getting the job done.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really cool about Doris. She has this passion and energy about her that allows her to be sympathetic and kind and warm,\u201d Carter said. \u201cYet she also has the moral fortitude to stand up for the things that she believes in.\u201d\n\nGoodale said she will focus this session on an education bill that would expand dual credit courses in trade skills like welding and a health bill that would require an addiction assessment for heavy-duty pain prescriptions.\n\nThe prescription drug bill affects Goodale personally, she said, because her daughter took pain pills for kidney problems. When the prescription ended, addiction remained and pushed her daughter into heroin, Goodale said.\n\nToday, Stephanie Goodale is off the narcotic drugs and taking addiction classes in Kingman, her mother said.\n\n\u201cShe did wrong, and I\u2019m proud of her for taking her medicine and serving her time and doing what she needed to do,\u201d Goodale said. \u201cBut I missed her so dreadfully because she is my daughter. But she did come home and she did take care of me.\u201d\n\nGoodale said that while doctors are pleased and others are thrilled by her recovery, she wants more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m progressing as quickly as I want,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can still get around, and I feel great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/02/18-goodale-front.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "PHOENIX \u2013 Recovering from a stroke that limits mobility on her left side, Rep.
