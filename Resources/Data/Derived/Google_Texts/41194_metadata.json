Her daughter, Tiffany Stanek, is trying to find a hospital that will accept Soper\u2019s new insurance. Provided\n\nThe Affordable Care Act should have solved Nancy Soper\u2019s medical mess.\n\nA few years ago, the 55-year-old Beaufort woman\u2019s pre-existing condition would have basically disqualified her from purchasing private health insurance on the individual market. Soper has cirrhosis of the liver, commonly caused by alcoholism.\n\n\u201cShe went home the night that she was diagnosed and dumped all alcohol down the drain and hasn\u2019t touched it since,\u201d said Soper\u2019s daughter, Tiffany Stanek. \u201cEight percent of her liver is working. She won\u2019t be able to survive without a new liver.\u201d\n\nThe 2010 federal health care law prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to sick customers. That\u2019s great news for Soper \u2014 except she recently learned from the Medical University of South Carolina that she won\u2019t have the right kind of insurance come Jan. 1. She\u2019s been waiting for a liver transplant at MUSC for nearly two years, but she can\u2019t find a policy that will cover the cost of the operation or any other services at the hospital next year.\n\nMUSC says it won\u2019t kick anyone off the transplant list, but Soper\u2019s story reinforces a few of Obamacare\u2019s oft-cited shortcomings: Patients face narrow provider networks as insurance companies find new ways to save money and millions of low-income adults, such as Soper, still don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid in conservative states like South Carolina.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that (MUSC) won\u2019t take me after a year and half,\u201d Soper said. \u201cI worked so hard to get where I\u2019m at and now I have to start all over again.\u201d\n\nConsumers\u2019 Choice closure\n\nSoper is currently insured by Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan, an insurance cooperative set up in 2012 with an $87.8 million federal loan. It was designed to offer health insurance shoppers in South Carolina more options and competitive prices on the federal marketplace.\n\nSince 2014, Consumers\u2019 Choice has been the only insurance carrier on HealthCare.gov that includes MUSC in its network of preferred providers.\n\nIn late October, though, the South Carolina cooperative announced it would not sell 2016 plans, forcing some 67,000 Consumers\u2019 Choice customers to find coverage through another insurer. In 2015, a dozen of these insurance cooperatives, all of them facing grim financial forecasts, closed their doors across the country.\n\nMost Consumers\u2019 Choice customers already have selected alternate coverage. In fact, S.C. Department of Insurance Director Ray Farmer said Thursday that more than 62 percent of those 67,000 patients have purchased a policy through another company.\n\nThere are dozens of Obamacare plans, most of them sold by BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina and its subsidiary Blue Choice, that they can purchase through the federal health insurance marketplace.\n\nThe problem for Soper is that none of these plans cover her liver transplant at MUSC \u2014 the only hospital in South Carolina that even performs this procedure.\n\n\u201cWe were told about it on Dec. 7,\u201d her daughter said.\n\nOther options\n\nThe government\u2019s public insurance plans would pay for Soper\u2019s transplant at MUSC, but she doesn\u2019t qualify for one of those policies. She\u2019s a decade too young for Medicare and her family\u2019s total income \u2014 only $24,000 a year \u2014 is still too high for her to receive Medicaid, according to South Carolina\u2019s eligibility rules.\n\nSoper may have qualified for Medicaid if South Carolina Republicans changed their minds about expanding eligibility for the government\u2019s low-income health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. But Medicaid expansion was made optional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012, and for now, this state and 19 others have opted out. Gov. Nikki Haley has often said that South Carolina can\u2019t afford to add more people to the Medicaid roll, even if the federal government covers most of the cost.\n\nBut paying cash for the liver transplant is out of the question, too. In 2014, the average billed charge for a liver transplant in the United States was $739,100.\n\nStanek, who manages her mother\u2019s medical affairs, said the transplant department at MUSC told them they should find a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., or Atlanta that will accept her mother\u2019s new BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina insurance plan.\n\n\u201cWe have family (in Atlanta) fortunately,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trip is going to be exhausting.\u201d\n\nStanek estimates, based on her mother\u2019s position on the transplant list, that Soper would have qualified for a transplant at MUSC in mid-2016. Now they don\u2019t know how long it will take.\n\n\u201cIt puts her kind of back on the bottom,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting really hard to stay alive.\u201d\n\nNarrow networks\n\nMUSC spokeswoman Heather Woolwine said that fewer than 16 patients waiting for liver or kidney transplants at the hospital are insured through Consumers\u2019 Choice. She said none of them will be removed from the list and MUSC will work with them to figure out their options.\n\nShe said the hospital assumes most of these patients, like Soper, will select one of the BlueCross BlueShield plans. MUSC is negotiating with the insurance company to \u201cdevelop a transition-of-care plan for our patients who choose the BCBS exchange plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to wait on (BlueCross BlueShield) for answers on how to best move forward for patients selecting their plan,\u201d Woolwine said.\n\nPatti Embry-Tautenhan, a spokeswoman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, said the insurance company approached MUSC about participating in its provider network when it designed plans for the federal marketplace. MUSC declined, she said.\n\nMedical University Hospital CEO Pat Cawley told the hospital\u2019s Board of Trustees last week that MUSC did not participate in the BlueCross BlueShield network because the proposed reimbursement rates offered by the insurance company were \u201clower than Medicaid.\u201d\n\nEmbry-Tautenhan said BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina reached agreements with other local hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we offer our members access to some of the Southeast\u2019s premiere transplant facilities,\u201d she said, including Carolina\u2019s Medical Center in Charlotte and Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C.\n\nNarrower provider networks have become commonplace in the insurance industry, she said.\n\n\u201cNarrower networks are a national trend and have been common in other parts of the country for some time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are viewed as a way to keep costs down and, therefore, increase affordability for members.\u201d\n\nFinding a way\n\nFor MUSC, the Consumers\u2019 Choice closure created \u201can administrative nightmare,\u201d Cawley told the Board of Trustees earlier this month.\n\nFarmer said challenges like these normally arise when an insurance company leaves the market.\n\n\u201cI understand that Consumers\u2019 Choice and MUSC and any other potential providers are looking at these (patients) on a case-by-case basis,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cEveryone is going to have work through that and this is going to be part of it.\u201d\n\nStanek said she cried for two days when MUSC told her to find another hospital for her mother\u2019s transplant.\n\n\u201cIt took me an entire day to tell my mom. And for the first time in three years I cried in front of her because I felt so helpless for her,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018It\u2019s OK. You will find a way. You always do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 843-937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "With Consumers\u2019 Choice failure, transplant patients fret over treatment options, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina,Consumers' Choice,Health insurance,liver transplant,Medicaid expansion,MUSC,Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The Affordable Care Act should have solved Nancy Soper\u2019s medical mess.", "title": "With Consumers\u2019 Choice failure, transplant patients fret over treatment options", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151218/151219343/with-consumers-x2019-choice-failure-transplant-patients-fret-over-treatment-options", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151218/PC16/151219343/AR/0/AR-151219343.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151218/PC16/151219343/AR/0/AR-151219343.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act should have solved Nancy Soper\u2019s medical mess.", "title": "With Consumers\u2019 Choice failure, transplant patients fret over treatment options", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151218/PC16/151219343/AR/0/AR-151219343.jpg?201512211812", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151219343}}, "keywords": "With Consumers\u2019 Choice failure, transplant patients fret over treatment options , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina,Consumers' Choice,Health insurance,liver transplant,Medicaid expansion,MUSC,Obamacare", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-18T15:29:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-21T18:12:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Affordable Care Act should have solved Nancy Soper\u2019s medical mess."}, "article_summary": "It was designed to offer health insurance shoppers in South Carolina more options and competitive prices on the federal marketplace.\nIn 2014, the average billed charge for a liver transplant in the United States was $739,100.\nBut paying cash for the liver transplant is out of the question, too.\n\u201cI understand that Consumers\u2019 Choice and MUSC and any other potential providers are looking at these (patients) on a case-by-case basis,\u201d Farmer said.\nIn late October, though, the South Carolina cooperative announced it would not sell 2016 plans, forcing some 67,000 Consumers\u2019 Choice customers to find coverage through another insurer."}
