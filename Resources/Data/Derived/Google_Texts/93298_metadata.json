Instead, interested parties get to sit on their hands and hold their breaths in anticipation of Daft Punk and Pharrell or Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams picking up a Grammy for record of the year. Personally, I\u2019d get a kick out of seeing Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cGood Kid, M.A.A.D. City\u201d take home the prize for album of the year, but I wouldn\u2019t exactly say I have a horse in this race. Scheduled performers include Lamar, Sara Bareilles, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams and many more.\n\nIf music isn\u2019t your thing, the big ticket cablers will be providing their usual fare. On Showtime\u2019s \u201cEpisodes,\u201d Matt LeBlanc continues to play a \u2014 hopefully \u2014 more sinister version of himself. His faulty attempts to retain child custody may earn him some sympathy, but not much. \u201cEpisodes,\u201d like its 8:30 follow-up, \u201cHouse of Lies,\u201d is something of a guilty pleasure of mine. The shows share Showtime\u2019s tendency toward dramatic excess and titillation, but they\u2019re mostly fun and as easy to digest as they are to dismiss. This week, \u201cLies\u201d offers up a compelling gender conundrum as Marty (Don Cheadle) tries to understand his son\u2019s newest infatuation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, the Grammys are coming.
