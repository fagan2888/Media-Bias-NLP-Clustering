That is what we have now.\u2019\u2019\n\nTallia is spearheading the creation of an Accountable Care Organization, called Robert Wood Johnson Partners, that will coordinate treatment among doctors, other health professionals, and hospitals through better use of electronic health records. The project also involves restructuring doctors\u2019 offices to improve communication with patients, and directly involve them in developing plans to benefit their health.\n\nAlthough similar efforts have been rolled out around the country since health care reform became law in 2010, one key factor sets Tallia\u2019s work apart: Robert Wood Johnson Partners has the power of a major research university behind it.\n\nTallia and others in the medical school \u2013 in partnership with Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Health System \u2013 are teaming up with researchers across different disciplines at Rutgers to find the best ways to improve care and curtail costs. This includes the School of Engineering, the Department of Psychology, and the School of Communication and Information.\n\nCredit: Nick Romanenko Physician Alfred Tallia at Robert Wood Johnson Medical Group\u2019s Family Medicine office at Monument Square.\n\n\u201cThe reason for Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers to be involved is to answer the many outstanding questions about how a system should work,\u2019\u2019 Tallia said. \u201cWe are in the best position not only to deliver care, but to also do the research to make it better.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor example, a professor in the School of Communication and Information plans to study the use of a patient portal, an online information hub that would allow patients to access test results and other health information. The technology will also allow patients to schedule appointments, request or renew prescriptions, pay bills and ask questions about their care.\n\nGraduate students from the Department of Psychology in the School of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology will work in a primary care practice to help patients quit smoking, improve eating habits and address other behavioral health issues.\n\nAnd professors in the School of Engineering will use mathematical modeling and statistical analysis to study workflow in the primary care office and define the role of a patient care coordinator. The person in this position would be dedicated to helping patients adhere to plans for their health, which could involve communicating with pharmacies to make sure prescriptions are filled, keeping tabs on exercise plans and coordinating appointments.\n\n\u201cPart of what the engineering department is going to do is help us make our care more efficient so we can spend more time on things that really matter,\u2019\u2019 said Elizabeth C. Clark, an assistant professor in the RWJMS Department of Family Medicine and Community Health.\n\n\u201cIf doctors are spending less time doing paperwork they will have more time to spend with patients,\u2019\u2019 Clark said.\n\nThe medical schools, nursing, pharmacy, and other professional programs at Rutgers can also build on lessons learned to train a team-based workforce suited to meet the health care needs of the future, Tallia said.\n\nBrian L. Strom, the incoming chancellor of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences who is also a primary care physician, echoed concerns about the health care system and called Tallia a \u201cnational leader in this area.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we need to move away from an episode-based disease management system,\u2019\u2019 Strom said.\n\n\u201cThis will require a multidisciplinary approach to population health, and a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating the new models of care that emerge, like the ACO planned by Dr. Tallia. Rutgers, with its depth and breadth across health and non-health fields, is enormously well positioned to be a leader in this field.\"\n\nA Timeline for Providing Care\n\nRobert Wood Johnson Partners is seeking approval to start treating Medicare patients early next year. The Affordable Care Act encourages the creation of such Accountable Care Organizations for Medicare patients, but most have been developed around hospital systems.\n\nRutgers would be one of the first academic institutions to launch such an organization, Tallia said.\n\nTallia is also talking to some of the state\u2019s major health insurers including Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, and the Medicaid program to expand next year into a statewide organization called Rutgers Health Partners.\n\nIn the meantime, the Robert Wood Johnson Partners would be modeled on the restructuring of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Group\u2019s Family Medicine office at Monument Square in New Brunswick. The primary care practice, which is part of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, has been organized into a \u201cpatient-centered medical home,\u201d where medical providers share information and work with patients to closely coordinate care.\n\nNearly 30 additional primary care practices have signed contracts to participate in the upcoming rollout of Robert Wood Johnson Partners.\n\nThe partnership would also include the 500 specialists in the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Group along with clinicians on staff at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and the other hospitals within the Robert Wood Johnson Health System.\n\nMedicare and insurance companies offer financial incentives for such reform efforts that meet benchmarks for improving care while moderating costs. Participating doctors, hospitals, and other providers would receive a share of the savings. And in Robert Wood Johnson Partners, patients may also share in the benefit.\n\nA Difference Patients Will Notice\n\nWhat this will mean for patients is seamless care, much like the experience Lou and Barbara Carcich have with the doctors at Monument Square, where some of the changes have already been introduced. When Barbara Carcich went for a follow-up visit after a hospital stay, the doctor had all the information about her illness and treatment at his fingertips.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to go through the whole thing again: why I went in, what happened,\u2019\u2019 said Carcich, of Somerset. \u201cYou know the information you usually have to retell, it was all there. My doctors in the hospital communicated and all care was coordinated with Dr. Tallia and his nursing team at Monument Square.\"\n\nAnd Lou Carcich finds it reassuring that Tallia and his cardiologist receive the results of his blood work simultaneously. \u201cI feel very confident and comfortable knowing that I have two doctors working for me who are both on the same page,\" he said.\n\nWhat the Somerset couple doesn\u2019t see is the coordination behind the scenes. Tallia and the cardiologist both have access to Lou Carcich\u2019s electronic medical records. If there is an issue Tallia wants the cardiologist to look into, he can make a note in the record for the cardiologist.\n\nTallia and other members of his team are looking forward to forming new partnerships with faculty from other academic units and research institutes at Rutgers \u2013 including the College of Nursing, the School of Social Work, the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers Center for State Health Policy and all the units of the new Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences \u2013 as Robert Wood Johnson Partners moves ahead.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the first tangible benefits of how the new Rutgers is going to serve the state of New Jersey in health care,\u2019\u2019 Tallia said. \u201cThis was not possible before. Now we have all the pieces under one roof.\u2019\u2019\n\nClick here to read other articles in the One Rutgers, A World of Discovery series.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The partnership would also include the 500 specialists in the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Group along with clinicians on staff at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and the other hospitals within the Robert Wood Johnson Health System.\nIn the meantime, the Robert Wood Johnson Partners would be modeled on the restructuring of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Group\u2019s Family Medicine office at Monument Square in New Brunswick.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep spending 18 percent or more of the Gross Domestic Product on health care, not cover everybody and have disappointing outcomes.\nDuring nearly three decades as a primary care physician, Alfred Tallia has identified a daunting list of flaws with the nation\u2019s health care.\n\u201cThis is one of the first tangible benefits of how the new Rutgers is going to serve the state of New Jersey in health care,\u2019\u2019 Tallia said."}
