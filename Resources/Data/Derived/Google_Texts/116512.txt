The Obama Administration’s prediction that people would shop for insurance at the last minute is proving true in state after state.

In Washington State, of the 65,000 people who've bought private insurance through Obamacare so far, 20,000 of those enrolled last weekend. In Kentucky, enrollments rose by 5,000 in the last week. Connecticut enrolled 6,700 on Monday alone.

In California, an unprecedented 100,000 customers have signed up since Friday.

“There was a huge surge,” said Peter Lee, the Executive Director of Covered California, the state-run health care marketplace.

“We think the fact that in four days we had over 100,000 people enroll -- as many as enrolled in 2 months -- shows not just that people are getting the message, but that they're spreading the message. They're telling friends and family members, which I think is going to carry into January February and March.”
