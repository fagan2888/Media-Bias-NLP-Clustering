It\u2019s based on legislation he introduced in the Senate in 2012, and he held a subcommittee hearing on the topic that same year.\n\n\u201cInstead of a system where the market is manipulated to keep out all competition, companies would be rewarded for their innovation with a cash prize for their medical innovations, rather than through the grant of a monopoly,\u201d the plan states.\n\nSanders said he also wants to expand the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program to double the number of people receiving HIV treatment by 2020.\n\nClinton is trying to lay out more details of her plans for HIV/AIDS treatment, too. In a Medium post this weekend, she called for more research on the disease, expanded access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to help prevent people from getting infected, and increased global funding for prevention and treatment.\n\nShe also wants to push Republican governors to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, which she said would help many people get treatment for the disease.\n\nSanders\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t enough to win the support of Larry Kramer, the writer and AIDS activist who blasted Clinton for her Nancy Reagan comments.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t believe Bernie can get any of his ideas, as wonderful as many of them may sound, off the ground,\u201d Kramer told STAT in an email.\n\nThe treatment options for HIV and AIDS have come a long way since the 1980s, with 25 different antiretroviral drugs now available. Combination pills also make it easier for people with the infection to keep up with their medications. But cost is still a barrier for many people \u2014 the problem Sanders and Clinton said they want to tackle.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health reserved 10 percent of its budget for HIV/AIDS research for many years but is reportedly letting that level of spending slip this year as some institutes have shown signs that they\u2019re having trouble spending the money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders's new plan would award $3 billion each year to companies developing HIV/AIDS drugs.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "Bernie Sanders's new plan would award $3 billion each year to companies developing HIV/AIDS drugs.", "title": "Sanders proposes cash prize for companies to make AIDS drugs affordable", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bernie-HIV-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-14T17:03:16-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/14/sanders-hiv-aids-prize/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders's new plan would award $3 billion each year to companies developing HIV/AIDS drugs.", "creator": "@DavidNather", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bernie-HIV-1024x576.jpg", "title": "Sanders proposes cash prize for companies to make AIDS drugs affordable", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "section": "Politics", "tag": "drug prices", "published_time": "2016-03-14T13:10:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T17:03:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aids, bernie sanders, drug prices"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28fb\"", "article_summary": "The treatment options for HIV and AIDS have come a long way since the 1980s, with 25 different antiretroviral drugs now available.\nBut cost is still a barrier for many people \u2014 the problem Sanders and Clinton said they want to tackle.\nSanders said he also wants to expand the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program to double the number of people receiving HIV treatment by 2020.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders called for a new strategy Monday to encourage drug companies to develop new HIV and AIDS therapies: give them a cash prize, but not the exclusive marketing rights that make the drugs too expensive for many patients.\nBy creating this $3 billion yearly prize, Sanders said he hopes to open up the new medicines to generic competition immediately \u2014 bringing down the costs and changing the incentives of a system that he says is designed to keep the prices artificially high."}
