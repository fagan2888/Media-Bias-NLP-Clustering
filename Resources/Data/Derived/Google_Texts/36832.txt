CHICAGO — The Avalanche will go with the same lineup as in the past two games Sunday night against Chicago, meaning defenseman Brandon Gormley — who was placed on and cleared waivers last week — will be a healthy scratch.

But Avalanche coach Patrick Roy emphasized that with Erik Johnson (lower body) and Brad Stuart (back) still out of the lineup, Gormley remains available to suit up and play if needed. Andrew Bodnarchuk, claimed on waivers from Columbus last week, will be playing his third game for Colorado and will be paired with Francois Beauchemin at even strength against the Blackhawks.

“Nothing has changed,” Roy said of Gormley after the Avalanche morning skate. “Obviously, hockey is a business sometimes and things could happen. Unfortunately for him, we thought that Stuart and E.J. might be back soon and we might have roster decisions to make. That will give us a little more flexibility, that’s all it is.”

Johnson will miss his third consecutive game Sunday night and he hasn’t yet started skating since suffering the injury against Los Angeles on Jan. 4. At the time, Roy estimated Johnson would be out five to 12 days. Stuart hasn’t played since Nov. 10 at Philadelphia.

“We’ll know more when he’s on the ice,” Roy said of Johnson. “But we haven’t put him on IR to show we think it’s a short period of time. It’s different for Brad Stuart. He didn’t do so well the last time (he skated). I’m not saying it’s a setback, it’s just going to take more time than we thought.”

The Avalanche will be seeking its fourth consecutive victory Sunday against the Blackhawks, who have won six consecutive games. A win or an overtime or shootout loss would pull the Avalanche ahead of the Nashville Predators in points (both have 45), but Colorado already has the edge in the standings and is sitting in the second Western Conference wild-card spot because of more regulation and overtime wins.
