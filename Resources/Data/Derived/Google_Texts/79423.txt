Thousands of books were given away to children Saturday in Greenville with the help of volunteers.

Volunteers, including Senator Don Davis, Greenville councilwoman Kandie Smith, Diane & Garrett Taylor of Taylor Made Publishing, Dede Carney and the women of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. helped pass out 20,000 books on Albemarle Avenue in Greenville.

Greenville Mayor Allen Thomas also helped hand out the books and said many non-profits and schools came from all across eastern North Carolina. An organization from as far as Tidewater, Virginia also stopped by to pick up books.

The books arrived Thursday, free of charge, thanks to the non-profit organization "First Book," which provides books and educational resources to schools and communities in need.

A local service organization is giving away thousands of children's books in an effort to improve literacy.

The Delta Sigma Theta sorority Greenville chapter, along with local book publisher Diane Taylor, are giving away 20,000 children's books this weekend.

The books arrived Thursday, free of charge, thanks to the non-profit organization "First Book," which provides books and educational resources to schools and communities in need.

Sorority members worked with Taylor to gather 1,000 participants in the program in order to qualify the Greenville area, alongside much larger cities like Miami and Chicago.

Taylor says books are an important part of childhood learning and development. She says, "All research shows that a tangible book does more than help actual reading and literacy. But it helps individuals, especially small children, learn how to use their hands. It enhances motor skills. It enhances comprehension. All the things that they'll need to start school and do well once they're in school."

The books will be handed out this Saturday at 713 Albemarle Ave. in Greenville.
