Henninger told WSJ editorial board member Mary Kissel that the ACA is the entitlement equivalent of Hurricane Katrina in terms of its political ramifications.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs this the beginning of a broader movement on the left to oppose the law,\u201d Kissel asked after noting that 15 congressional Democrats recently wrote the president to express their concerns about the problematic ACA rollout.\n\n\u201cWhat took so long for Democrats to figure out that Obamacare was going to roll out like this?\u201d Kissel asked Henninger. \u201cThey knew years ago what they signed, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Henninger replied with a laugh. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they didn\u2019t look very closely and now they are hitting the panic button,\u201d he continued. Henninger said that the closeness of the Virginia gubernatorial contest has heightened Democrats\u2019 sense of unease surrounding the ACA roll-out.\n\nRELATED: Jay Leno Roasts Obama Over \u2018A**-Backwards\u2019 Obamacare Rollout\n\nHe noted that Democrats are demanding the White House fix all the problems associated with the federal insurance exchanges website by the end of November, which is unlikely.\n\n\u201cThis has become the Hurricane Katrina of entitlements,\u201d Henninger added. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just the software, it isn\u2019t just the website, Mary, it\u2019s also the fact that people are having their insurance policies cancelled and finding that they\u2019re not going to be able to go see their doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to stop unless you basically blow up the Affordable Care Act because it is designed to move people towards the exchanges,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to see why the Democrats are going to get any relief from the bad press that\u2019s pouring out of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHenninger insisted that the president\u2019s statements that these eventualities would not materialize were flatly untrue. \u201cIn American politics, that\u2019s not good,\u201d Henninger said. \u201cThat causes the president huge political problems, as it did for Richard Nixon in Watergate and, of course, George W. Bush and Katrina.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the president is in a maelstrom and it\u2019s not obvious at all how he gets out of it, Mary,\u201d Henninger concluded.\n\nWatch the clip below via WSJ Live:\n\n[Photo via screen grab ]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Thursday, Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger discussed the growing sense of crisis among congressional Democrats surrounding the failed roll-out", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Kissel.jpg", "title": "WSJ\u2019s Daniel Henninger: Obamcare Is the \u2018Hurricane Katrina of Entitlements\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Thursday, Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger discussed the growing sense of crisis among congressional Democrats surrounding the failed roll-out of the Affordable Care Act.
