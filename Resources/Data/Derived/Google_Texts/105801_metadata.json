But recently some have begun to question its efficacy, noting that many smaller, nonprofit insurers get stuck with large government bills while larger, legacy carriers receive windfalls.\n\nIn fact, the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs pointed out that three-fourths of 35 new health plans had to pay into the program for 2014, FierceHealthPayer has reported.\n\nBut the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has not taken steps to fix the problems with the risk adjustment program, writes Dr. Peter Beilenson, the CEO of Maryland CO-OP Evergreen Health and a former Baltimore City health commissioner. This hurts CO-OPS--many of which have experienced financial troubles and shut down--as well as other new insurers, which goes against the ACA's goal of encouraging more competition in the health insurance marketplace, he says.\n\nThe erosion of competition is likely to drive premiums higher, pricing younger and healthier consumers out of the market and forcing insurers to raise premiums even more to cover the cost of a sicker risk pool, he adds.\n\nThe best way forward, Beilenson argues, is for CMS to limit the percentage of risk adjustment payments that insurers must make to no more than 2 percent of the carrier's premium for the year. \"This action would avert significant financial damage to the small insurance carriers that are so important to the success of the ACA,\" he writes.\n\nAnother of the three Rs--the risk corridor program--has also become a pain point for smaller insurers and CO-OPs. The program paid out only 12.6 of what it owed insurers for the 2014 benefit year, and shortfalls are expected to continue.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nIs the risk-adjustment program unfair to small insurers?\n\nKeeping it honest: New risk adjustment tracking system comes into play\n\nStruggling CO-OPs, small insurers form coalition to push for change\n\nSome insurers will take hit from risk corridor program shortfall", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal regulators' refusal to amend the risk-adjustment program threatens not only the viability of small insurers, but also the survival of the Affordable Care Act itself, the CEO of a consumer operated and oriented plan wrote in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0for the\u00a0Baltimore Sun.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Federal regulators' refusal to amend the risk-adjustment program threatens not only the viability of small insurers, but also the survival of the Affordable Care Act itself, the CEO of a consumer operated and oriented plan wrote in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0for the\u00a0Baltimore Sun.", "title": "CO-OP exec: Risk-adjustment issues threaten core of health reform", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/co-op-exec-risk-adjustment-issues-threaten-core-health-reform/2016-02-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,consumer operated and oriented plans (CO-OP),Evergreen Health Cooperative,Financial Management,Health Insurance Exchanges,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,risk adjustment program,three R's", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Financial Management,Health Insurance Exchanges,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the opinion pieceRelated Articles:Is the risk-adjustment program unfair to small insurers?\nIn fact, the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs pointed out that three-fourths of 35 new health plans had to pay into the program for 2014, FierceHealthPayer has reported.\nAnother of the three Rs--the risk corridor program--has also become a pain point for smaller insurers and CO-OPs.\nKeeping it honest: New risk adjustment tracking system comes into playStruggling CO-OPs, small insurers form coalition to push for changeSome insurers will take hit from risk corridor program shortfall\nBut the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has not taken steps to fix the problems with the risk adjustment program, writes Dr. Peter Beilenson, the CEO of Maryland CO-OP Evergreen Health and a former Baltimore City health commissioner."}
