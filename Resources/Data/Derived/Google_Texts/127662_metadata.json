Sheriff Tony Wolf said that a duck hunter drowned today after a boat he was in capsized.\n\nThe accident happened near the southwest part of the lake.\n\nThe original emergency was received at 7:42 a.m. indicating the hunter was trapped on the ice. He was trying to recover a duck he and his hunting partner had shot, using a makeshift boat with no motor.\n\nA Geary County Sheriff's release indicated that the boat was caught by the wind, pushed further out, at which time the boat began taking on water. The victim made it back to the ice sheet, was stranded and then fell through the ice.\n\nThe effort has now changed from rescue to recovery. Due to the weather conditions, the search has been suspended until the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks can launch a boat equipped with side scan sonar.\n\nNo name has been released as of noon Tuesday\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man has drowned at Milford Lake after his boat capsized while duck hunting.", "language": "english", "author": "wibw.com, Topeka", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Duck-hunter-drowns-on-Milford-Lake-237164731.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/milford-lake-hunter-drowns.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A man has drowned at Milford Lake after his boat capsized while duck hunting.", "title": "Duck hunter drowns on Milford Lake"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A man has drowned at Milford Lake after his boat capsized while duck hunting.", "title": "Duck hunter drowns on Milford Lake", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Duck-hunter-drowns-on-Milford-Lake-237164731.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/milford-lake-hunter-drowns.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Duck hunter drowns on Milford Lake", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Duck hunter drowns on Milford"}, "article_summary": "Geary County officials say that one man lost his life while hunting at Milford Lake this morning.\nSheriff Tony Wolf said that a duck hunter drowned today after a boat he was in capsized.\nHe was trying to recover a duck he and his hunting partner had shot, using a makeshift boat with no motor.\nThe original emergency was received at 7:42 a.m. indicating the hunter was trapped on the ice.\nA Geary County Sheriff's release indicated that the boat was caught by the wind, pushed further out, at which time the boat began taking on water."}
