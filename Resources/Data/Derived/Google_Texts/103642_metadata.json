The results of Forde\u2019s test were not immediately clear.\n\nHelfrich said the team has faced many issues during the season, including injuries. But he insisted that the team is not distracted heading into the first College Football Playoff title game.\n\n\u201cHow you manage those things is what matters most. And our guys have managed all those situations very, very well,\u201d Helfrich said.\n\nNot having Carrington leaves the Ducks down two key wide receivers against Ohio State. Carrington, a 6-foot-2, 191-pound redshirt freshman, had seven catches for 166 yards and two touchdowns in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory over Florida State.\n\nOregon quarterback Marcus Mariota said the team was disappointed. He hadn\u2019t been able to talk to Carrington.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time I think a lot of guys feel guilty like they should have helped, including myself,\u201d Mariota said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. But we\u2019ll have to be ready for the next one, whoever the next guy is to step up.\u201d\n\nLast week Oregon lost redshirt freshman receiver Devon Allen on the opening kickoff with a knee injury. Allen had 41 catches for 684 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nThe Ducks have also been playing for the last four games without star tight end Pharoah Brown, who went down with a season-ending leg injury against Utah.\n\nAnd before the season started, junior receiver Bralon Addison tore a ligament in his left knee. Although Addison said Saturday at the team\u2019s media availability in Dallas that he could play in the championship game, Oregon\u2019s coaches don\u2019t want to burn his redshirt year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had stuff happen all year long where a guys missed and the next guy has jumped in there and done a great job,\u201d receivers coach Matt Lubick said. \u201cOur guys are going to be fine.\u201d\n\nCarrington\u2019s absence leaves Oregon, which regularly uses three- and four-receiver formations, with Byron Marshall (66 catches for 834 yards), Dwayne Stafford (39 for 578), Keanon Lowe (25 for 359) and freshman Charles Nelson (11 for 101) to rely on.\n\n\u201cWe all know as receivers that we\u2019re going to have to step up. It\u2019s the last game of the season. We\u2019re going to have to make plays and play basically our best game ever,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cBut losing him, losing a great receiver and a great kid with a great talent, it\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nForde, a running back who is a contributor on special teams, played in all 14 games this season, with three carries for 17 yards. He had a carry for five yards in the Pac-12 championship against Arizona.\n\nThe NCAA does random drug testing for championship events and bowl games. Those tests can be done before or after an event and the school is given no notice about which players will be tested or how many players.\n\nA failed test for recreational drugs results in the NCAA requiring the school to declare the player ineligible. The penalty for a failed test is 50 percent of a season, which means Carrington and Forde could miss up to five games next season.\n\nOregon can appeal the NCAA ruling and ask that a player be reinstated.\n\n\u201cI think anytime you put something in your body that doesn\u2019t belong there it\u2019s a bad decision,\u201d Oregon offensive coordinator Scott Frost said.\n\nIn November, voters in Oregon approved Measure 91, which legalizes marijuana for recreational purposes. However, the law does not take effect until July 1.\n\nAssociated Press College Football Writer Ralph D.
