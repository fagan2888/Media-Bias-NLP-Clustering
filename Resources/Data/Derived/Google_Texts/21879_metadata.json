What about when you teacher asked you to bring in all those textbooks for the day? These factors are putting a strain on school children\u2019s backs, a new study says, and it could have implications for back problems later in life.\n\nA team of researchers, led by Ana Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, of the Biomechanics and Functional Morphology Laboratory of the University of Lisbon, in Portugal, studied 138 adolescents, ages 12 to 15. They compared the students\u2019 body sizes to their school\u2019s furniture dimensions and the weight of their backpacks.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the children reported back pain, for which the researchers found could be partially attributed to the large difference between desk height and elbow height. Differences in desk height also affected 59 percent of girls compared to 47 percent of boys. \u201cThese results highlight the importance to study the school environment to establish preventative programs for back pain in youths,\u201d the researchers wrote, according to a statement.\n\nReports of back and neck pain, and headaches, have increased in recent decades, the researcher said and these results don\u2019t only apply to Portuguese children either. According to the U.S. Product Safety Commission, backpack-related injuries send about 5,000 children to the emergency room, and more than 14,000 are treated for injuries each year, Knox News reported.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t place the blame solely on backpacks and low desks, however, saying that other factors, such as age, family clinical history, injury, gender, lifestyle, sport, stress, and anxiety could also have a role. They advised \u201cpromoting healthy lifestyles in what concerns physical activity and a balanced nutrition\u201d because so much of a student\u2019s time is spent sitting in their ergonomically unfit desk rather than getting enough daily physical activity.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that children get at least one hour of physical activity each day, with most of it being either moderate of vigorous intensity. The CDC also recommends bone and muscle strengthening exercises at least three days a week as well. These can include everything from jumping rope to swinging on playground bars to riding bicycles.\n\nIf you feel that your child\u2019s bag may be too heavy, you can find some tips to help them lighten the load here.\n\nSource: Assun\u00e7\u00e3o A, Carnide F, Vieira F, et al.
