Sgnarelle is a character that Moli\u00e8re, who was also an actor, played in various plays that he wrote, and the stock character of the deceived, buffoonish husband is one that comes from the Italian comic style of commedia d\u2019ell arte, which was heavily influential on Moli\u00e8re\u2019s work.\n\nAccording to a press release, Dr. Berkeley\u2019s \u201cDoctor\u201d will focus largely on the physical comedy and bawdiness that commedia d\u2019ell arte is known for. The theater department\u2019s new chair, Thomas Salzman, will serve as lighting designer for \u201cThe Doctor in Spite of Himself.\u201d\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sept. 25-27 and Oct. 2-4 and 2 p.m. Sept. 28 and Oct. 5 at the Mainstage Theatre in UNCW\u2019s Cultural Arts Building. $12; $10 for seniors, UNCW employees and alumni; $5 for students. 910-962-3500 or www.UNCW.edu/theatre", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 124987614282599}}, "article_summary": "In the play, Sgnarelle (Bruno Rose) is tricked by his wife, Martinne (Arianna Tysinger), into impersonating a doctor, even though, as a common woodcutter, he knows nothing about medicine.\nOn the surface, there seems to be plenty in \u201cThe Doctor in Spite of Himself,\u201d which satirizes the medical profession, that remains relevant in today\u2019s world of Obamacare and HMOs.\nAccording to a press release, Dr. Berkeley\u2019s \u201cDoctor\u201d will focus largely on the physical comedy and bawdiness that commedia d\u2019ell arte is known for.\n$12; $10 for seniors, UNCW employees and alumni; $5 for students.\nThe theater department\u2019s new chair, Thomas Salzman, will serve as lighting designer for \u201cThe Doctor in Spite of Himself.\u201dDetails: 8 p.m. Sept. 25-27 and Oct. 2-4 and 2 p.m. Sept. 28 and Oct. 5 at the Mainstage Theatre in UNCW\u2019s Cultural Arts Building."}
