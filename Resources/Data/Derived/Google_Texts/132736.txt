DULUTH, Ga. — NCR Corp. announced Monday that the Army and Air Force Exchange Service will replace 6,000 point-of-sale terminals with NCR RealPOS 72XRT systems.

Built with Intel processors inside and featuring Intel Active Management Technology, the 72XRT provides more intelligent processing power to drive new applications, remote manageability and enhanced security to deliver value for the Exchange.

“The Army and Air Force Exchange Service needed a flexible and dependable solution to deliver its high levels of customer service worldwide,” said Stan Ratcliffe, president, NCR Government Systems. “We are pleased to be working closely with them as they enhance their store experience to families on location worldwide.”

The Exchange provides goods and services at comparatively low prices to American armed forces families. It operates more than 3,100 facilities worldwide, in more than 30 countries, five U.S. territories and 50 states.
