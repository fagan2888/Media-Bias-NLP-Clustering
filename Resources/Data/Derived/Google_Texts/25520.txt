Angelina Spencer of Naples, a former "exotic dancer" and "adult club" owner, is leading the public relations effort to get strip-club owners to work with federal agents in trying to combat human trafficking and the child sex trade, the Tampa Tribune reports. Itâ€™s a big problem in Florida, and especially in Tampa Bay, which ranks third in the country for the illegal trade.



The Tribune reports that federal agents use educational videos to teach the employees of nightclubs how to spot signs of human trafficking. Meanwhile, The Tampa Bay Times has a Q&A with a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, Dotti Groover-Skipper, who became a self-esteem instructor and now chairs the human trafficking community outreach campaign (paywall alert).
