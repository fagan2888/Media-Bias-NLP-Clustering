Lawmakers could change the landmark 1996 privacy law as soon as next year. The Morning Consult\u2019s Jonathan Easley reported Sunday on a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing where witnesses pleaded with Congress to address the law and allow providers to better take advantage of technology to improve patient care. The use of cloud computing is one example that is strangled by HIPAA, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global public policy said last week. Advocates of big data analytics and integrating behavior health into mainstream medicine say these areas also are hurt. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been getting an earful about HIPAA during its 21st Century Cures hearings. Chair Fred Upton has said the committee hopes to start drafting legislation by the end of the year, with the goal of passing a bill in early 2015. It\u2019s increasingly likely changes to HIPAA would be included.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRead the Morning Consult story here: http://bit.ly/1uwWwGY.

The potential impact of the rule is huge. Federal health officials say that 33.7 million individuals have had their health information stolen, hacked or otherwise wrongfully disclosed \u2014 more than one in 10 people in the U.S. since 2009.\n\nTo date, courts have refused to compensate anyone whose records were stolen or viewed unless they can show that harm resulted. But HHS was instructed by the 2009 HITECH Act to define who is a \u201charmed individual\u201d and allowed a percentage of penalties and settlements related to HIPAA violations. \u201cI think it could be a real game changer, but I couldn\u2019t guarantee that,\u201d said Jo-Ellyn Sakowitz Klein, a health privacy expert and attorney at Akin Gump. \u201cThe devil would be in the details. It would depend on how far the agency went in the rule making.\u201d\n\nPros get the story here: http://politico.pro/1ny82gB\n\neHealth tweet of the day: @ReportingHealth Technology can\u2019t replace the face to face in medicine http://bit.ly/UrhczP\n\nWelcome the Monday edition of Morning eHealth where I\u2019m your guest host. We\u2019re still beaming from eHealth Editor Arthur Allen\u2019s successful book reading at Politics & Prose Bookstore in Washington yesterday evening. If you haven\u2019t heard, his book on how two typhus experts outsmarted the Nazis was published this month. Send your tips, comments and feedback to dpittman@politico.com.

The American Telemedicine Association holds its This Month in Telemedicine on Tuesday. On Thursday, the House Small Business Committee hosts a hearing on telemedicine\u2019s use in small medical practices. The Health IT Policy Committee\u2019s JASON taskforce meets the same day.\n\nMorning eHealth has also learned about a bipartisan meeting of the Senate Finance and HELP committees Tuesday regarding health IT. It\u2019s part of a series of discussions the committees are holding with stakeholder groups throughout the recess to gain feedback on the meaningful use program. \u201cOne key goal is to come away with guidance on how to ensure we\u2019ll have interoperability,\u201d a committee staffer told us. We\u2019re following the story.\n\nHAVE MORE EVENTS? Let us know and we\u2019ll include it on our calendar. Drop us a line at ehealthcalendar@politicopro.com.\n\nONC RESPONDS: Karen DeSalvo, national coordinator for health IT, fired back Sunday at a hard-hitting Boston Globe article from July 20 that questioned the safety of EHRs. DeSalvo, in a letter to the editor, called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d the story failed to mention the benefits the technology can bring. \u201cA fully electronic health system can help identify and prevent potential medical errors,\u201d she said, going on to mention her work to create a health IT safety center.\n\nRead DeSalvo\u2019s letter to the editor here: http://bit.ly/1tRaYpd.

The protester, DC-based Iron Vines, successfully argued that CMS failed to evaluate the realism of vendors\u2019 bids, specifically their labor costs. Iron Vines bid $30 million for the project but lost out to Spann and Associates, which bid $20 million. GAO recommended that CMS re-evaluate bids and reimburse Iron Vines the cost of its protest. The solicitation sought services, personnel, material equipment and facilities to support information security program activities for CMS\u2019s Enterprise Information Security Group. The GAO decision was released in January but held under a protective order until a redacted version was released Friday. The decision: http://1.usa.gov/1nLJiSU\n\nNAME CHANGE FOR AAFP HEALTH IT CENTER: The American Academy of Family Physicians\u2019 Center for Health Information Technology will now be called the Alliance for eHealth Innovation as it shifts its focus and priorities. As family doctors have adopted EHRs, the academy wants to focus on optimizing their use and potential. \u201cThis new direction focuses more broadly on eHealth,\u201d said Alliance Director Steven Waldren. Read more about it here: http://bit.ly/X1i3so.\n\nICYMI: TAXPAYERS SHOULD FRONT NATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE: A national health information exchange infrastructure will cost U.S. citizens each from $1.50 to $2 per year, DeSalvo estimated Friday. That cost, which amounts to around $450-$650 million, should be paid by taxpayers and not health care providers, she said during an appearance before the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s National Advisory Council.\n\nMeaningful use program funding is starting to dry up, and most of the $2 billion in incentive money budgeted to ONC projects such as health information exchanges is spent, DeSalvo noted. But there will be continuing costs, she indicated, to reach the national goal of interoperability.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expected the health care system to pay for that. That\u2019s not right. In a fee-for-service system, to ask providers to pay for it is perverse, because it\u2019s a burden on them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want it to be free so you are encouraged to use it all the time. It\u2019s a public good \u2026 it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\n\nPros get the story here: http://politico.pro/1mTfxd2\n\nSTUDY ON TELEMED SAVINGS \u2018MISLEADING\u2019: A study published earlier this month that questioned the potential cost savings of telemedicine is misleading and puts forth \u201cunwarranted conclusions,\u201d a leading researcher and former American Telemedicine Association president wrote in a rebuttal. The study in question deemed the cost-effectiveness of the technology \u201cinconclusive\u201d after reviewing nine studies that met researchers\u2019 inclusion criteria. However, Rashid Bashshur of the University of Michigan Health System\u2019s eHealth Center questioned the study\u2019s methodology, saying the researchers filtered out some of the most important studies. Only three of the nine included in the \u201creview of reviews\u201d were published in the last five years.Bashshur teamed up with economist Timothy Reardon to dissect the study in a letter to the editor set to be published in the next issue of Telemedicine and e-Health.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING\n\nThe L.A.
