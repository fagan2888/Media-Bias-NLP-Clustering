Storefront Inc.\n\nHe says Storefront is just beginning to \u201copen up the eyes\u201d of property owners to the possibility of making money from their real estate assets with short-term agreements and greater flexibility than leases.\n\nFor those who believe that mobile and online shopping may \u201ckill\u201d brick-and-mortar shopping altogether, according to the 2013 Deloitte Annual Holiday Survey 66% of Americans planned to spend over one-third of their holiday budget at local, small and independent business venues.\n\nSuch venues comprise a growing segment of listings on Storefront.\n\nCo-founders Erik Eliason and Tristan Pollock plan to use their company\u2019s funding to bring Storefront\u2019s services to major metropolitan areas in and beyond North America. It is currently operating in San Francisco, New York and newly in Los Angeles.\n\nThe company has managed to win over independent artists, and huge celebrities alike to selling in pop-up shops and temporary spaces. Kanye West used a Storefront space to sell branded merchandise for about a week ahead of a huge concert in New York last year, noted Erik Eliason, Storefront CEO.\n\nStorefront leaves the pricing consideration up to property owners, and does not buy or lease property itself. The company makes revenue as a percentage of each transaction paid by both the property owner and the renter of the property.\n\nAccording to original research by Storefront, merchants spend some $80 billion on temporary spaces to sell their goods each year in the U.S. alone Mr. Eliason said.\n\nJoining Spark in the Series A investment are Storefront\u2019s earlier backers\u2013Mohr Davidow Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital, 500 Startups and Box Group\u2013and new investors including SV Angel, Gary Vaynerchuk, the rapper Nas (subject of the forthcoming documentary \u2018Time is Illmatic\u2019), Tom Glocer, Vikram Pandit and Troy Carter.\n\nCORRECTION 4/14/14: An earlier version of this story said Spark Capital invested in Shopify. It did not. The story has been corrected.\n\nWrite to Lora Kolodny at lora.kolodny@wsj.com.
