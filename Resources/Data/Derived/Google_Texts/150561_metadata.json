A hearing was scheduled for Tuesday before Judge Kevin Gross to consider the request.\n\nTrump Entertainment filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month and shut its other Atlantic City hotel, the Plaza, bringing to four the number of the city's casinos that have closed this year. Atlantic City started the year with 12 casinos, but the casino attendance numbers have dwindled dramatically in recent years as neighboring states have embraced gaming as a way to boost government revenues.\n\nIcahn is Trump Entertainment's main creditor. He is owed $286 million, and has proposed converting that debt into ownership of the company.\n\nTrump Entertainment's Taj Mahal was the city's largest casino when it opened in 1990, and currently employs about 3,000. Of that, 1,136 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Unite Here Local 54, according to court documents.\n\nUnite Here President Bob McDevitt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump Entertainment said in court filings the union was distributing flyers to encourage its members to rally against the company and to call the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe contract Trump Entertainment wants to impose would move unionized workers to a 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan. The company would end its health insurance coverage, but it would increase pay for full-time employees by $2,000 to help pay for purchasing insurance on exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSeparately, the company is seeking $25 million in tax credits, a freeze on its tax rate for five years and a reduction in its assessed value of its real estate - to $248 million for the Taj Mahal from $1 billion, according to court documents.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing is the fifth for the various owners of the two casinos, according to Fitch Ratings. Trump Entertainment emerged from its last bankruptcy in 2010, with a plan backed by Marc Lasry's Avenue Capital Management investment funds. Real estate developer Donald Trump held a minority stake, which he has said he no longer holds.\n\nThe case is In Re: Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No.
