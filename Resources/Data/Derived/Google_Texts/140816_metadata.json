The 2016 election year is going to be a big, busy one for health policy. Pro\u2019s Jen Haberkorn has a handy list of some big stories coming down the pipe, including a landmark Supreme Court case that will determine how far states can go to limit abortion. SCOTUS will hear the case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Cole, in March and the ruling, which could be the most significant abortion decision in a generation, is likely in June. \u201dIt will have implications far beyond Texas, defining how states can limit abortion access and regulate doctors and clinics,\" Jen writes. \"And the timing guarantees that it will play into how the 2016 presidential candidates talk about abortion, and potentially energize voters on both sides of the divide.\u201d We\u2019ll also be watching the House Republicans' legal challenge to Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies. And speaking of Obamacare, we\u2019ll be keeping our eyes on the health care law before it gets handed to the next administration. Jen writes, \u201cBeyond that, 2016 is the last opportunity the administration has to directly influence the president's signature domestic policy legacy, especially if a Republican president is elected.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Then there are the mega insurer mergers. Congress, the states and the Justice Department are watching the Aetna deal to buy Humana and the Anthem deal to buy Cigna. A Senate subcommittee has already grilled Aetna and Anthem on consolidation plans and more investigation is expected in 2016. The deals, if successful, aren\u2019t expected before the summer.\n\n\u2014 We'll also be tracking whether political pressure on drugmakers will grow. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both been critical of drug companies \u2014 Clinton has made it a focal point of her campaign. But will the pressure continue? We\u2019ll be watching. The story for Pro\u2019s here: http://politico.pro/1JSH9vE\n\nOBAMA\u2019S LAST YEAR HEALTH PRIORITIES: OPIOID EPIDEMIC, E-CIG REGS, DRUG PRICES \u2014 The Obama administration will focus, as always, on fending off attacks on the president\u2019s signature health care law, but Pro's Brett Norman and Paul Demko report that \u201cthe final year will also be marked by efforts to curtail a deadly opioid epidemic, fight soaring prescription drug prices and deliver a long-awaited rule on expanded tobacco oversight.\u201d More from Brett and Paul: http://politico.pro/1NU41fY\n\nGOOD MONDAY MORNING and welcome to the first Pulse of 2016, where we're excited to be back from a wonderful holiday break with family, friends and food, so much food. We've told you some of what we expect for health policy in the new year \u2014 but we'll of course be on the lookout for more so send us your tips, predictions and scoops over to behley@politico.com and emershon@politico.com.\n\nRock your body right\n\nPULSE is back, alright\n\nFRIENDLY REMINDER \u2014 State Week and Prescription Pulse will be back Tuesday.\n\nCREDIT RISKS FOR INSURANCE MEGADEALS \u2014 Insurance mega mergers could pose credit risks for the companies involved, according to a new report by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Specifically, Anthem and Cigna could see their credit ratings downgraded by up to two notches, while Aetna could face a one-notch downgrade. That\u2019s because the companies are taking on significant debt to finance the blockbuster deals, more than $40 billion in the case of Anthem\u2019s takeover of Cigna. But the biggest risk for the companies involved is that the deals could be thwarted by state and federal regulators. \u201cThese deals are unprecedented in their size, complexity, and simultaneous nature,\u201d S&P notes. \u201cTherefore, we expect the review process to be lengthy as it will involve both the DOJ and multiple state regulators, each with their own local interests.\u201d The report for Pro subscribers: http://politico.pro/1PFc5E2\n\n** A message from the United Health Foundation: How does your state rank on leading health indicators? The United Health Foundation just released America\u2019s Health Rankings 26th Annual Report that provides analysis of national health on a state-by-state basis by evaluating a historical and comprehensive set of health, environmental and socioeconomic data.

The House Rules Committee is expected to meet Tuesday to take up the Obamacare repeal vote which was approved by the Senate through reconciliation. The full House is expected to vote on the measure this week.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH WATCH ON THE HILL \u2014 We\u2019re expecting two big mark ups and one hearing on comprehensive mental health reform this month. On the House side, the Energy and Commerce Committee is planning to hold a full committee markup on Rep. Tim Murphy\u2019s bill, which still faces steep opposition from Democrats in the E&C subcommittee, but has dozens of Democratic supporters in the full House. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also touted it as the chamber\u2019s response to recent mass shootings.\n\n\u2014 On the Senate side, the HELP Committee is expected to take up Sens. Chris Murphy and Bill Cassidy\u2019s reform bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee is also expected to hold a hearing on Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s mental health and criminal justice reform bill, which faces opposition from Democrats because it includes NRA-backed gun language.\n\nEMPLOYER MANDATE IN FULL SWING \u2014 It\u2019s finally fully in effect, now that it\u2019s 2016. But we can\u2019t rule out that Congress would revisit it \u2014 or the 30 hour workweek for insurance coverage purposes \u2014 one way or another this year.\n\nREPORT: PATIENTS STILL GIVEN OPIOIDS AFTER OVERDOSING \u2014 A report from researchers at Boston University and Harvard University found that more than 9 in 10 chronic-pain patients who survived an opioid overdose continued getting the drugs prescribed and were at high risk of overdosing again. The study found that 70 percent of the overdose patients got those opioid prescriptions from the same doctor who prescribed the drugs before the overdose. More from Pro\u2019s Brett Norman: http://politico.pro/1QRu7q4\n\nFASTER WAY TO TRACK FLU EPIDEMICS? LOOK TO THE CLOUD \u2014 If research pans out, Cloud-based health records could track flu epidemics faster than the CDC and more accurately than GOOGLE, Pro eHealth\u2019s Arthur Allen reports. Last year, researchers at Harvard used data from CDC, Google and social media along with reports from EHR vendor athenahealth\u2019s database to provide real-time flu trends and accurate predictions for up to two weeks. More here: http://politico.pro/1mtdrs6\n\nCHECKING IN WITH TAVENNER AT AHIP \u2014 After leaving CMS, Tavenner has been focusing on the accessibility and cost side of health care. Pro\u2019s Jen Haberkorn has the details: As AHIP CEO, Tavenner said her priorities will be addressing medical costs, working with the pharmaceutical industry to address drug costs and preserving a relationship with the government on issues such as Medicare Advantage. For years, AHIP has led the pushback against proposed cuts by the Obama administration to the private insurance alternative to traditional Medicare. More from Jen here: http://politico.pro/22yDiza\n\nCMS\u2019S MANDY COHEN TALKS COVERAGE ISSUES AND PAYMENT REFORM \u2014 CMS\u2019s chief of staff and chief operating officer joined a POLITICO Emerging Health Care Leaders event before the holiday break and discussed her focus for 2016 \u2014 private insurance marketplaces and health care delivery reform. Pro\u2019s Rachana Pradhan has the details for Pros: http://politico.pro/1JJ5Ieg\n\nICYMI: Q&A WITH CMS QUALITY CHIEF \u2014 Pro's Erin Mershon sat down with CMS' quality chief Kate Goodrich.

Dean Heller became the unlikely hero for the labor lobby's big end of the year victory in the form of the Cadillac tax delay. More from Nancy: http://politico.pro/1OWmus1\n\nCONSUMER GROUPS AND INSURERS FIGHT OVER 2017 OBAMACARE RULES \u2014 Insurers and state regulators are at odds with consumer groups over the 2017 Obamacare rules, Pro's Paul Demko reports.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
