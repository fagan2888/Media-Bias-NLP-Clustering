Based on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s team-leading 13 points with the Buffalo Sabres, one can suggest the Avs are taking a beating.\n\nIt does not, however, dub the six-player deal a disaster for Colorado.\n\nIn the long term, the Avs could still prevail, with all four return pieces 21 or younger \u2014 but undoubtedly it\u2019s another reason Avs fans are losing faith.\n\nDespite his tender age, Zadorov, 20, was considered the big addition in June, when the Avs sent O\u2019Reilly to Buffalo, along with Jamie McGinn, for Zadorov, fellow Russian Mikhail Grigorenko, University of Michigan captain J.T. Compher and a second-round draft pick.\n\nGrigorenko, 21, has played in 11 of the Avs\u2019 14 games but still is looking for his first goal and has produced just seven shots. He is where we thought he would be. McGinn, who missed most of last season with a back injury, has played all 14 games for the Sabres and is tied for their fifth-leading scorer.\n\nIndeed, the comparison hurts right now.\n\nUpon making the deal, Colorado immediately pegged the 6-foot-5 Zadorov as the left-shooting partner with Tyson Barrie on the second pairing. But after training camp, the Avs didn\u2019t think Zadorov was developed enough to play big minutes. He has played mostly on the third pairing and was scratched in three of the last four games.\n\nMake no mistake, Zadorov has great promise and could become a franchise defenseman. But like the Avalanche \u2014 2-7-1 in its last 10 games \u2014 Zadorov isn\u2019t ready to compete at the highest level.\n\nWith the right attitude, Zadorov will prosper with the San Antonio Rampage and be better prepared in his next stint with the Avalanche.\n\nIf nothing else, he will enjoy playing on a winning team. The Rampage was unbeaten (5-0-3) entering Saturday\u2019s game at the Texas Stars.\n\nChoose \u201cPicks.\u201d The Avalanche\u2019s most exciting AHL prospect is goalie Calvin Pickard, who led the NHL in save percentage during parts of last season. Pickard, 23, is capable of stealing wins with consistency, something Semyon Varlamov and Reto Berra have not done.\n\nGranted, Berra has played well in five starts. But your backup isn\u2019t supposed to regularly outplay your high-priced former star.\n\nBased on the last 13 months, the Avs\u2019 best goaltender is Pickard, who is 5-0-2 with San Antonio and last week was named the AHL\u2019s inaugural 2015-15 goalie of the month. In 16 NHL appearances last season, Pickard easily put up the Avs\u2019 best goaltender numbers (2.35 goals-against average, .932 save percentage).\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t control any type of call-ups and things like that,\u201d Pickard said Saturday when reached by phone. \u201cLast year I had some success, and I feel like I can compete at that level. That will happen when the time comes.\u201d\n\nBesides Varlamov\u2019s 35-save performance in a 2-1 victory at Tampa Bay on Oct. 29, he has been next to awful. Among 42 NHL goalies with five appearances, Varlamov is 37th in goals-against average (3.26) and 36th in save percentage (.890).\n\nVarlamov\u2019s $5.9 million annual contract through 2018-19 should not keep him as Colorado\u2019s No. 1 guy. Berra or Pickard should be No. 1B and challenge the Russian.\n\nPickard deserves a chance and could boost a team in dire straights heading into a seven-game road trip that begins Tuesday at Philadelphia.\n\nIn preseason, Avs coach Patrick Roy challenged Pickard to become the AHL\u2019s best goalie. Pickard did just that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this league for three years now, and I feel confident that I could be one of the best goalies in the league, even if he didn\u2019t say that,\u201d said Pickard, who is on a two-way contract and waiver exempt. \u201cWe have a good team here. We\u2019re jelling as a team, and I\u2019m getting in a rhythm when you\u2019re playing all the games.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers @denverpost.com or @mikechambers\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nBrad Marchand, LW, Boston Bruins\n\nWhen: Amid a franchise-tying seven-game road trip, the Avalanche plays at Boston\u2019s TD Garden on Thursday, after the trip opener Tuesday at Philadelphia.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The 5-foot-9 Marchand had nine points (five goals) in his first 10 games. Upon returning from injury during a span when he missed the Bruins\u2019 game at Colorado, Marchand produced a six-game scoring streak (nine points). Although he has missed two games, his five goals were second on the team entering Saturday\u2019s game at Montreal.\n\nBackground: Marchand, 27, is from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was drafted by Boston in the third round (71st overall), in 2006. In his first full season with the Bruins, he hoisted the Stanley Cup in 2011 after scoring 11 goals in 25 playoff games\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Marchand is in the Andrew Shaw and Steve Downie mold. Undersized and unafraid. Huge hockey hearts will never be undervalued in this game. Young, pesky players will always find a place. Marchand is a bit more skilled than most, having scored 21 goals in his four full NHL seasons. Love him on your team, hate to play against him. It\u2019s exactly how he wants to be remembered.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chambers: Nikita Zadorov-Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade will take years to evaluate", "title": "Chambers: Nikita Zadorov-Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade will take years to evaluate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/07/chambers-nikita-zadorov-ryan-oreilly-trade-will-take-years-to-evaluate/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T19:34:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:30:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But like the Avalanche \u2014 2-7-1 in its last 10 games \u2014 Zadorov isn\u2019t ready to compete at the highest level.\nIn 16 NHL appearances last season, Pickard easily put up the Avs\u2019 best goaltender numbers (2.35 goals-against average, .932 save percentage).\nDefenseman Nikita Zadorov\u2019s demotion to the American Hockey League on Saturday further points to the Avalanche as the short-term loser in the Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade.\nGrigorenko, 21, has played in 11 of the Avs\u2019 14 games but still is looking for his first goal and has produced just seven shots.\nBased on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s team-leading 13 points with the Buffalo Sabres, one can suggest the Avs are taking a beating."}
