Some will be drowning in permits and taxes and paperwork, \u201cand then overlaid upon it \u2026 will be this alternative America, a lawless America, where people have fake paperwork and nobody minds,\u201d Steyn said. People won\u2019t be legal immigrants, but a blind eye will be turned, he said.\n\nBeck asked Steyn what will happen if the president takes executive action to legalize millions of illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s figured that it\u2019ll be like Obamacare, where people say \u2018We\u2019re going to repeal this! \u2026 It\u2019s dead, it\u2019s finished, it\u2019s over.\u2019 And then six months, a year goes by and they\u2019re talking about, maybe they\u2019ll try to reform it. Maybe they\u2019ll eliminate the medical appliances tax,\u201d Steyn said. \u201cAnd suddenly it\u2019s less talk about killing Obamacare and more about living with it. And Obama has figured that you can do an awful lot to this country, and the Republicans will do what they are best at doing, which is playing catch-up and living with it.\u201d\n\nBut Steyn said that someone has to stop the out-of-control spending because we are racing towards the \u201ctotal collapse of the dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe minute the dollar collapses, you won\u2019t be able to go to Walmart and live the life you used to live,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crash will be brutal and destructive, and it\u2019s why it\u2019s better to fight it now, and it\u2019s why it\u2019s better to insist that instead of Republicans being happy to go off the cliff in third gear, and offering that as an alternative, that they actually try to move people off this fatalism. Because the fatalism is un-American, Glenn.\u201d\n\nSteyn also emphasized the importance of winning the culture.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make some feature films. Let\u2019s get a TV studio going. Let\u2019s actually get back in the game of where ideas live,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in a Democratic society, politics reflects the culture. And if you have 50 million people on food stamps and 47 percent not paying federal income tax and all this other stuff, eventually it\u2019s not going to be able to drag a guy with an \u2018R\u2019 after his name over the finish line.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not in the storytelling business, you\u2019re going to lose,\u201d Steyn concluded.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
