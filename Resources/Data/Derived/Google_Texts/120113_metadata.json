Ware refused to let officers test his blood.\n\nWare said he has no recollection after the moment of impact and only remembers getting booked into Potter County jail hours later. He bonded out of jail that morning.\n\nAssistant defense attorney Audrey Mink questioned whether probation was a good fit for Ware, who was convicted in 2011 for driving under the influence and also admitted to drinking alcohol while on probation.\n\nWare also failed the ignition interlock device on his car six times and drove a work vehicle that had no ignition interlock system in violation of his probation, prosecutors argued.\n\nThe Encinias family has won a civil lawsuit against General Motors for a faulty airbag that didn\u2019t deploy in the crash. They also sued Crush, Butlers, Skooterz and the Circus Room, the bars Ware visited the night of the accident.\n\nThe Encinias family\u2019s attorney in those cases, Jesse Quackenbush, said he discovered through interviews that Ware consumed about 28 alcoholic drinks before the accident.\n\n\u201cThe real shame here is that the family is really disappointed in the prosecution\u2019s efforts,\u201d Quackenbush said.\n\n\u201cIt has taken two to three years for a simple DWI prosecution. This lady was a pillar in the community and was six months away from retirement. It looks like special treatment on its face.\u201d\n\nKelly presented pictures of Ware\u2019s children, nieces and nephews and paintings Ware had been doing in therapy.\n\nWare \u2014 the son of William Ware, an Amarillo banking icon who died in 2012 \u2014 said he learned in alcohol rehabilitation that alcoholism is a disease. He told the jury he is a \u201closs of control\u201d type of alcoholic who will go without a drink for days and then binge drink and lose control.\n\nWare said he had continued to drink and blamed changes in the Affordable Care Act for making it too expensive for him to buy prescription medicine that prevents alcoholics from drinking.\n\n\u201cThe biggest demon I have is not being able to apologize to Mrs. Encinias and ask for forgiveness,\u201d Ware said through tears during the trial on Wednesday. \u201cThe pain I put that family through is very hard to deal with, and not being able to apologize makes it worse.\n\n\u201cGod intervened that night, and I know she is up there and I\u2019ve tried to talk to her. I hope there\u2019s some good to come from this event.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Latest News, Local News, Crime and Courts, News, AARON DAVIS", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "An Amarillo man was sentenced to 15 years in prison nearly three years after he was arrested and charged in a fatal drunken driving incident downtown on Polk Street.", "title": "Man gets 15 years for DUI death", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2016-02-24/man-gets-15-years-dui-death", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/15148962.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "An Amarillo man was sentenced to 15 years in prison more than two and a half years after he was arrested and charged in a fatal drunken driving incident downtown.Earlier this week in 108th District Court, Billy Don \u201cB.D.\u201d Ware, 39, pleaded guilty to a charge of intoxication manslaughter in the 2013 incident that killed Mary Nancy Encinias, a 61-year-old custodial foreman for Potter County.Ware initially pleaded not guilty in August, but recently switched his plea to guilty and asked for community supervision instead of jail time."}, "article_summary": "The Encinias family has won a civil lawsuit against General Motors for a faulty airbag that didn\u2019t deploy in the crash.\nProsecutors said Thursday that Ware initially told police Encinias ran the red light and missed another truck by 14 inches.\nWare initially pleaded not guilty in August, but recently switched his plea to guilty and asked for community supervision instead of jail time.\nAn Amarillo man was sentenced to 15 years in prison more than two and a half years after he was arrested and charged in a fatal drunken driving incident downtown.\nPolice records show Ware smelled of alcohol and officers noted he slurred his speech and staggered when walking."}
