The state received 186 of those kids.\n\nTexas led all states for placements this year, with 4,280 unaccompanied children, followed by New York, California and Florida.\n\nExperts said that the low number of placements in Arizona points to the relatively small population of Central Americans living in the state.\n\n\u201cGiven just the basic demographic distribution of those communities, Arizona is not a major Guatemalan, Honduran or Salvadoran place of destination,\u201d said Luis Plascencia, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Social and Behavioral Sciences.\n\nFrom Oct. 1 through June 30, more than 43,000 unaccompanied immigrant children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras showed up at the U.S. border, mostly in Texas.\n\nUnder current law, children from Central America who are caught in this country illegally have to be screened by Customs and Border Protection and are then supposed to be turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours.\n\nOnce there, the Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for care of the children in HHS shelters, until a family member or another sponsor in the United States can be located. The child is then put in the sponsor\u2019s care for the duration of his or her immigration proceedings.\n\nThe surge of children overwhelmed Border Patrol facilities in Texas, forcing the agency to move children to facilities in other states for processing, including Arizona. The agency sent 5,479 children to a processing facility in Nogales between May 31 and July 22.\n\nAs Border Patrol caught up on the backlog of cases, however, it was able to stop shipping children to places like Nogales. Most of those children have since moved on, and moved out of the state.\n\n\u201cMost of those kids get placed usually with a family member in the U.S. if one can be identified, and there\u2019s very few Central Americans in Arizona,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cWhat you would expect is that most of these children would end up in the states that have a lot of Central Americans living in them,\u201d Rosenblum said.\n\nArizona is not one of those states.\n\nJust 0.9 percent of the Central American-born population in the U.S. is in Arizona, while people from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras made up 3 percent of the state\u2019s foreign-born population in 2010, according to the Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cLess than 1 percent of the Central American-born immigrants in the U.S. are from Arizona so it\u2019s not surprising that less than 1 percent of the placements are being placed there,\u201d Rosenblum said.\n\nTucsonSentinel.com's original reporting and curation of border and immigration news is generously supported in part by a grant from the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation.\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": "http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/080814_passing_through/few-unaccompanied-minors-staying-arizona/", "twitter": {"description": "More than 5,000 unaccompanied immigrant children were sent to Arizona for processing by Customs and Border Protection this summer, but fewer than 200 of them ended up staying in the state.
