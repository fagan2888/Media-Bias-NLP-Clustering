In all the hoopla about downtown Tucson's resurgence, there has always been a bit of concern about "when it will come to an end" or at least slow down.

2016 does not appear to be the time.

The year begins with ground broken on a new 135-room urban Hotel Marriott, work on the new One West Broadway underway, and plans to start work on 43 row houses on Stone Avenue.

The city and Peach Properties are working on design and a development plan for a $150 million project at The Ronstadt Transit Center. A financial package is also in the works.

The Arizona Hotel on 6th Avenue is being remodeled.

Don Bourn has submitted plans for his seven-story development on Congress Street.

A new bar, Batch Donuts and Whiskey opened its doors in a space formerly occupied by a wine bar that closed only hours earlier. If and when one closes, others are waiting in the wings.

There are other things in the talking stages.

There has been some discussion between Humberto Lopez and the city about economic incentives for La Placita Village and Hotel Arizona.

So far, the talks have not borne fruit but there is talk nonetheless.

Many people are holding their collective breath until Nor-Generations shows if it has the financials and plans for the arena parcel next to Interstate 10 and Congress.

Many promises have been made there but just as many promises have been broken.

The west-side redevelopment has been slower that most hoped and predicted.

The 17-acre parcel west of I-10 is still an empty field of false promises.
