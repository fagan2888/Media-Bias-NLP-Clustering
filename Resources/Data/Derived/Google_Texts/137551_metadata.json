What idiot did that? I thought.\n\nMy stomach turned inside out when I realized the eye of the storm was my trash can. Moments before, it had been filled to the brim with the pink packing material, which had cradled my mother\u2019s china on its sentimental journey from California to Florida.\n\nThe trash collectors had just been by. It was a windy day. And I had instantly become that neighbor. I can\u2019t stand people like me.\n\nI dashed down the street and began chasing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pink peanuts, asking myself for the zillionth time: How did I get into this mess?\n\nIt all started just before Thanksgiving. I was setting the holiday table and suddenly got choked up. A wave of nostalgia washed over me as I flashed back to all those holiday dinners around my mother\u2019s table, with her delicate, ivory china and its hand-painted gold pattern.\n\nNow Dad\u2019s gone. Mom\u2019s in a rest home and I\u2019m 3,000 miles away trying to make my own meaningful traditions. The family china was sitting in a box in my brother\u2019s garage in California, waiting for me to claim it.\n\nLast spring, some of you will recall, I cleared out my parents\u2019 home, selling and donating their furnishings. I brought home a few items \u2014 some jewelry, glassware, an oil painting \u2014 but held off on the silver and china. I wasn\u2019t ready, emotionally (the memories!) or physically (where would I put it?) to deal with the 12 place settings.\n\nBut as I set the Thanksgiving table, I did some mental math, which sounds like a hand-crank pencil sharpener, and figured that I have likely had more Thanksgivings than I can look forward to.\n\nForget what anyone tells you. This is the definition of midlife. And it is a crisis. Suddenly, my desire for Mom\u2019s china became a stage-five obsession, not seen since the days of my \u201cI need a barbecue chicken pizza NOW!\u201d pregnancy cravings.\n\n\u201cPlease, send the china,\u201d I said to my sister-in-law over the phone. She took the boxes straight to Art Ono, owner of the UPS store in Culver City, Calif., who promptly panicked.\n\nA piece of advice: If you want to send a shipper\u2019s vital signs into the ozone, just utter the words \u201cheirloom china.\u201d An all-points bulletin goes out to delivery trucks nationwide, and the entire transportation network goes on red alert. No two boxes of china can travel on the same truck for the same reason that the president and vice president can\u2019t fly together.\n\nThen the packer corners the market on pink peanuts.\n\nOno, a certified packing expert, and his crew, who happen to be his kids, took the heirloom china job to heart. Several days later, I received three boxes the size of Smart cars, and a smaller fourth box, which held the silver.\n\nThe boxes were so thoroughly packed you could have dropped them from a freeway overpass and had them knocked around by 18-wheelers without damaging the dishes. Only delivery by armored car could have offered more protection.\n\nMy Christmas table was a beautiful \u2014 if sentimental \u2014 blend of old and new: Mom\u2019s gold-rimmed china with my plain ivory, her silver with my crystal. I discarded the packaging.\n\nAnd that is how, one recent morning, for love, for family, and so I wouldn\u2019t make the neighbors mad, I was trolling through neighbors\u2019 yards and the streets like a stray dog, chasing that which was fleeting.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).

When shipping breakables, individually wrap each piece with bubble wrap until you can\u2019t feel any edges, said Ono, who used several layers of small-bubble wrap on each dish.\n\nDon\u2019t spare the peanuts. Next put a layer of peanuts on the bottom of the box. Layer in wrapped dishes so they\u2019re not touching, add another layer of peanuts, then more dishes. Once filled, overstuff the box with more peanuts so nothing moves.\n\nBox the box. Ono then put that box in another box, 2 inches bigger all around, and filled the gap with more peanuts.\n\nAssume rough handling. When packages ship by ground, they typically go from truck to truck, and \u201ccan be thrown around quite a bit,\u201d said Ono, \u201ceven when they say fragile.\u201d Picture boxes being dropped from a height of 3 feet and pack accordingly.\n\nNix the newspaper. The most common mistakes Ono sees self-packers make are: wrapping breakables in paper; and leaving too much room in the box. \u201cWhen you grab a box, you shouldn\u2019t feel contents moving,\u201d he said. \u201cBut customers bring their china in that way and think it\u2019s ready to ship.\u201d UPS is good about honoring insurance, but often want to inspect the packing to see why an item broke. \u201cIf it\u2019s because the sender didn\u2019t pack properly, it\u2019s not UPS\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nOnce it\u2019s packed, insure it. With UPS, each box is automatically insured for $100. For $1.50 more per box, you can buy an additional $100 of protection.\n\nExpect some sticker shock. This kind of packing doesn\u2019t come cheap. Ono said he can usually pack eight place settings of dishes in two boxes, and charges $100 per box. Shipping and insurance get added to that. To pack, ship and insure our four boxes cost $500. When I asked Ono if perhaps he overpacked them, he replied, \u201cWas anything broken?\u201d No, I told him. \u201cThen the job was perfect,\u201d he said. And I can\u2019t argue with that.\n\nNOTE: Since this column was published, readers have let me know that I deserve to be tarred and rolled in packing peanuts. I did not think of, and therefore did not mention, that I should have recycled those peanuts! Thanks to hundreds of evolved readers who wrote, I will never again throw away good packing peanuts. From here on, back to the shipping store they will go.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Precious breakables: How the professionals pack them", "title": "Precious breakables: How the professionals pack them", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/10/precious-breakables-how-the-professionals-pack-them/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__20140111_C8_FE11AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 368}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__20140111_C8_FE11AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-11T03:44:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:47:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "NOTE: Since this column was published, readers have let me know that I deserve to be tarred and rolled in packing peanuts.\nThanks to hundreds of evolved readers who wrote, I will never again throw away good packing peanuts.\nI dashed down the street and began chasing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pink peanuts, asking myself for the zillionth time: How did I get into this mess?\nOno said he can usually pack eight place settings of dishes in two boxes, and charges $100 per box.\nThen the packer corners the market on pink peanuts."}
