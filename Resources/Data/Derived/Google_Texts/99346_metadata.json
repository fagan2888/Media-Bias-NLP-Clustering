Instead, Bila said she may do a write-in in November, because Trump has a problem with women.\n\nGoldberg turned blunt on the issue of support for candidates.\n\n\"I think if you're a principled person, you don't support racism,\" the Oscar-winning actress said. \"What is best for the country? It's not what's best for your party. It's what's best for America. That's how you have to look at it.\u201d\n\nOther issues may seem important. \"You can bitch about money all you want, big banks and all that -- we're going to have this fight forever,\" Goldberg said. \"But this racism stuff, this is a problem.\"\n\nGoldberg issued a warning: \"America is going to get browner and yellower and redder and whiter. It's always going to shift. Nothing is going to stay the same.\"\n\nHer remarks followed Joy Behar's observation that in years to come, people will look at the 2016 race and ask: Did you back Trump? She cited Trump's comments about Muslims and Mexicans to make her point.\n\nLater, guest Rob Reiner expanded on Goldberg's remarks and ripped Trump. \"If Donald Trump wasn't a celebrity, if there was a man that said the things that he has said, he'd be a crazy man in the park on a soapbox that you'd walk by,\" said Reiner, a Clinton supporter.\n\nReiner complained that Trump had no ability but had gained celebrity through the \"Kardashian-ization of America.\"\n\nTrump will be interviewed by Lester Holt on Wednesday's edition of \"NBC Nightly News\" at 6:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Whoopi Goldberg: Principled people don't support racism", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Donald Trump won big Tuesday in Indiana, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a criticism Wednesday on \"The View\"\u00a0 that could reverberate through the campaign.", "title": "Whoopi Goldberg: Principled people don't support racism", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/tv/tv-guy/os-whoopi-goldberg-principled-people-do-not-support-racism-20160504-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-572a5ee2/turbine/os-whoopi-goldberg-principled-people-do-not-support-racism-20160504", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Whoopi Goldberg, Donald Trump, View, Joy Behar", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/87079202", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-04", "Description": "Donald Trump won big Tuesday in Indiana, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a criticism Wednesday on \"The View\"\u00a0 that could reverberate through the campaign.", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Whoopi Goldberg, Donald Trump, View, Joy Behar"}, "article_summary": "\"I think if you're a principled person, you don't support racism,\" the Oscar-winning actress said.\nDonald Trump won big Tuesday in Indiana, but Whoopi Goldberg offered a criticism Wednesday on \"The View\" that could reverberate through the campaign.\nConservative commentator Jedediah Bila said that a lot of \"principled conservatives\" won't support the Republican front-runner because he has been on both sides of every issue.\nIt's what's best for America.\nIt's not what's best for your party."}
