And in an unprecedented push for transparency, the state would publish a list of the average prices for almost every service, based on data the insurers would be required to submit. When hospitals or doctors and insurers disagree on the appropriate amount for an out-of-network bill, the measure calls for \u201cbaseball arbitration\u201d \u2014 a state-appointed arbitrator to choose one side\u2019s final offer.\n\nThe financial stakes are enormous, and a high-powered offensive from those whose revenues or income would be diminished by the measure is expected, including specialist physicians and hospitals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a fight,\u201d for passage, said Assemblyman Gary S. Schaer, a Passaic Democrat who chairs the Assembly Budget committee and helped draft the \u201cThe Out-of Network Consumer Protection, Transparency, Cost Containment and Accountability Act,\u201d to be introduced today at a noon news conference.\n\nBut he pointed to the high-ranking Democrats who drafted the legislation, including state Sen. Joseph Vitale, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, and Assemblyman Craig Coughlin, chairman of the Assembly committee in charge of health insurance, both Wood-bridge Democrats \u2014 as well as Assemblyman Troy Singleton of Mount Laurel. Schaer is chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.\n\nMost lawmakers are expected to agree, he said, that \u201csignificant remedial action needs to be undertaken to tackle this issue, which contributes a lot to the rise in health-care costs,\u201d as well as bankruptcies among state residents.\n\nAn important way insurance companies control costs is by negotiating contracts with hospitals, doctors, and other health-care providers who agree to accept their reimbursement and become part of their network. Some health plans include coverage for care received from providers who are not part of the insurer\u2019s network.\n\nThe out-of-network charges billed by some New Jersey hospitals are among the highest in the country, and insurers say that they drive up premiums for everyone. In addition, patients who receive care from hospital-based physicians \u2013 over whom they have no choice \u2013 often are surprised to learn that they were out-of-network providers and charge much more than expected.\n\nSo confident are the drafters that this measure will reduce health-care costs that they include a provision requiring the savings to be used to lower premiums or give dividends to plan members. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for them to pocket the difference,\u201d said Schaer, of the insurance companies. \u201cThey\u2019re required to \u2026 pass along those savings, in part, to the consumer.\u201d\n\nEven before the measure was made public, CarePoint Health, a chain of three for-profit Hudson County hospitals, said that \u201cour hospitals may be forced to close,\u201d because of the one-sided effort to limit out-of-network charges without requiring higher in-network reimbursement rates. A high proportion of its patients are covered by Medicaid or Medicare, government programs that pay less than the cost of care, and it is necessary to seek higher reimbursement from commercial insurers to cover those losses, executives said.\n\nThe Record published an article on Monday detailing surprise out-of-network bills patients had received from hospital-based physicians.\n\nThe measure being introduced today seeks to protect consumers from surprise bills in two ways:\n\n\u2014 In emergencies, a hospital and all the medical professionals who care for patient at the hospital must bill the patient no more than the patient\u2019s insurance plan would allow for in-network services. It would be the facility\u2019s responsibility to make sure all of the physicians practicing within its walls followed that rule.\n\n\u2014 For elective or non-emergency admissions, the hospital and the admitting doctor would have to disclose in writing whether they were in- or out-of-network, and the amount of the expected charges. Unless the patient \u201cknowingly, voluntarily, and specifically selected an out-of-network provider,\u201d the patient would not incur any out-of-pocket costs beyond what he would have paid in-network.\n\nWhile an emergency patient can\u2019t be billed more than the in-network rate, insurance companies can be billed more by an out-of-network doctor or healthcare facility. Charges to the insurer, however, could not exceed 2\u00bd times the median price established by a health-price index to be created under the measure.\n\nThe index will determine the range of prices for in-network services. Insurers would be required to turn over all their claims data for analysis, and pay a surcharge to set up the database, which would be run by the state Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\nThe measure tries to encompass everyone with commercial insurance in New Jersey, as well as those in the State Employee Benefits Program and the School Employees\u2019 Health Benefits Program.\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Consumers would be protected from surprise medical bills when they go to the hospital under a measure to be unveiled Thursday in Trenton by a group of powerful Democratic lawmakers.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "LINDY WASHBURN", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/n-j-lawmakers-plan-consumer-bill-to-protect-against-surprise-medical-bills-1.1333286", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Consumers would be protected from surprise medical bills when they go to the hospital under a measure to be unveiled Thursday in Trenton by a group of powerful Democratic lawmakers."}, "title": "N.J. lawmakers plan consumer bill to protect against surprise medical bills", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "LINDY WASHBURN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "N.J. lawmakers plan consumer bill to protect against surprise medical bills"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe472c\"", "article_summary": "Out-of-network charges to insurers would be capped.\nThe Record published an article on Monday detailing surprise out-of-network bills patients had received from hospital-based physicians.\nConsumers would be protected from surprise medical bills when they go to the hospital under a measure to be unveiled Thursday in Trenton by a group of powerful Democratic lawmakers.\nThe out-of-network charges billed by some New Jersey hospitals are among the highest in the country, and insurers say that they drive up premiums for everyone.\nThe measure being introduced today seeks to protect consumers from surprise bills in two ways:\u2014 In emergencies, a hospital and all the medical professionals who care for patient at the hospital must bill the patient no more than the patient\u2019s insurance plan would allow for in-network services."}
