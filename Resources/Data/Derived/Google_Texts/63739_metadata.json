William Langer was elected in 1940.\n\nWhen Langer, a Republican, showed up in the Washington, D.C., to be sworn in early 1941, he was informed that a group of North Dakotan citizens had petitioned for him to be denied the seat. They cited his \"financial misconduct\" as governor for grounds for denial, and a majority of committee members reviewing Langer's actions later agreed.\n\n\"The minority warned against allowing the Senate to be used by a winner's opponents to overturn the results of a lawful election,\" a biography on the Senate's website stated. \"In its requirements for election to the Senate, they noted, the Constitution makes no reference to moral purity.\"\n\nMore than two years after he won the 1940 election, however, the full Senate voted to seat Langer.\n\nHeated electoral politics are nothing new, and North Dakota's history is filled with examples of candidates sparring over policy and personal lives.\n\nSome say the battle between leading Republican candidates for governor, Fargo businessman Doug Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, has become \"nasty,\" a term that's even used by a Stenehjem television ad. The lead-up to the June 14 primary election has seen the candidates trade barbs over the Stenehjem's alleged support of the Affordable Care Act and Burgum's involvement in angel fund tax credits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that we\u2019ve gotten this way in North Dakota politics,\u201d state Rep. Roscoe Streyle, a Minot Republican who is supporting Stenehjem, said on the What\u2019s on Your Mind radio show last month regarding Burgum\u2019s television ads. \u201cI have never seen anything so negative and nasty.\u201d\n\nBut even modern political history in North Dakota includes plenty of controversy during election season. There was Kevin Cramer's ad attacking former U.S. Rep. Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat, over parental notification on abortion, accusations of private detectives snooping into congressional candidates' personal lives and claims that former Gov. Ed Schafer, a Republican, spent too much time scuba diving in Mexico.\n\n\"I don't think it is terribly unusual,\" Bruce Gjovig, a Grand Forks resident who was a delegate to this year's North Dakota Republican convention, said of the current governor's race. \"Candidates try to push the negatives up on the other candidate that they're opposing, and they also try to sell themselves.\"\n\nMike Jacobs, the former publisher of the Herald who now writes a weekly political column, agreed that the tone of this election cycle is \"not unprecedented and not as personal in the sense of going after the character of somebody as campaigns in the past.\"\n\n\"We don't see Burgum or Stenehjem going after the moral character of the other one,\" he added.\n\nGjovig said that may have to do with voters' preferences that campaigns be based on the issues rather than personal lives.\n\n\"You can garner a lot of sympathy for a candidate by attacking them unfairly,\" he said.\n\nDivision?\n\nOne memorable battle was the Democratic primary race in 1992 between former Sen. William Heigaard and then-Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth. Heigaard won the party's endorsement for governor, but Spaeth won the primary election.\n\nJust days before the general election between Spaeth and Schafer, the Republican candidate at the time, Heigaard declined to even say he was voting for his party's nominee, according to an Associated Press report. Though he said he wasn't bitter over the primary defeat, Heigaard added there had been \"substantial damage\" done to the party over the battle.\n\nA Democrat hasn't held the governor's office since.\n\nBob Valeu, former Democratic-NPL Party chairman, said the party has struggled to recover from the 1992 election. He sees similarities between what happen to Democrats then and Republicans now.\n\n\"I think it will create a division within the (Republican) party,\" Valeu said.\n\nState Rep. Marvin Nelson, a Democrat from Rolla, N.D., is running uncontested in the June primary and will move on to the general election.\n\nFor his part, Burgum, who lost the Republican endorsement to Stenehjem at the state GOP convention, isn't worried about hurting fellow Republicans in the general election later this year. He plans on winning in June and supporting the party's candidates.\n\nBut Stenehjem questioned how Burgum would govern after running a \"negative campaign.\"\n\nCramer, a member of the U.S. House who skipped the Republican endorsing convention and won the primary election in 2012, doesn't think the current race for governor will hurt the party.\n\n\"In my view, what we're going to see on primary election day is probably the largest Republican turnout in years, if not ever,\" he said. \"And that's party building.\"\n\nOn the issues\n\nDespite Stenehjem's call for Burgum to adhere to the \"11th commandment,\" the doctrine widely attributed to Ronald Reagan that Republicans don't speak ill of other Republicans, Burgum said he's well in-bounds to point to Stenehjem's record in office. He also cited a Stenehjem ad that claims Burgum will pay or say anything to become governor as an example of \"name-calling.\"\n\n\"I didn't get into politics thinking that wasn't going to happen,\" Burgum said.\n\nStenehjem said he hears from voters who want candidates to talk about themselves rather than \"dragging down the other candidate.\" He called claims in Burgum's ads \"demonstrably untrue,\" and Burgum has said he strongly believes in the angel fund goals.\n\nDespite that back-and-forth, Valeu said Burgum and Stenehjem largely have tried to stay on the issues. That's more than he can say for the presidential race, where presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has used his Twitter account to call his opponents lightweights and liars, among other labels.\n\nValeu said North Dakota has largely avoided that brand of politics because people here have a \"better sense of fairness.\"\n\nBut Jacobs pushed back against the notion of \"North Dakota nice.\" He said if public officials here were caught doing more questionable things, the nasty campaigns would follow.\n\n\"By and large, there's not a lot of shenanigans going on,\" he said. \"I think North Dakotans are perfectly capable of being nasty and have been nasty in the past.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Government,Election,North Dakota,doug burgum,Wayne Stenehjem", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Hageman", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "The battle for one of North Dakota's U.S. Senate seats didn't end when former Gov.
