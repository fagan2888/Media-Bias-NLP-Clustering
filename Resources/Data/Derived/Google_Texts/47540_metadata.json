The buyer was CNL Healthcare Properties Inc., a Florida-based real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on acquiring and developing properties in the senior housing and healthcare sectors.\n\nFive of the properties are located in and around Charlotte, North Carolina, on three Novant Health campuses. Of the remaining four, one is located in Asheville, North Carolina, on a Duke LifePoint campus, another is in Rome, Georgia at Floyd Medical Center, and two properties near Atlanta are satellite offices for Southern Regional Medical Center. Together they total 907,300 square feet of rentable space. Certain properties have ground leases that prohibit cross-collateralization. As a result, Capital One financed them through individual term loans, consolidating the remaining properties into a single loan.\n\n\u201cThis transaction highlights the structural flexibility we offer clients across the country, as well as our capacity to accommodate a deal of this size,\u201d said Todd Gordon, managing director, Capital One Bank. \u201cCNL Healthcare is one of the premier organizations in the industry, and we are pleased they turned to us for financing.\u201d\n\nCNL Healthcare Properties is one of the largest third-party owners of medical office buildings, acute care and post-acute care medical facilities in the United States. The acquisition also increases the size of the company\u2019s portfolio to approximately 100 assets, including healthcare facilities and senior housing communities.\n\n\u201cThe Capital One team demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the strategic importance of medical office buildings in our portfolio and the financing challenges such investments can often have,\u201d said Joseph T. Johnson, senior vice president and chief financial officer of CNL Healthcare Properties. \u201cTheir expertise was an important factor in our ability to complete this complex transaction by our deadline.\u201d\n\nCapital One Bank\u2019s Healthcare team provides a wide array of banking and lending solutions to the healthcare marketplace, including real estate loans, enterprise term loans and revolving lines of credit to address their capital needs.
