Thirty-five states have these laws, 33 of which require that the women receive specific information on the gestational age of the baby.\n\nCritics of the laws argue that they\u2019re slanted in favor of pro-life views. But now the Satanic Temple thinks it\u2019s found an opt-out loophole because of the recent Hobby Lobby case that lets business owners with religious-based objections decline to provide a handful of birth control options \u2014 those seen as abortifacients \u2014 to Obamacare participants.\n\nThe line of logic is this: The Satanic Temple says that any state-mandated information on personal health that is not rooted in what its members see as scientific fact is a violation of its own \u201creligious\u201d beliefs, Raw Story reported.\n\n\u201cWhile we feel we have a strong case for an exemption regardless of the Hobby Lobby ruling, the Supreme Court has decided that religious beliefs are so sacrosanct that they can even trump scientific fact,\u201d said the group\u2019s spokesman, who uses the name Lucien Greaves, Raw Story reported. \u201cThis was made clear when they allowed Hobby Lobby to claim certain contraceptives were abortifacients, which in fact they are not.\u201d\n\nSo the Satanic Temple created a website for women who want abortions to print out a letter for medical providers to argue for exemption of state informed consent laws.\n\nThe group posts on its website that all \u201cwomen who share our deeply held belief that their personal choices should be made with access to the best available information, undiluted by biased or false information, are free to seek protection with this exemption whether they are members of the Satanic Temple or not,\u201d Raw Story said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Satanic Temple said in a statement on its website that the Supreme Court's recent ruling on Hobby Lobby now gives women the right to opt out of state laws that require abortion seekers to first read pro-life materials.", "Author": "Cheryl K.
