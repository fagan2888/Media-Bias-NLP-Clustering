Ellison is one of the most versatile artists of our time. Not just an innovative electronic musician \u2014 working under the moniker \u201cFlying Lotus\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s also a rapper, master producer and frequent collaborator with Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke. Ellison\u2019s most recent Flying Lotus album, \u201cYou\u2019re Dead,\u201d features guest verses from Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg and others, and was named one of the top 50 albums of the year by Rolling Stone. You can understand, then, why I was a little nervous to meet the guy.\n\nWhen I met Ellison earlier this year in a warehouse-cum-office building in Brooklyn, we were ushered into a small room; after polite introductions I took out my phone to record our conversation, and instantly he picked it up and began riffing. Nerves on both ends dropped, and suddenly the room was buzzing.\n\nEllison\u2019s energy is vital and frenetic; he often communicates with sound effects, and his eyes dance when he discusses his music. This vibrance and intellectual energy is reflected in his music. At this point, \u201cYou\u2019re Dead\u201d had not yet been released, but he was already moving forward and thinking about his next project. Below is the (lightly edited) conversation that followed.\n\n[Playing with a phone]\n\nI used an iPhone to record some stuff for the album. It was actually an emergency situation that I had to do that because I was literally on the road and I had to fix something and turn it in and whatever. So we recorded some drums with the iPhone at the venue. It was cool. It worked out.\n\nI was actually going to ask you about technology and technology\u2019s influence on music. There are so many aspects of it from sharing music and piracy and even creating music and you\u2019re \u2014 from what I\u2019ve read \u2014 pretty much self-taught and you watch YouTube tutorials. What\u2019s your relationship with technology?\n\nI\u2019ve always been a techie kind of person. As a child I remember freaking out. I was a really little kid, and I went to a friend\u2019s to sleep over, and they had a Nintendo, but the dad wasn\u2019t home so he couldn\u2019t set it up, and I was like, \u201cAh, I know how to set it up. I\u2019ll just get behind the TV and just [tinkering sound effects].\u201d The mom was like, \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d And I got it working, but I guess I was just really inclined to that kind of shit, technical stuff. I built computers and stuff when I was a teenager and whatever. I was really into that kind of shit. And so technology, when you can make music on a computer, it really fit me out, because I was already on it.\n\nBut it was kind of like a taboo thing to make hip-hop on a computer in the early 2000s, it was like, \u201cNo, man, that\u2019s not hip-hop. You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t use a damn computer.\u201d So I used a computer. When that was possible, it was perfect for me, because it just seemed like an extension of my brain activity anyway, the way my brain was, I was already on it.\n\nObviously now, we\u2019re in a funny time where technology is run rampant and looking at little kids and shit, they\u2019re screwed now. The technology has taken them. I was at a friend\u2019s house last night and there was a little baby girl on the little iPhone watching cartoons and stuff, like, \u201cWhat are you watching over here? I gotta make sure you watching the right [show].\u201d The parents are like in their own world, and this kid\u2019s got this phone. And I\u2019m just like, man, she\u2019s still got a pacifier in her mouth. And I\u2019m just like, shit man. If I had a phone when I was a teenager, it\u2019s just like, the things you could do.\n\nEven with this album, it\u2019s like a new spin on jazz. You\u2019ve morphed it with these new sounds and it seems like almost this coming together of two ages. Is that what you were trying to do?\n\nThat\u2019s the point. That\u2019s the point. I always think about Miles Davis coming back. And if he came back to Earth and heard a lot of these jazz cats, he\u2019d be mad. He\u2019d literally be mad, and he\u2019d just go back to wherever he was dead at. I was like, all right, if we\u2019re gonna do something like that, we gotta do something a little different and switch it up a little bit. So if Miles heard it, he\u2019d be like, \u201cOK, that\u2019s what ya\u2019ll doing. Oh, all right. OK.\u201d I wanted to do something like that. Make him chin stroke a little bit. \u201cOh OK.\u201d\n\nSo partially it\u2019s out of my own frustration of where it\u2019s all at, because I think everyone, with jazz, it\u2019s gotten so in the box, you know? It\u2019s gone quite stale over the past 20 years, and when you talk about it, people think of it as like elevator music now. But there\u2019s still people hidden, man. There\u2019s still some shit and places to take it. Especially now that we have the technology and capabilities, we should be trying to take it further; we should be trying to change it up.\n\nWith your family background, did you grow up listening to a lot of jazz?\n\nYeah. Yeah. And the jazz thing was always present. My family, they would throw the John Coltrane festival, which would happen every year, and it would be all-day jazz. And I was like, when I was a child, it went on for so long. So it was always there. And my appreciation for it only increased more and more as I got older, and I started learning more and doing my own digging and living and stuff, and then it seems like every five years I get inspired to go back to John Coltrane and Alice Coltrane and Miles and all that. And like have a new appreciation and understanding for the journey of it, the technical aspects of everything, just have more appreciation for it every five years of my own living and whatnot. Go back to it and, \u201cDamn, man. Why do I feel so much?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s the best kind of music. Every time, \u201cYou\u2019re Dead\u201d hits me with something different. Even though it\u2019s just one long track \u2014\n\nFor you.\n\nRight. But you can hear the breaks but it\u2019s still very seamless. What was the process? It took you two years, and it almost sounds like it\u2019s composed.\n\nThat\u2019s the fun. The way it works generally is a lot of ideas will come out, and then it\u2019s, OK, how do I make these ideas better? Then it is how do I tie it all together? It\u2019s like a little process, and I enjoy each part of it so much. But it was funny this time, because I feel like I\u2019ve been listening to these songs, only these songs, for like a whole year and a half. Hearing them over and over and over and over and trying to figure out, Is this done yet? No. Is this done yet? No. Is this done yet? No, God, it\u2019s not done yet. It\u2019s so much work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The electronic artist talks to Salon about jazz, technology, death and his latest acclaimed album", "title": "Flying Lotus: Miles Davis would \u201cliterally be mad\u201d at what\u2019s happened to jazz", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The electronic artist talks to Salon about jazz, technology, death and his latest acclaimed album", "title": "Flying Lotus: Miles Davis would \u201cliterally be mad\u201d at what\u2019s happened to jazz", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/flying_lotus_miles_davis_would_literally_be_mad_at_whats_happened_to_jazz/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/music-review-flying-lotus.jpeg-1000x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The electronic artist talks to Salon about jazz, technology, death and his latest acclaimed album", "title": "Flying Lotus: Miles Davis would \u201cliterally be mad\u201d at what\u2019s happened to jazz", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/music-review-flying-lotus.jpeg-1000x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, best albums of 2014, cool culture, Flying Lotus, innovation, Miles Davis, Music", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And I\u2019m just like, shit man.\nTopics: best albums of 2014, cool culture, Flying Lotus, innovation, Miles Davis, Music, Innovation News, Entertainment NewsWhen I first met Steven Ellison, I was a bundle of jittery nerves.\nAnd if he came back to Earth and heard a lot of these jazz cats, he\u2019d be mad.\nMy family, they would throw the John Coltrane festival, which would happen every year, and it would be all-day jazz.\nEllison\u2019s energy is vital and frenetic; he often communicates with sound effects, and his eyes dance when he discusses his music."}
