The latest video from conservative activist James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas accuses the director of Enroll America of conspiring to release private data for political purposes.

Alleging that Americans’ personal data is being “cross-pollinated” among various left-leaning groups for political purposes, a Project Veritas “investigator” posed as an official a fake progressive group and sat down with the communications director of Enroll America in Texas, Christopher Tarango.

In the video, which is provided in edited and unedited form, the Project Veritas investigator inquires about obtaining a private list of Obamacare enrollee data to use for political purposes.

“So then how do we get the list? I still don’t think we can get a list from Enroll America because of the 501 (c)(3) status. How do you suppose we get around that?” Tarango asks in the video.

However, he later says he will “talk to one person that I think might be open to having this conversation behind closed doors.”

“The person that I’m telling you, I’m to referring you to, is like me in a leadership position,” he later added. “And so he could export the list if he wanted to.”

Tarango also assures the undercover Project Veritas staffer that “if we can do it, we’re going to get the list” and references what he calls rule number 17: “Do whatever it f***ing takes.”

Due to Enroll America’s 501 (c)(3) status, Tarango at one point tells the fake official, “this conversation never happened.”

The latest video again employs deceptive tactics, however, includes what is reportedly the full, unedited video after the produced version.
