But lawmakers hope to see that number shrink as the Affordable Care Act goes into effect.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the health-care exchanges enacted by President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law went live, providing Americans with a marketplace to shop for insurance plans. The exchanges, operated by a mixture of states, the federal government and private companies, work a lot like Amazon.com, allowing users log on and compare their options. A high-tech spin on an age-old idea \u2013 a perfect match for the tech savvy group of young adults in the nation.\n\n\n\nBut Michael Sparer, professor of health policy management at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, said young people might not be so quick to join in since, as they begin to enter into adulthood, they have a lot of other high-cost concerns weighing on their minds and budgets: Student loans, rent, a mortgage, young kids at home, etc. But, if they don\u2019t sign up for some sort of insurance by the January 1 deadline, these young adults will face a penalty as part of ObamaCare\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cOne of the questions for exchanges is while the cost is higher than the penalty, will the cost be reasonable so young, middle class kids will say, \u2018Well the cost is low enough, maybe I\u2019m eligible for a subsidy, so maybe I should do this.\u2019 That\u2019s one of the real uncertainties,\u201d he said.\n\nThe reason these 18 to 34 year-olds are key to making the ACA tick is because they\u2019re considered low-risk individuals, meaning they\u2019re more likely to purchase an insurance policy, but not have to use it unless they\u2019re in a major accident or suffer from an unexpected illness. Because of that, these young adults tend to offset the higher risk portion of the American population \u2013 paying into a system they might not use nearly as often.\n\n\n\nPaul Delay is a 21-year-old who has insurance from his company, and believes everyone should be insured, but says cost is, and always has been, a barrier for people his age.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, I have my insurance from my company. Luckily I have that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut other people who don\u2019t have that luxury, if (the government) ups the prices, it\u2019s going to be much worse.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Shelby Dickens, a 20-year-old college student said she would likely not purchase her own insurance policy if her school did not provide it for her.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that everyone should be able to have health care and it should be affordable for everyone, \u201c she said. \u201cI definitely use my health care\u2026and I get access to things I wouldn\u2019t normally, which I\u2019m very fortunate for\u2026I would like to (buy insurance) if I\u2019m able to, but I don\u2019t think I could do so on my own.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, it\u2019s not just the cost of insurance that becomes a concern for many young people. It\u2019s also the confusion surrounding the ACA. The law has been at the center of heated controversy on Capitol Hill about whether the government should have the power to mandate insurance for all Americans. And with the most recent fiscal battle that resulted in a partial government shutdown, the waters grew more opaque for the general public as the fight over repeal or alteration of the law would be tied to a government funding bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people will be confused and uncertain and assume everything about the Affordable Care Act is on hold (as a result of a government shutdown),\u201d Sparer said. \u201cThe resolution of the budget crisis, whether its 24 hours, or two weeks after the debt ceiling, is going to be a moment in which, unless something dramatic happens\u2026the American public will see it\u2019s not going to change.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the uncertainty, Sparer said, that will cause many people to play the wait-and-see game before actually enrolling in a health insurance plan. If that\u2019s the case, they have until January 1 to select a plan that best fits their needs before they get hit with a penalty. He said he doesn\u2019t anticipate many young people committing to a plan in the next few weeks, but said come November and December, as the January 1 deadline creeps up, they\u2019ll start making their selections.\n\n\n\n\u201cMore generally, we\u2019ll know in a year (if young people choose to sign up rather than face the penalty) because even if the rate is low, a year from now, the penalty will start going up and the exchanges will be more of a known quantity,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will know how they work and a year from now, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to judge the extent of uninsured adults who end up signing up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 07:37:21 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Young people are the key to making ObamaCare work, but will they buy insurance or pay the penalty?", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/10/01/insurance-as-law-will-younger-generation-buy-in.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/093013/0/0/093013_web_craig.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Young people are the key to making ObamaCare work, but will they buy insurance or pay the penalty?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ObamaCare Mandate: Will the Younger Generation Buy In?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\"],\"author\":\"Victoria Craig\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare Mandate: Will the Younger Generation Buy In?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/093013/0/0/093013_web_craig.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-01T17:47:41Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/10/01/insurance-as-law-will-younger-generation-buy-in.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b6d821b1-03f1-4533-aae8-a5f57cd76d21\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Young people are the key to making ObamaCare work, but will they buy insurance or pay the penalty?", "dc.identifier": "b6d821b1-03f1-4533-aae8-a5f57cd76d21", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "healthcare", "description": "Young people are the key to making ObamaCare work, but will they buy insurance or pay the penalty?", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Obamacare Mandate: Will The Younger Generation Buy In?", "dcterms.created": "2016-03-02 07:37:21 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Young people are the key to making ObamaCare work, but will they buy insurance or pay the penalty?", "title": "ObamaCare Mandate: Will the Younger Generation Buy In?
