Sometimes I wonder what did I do wrong?\u201d she said.\n\nQuinn said she doesn\u2019t know how they got her personal information last year, but once the ID thief had her social security number, they accessed her account with a popular online tax preparation service and stole her refund.\n\n\u201cSomeone actually hacked into the site where they processed the transaction and they switched the bank account information,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nQuinn said this year she chose to use a different online service but her return was rejected.\n\n\u201cSo I checked the reason and they found another return under my social security number,\u201d she said.\n\nQuinn said someone used her personal information to open a second account with the tax preparation company she used last year.\n\nAs CBS2\u2019s Jessica Schneider reported, the scammers are getting savvy.\n\n\u201cThe identity theft with the tax returns has become a cottage industry,\u201d tax attorney David Selig said.\n\nSelig said he has been getting calls from clients about three separate tax scams.\n\nUnsavory tax preparers have been telling their own clients to pay Affordable Care Act penalties directly to them instead of the IRS, scammers calling filers posing as the IRS and asking for bank account info, and tax preparers getting phone calls asking for their clients\u2019 information.\n\n\u201cThe best thing is to ask for a number to call back and if you\u2019re not sure, call law enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, an attorney,\u201d Selig said.\n\nYou can even Google the phone number that has just called you.\n\n\u201cRun their telephone number through the computer. Most come up as known scam artists,\u201d Selig said.\n\nIt\u2019s very unlikely that the IRS would contact you out of the blue without some kind of paper trail, but scammers only need a little bit of information to strike.\n\n\u201cAll they need is a name, an address, maybe date of birth, social security number and they\u2019re off to the races,\u201d said Adam Levin.\n\nLevin, founder of identity theft defense company IDT911, said one quick way of stopping hackers is by lying about your security question.\n\n\u201cIf you say what your mother\u2019s maiden name is, they\u2019re (the company) not going to investigate as to whether that was what your mother\u2019s real maiden name was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need to make sure that whatever you choose is something you remember.\u201d\n\nLevin said you can also prevent hacking by following the three M\u2019s.\n\nMinimize exposure of your personal information.\n\nMonitor your accounts by constantly checking your credit report for irregularities.\n\nManage the damage by having a list of companies, credit accounts and bank accounts to call if you are victimized.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why you haven\u2019t become a victim of identity theft yet is because they haven\u2019t gotten around to you,\u201d said Levin.\n\nIt remains unknown if hackers accessed Quinn\u2019s personal information through a break in the tax preparation site or from somewhere else, which stresses the importance of keeping your personal information secure.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo has urged anyone who is the victim of a scam to report it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adam Levin, founder of identity theft defense company IDT911, said one quick way of stopping hackers is by lying about your security question.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/03/identity-scam-tax-return-theft/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/57167631.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/57167631.jpg?w=1500", "height": 959}, "type": "article", "description": "Adam Levin, founder of identity theft defense company IDT911, said one quick way of stopping hackers is by lying about your security question.", "title": "Scam Alert: Thieves Are Targeting Your Tax Refund"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/57167631.jpg?w=1500", "description": "Adam Levin, founder of identity theft defense company IDT911, said one quick way of stopping hackers is by lying about your security question.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Scam Alert: Thieves Are Targeting Your Tax Refund"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "tax return theft, tax refund theft, identity theft tax return, identity theft tax refund, tax refund stolen", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "adam levin, hazle sanchez, identity theft, tax return theft"}, "article_summary": "It remains unknown if hackers accessed Quinn\u2019s personal information through a break in the tax preparation site or from somewhere else, which stresses the importance of keeping your personal information secure.\n\u201cSomeone actually hacked into the site where they processed the transaction and they switched the bank account information,\u201d Quinn said.\nQuinn said someone used her personal information to open a second account with the tax preparation company she used last year.\n\u201cSo I checked the reason and they found another return under my social security number,\u201d she said.\nMinimize exposure of your personal information."}
