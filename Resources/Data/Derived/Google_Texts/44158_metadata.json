Magazine\u2019s list of the Top 30 Top 30 Fastest Growing Companies in the insurance industry (based on annual sales revenue) for 2013.\n\nMorgan agreed to answer a few questions from HottyToddy.com this week, when he could find a spare minute, about his insurance company\u2019s successes.\n\nHT: How did you meet your partner, David R. White?\n\nJM: David White and I were fraternity brothers in college (Sigma Alpha Epsilon at the University of Mississippi). We met each other in the late \u201960s in college. We\u2019ve been friends ever since. We were roommates and were in several businesses early on in manufacturing. His grandfather had an International Harvester dealership at that time.\n\nI had a street load maintenance company, and the grand plan was to merge those two companies together. That didn\u2019t pan out as well because of a lot of factors, including foreign imports.\n\nHT: Why did you and your partner, David R. White, decide to form an insurance company?\n\nJM: A friend of mine approached me about a new thing that had come out, IRS 125 Cafeteria Plans, supplemental insurance plans that use pretax money to pay for it and provide benefits. They were popular with employers and employees.\n\nWe got into that and self-funded workers\u2019 compensation. At that time, workers\u2019 compensation was so high, and everyone was in the assigned risk program, so we started several workers\u2019 compensation programs.\n\nHT: How did you move into health insurance?\n\nJM: People started asking for health insurance. People didn\u2019t have a problem with car or house insurance. Everyone was scrambling around for health insurance because everyone wants everything paid for when they go to the doctor. \u2026 Today we\u2019re the largest solely dedicated health insurance company in the state.\n\nWe also have an international division, which David started. We sell health insurance products in South America and have a claims office in Miami, with about 60 employees there.\n\nDavid primarily started that because he was selling equipment in South America for his grandfather and had developed some relationships with people selling life insurance. One of the guys in South America said, \u201cWe really need a health insurance product.\u201d\n\nThey already have government coverage of poor people. All the specialty doctors, such as neurosurgeons, form private clinics, and they don\u2019t take government insurance.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have private health clinics, you don\u2019t get care. This insurance will bring you into Houston or Miami, and you will get treatment in U.S. All medical records are transcribed into English and patients get immediate care.\n\nWe\u2019re always looking for new markets and more innovative approaches to resolving the rapidly rising costs of health care. \u2026 In today\u2019s market, whether in health insurance or pharmaceuticals or automobiles, you have to think outside the box. If you don\u2019t you\u2019ll end up being inside the box. There\u2019s no such thing as standing still, because everyone else is moving forward. If you\u2019re standing still, you\u2019re really moving backwards.\n\nHT: How has the insurance industry changed since you and your partner formed your company in 1987?\n\nJM: Insurance companies were competing with each other on insurance products, especially major medical. Everyone wanted everything to be covered. Each would add something each year to compete, that\u2019s what increased the price of it. So the next year, if you have cancer and your hair falls out, wigs will be covered. That\u2019s something that was not covered in a lot of them. People wanted more to be included in their insurance, so naturally that will increase prices.\n\nObamacare was such a radical change, in instituting it as a law, it outlawed existing policies that were out there at the time. My policy from last year is void and no good. After 2014, I\u2019m covered for so much stuff that you\u2019ll never use.\n\nHT: What is your favorite part of the job?\n\nJM: I like going out and developing prospects, meeting people and talking about what we can do to save them money in the health insurance business. There are two kinds of people in this business, tree shakers and leaf rakers. Some people do administration, and take care of financials and enrolling. I like doing the selling and the marketing.\n\nHT: Are you still involved in politics or do you plan to become involved again?\n\nJM: I was in the Senate for about eight years and was a Supervisor for eight years. I\u2019ve probably contributed my time well enough to the cause. I enjoyed my stint, and made a lot of good contacts and met a lot of people. I still do fundraising for candidates I support, but I\u2019m not a candidate anymore.\n\nHT: Do you specialize in working with one area of the company or do you spend equal time on each entity? What\u2019s the average day like for you?\n\nJM: I primarily work in what I call the retail-end promotion, trying to handle governmental affairs. We do a lot of state agencies\u2019 supplemental products, and developing prospects in the retail end with retail agents. We have three little insurance companies, and my partner os inundated with running those insurance companies. He\u2019s the CEO of the company and runs all the stuff in Jackson. The office there keeps him busy. He doesn\u2019t have time to get out into the retail end of it, but that\u2019s where your money\u2019s made.\n\nHT: What is the insurance market like in Mississippi and do you expect any more expansion?\n\nJM: I think that Obamacare has made things so technical and it\u2019s such a moving target. It\u2019s changing on a day-to-day basis, and that\u2019s a detriment to the small insurance agent. We have a full time paid technical advisor in our office. He stays on top of Obamacare with the Department of Health and Human Services, and stays in contact with the regulatory agency on Obamacare day to day.\n\nWithout someone like that on staff, an insurance agent is going to be at a disadvantage and can\u2019t give people the service they need. More small agents will do cars and things not affected by Obamacare.\n\nAnything you tell someone about health care, you can be held liable, so you better know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nHT: Are a lot of customers signing up for your insurancelockbox.com? What makes it unique compared with other online services, or do any others exist?\n\nJM: This is a service we have that\u2019s basically an Internet site. So many people die and then their relatives don\u2019t know what they have. This allows you to go someplace and put it in a digital lockbox, and it lists what your secrets are. When you die, that lockbox will say who can open it.\n\nIf you have a combination to a safe at home, and let\u2019s say you have a car wreck and died today, people wouldn\u2019t know what you had. It allows you to keep your confidential information in a safe place, and those people would be contacted to access these vital records. And who\u2019s going to know you took out an insurance policy? The insurance company doesn\u2019t know you died, they just know you stopped paying your premiums. Your relatives wouldn\u2019t ever know you had insurance.\n\nHT: What has contributed to your success?\n\nJM: We\u2019re expanding and I have to attribute most of our success to my partner: he\u2019s a very creative and innovative entrepreneur. He\u2019s a great mind for insurance and he\u2019s developed a lot of products that I enjoy selling. The whole idea is that he thinks outside the box.\n\nGretchen Stone is a HottyToddy.com associate editor.
