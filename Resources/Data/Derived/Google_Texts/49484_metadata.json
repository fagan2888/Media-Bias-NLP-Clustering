According to the letter, research shows that damages caps \u201cdiminish access to the courts for low wage earners, like the elderly, children, and women. If economic damages are minor and non economic damages are capped, attorneys are less likely to represent these potential plaintiffs. The letter also notes that courts already have the power to reduce excessive verdicts through remittitur.\n\nThe bill imposes a \u201cfair share\u201d rule which states that each party is liable only for its share of the damages. At the state level, the ABA supports laws requiring defendants whose responsibility is substantially disproportionate to the entire loss to be liable for only their equitable share of the non economic loss. Therefore, the ABA opposes the fair share provision \u201cto the extent that it would pre-empt existing state laws and to the extent that it would apply a proportionate liability rule to all damages, not just the plaintiff\u2019s non economic damages,\u201d the letter says.\n\nThe bill also has a provision that will allow judges to reduce contingent fees paid from a plaintiff\u2019s damage award to an attorney, redirect damages to the plaintiff, and further reduce contingent fees in cases involving minors and incompetent persons. ABA policy says no justification exists for special restrictions on contingent fees in medical malpractice cases.\n\nSource: ABA opposes federal medical-malpractice bill that caps pain-and-suffering damages\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Consuella Pachico", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "The ABA has sent a letter to Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which opposes a medical liability bill that caps non economic damages.
