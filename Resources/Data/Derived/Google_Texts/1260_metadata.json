Gruber played an integral, major role in developing Obamacare.\n\nThe emails show frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on the Affordable Care Act. They show he informed HHS about interviews with reporters and discussions with lawmakers, and he consulted with HHS about how to publicly describe his role. The emails, provided by the House Oversight Committee to The Wall Street Journal, cover messages Mr. Gruber sent from January 2009 through March 2010. Committee staffers said they worked with MIT to obtain the 20,000 pages of emails.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis proximity to HHS and the White House was a whole lot tighter than they admitted,\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he was a much more integral part of this than they\u2019ve said. He put up this facade he was an arm\u2019s length away. It was a farce.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Chaffetz on Sunday sent a letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell requesting information justifying the department\u2019s sole-source contract with Mr. Gruber for his work on the health law.\n\n\n\nThe emails show Mr. Gruber was in touch with key advisers such as Peter Orszag, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget, an arm of the White House that oversaw federal programs.\n\n\n\nHe was also in contact with Jason Furman, an economic adviser to the president, and Ezekiel Emanuel, who was then a special adviser for health policy at OMB.\n\n\n\nOne email indicates Mr. Gruber was invited to meet with Mr. Obama. In a July 2009 email, he wrote that Mr. Orszag had \u201cinvited me to meet with the head honcho to talk about cost control.\u201d\n\nAs a reminder, Gruber is also the White House advisor and Obamacare architect who said people living in states without Obamacare exchanges are not eligible for federal healthcare exchange subsidies. This is of course at the center of the King v. Burwell Supreme Court battle.\n\nA decision on the case is expected any day now.\n\nFor good measure, here's Gruber calling American voters stupid multiple times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Architect. .05/27/2016 0:26:51AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Architect.", "title": "- New Emails Again Confirm Jonathan Gruber Wasn't \"Just Some Advisor\" on Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/06/22/new-emails-again-confirm-jonathan-gruber-played-major-role-in-writing-obamacare-n2015615", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/343/995a15bf-07f0-4913-ae7b-bd95827f041d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Architect.", "title": "- New Emails Again Confirm Jonathan Gruber Wasn't \"Just Some Advisor\" on Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/06/22/new-emails-again-confirm-jonathan-gruber-played-major-role-in-writing-obamacare-n2015615", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/343/995a15bf-07f0-4913-ae7b-bd95827f041d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "New Emails Again Confirm Jonathan Gruber Wasn't \"Just Some Advisor\" on Obamacare , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One email indicates Mr. Gruber was invited to meet with Mr. Obama.\nThe emails, provided by the House Oversight Committee to The Wall Street Journal, cover messages Mr. Gruber sent from January 2009 through March 2010.\nThe emails show frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on the Affordable Care Act.\nGruber played an integral, major role in developing Obamacare.\nThe emails show Mr. Gruber was in touch with key advisers such as Peter Orszag, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget, an arm of the White House that oversaw federal programs."}
