In Kansas, the program is fueled by $42 million in federal aid and supported with $16 million from the state.\n\nUnder a draft of proposed federal requirements, Kansas might have to repeal regulations folded into the Hope Act by the 2015 Legislature and Gov. Sam Brownback.\n\nKansas\u2019 Hope Act makes families ineligible for child care subsidies for three-, six- or 12-month periods if guilty of infractions defined as \u201cnoncooperation.\u201d The law requires parents receiving a child care subsidy in Kansas to work 20 hours each week. The law creates a lifetime limit on the amount of school attendance a parent can count as an acceptable alternative.\n\nConflict could exist if regulations enforced by officials at the Kansas Department for Children and Families don\u2019t comply with the federal rule that each state provide subsidies for a 12-month period to every eligible child.\n\n\u201cThere are potential conflicts with the Hope Act,\u201d said Shannon Cotsoradis, president of Kansas Action for Children. \u201cI feel fairly comfortable in saying there will have to be some changes.\u201d\n\nTheresa Freed, spokeswoman for the Department for Children and Families, said HHS hadn't informed the state that amendment of the Hope Act would be necessary.\n\n\"If Ms. Cotsoradis would like to address her concerns to our agency, we would be happy to discuss those with her,\" Freed said.\n\nThe state\u2019s welfare reform statute was adopted in April and modified in June.\n\nIt was portrayed by supporters as a way to instill dignity to people in safety-net programs, but critics said the law was punitive and designed to deter participation. The number of Kansas children covered by child care subsidies is projected to decline by about 400 to 12,385, Cotsoradis said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services previously delved into the Hope Act by challenging a $25-a-day limit on ATM withdrawals from cash assistance accounts provided poor families in Kansas. Under federal pressure, state regulators dropped the cap.\n\nOn Monday, Kansas Action for Children plans to host a meeting at Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library to delve into pending changes to the grant system. The Department of Children and Families declined to take part, Cotsoradis said.\n\nShe said there was anxiety among organizations devoted to child care that state officials hadn\u2019t shared information about plans to comply with revised block grant guidelines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been very limited transparency in terms of what the agency has under way,\u201d she said. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any opportunity for stakeholder engagement up to this point.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Legislature, Tim Carpenter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The state of Kansas could be compelled to modify more provisions of a controversial welfare reform law to comply with federal guidelines attached to funding of child care programs.", "title": "Child advocate raises red flag about new Kansas welfare policy", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-08-27/child-advocate-raises-red-flag-about-new-kansas-welfare-policy", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14679854.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The state of Kansas could be compelled to modify more provisions of a controversial welfare reform law to comply with federal guidelines attached to funding of child care programs, a Topeka advocate for child services said Thursday."}, "article_summary": "The number of Kansas children covered by child care subsidies is projected to decline by about 400 to 12,385, Cotsoradis said.\nUnder a draft of proposed federal requirements, Kansas might have to repeal regulations folded into the Hope Act by the 2015 Legislature and Gov.\nShe said there was anxiety among organizations devoted to child care that state officials hadn\u2019t shared information about plans to comply with revised block grant guidelines.\nKansas\u2019 Hope Act makes families ineligible for child care subsidies for three-, six- or 12-month periods if guilty of infractions defined as \u201cnoncooperation.\u201d The law requires parents receiving a child care subsidy in Kansas to work 20 hours each week.\nStates accepting Child Care Development Block Grants, which provide a total of $79 million to early-childhood education initiatives as well as support to employed, low-income families unable to afford child care in Kansas, must submit compliance plans by March."}
