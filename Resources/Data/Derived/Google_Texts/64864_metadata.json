(September 2014) and is printed with permission from Chelsea Green Publishing. Ad Policy\n\nFDR, in giving his Four Freedoms speech of 1941, suggested that Democrats\u2019 mission was to expand human freedom. Yet today Democrats have ceded the very concepts of freedom and liberty to Republicans. It\u2019s time to take freedom back as the central Democratic issue.\n\nConservatives talk constantly about freedom and liberty, defining the nation\u2019s understanding of these core values. But conservatives and progressives understand the concepts of freedom and liberty very differently.\n\nFor conservatives, individual responsibility is central: democracy provides the \u201cliberty\u201d to pursue your own interests, without any help from others (which would make you dependent and weak) and without any responsibility for others.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of the progressive view, perhaps expressed best by Elizabeth Warren. Senator Warren often repeats a central truth that the conservative view misses entirely: democracy is about citizens caring about one another and working through their government to provide public resources that allow freedom for all.\n\nHow do public resources create freedom? Consider the business world. It\u2019s hard to run a business without sewers, without roads and bridges and airports, without an electric grid, without satellite communications, the internet, GPS systems, and without healthy and educated employees. The public\u2014you and me and the rest of us over decades\u2014have, through our government, provided all these public resources. The development of computer science depended on government funding, as did the development of the computer chip industry. Our pharmaceutical industry required NIH research funding. In short: the private depends on the public! Without collective investment, Americans would not be free to start, run, and work in businesses.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1932_history_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "George Lakoff", "description": "Democrats would be more successful with this simple reframing.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Democrats would be more successful with this simple reframing.", "title": "What Liberals Don\u2019t Understand About Freedom", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/what-liberals-dont-understand-about-freedom/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1932_history_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:44+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats would be more successful with this simple reframing.", "title": "What Liberals Don\u2019t Understand About Freedom", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/what-liberals-dont-understand-about-freedom/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1932_history_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1932_history_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "October 1st, 2014", "sailthru.title": "What Liberals Don\u2019t Understand About Freedom", "keywords": "FDR, Democrats, Liberals, Progressives, Democracy, Four Freedoms, Moral Relevance, George Lakoff, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 90899, "sailthru.tags": "Politics,Society,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2014-10-01T21:09:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T08:27:44+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/sarahleonard/"}, "sailthru.description": "Democrats would be more successful with this simple reframing.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1932_history_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The public\u2014you and me and the rest of us over decades\u2014have, through our government, provided all these public resources.\nHow do public resources create freedom?\nBut conservatives and progressives understand the concepts of freedom and liberty very differently.\nAd PolicyFDR, in giving his Four Freedoms speech of 1941, suggested that Democrats\u2019 mission was to expand human freedom.\nYet today Democrats have ceded the very concepts of freedom and liberty to Republicans."}
