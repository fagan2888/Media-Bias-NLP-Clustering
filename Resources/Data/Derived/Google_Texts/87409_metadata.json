Jacques\u2019 transition was chronicled in the Orwell Prize-nominated column she wrote for the Guardian, \u201cMy Transgender Journey,\u201d which began in 2010 and lasted three years. However, \u201cTrans\u201d is a broader take on what it was like coming of age in the transphobic \u201990s, navigating an identity via music, film, literature, football, gender theory and a slowly expanding circle of role models.\n\nJacques writes in a detached way, and descriptions of her attempted suicide and the unrelenting stigma she faced \u2013 tempered though they are with accounts of warm friendships \u2013 will strike you with their matter-of-factness. It\u2019s an honest book, without being gratuitous. Hard to write, for sure; Jacques says she spent six months unable to type another word after she submitted the manuscript.\n\nSalon caught up with Jacques for a conversation about writing, censorship, politics and parents.\n\nYou\u2019ve already been in the public eye, but still, writing this book must have been terrifying.\n\nAbsolutely. Writing this memoir was much more public, more permanent than anything I\u2019ve done before. I had to have a quite stressful conversation with my parents, saying \u201cThis is what\u2019s going in about you.\u201d The same thing with friends.\n\nI had lots of anxieties about the wider public. Arguments about how trans people are represented in the media, and how we represent ourselves, are very heated at the moment, so publishing this book in that context was terrifying.\n\nTo what extent did you feel you had to censor yourself because of that?\n\nSome issues that would have been really controversial don\u2019t concern me or didn\u2019t fit the narrative. But I think we live in a climate that\u2019s becoming increasingly censorious. There\u2019s so much pressure on trans people to be good role models and, yes, maybe I could have said more about my sex life and my relationship with my body if there weren\u2019t all these competing pressures from conservatives, certain feminists and the trans community.\n\nSome scenes are heartbreaking to read and must have been painful to write. How did you look after yourself through that?\n\nIt was really difficult to reinhabit some moments in the book, and to do so thoroughly enough to create something interesting, poetic, or politically worthwhile. The hardest part was in chapter five, where I decided to kill myself. I knew that bit was coming for a long time and was building up to writing it. The way I dealt with that was to make sure I wrote the next episode \u2013 where I decide not to and, the following day, I\u2019m still alive and I play football, well, feeling that nothing else mattered \u2013 at same time. After I\u2019d written that, nothing else seemed quite so daunting.\n\nYou say explicitly in your book that you see who you are as inherently political. How have you been aware of your politics shaping your identity?\n\nI became very conscious of my mindset changing around 2005, when I discovered that line of (mainly North American) transgender theory: Kate Bornstein, Leslie Feinberg, Pat Califia and others, leading to Julia Serano and Paul Preciado. This theory wasn\u2019t so much about making a smooth move from male to female or vice versa, more about creating areas between them or around them, and creating a better language to discuss our experiences.\n\nAs a child I had the terms \u201ctransvestite\u201d or \u201ctranssexual\u201d and neither really suited me. \u201cTransvestite\u201d had all these sexual connotations and the stereotype was of a high-powered male lawyer wearing his wife\u2019s underwear. \u201cTranssexual\u201d described someone who\u2019d gone through a medical process, which I hadn\u2019t and, at the time, wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to. \u201cTransgender\u201d gave me this grey area; it gave me some intellectual space to move in.\n\nTrans memoirs like Jan Morris\u2019s and Lili Elbe\u2019s seem very \u201cof their time\u201d now and make you realize how dialogue has changed. Do you imagine yourself looking back at your book in the same way one day?\n\nAbsolutely. Really, this book aims to make itself irrelevant. It\u2019s reflexive about the way memoirs have been used and the obligation on trans people to write autobiographically. I do use that form but I critique it heavily and try to infuse it with politics, theory and history. I\u2019m trying to move the conversation on to those things.\n\nYou say in the book that inclusion in feminist spaces isn\u2019t the most pressing issues for trans people but that, once those debates begin to influence health and social care policy, they become a bigger deal. Given that, how much attention do you give these days to feminist battles over trans issues?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon speaks with the author about coming of age in the transphobic '90s and navigating her identity", "title": "\u201cTransition makes things easier, but it doesn\u2019t fix everything\u201d: \u201cTrans\u201d author Juliet Jacques", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon speaks with the author about coming of age in the transphobic '90s and navigating her identity", "title": "\u201cTransition makes things easier, but it doesn\u2019t fix everything\u201d: \u201cTrans\u201d author Juliet Jacques", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/11/transition_makes_things_easier_but_it_doesnt_fix_everything_trans_author_juliet_jacques/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/juliet_jacques2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon speaks with the author about coming of age in the transphobic '90s and navigating her identity", "title": "\u201cTransition makes things easier, but it doesn\u2019t fix everything\u201d: \u201cTrans\u201d author Juliet Jacques", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/juliet_jacques2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Frankie Mullin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, juliet jacques, Memoir, Trans, transgender issues", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0e5\"", "article_summary": "Given that, how much attention do you give these days to feminist battles over trans issues?\nHard to write, for sure; Jacques says she spent six months unable to type another word after she submitted the manuscript.\nTopics: Books, Editor's Picks, juliet jacques, Memoir, Trans, transgender issues, Life News, Entertainment NewsJuliet Jacques has written a memoir, \u201cTrans\u201d (available now from Verso), based around her transition but encompassing a wide sweep of her life, from disaffected teendom in rural England to politically angry but established adulthood in London.\nIt\u2019s reflexive about the way memoirs have been used and the obligation on trans people to write autobiographically.\nYou\u2019ve already been in the public eye, but still, writing this book must have been terrifying."}
