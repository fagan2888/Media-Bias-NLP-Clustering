Spotlight on … Klay Thompson, guard, Warriors

When: His week was solid overall. But it was one performance that put Klay Thompson over the top, edging out Houston’s James Harden as The Denver Post’s NBA player of the week for the evaluation period of Jan. 17-23.

What’s up: The Warriors won four times — twice over Harden’s Rockets — and Thompson got better each game. He averaged 32.0 points and made 56.8 percent of his shots. But it gets better. Thompson sizzled from the 3-point line, hitting 58.3 percent of his shots behind the arc. It gets even better. He was an extraordinary plus-26.3 for the week.

Background: Thompson’s break- out game cleared the 50-point barrier. The Washington State product scored a career-high 52 points Friday night in Golden State’s 126-101 victory over visiting Sacramento. Thompson set an NBA record for most points in a quarter, scoring 37 in the third. He was 13-of-13 from the field in that quarter, including nine 3-pointers. Overall he was 16-of-25 from the field, including 11-of-15 from the 3-point line, and found time to hand out five assists. He did all of that in just 32 minutes of playing time.

Dempsey’s take: To review, that was 52 points in 32 minutes. Not much more needs to be said about that. There had been some debate about whether Thompson would be included on the all-star team as a reserve. There’s no doubt now. The NBA’s best team to this point will have at least two representatives in New York on Feb. 15.
