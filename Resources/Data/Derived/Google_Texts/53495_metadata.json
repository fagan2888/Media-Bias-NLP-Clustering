Scott Walker tried by touting his ability to beat whomever is nominated by the Democratic Party, reminding activists that he won three statewide elections in four years in a state twice carried by Obama.\n\n\u201cThe last time a Republican carried the state for president was 1984,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough state.\u201d\n\nHe even took the crowd back to his decision to run for county executive in heavily Democratic Milwaukee County. \u201cNever ever had there been a Republican in that spot before,\u201d he said.\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, continued her tactic of going straight at Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic favorite for 2016. \u201cShe is not trustworthy, and she does not have a record of accomplishment,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nIn an interview before his turn on stage, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal pointed to his work on policy, saying he\u2019s the only potential candidate in the field who has \u201cspent the last 18 months coming up with detailed ideas on health care, on foreign policy, on energy.\u201d\n\nOnce on stage, Jindal spent considerable time touting his credentials as a social conservative, including his pushback against criticism from some in the business community over \u201creligious liberty\u201d laws that have become a flashpoint in the national debate over same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even waste your breath trying to bully the governor of Louisiana,\u201d Jindal said, repeating what he said was his message to corporate leaders.\n\nRick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 before fizzling out against eventual nominee Mitt Romney, warned that Republicans eager to retake the White House after Obama\u2019s two terms in office must stay focused on reaching working-class voters.\n\n\u201cWe have to be a pro-worker party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be the party for a rising tide lifting all boats. There are millions and millions of Americans who have holes in those boats.\u201d\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio took a hard line on foreign policy, saying the nation must get tougher with terrorists. Adapting a line from the movie \u201cTaken,\u201d he said: \u201cWe will look for you. We will find you. And we will kill you.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz trumpeted his unapologetic approach on Capitol Hill, where he helped engineer a partial government shutdown in 2013. And he told activists that they should compare his style with his rivals, all of whom insist they are conservative.\n\n\u201cHave you had anyone up here today say, `I\u2019m an establishment moderate who stands for nothing?'\u201d he said. \u201cSo how do you tell the difference? The scriptures tell us, `You shall know them by their fruits.\u201d That means, he said, asking candidates, \u201cYou say you believe these principles. When have you fought for them?\u201d\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry let loose a series of broadsides at Obama and his policies, drawing cheers from the crowd for a withering critique that covered immigration, the Affordable Care Act, the Islamic State militant group and the federal budget.\n\nHis bottom line: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen gross incompetence. We\u2019re here to declare that we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u201d\n\nBen Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who, like Fiorina, announced his candidacy earlier this week, is running as the outsider. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what sets me apart.\u201d\n\nThose not in South Carolina on Saturday included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who delivered the commencement address at Liberty University in Virginia; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who was campaigning in northern California; and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who was in South Carolina on Friday.\n\nCitizens United President David Bossie dismissed the idea that the large number of GOP candidates muddled their messages and called the wide field an advantage.\n\n\u201cThese men and women all believe in American exceptionalism,\u201d Bossie said. He added that along with criticizing Obama, Republicans should focus their ire on Clinton \u2013 a point on which many in the crowd agreed.\n\n\u201cAny one of them would be better than the disaster we\u2019ve got now,\u201d said Gary Gunderson of Abbeville, South Carolina. His wife, Margaret, chimed in: \u201cOr Hillary.\u201d\n\nThis report was written by Bill Barrow and Mitch Weiss of the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans making their pitch to be the party's 2016 presidential nominee aimed to out-do each other Saturday in arguing that President Barack Obama is a failed leader", "pubdate": 20150510, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Republicans making their pitch to be the party's 2016 presidential nominee aimed to out-do each other Saturday in arguing that President Barack Obama is a failed leader", "title": "GOP presidential hopefuls scramble to stand out in South Carolina", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RTX1C9RN.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gop-presidential-hopefuls-scramble-stand-south-carolina/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Republicans making their pitch to be the party's 2016 presidential nominee aimed to out-do each other Saturday in arguing that President Barack Obama is a failed leader", "title": "GOP presidential hopefuls scramble to stand out in South Carolina", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RTX1C9RN.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, GOP presidential hopefuls, PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdaaa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAny one of them would be better than the disaster we\u2019ve got now,\u201d said Gary Gunderson of Abbeville, South Carolina.\nMike Huckabee, who was in South Carolina on Friday.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what sets me apart.\u201dThose not in South Carolina on Saturday included former Florida Gov.\nHe added that along with criticizing Obama, Republicans should focus their ire on Clinton \u2013 a point on which many in the crowd agreed.\n\u201cThe last time a Republican carried the state for president was 1984,\u201d he said."}
