Physicians monitor such patients closely to help them avoid setbacks. Patients generally are instructed to monitor their own vital signs at home between visits to the clinic.\n\nMilani said using the Apple technology is like having \u201can easy button\u201d that wirelessly sends key data directly from a patient\u2019s home to the clinic.\n\n\u201cHealthKit is a way to help jumpstart the monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides us with more frequent data points, and that enables us to course-correct (our treatment) quickly in order to get to the patient\u2019s goal.\u201d\n\nA primary data point, or indicator, for patients who have experienced heart failure is weight fluctuation. So patients are instructed to weigh themselves each day and take note of any upward trend.\n\nBy using Apple HealthKit and a scale designed to integrate with the system, the patient\u2019s daily weigh-in results go directly to Ochsner. The system alerts a case manager to a meaningful change so that a physician or nurse can be immediately informed.\n\nSimilarly, a patient using a blood pressure cuff that integrates with the system can take regular pressure and heart rate readings at home and the data can go directly to the clinic.\n\nThe technology is helping to reduce hospital readmissions by enabling doctors to resolve issues at an early stage, Milani said.\n\n\u201cWe know that if we can collect this data more frequently, we can reduce your chance of a heart attack, stroke or even dying,\u201d he said.\n\nMilani said about 200 patients are using the technology, and Ochsner soon will expand the program to include patients with hypertension. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some success, and we want to do more,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Ochsner launched its Apple HealthKit program in October, it became the first health care provider in the country to integrate the Apple service into its electronic health records system provided by Epic Systems Corp., which is a leading provider of EHR technology. Other Epic clients have since followed suit.\n\nSumi Rana, who is chief technology officer for Wisconsin-based Epic, said the company now uses HealthKit in records systems that serve 170 million patients. He said patients must give their permission for the Epic system to access data from Apple HealthKit\u2019s data repository and share it with the patient\u2019s doctor.\n\n\u201cNow that health care organizations like Ochsner have data not only from traditional means, but also coming directly from the patients, the clinicians and care managers can get a more complete picture of the patient\u2019s health,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, he predicted, developers will find ways to extract the most medically relevant data from those popular wearable activity trackers and integrate it into a total medical record, as well. \u201cThis is going to be the future of health care,\u201d Rana said.\n\nThe move by Apple and other tech powerhouses into health technology coincides with the increased use of incentives, under the Affordable Care Act and other health care initiatives, for doctors to keep patients healthy. The new services help providers steer clear of the \u201cfee for service\u201d model, which has tended to reward physicians based on procedures and treatments they prescribe rather than on health outcomes.\n\nThe technology carries certain financial rewards for health care providers. By helping to keep patients out of hospitals, institutions can avoid penalties for readmissions that they could incur under new U.S. government guidelines.\n\nIn addition, Medicare recently has begun making monthly payments to providers for non-face-to-face care coordination services for patients who have two or more chronic conditions, making remote data monitoring more financially viable.\n\nMeanwhile, many independent software developers are working on ways to integrate new apps with services created by Apple and other tech companies and to create apps that can work on their own to improve health care coordination.\n\nOne local player in this space is the health and wellness platform developer Get Healthy. Company CEO and founder Blaine Lindsey said doctors can use his software to communicate with patients and monitor such \u201cbiometrics\u201d as blood pressure, heart rate and glucose readings.\n\n\u201cWith our app, the doctor decides what data is meaningful for a specific patient and then uses Get Healthy to collect that data,\u201d Lindsey said.\n\nHe said that, in contrast to Apple HealthKit, Get Healthy does not aim to link into a provider\u2019s records system, but rather to streamline the sharing of crucial data between doctor and patient.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on wellness and not electronic health records,\u201d he said.\n\nLindsey said both types of technology are \u201cchanging medicine from reactive to proactive\u201d by helping doctors home in on health problems before they become acute.\n\nHe thinks the Get Healthy system will find favor with health care providers in rural settings and smaller institutions that have fewer resources but \u201cwant to play on the same field\u201d as large hospitals.\n\nLindsey said Get Healthy soon will launch a pilot program with a large physician group in southwestern Louisiana, and the company is in the process of raising funds to expand into targeted locations in Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina and New Hampshire.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/: As fitness-crazed consumers embrace wearable activity trackers that record their every move, Ochsner Health System is among the first medical providers in the country to test the potential for similar technology to substantially change how doctors assess", "og": {"url": "http://theadvocate.com/news/11654837-123/patient-tracking-takes-a-techy", "image": "http://theadvocate.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=45_m2Wz3HbHcvvuBqLx2_8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuciQIPvcwbEa8NWhiCGSH$WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "As fitness-crazed consumers embrace wearable activity trackers that record their every move, Ochsner Health System is among the first medical providers in the country to test the potential for similar", "title": "Patient tracking takes a techy turn at Ochsner"}, "robots": "NOODP", "fb": {"app_id": 514908288573846}, "google-site-verification": "WJ-GmvLB0_4_ubFhOXLkAFEJNrdaozYvrgZP8mTLz5U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6ad\"", "article_summary": "Patient tracking takes a techy turn at OchsnerPatient tracking takes a techy turn at OchsnerAs fitness-crazed consumers embrace wearable activity trackers that record their every move, Ochsner Health System is among the first medical providers in the country to test the potential for similar technology to substantially change how doctors assess the health of chronically ill patients and deliver basic care.\n\u201cThis is going to be the future of health care,\u201d Rana said.\nThe technology carries certain financial rewards for health care providers.\nMilani said about 200 patients are using the technology, and Ochsner soon will expand the program to include patients with hypertension.\nBy using Apple HealthKit and a scale designed to integrate with the system, the patient\u2019s daily weigh-in results go directly to Ochsner."}
