But their often over-the-top criticisms of the decision are reflective of what is most often misunderstood about the charter school sector and what that industry has come to represent in the political debate about public schools.\n\nFirst, about the ruling: As Emma Brown of the Washington Post reports, \u201cWashington state\u2019s Supreme Court has become the first in the nation to decide that taxpayer-funded charter schools are unconstitutional, reasoning that charters are not truly public schools because they aren\u2019t governed by elected boards and therefore not accountable to voters.\u201d\n\nBrown explains how voters in the state previously rejected charter schools on two ballot initiatives only to see an initiative pass on the third attempt, in 2012, when a who\u2019s who of billionaires \u2013 including Bill Gates and members of the Walton (Walmart) and Bezos (Amazon) families \u2013 donated millions of dollars to ensure passage. Today, there are nine charter schools in Washington serving about 1,200 students.\n\nThe court\u2019s 6-to-3 ruling, Brown explains, relies \u201con a century-old precedent that defined \u2018common schools,\u2019 or public schools, as those that are \u2018common to all children of proper age and capacity, free, and subject to and under the control of the qualified voters of the school district.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Washington court\u2019s ruling certainly didn\u2019t catch education historian Diane Ravitch by surprise. On her personal blog, she points to a letter from Parents Across America, a parent-led advocacy group supporting locally operated public schools, that explained to the state superintendent, over two years ago, \u201cCharter schools would not meet the definition of \u2018common schools\u2019\u201d in the state constitution.\n\nNevertheless, charter school advocates seethed.\n\nEarly out of the gate to object to the ruling was the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal whose headline blared, \u201d The Judges Who Stole School Choice.\u201d The editors\u2019 opprobrium continued, \u201cThe liberal majority\u2019s real concern is preserving the union monopoly \u2026 Charter schools are public schools too.\u201d\n\nAt the blog site of the right-wing Thomas B. Fordham Institute, the director the University of Washington\u2019s Center on Reinventing Public Education called the ruling a \u201cdecision only the Kremlin could love.\u201d\n\nBut anyone with a clear understanding of the issues \u2013 rather than a charter school advocacy job bankrolled by billionaires \u2013 could see this ruling coming from a mile away.\n\nWhy Charter Schools Aren\u2019t Really \u201cPublic\u201d Schools\n\nAs the Post\u2019s Brown reported, the Washington\u2019s court\u2019s ruling \u201chighlights a question that has spurred much debate in education circles as charter schools \u2013 which are funded with taxpayer dollars, but run by independent organizations \u2013 have expanded rapidly during the past two decades: What makes a public school public?\u201d\n\nTo critics of the charter school sector, the very idea of calling charter schools \u201cpublic\u201d schools makes about as much sense as calling defense contractors \u201cpublic\u201d companies. The fact these entities get taxpayer money does not mean they are \u201cpublic.\u201d\n\nFor years, education law and finance scholars have warned that the legal status of charter schools is on shaky ground. In 2012, Rutgers University professor Bruce Baker asked, on his personal blog, \u201cCharter Schools Are\u2026 [Public? Private? Neither? Both?].\u201d\n\nBaker notes, first, that charter schools differ from public schools, in most statutory law, because they have limited public access. Unlike public schools, charter schools \u201ccan define the number of enrollment slots they wish to make available \u2026 admit students only on an annual basis and do not have to take students mid-year, [and] set academic, behavior and cultural standards that promote exclusion of students.\u201d\n\nThese points of difference between charter and public schools are glaringly obvious in the neighborhoods where charters are common. Those who protest charter school expansions in their communities note how charter schools use lotteries to limit the number of students in their schools while public schools are frequently overcrowded. Charter schools are often criticized for not \u201cback filling\u201d and taking in new students mid-year as empty seats become available. And charter schools are notorious for enforcing student behavior codes that lead to frequent discipline violations and increase suspension and expulsion rates.\n\nBaker found that in their authorization, governance and operation, charter schools are frequently exempted from requirements public schools have, such as open meeting laws, disclosure of financial records, and employee rights.\n\nIn January 2015, Baker collaborated with two other scholars to publish a review, the \u201cLegal Status of Charter Schools in State Statutory Law,\u201d in the University of Massachusetts Law Review, which found that in most states the legal distinctions between charter schools and public schools are not at all clear due primarily to how legislation providing for charters is often drafted without including any \u201cclear set of rules to follow\u201d for governing the schools \u2013 a provision, by the way, the charter lobby often insists on.\n\nThe analysis examined whether charter schools, which are generally run by private boards or educational management organizations, are entitled to governmental immunity and whether they are subject to public accountability laws. The scholars examined whether charter schools are subject to the same wage statutes and student expulsion requirements as public school.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charter schools will be accountable when they are just as transparent as public schools.
