In talking with the newspaper, he referred to an Institute of Medicine report that found more than $760 billion was wasted in healthcare each year because of consumer fraud, unnecessary procedures and excessive administrative costs.\n\nThe problem, he said, is consumers don't know the cost or value of healthcare services. \"We have to bring everybody to the table,\" Mead said.\n\nAetna's campaign also emphasizes the importance of providers shifting to an accountable care model, which is often associated with technology that helps providers measure performance and manage data.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act encourages the system to move to accountable care,\" Mead said. \"The challenge with that is that doctors and hospitals need technology and support to make that work.\"\n\nThat's why Aetna launched a new division within the company, Healthagen, to sell health technology services to providers. And Aetna empowers its provider partners with unprecedented access to claims data through its accountable care program, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nBut not everyone believes technology can reduce healthcare waste. \"When you're talking about having to manage waste in the system, most would agree that a lack of coordination rests at the heart of a lot of it,\" Robert Huckman, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, told the Times. \"Data without an educated way of querying that data is not helpful. It is a start.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the New York Times article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAetna: Empower providers with data for ACO success\n\nAetna creates new unit for health management, IT services\n\nAetna launches updated iTriage app\n\nAetna buys popular mobile app iTriage maker for ACO", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aetna is hoping a new marketing campaign can help boost its efforts to encourage provider coordination and enhance the use of health technologies.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Aetna is hoping a new marketing campaign can help boost its efforts to encourage provider coordination and enhance the use of health technologies.", "title": "Aetna touts health IT as cost cutter in new marketing campaign", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/aetna-marketing-campaign-touts-health-it-cost-cutter/2013-09-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "accountable care,Aetna,health technology,Healthagen,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,Marketing Campaign,Operations & Business Management,provider coordination", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Marketing & Consumer Engagement,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd47b\"", "article_summary": "That's why Aetna launched a new division within the company, Healthagen, to sell health technology services to providers.\nAetna is hoping a new marketing campaign can help boost its efforts to encourage provider coordination and enhance the use of health technologies.\n\"We believe that the healthcare system is desperately in need of improvement,\" Robert Mead, Aetna's senior vice president of marketing, product and communications, told the Times.\n\"The Affordable Care Act encourages the system to move to accountable care,\" Mead said.\nAnd Aetna empowers its provider partners with unprecedented access to claims data through its accountable care program, FierceHealthPayer previously reported."}
