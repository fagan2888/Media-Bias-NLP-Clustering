Is your state a leader in innovation?

The Consumer Electronics Association, a technology trade association, released its first Innovation Scorecard this week, ranking each state on its “innovation performance.”

Consumer Electronics Association evaluated all 50 states and Washington, D.C. on criteria such as “right-to-work laws, policies that support new business models, tax friendliness, Internet speed, and size of the tech workforce.”

The ten “innovation champions” – the states that earned the highest rankings – are Delaware, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The rest of the states are sorted into three categories: innovation leader, innovation adopter or modest innovator.

Users can also use the scorecard to examine specific criteria for each state, such as which states have the best Internet speed or have passed right to work laws. The scorecard also enables users to tweet their state’s score to their governor and legislators.

“I want to congratulate our ten Innovation champions – nine states and D.C. – whose proactive support for innovation enables startups and established businesses in these states to thrive,” Gary Shapiro, the president and CEO of CEA, said in a statement. “The future of growth and economic prosperity in this country is most vibrant in places where policies and political climates serve to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude that is part of our American DNA. Our hope is that states will use our scorecard as a measurable guidepost to improve their policies supporting innovation.”
