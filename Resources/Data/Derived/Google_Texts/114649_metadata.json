I recently wrote that it\u2019s time for my liberal and moderate friends \u201cto get hard.\u201d I made the case that in fact, because of our inattention and our tendency to compromise that we have lost on nearly every social and political agenda of importance: increasing social inequality; larger military budgets; more weapons on the street; a stalled immigration reform; endless money in our politics, and now, with one piece of success, the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have threatened to cause a global economic disaster to stall this one feeble victory for Democrats.\n\nBut maybe I misinterpreted a few things. I\u2019ve been reading and analyzing a recent piece of research that looked at the main constituencies within the Republican Party: the Tea Party, Republican libertarians, and Evangelicals, and the overwhelming finding from this quite thorough and unbiased study was that Evangelicals, in particular, feel that the country has been lost; their notion of faith has been destroyed; they see in the Tea Party a group that is, at least, willing to put up a fight for their values and principles.\n\nFor Evangelicals, the Republican Party has failed them in almost every way. They have given in on gay marriage and rights for gay people in America; abortion continues apace; they have been defeated by a Democratic Party that is \u201cexpanding dependency\u201d at a record rate and winning a plurality of the electorate. They have been defeated by a \u201cslick, lying, socialist\u201d in Barack Obama; their country, as they know it, is disappearing, with the white population shrinking and minorities now becoming the majority. The Christian country, which they loved and defended and worked for, is dying before their eyes, and the Republicans do nothing but give in over and over again.\n\nNow, I know my liberal, progressive and moderate friends have just thrown up a little in their mouths. I say, hold on. Think about the other side. We all pride ourselves on being understanding and big hearted, and being willing to listen to the other side, well, THIS is the other side. These are Americans who, in general, have fought for this country, died for this country, and often have done much of the dirty work for the liberal \u201ccreative class\u201d who generally doesn\u2019t go to war, or work in the manufacturing sections of the American workforce. Our Republican friends want an America where hard work is recognized and dependency on government is frowned upon; a country in which family values are admired and upheld and children are raised to do what is right and good.\n\nWe all might have very different views on what\u2019s right and good. But Evangelicals are an American population that deserves a voice. And that\u2019s the point; they feel that they have LOST THEIR VOICE AND LOST THEIR COUNTRY. So, in a strange sense, liberals and conservatives are in the same boat, both feeling that something has been lost.\n\nLet me give you one more example. In a new article about the U.S. Military\u2014it was reported that in a training meeting, officials for the U.S. Military argued that the American Family Association should be considered a \u201cdomestic hate group.\u201d A hate group because it takes a stand against homosexual behavior; it was said that the AFA should be filed along side the Ku Klux Klan and neo-nazis.\n\nMany progressives may say, \u201cAmen, thank God for the U.S. Military.\u201d But imagine how this sits with American Evangelicals, who truly believe in America, in its causes and in their belief that homosexual behavior is \u201cabhorrent\u201d and not what is \u201cintended\u201d for their families. It really is a time of defeat and devastation for them.\n\nNow, as I\u2019ve written on my blog, I am for equal rights for the LGBT community and I\u2019ve worked through what I called my \u201cprejudices\u201d toward these folks. But shouldn\u2019t we, as liberal, progressives and moderates, understand people who are different from us? Shouldn\u2019t we be somewhat understanding of a large swath of this country that feels like they have \u201clost\u201d their country?\n\nIn this way liberals and conservatives are in the same camp, we both feel like we\u2019ve been defeated. I\u2019m really not sure what this means. But at some level, maybe its time in the aftermath of this terrible episode in American history, to sit back and say, \u201cOkay, these folks, on some level, aren\u2019t that different than you and me. Neither of us is getting what we want. We don\u2019t have to agree but we also don\u2019t have to hate one another and we don\u2019t have to destroy a country because of our disagreements.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m calling for a sense of empathy and compassion. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m for tough debate; and I do believe in my more progressive principles and I won\u2019t back down. But I have tried to walk in the moccasins of those on the other side. It\u2019s not fun to lose, I know that existentially. So, maybe, just maybe, we can love one another even as fight for what we believe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jameswellman/2013/10/defeated-how-evangelicals-feel/", "site_name": "James Wellman on American Religion", "image": "http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/jameswellman/files/2013/10/Defeated3.jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "Defeated: How Evangelicals Feel"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19f5\"", "article_summary": "For Evangelicals, the Republican Party has failed them in almost every way.\nAnd that\u2019s the point; they feel that they have LOST THEIR VOICE AND LOST THEIR COUNTRY.\nIn this way liberals and conservatives are in the same camp, we both feel like we\u2019ve been defeated.\nBut Evangelicals are an American population that deserves a voice.\nMany progressives may say, \u201cAmen, thank God for the U.S. Military.\u201d But imagine how this sits with American Evangelicals, who truly believe in America, in its causes and in their belief that homosexual behavior is \u201cabhorrent\u201d and not what is \u201cintended\u201d for their families."}
