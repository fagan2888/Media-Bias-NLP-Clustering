Scammers told victims their family members had already paid for it and they would just need to provide their bank account or credit information for verification. Auction Reseller Scam \u2013 Scammers used Ebay and PayPal to lure in their victims. They figured out a way to have sellers mail the goods without receiving payment. The sellers receive an email that looks like it is from PayPal, but it was really just a fake. The BBB says always confirm payments in your Ebay and PayPal accounts before shipping goods, especially overseas. Arrest Warrant Scam \u2013 These scams take advantage of the fact that you can change what shows up on caller IDs when you call someone. Scammers change their name to resemble a law enforcement agency and call people to tell them they have an outstanding warrant for their arrest. They tell victims they can pay to avoid criminal charges.

You can check out home contractors at bbb.org before hiring them. Casting Call Scam \u2013 Scammers pose as casting agents for hit television shows. They either offer acting lessons or photography sessions to help the aspiring actor or charge fees for fake applications and casting calls. Foreign Currency Scam \u2013 Scammers target their victims and tell them they can make great investments by purchasing foreign currency. You are told you can sell and cash in when governments revalue the currency, but this is very unlikely to happen and the currency will be difficult to sell. Scam Texts \u2013 These texts look like an alert from your bank asking you to confirm information with a fake link. Sometimes the link will download malicious software that gives scammers access to everything on your phone. Do Not Call Scams \u2013 Scammers call and offer to add your name to the National Do Not Call Registry. They ask for personal information and sometimes charge a fee to join.\n\nFake Friend Scam \u2013 On Facebook, people are creating fake profles to be used in a variety of ways. Some will download malware or use your account to prey on your friends.\n\nGarbage collector\u2019s patriotic gesture brings resident to tears\n\nThis is proof positive that although Obamacare is losing its luster among American citizens, it\u2019s number one on the list of scammers and con artists and swindlers.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The Better Business Bureau announced its \u201cTop 10 Scams of 2013.\u201d Leading the pack, believe it or not, was the Affordable Care Act Scam, which most would refer to as the Obamacare scam.
