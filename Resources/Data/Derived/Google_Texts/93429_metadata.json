Peter Shumlin\u2019s quest to build a single-payer health care system is leaving the administration.\n\nDavid Reynolds, a former health policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders and a co-crafter of the federal Affordable Care Act, began working this year on what a single-payer system would look like, as Shumlin\u2019s deputy director of health care reform policy. Meanwhile, former Policy Director at the Tax Department Michael Costa began working on the public financing piece of a proposed universal health care system.\n\nAt the ripe age of 66, Reynolds is moving on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be my own boss,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI say I\u2019m semi-retiring because I want to stay engaged and pick and choose what I want to do. Anything from teaching to consulting to writing. \u2026 I\u2019ll certainly be an observer and a critic and a contributor going forward.\u201d\n\nReynolds founded Northern Counties Health Care Inc. in 1976, Vermont\u2019s first network of Federally Qualified Health Centers. More than three decades later, he was on the front-lines of a Washington, D.C., battlefield, negotiating the future of the country\u2019s health care policy framework. He advocated for the inclusion of a waiver in the Affordable Care Act that would allow a state to deviate from the federal law in 2017 \u2014 something that is necessary for Vermont to create a publicly financed, single-payer system.\n\n\u201cEverybody is replaceable, but not really,\u201d said Con Hogan, a member of the Green Mountain Care Board and a former Secretary of the Agency of Human Services. \u201cThey will find someone else to do the job, but you\u2019re not going to find anyone else with that kind of background.\u201d\n\nHogan touted Reynolds\u2019 ability to approach difficult discussions with a sense of humor and optimism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a skill; it\u2019s an attribute,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cTwenty years ago, he was doing things in Northern Counties that we\u2019re only talking about doing for the rest of the state today. \u2026 We\u2019re losing that sense of experience and the value system that goes along with it. Sometimes you lose somebody, and you\u2019re losing more than just the person, and that\u2019s how I feel about David. He\u2019s really been in the middle of this stuff for a long time and understands it better than most of us.\u201d\n\nReynolds left Sanders\u2019 office two years ago and joined state government to help transfer authority to the newly created Green Mountain Care Board, charged with controlling the state\u2019s growing health care costs. In his two-year stint with the state, Reynolds and Director of Health Care Reform Robin Lunge touted two of his major achievements.\n\nThe first was his effort to reclassify routine outpatient mental health and substance abuse services as primary care.\n\n\u201cUntil this year, all mental health services were classified as specialty care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat meant that before people could get their insurers to pay for it, they had to meet a deductible, and then they had to pay a copay for specialist care, which was much higher than your copay for primary care.\u201d\n\nThe second accomplishment was his work on what\u2019s known as the \u201cHealth Care Workforce Strategic Plan,\u201d which the Green Mountain Care Board approved earlier this year. It is a plan for the labor side of Vermont\u2019s health care reform equation.\n\n\u201cWe can provide coverage, but if we don\u2019t have the workforce to deliver the services it\u2019s going to be an empty promise to Vermonters,\u201d he said.\n\nLunge said her policy analyst, Devon Green, would take over some of Reynolds\u2019 Statehouse duties, and the administration would soon begin searching for someone to fill the position. Reynolds\u2019 final day working on the fifth floor of the Pavilion building will be Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly miss David,\u201d Lunge said. \u201cBut I think one of David\u2019s strengths is that he\u2019s been able to create structures that can live on after him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "green mountain care board, single-payer health care, vermont health connect, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "David Reynolds, Gov.
