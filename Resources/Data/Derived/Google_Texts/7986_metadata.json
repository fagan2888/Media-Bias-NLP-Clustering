The Obama administration has decided, however, that the option of having a private third party collect and retain the telephone metadata is unworkable for both legal and practical reasons. \u201cI think that\u2019s accurate for right now,\u201d a senior U.S. security official said. Telephone \u201cmetadata\u201d includes records of which telephone number calls which other number, when the calls were made and how long they lasted. Metadata does not include the content of the calls. An alternative proposal, which U.S. officials said the administration is still considering, would have telecommunications firms collect and retain such data. The senior U.S. security official said that among the concerns officials had when examining that option was putting security protocols at risk. The official also cited concerns about the extra costs of moving data from telecom companies to a third party, and in a format which the government agencies found easy to use. The official said there would be no significant cost to the government to require telecom providers to hold the data.\n\nPerhaps leaving the telecom companies in charge of the data is the best approach, given that it\u2019s cost-effective, and involves the least amount of movement from source to storage. From a public-relations standpoint, the goal of these post-Snowden reform proposals is to erase the image of phone companies \u201cgiving our phone data to the government.\u201d If the companies are storing the data themselves and making it accessible to the government, the public\u2019s comfort level with the process might increase.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear just how uncomfortable the general public is with any of this, especially in the wake of more high-profile terrorism news, filling the airwaves with discussions of sleeper cells and \u201clone wolf\u201d jihadis. The Snowden storm blew in with a flurry of polls showing voters, especially young voters, were outraged by the Surveillance State revelations, but more recent surveys show a pronounced shift back to favoring security over privacy. The latest Washington Post / ABC News poll on the subject shows that even young adults are evenly divided, with 48 percent in favor of prioritizing the investigation of terror threats, versus 47 percent who feel protecting citizens\u2019 privacy is more important.\n\nThere would appear to be considerable evidence for the argument that public opinion on the subject is driven more by current events and the intensity of news coverage than thorough consideration of the privacy challenges posed by the Internet era. Modest gestures to dispel the creepy image of intelligence agents stashing terabytes of phone surveillance data in huge computerized vaults, to be riffled through at their leisure, might be all it takes to keep public opinion comfortably on the side of security\u2026 at least until they are presented with an outrageous example of abuse perpetrated against law-abiding citizens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Drops Plan to Store NSA Phone-Snooping Data With Third Parties", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Drops Plan to Store NSA Phone-Snooping Data With Third Parties", "title": "Obama Drops Plan to Store NSA Phone-Snooping Data With Third Parties - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/smartphone.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-24T14:22:39-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/24/obama-drops-plan-to-store-nsa-phone-snooping-data-with-third-parties/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Drops Plan to Store NSA Phone-Snooping Data With Third Parties", "title": "Obama Drops Plan to Store NSA Phone-Snooping Data With Third Parties - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/smartphone.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "cell phones, Edward Snowden, metadata, NSA, surveillance state,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-24T20:00:34-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-01-24T14:22:39-07:00", "tag": "surveillance state", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Telephone \u201cmetadata\u201d includes records of which telephone number calls which other number, when the calls were made and how long they lasted.\nThe senior U.S. security official said that among the concerns officials had when examining that option was putting security protocols at risk.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s accurate for right now,\u201d a senior U.S. security official said.\nThe Obama administration has decided, however, that the option of having a private third party collect and retain the telephone metadata is unworkable for both legal and practical reasons.\nPerhaps leaving the telecom companies in charge of the data is the best approach, given that it\u2019s cost-effective, and involves the least amount of movement from source to storage."}
