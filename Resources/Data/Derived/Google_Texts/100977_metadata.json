He canceled his appearance, citing a pressing family matter that \u201ctrumps politics,\u201d according to a statement he sent to event organizers.\n\nCo-hosted by the San Antonio Tea Party, Alamo City Republican Women and the Republican Men's Club of Bexar County, the event at San Antonio Firefighters Banquet Hall drew about 200 people, including numerous down-ballot candidates, GOP loyalists and tea party activists.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, who unseated Canseco two years ago, wasn't part of the forum and was hardly mentioned, aside from Lowry saying Gallego missed his chance to improve immigration policy and border security in the district that sweeps from San Antonio to El Paso.\n\nWith little disagreement, the two candidates fielded pointed questions from San Antonio Tea Party President Allen Tharp, who cast Obamacare as a fiasco, assailed the House GOP leadership, derided entitlement programs and suggested President Barack Obama should be impeached.\n\n\u201cProfessional politicians and lawyers are part of the problem with Washington, D.C. If we want to change what's going on in Washington, we need to change the kind of people we're sending there,\u201d said Hurd, a cybersecurity specialist.\n\n\u201cThere's absolutely nothing wrong with the conservative principles of the Republican Party. The problem is, we keep sending folks to Washington, D.C., that don't know how to implement them,\u201d Hurd said.\n\nLowry, with a slogan of \u201cThe Cure for Congress,\u201d said he would advocate term limits and buck House rules that empower the speaker and committee chairs. He also favors elimination of numerous federal entities not prescribed by the Constitution.\n\nThe GOP leadership \u201chas given up their morals. That's why they always find themselves compromised. It's time to go on the offensive, know what you're talking about and quite compromising,\u201d Lowry said\n\njgonzalez@express-news.net\n\nTwitter: johnwgonzalez", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "SAN ANTONIO \u2014 Two of the three GOP candidates for Congressional District 23 faced off before a tea party audience on Thursday and drew cheers as they pledged to attack the nation's budget problems and reduce illegal immigration.
