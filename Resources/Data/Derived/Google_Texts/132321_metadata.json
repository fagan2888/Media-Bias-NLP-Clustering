They are both low risk, having uneventful pregnancies. But how they will deliver their baby \u2014 whether they\u2019ll have a c-section, for example \u2014 depends dramatically on the hospital each woman chooses when she delivers.\n\nThe California Hospital Assessment and Reporting Taskforce, or CHART, crunched the numbers and found wide and, frankly, stunning variation in the rates of four common procedures related to delivery and newborn care: c-section, episiotomy, breastfeeding and vaginal birth after c-section.\n\nThe Oakland-based California HealthCare Foundation created this infographic to illustrate what CHART found:\n\nCHCF has further taken the data and mapped the state\u2019s highest and lowest performing hospitals. (The map does not include all hospitals in California.) Almost all of the 33 high-performing hospitals (88 percent) are in Northern California and include many Kaiser hospitals, San Francisco General, Stanford and Sutter Santa Rosa, to name just a few.\n\nAll of the 12 low-performing hospitals are in Southern California and include Citrus Valley Medical Center and Garfield Medical Center.\n\nOne note \u2014 CHCF says they included the VBAC rate because it is one of the measures used to define performance, even though the infographic focused on women delivering for the first time. CHCF explains its metrics this way: \u201c\u2018High performing\u2019 is defined as three or more Superior or Above Average scores and no Average, Below Average, or Poor scores on the four maternity measures available on CalQualityCare.org. \u2018Low performing\u2019 is defined as three or more Below Average or Poor scores on the four maternity measures.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two women with low-risk pregnancies will have different outcomes based on the hospitals they choose.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In California, Where You Deliver Your Baby Matters\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/12\\/11\\/in-california-where-you-deliver-your-baby-matters\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-11 11:47:19\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-12-15 10:58:45\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22946,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Hospitals\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/12\\/iStock_000001289946_Large-e1418326296213.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Two women with low-risk pregnancies will have different outcomes based on the hospitals they choose.", "title": "In California, Where You Deliver Your Baby Matters", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/12/11/in-california-where-you-deliver-your-baby-matters/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/12/TaleTwoBirths-640x895.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "hospitals", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccff\"", "article_summary": "In California, Where You Deliver Your Baby MattersTwo women in California are having a baby for the first time.\nAll of the 12 low-performing hospitals are in Southern California and include Citrus Valley Medical Center and Garfield Medical Center.\nThe Oakland-based California HealthCare Foundation created this infographic to illustrate what CHART found:CHCF has further taken the data and mapped the state\u2019s highest and lowest performing hospitals.\nBut how they will deliver their baby \u2014 whether they\u2019ll have a c-section, for example \u2014 depends dramatically on the hospital each woman chooses when she delivers.\n\u2018Low performing\u2019 is defined as three or more Below Average or Poor scores on the four maternity measures."}
