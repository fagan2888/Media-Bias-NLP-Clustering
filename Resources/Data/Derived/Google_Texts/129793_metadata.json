The dedication, vision, and prayers of every volunteer in the state, along with the hard work and commitment of our sponsors and their staff, is what made this victory possible. The people of Alabama should hold their heads high \u2014 they\u2019ve implemented the Founders tool to fight federal overreach, and we\u2019re one step closer to turning a Convention of States into a reality.\u201d\n\nConvention of States co-founder Mark Meckler said \u201cThe citizens of the great state of Alabama have stepped up and joined the movement to tell the federal government to back off by passing the Convention of States resolution by overwhelming majorities. Legislation is pending in many other states, with Texas and Kansas next in line. The citizens are speaking; it\u2019s time for the states to put the federal government back in the box.\u201d\n\nLegislatures in 36 states have constitutional convention resolutions now making their way through committees and other parts of the legislative process.\n\nAt least 34 states, or two-thirds, must pass applications for a convention and ultimately would need a sign-off from Congress to hold a convention. Thirty-eight states must then ratify any amendment proposals coming out of such a convention.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alabama became the fourth state on Thursday to pass the legislation calling for a convention of states to limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Alabama became the fourth state on Thursday to pass the legislation calling for a convention of states to limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government.", "title": "Alabama joins coalition of states calling for convention to limit federal power", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/23/alabama-joins-coalition-of-states-calling-for-conv/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/23/Constitution_AP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/23/Constitution_AP.jpg", "description": "Alabama became the fourth state on Thursday to pass the legislation calling for a convention of states to limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government.", "card": "summary", "title": "Alabama joins coalition of states calling for convention to limit fede"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress"}, "article_summary": "Alabama has become the fourth state to pass legislation calling for a constitutional convention of states to limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government.\nLast week\u2019s move made Alabama the first state to pass such legislation this year after Georgia, Florida, and Alaska which passed the Convention of States resolution in 2014.\nAt least 34 states, or two-thirds, must pass applications for a convention and ultimately would need a sign-off from Congress to hold a convention.\nThirty-eight states must then ratify any amendment proposals coming out of such a convention.\nLegislation is pending in many other states, with Texas and Kansas next in line."}
