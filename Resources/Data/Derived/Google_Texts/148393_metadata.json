Chuck\u2019s initial reaction was to chase Grace off the lake. The Nature Center isolated Chuck for a couple of days, letting Grace have the lake to herself. Then Chuck was put back on the water and the pair of swans hit it off, said Nature Center Manager Jennifer Curtis .\n\n\u201cThey have been inseparable since,' he said.\n\nBoth flightless from being pinioned \u2014 where people have cut off the end of one wing \u2014 the swans spend their days at Lake Aspen swimming and sitting together. At times they mirror each other\u2019s movements and have been spotted performing mating dances. \u201cThey are really enjoying each other,' Curtis said.\n\nChuck is quick to rear up, raise his voice and spread his wings to protect Grace if he feels someone has come too close to her.\n\nChuck\u2019s aggressive behavior didn\u2019t always have such purpose.\n\nBefore Grace, he appeared frustrated with failed attempts to keep a mate, said Kirstin Rea, a naturalist at the Nature Center.\n\nA resident at Lake Aspen for two years, Chuck twice had wild female swans stop by Sunriver and show interest in him, only to eventually fly away. Rea said the problem may have been that Chuck could not fly himself.\n\n\u201cOne of my co-workers said it is like trying to date without a car,' she said.\n\nPerhaps angry about his lack of luck at landing love, Chuck would lash out at people who came too close, honking, hissing and beating his wings.\n\nThe Nature Center responded by putting up a sign warning, \u201cCaution Swan is Aggressive.' Punctuating the point, video on the Nature Center\u2019s Facebook page posted in November 2014 shows Chuck snapping and biting at the sign.\n\nHaving found a mate, it appears Chuck has also found some peace, said Jay Bowerman, principal researcher at the Nature Center.\n\n\u201cThe moment he hooked up with Grace he has turned into an absolute perfect gentleman ,' he said.\n\nBowerman has taken to calling the swans \u201cSir Charles' and \u201cLady Grace.'\n\nLife was not always so easy for the swans \u2014 both were outcasts.\n\nBefore he was moved to Sunriver, Chuck was at Pronghorn Club northeast of Bend with his brother Larry. Larry took a mate and Chuck was the odd swan out.\n\nGrace used to live along the Deschutes River in Bend, near the First Street Rapids Park , but also didn\u2019t fit in with other swans that had paired up.\n\nWhile Chuck was part of a decades-old program supported by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to reintroduce trumpeter swans in Central Oregon, Grace\u2019s background is more mysterious. She just showed up a few years ago near downtown Bend. Birds in the state-supported program were pinioned so they would stay close to where they were released and hopefully produce young. In the 19th century , hunting of swans , sought for meat and feathers, nearly wiped the bird from Oregon.\n\nGrace\u2019s injury came in late December 2013. A pair of birders spotted her on Christmas Day with a fishing lure stuck in her mouth. High Desert Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in Bend teamed up with Grebe Acres Wild Bird Care in Sisters to save her.\n\nThe lure, which impaled her tongue, was surgically removed and then she went to Sisters to gain weight while healing from the wound, said Elise Wolf, owner of Grebe Acres, which specializes in water bird rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cShe was a good patient,' she said.\n\nAfter three weeks, Grace was returned to the river by the rapids. Wolf said she continued to visit Grace and give her food, trying to help with her ongoing recovery. She saw Grace did not get along with the other swans there and is glad she has now found better waters in Sunriver.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be happier for Grace,' Wolf said. \u201cI love that girl so much.'\n\nMarilyn Miller, the birder who came across Grace when she was injured, shared Wolf\u2019s enthusiasm after hearing Grace had found a new home and a mate.\n\n\u201cOh cool, cool, because Grace was getting picked on by other swans,' said Miller, who has been involved with the East Cascades Audubon Society.\n\nSwans typically mate for life, Rea said, and they can be picky. It looks as though Chuck and Grace have picked each other. On Thursday afternoon, Curtis tossed cracked corn into the water to entice the swans off an island in Lake Aspen. They stayed close together as they swam to the snack.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are ever any more than 50 feet from each other,' Rea said. \u201cIt might be a little more than that.'\n\nThe swans took turns leading their movements around the lake, and if one fell too far behind it was quick to catch up.\n\nNow that Chuck and Grace seem to be a couple the question is whether they\u2019ll have any cygnets, or baby swans, said Simon Wray, high desert conservation biologist with the state Department of Fish and Wildfire.\n\n\u201cWe missed the breeding season this year, but we have high hopes they\u2019ll be ready to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll next spring,' he said.\n\nFor now, Nature Center workers and volunteers, as well as passers-by, will continue to watch the budding swan romance between Chuck and Grace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens next,' Curtis said, \u201cbut so far, so good.'\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7812, ddarling@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "SUNRIVER \u2014 Chuck, the sometimes aggressive trumpeter swan at the Sunriver Nature Center, appears to have finally found a pond partner.
