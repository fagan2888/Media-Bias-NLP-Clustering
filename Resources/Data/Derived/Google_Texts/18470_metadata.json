Some of the games will air on CBS while others air on Turner-owned cable-satellite channels TBS, TNT and truTV.\n\n\"We've been pretty lucky that we've had four Kentucky games in a row,\" said WKYT President and General Manager Chris Mossman about how Kentucky's first games in this year's NCAA tournament have ended up airing on CBS. \"This is the first year the Final Four has gone over to cable. Do I wish we could air it? Absolutely, I wish we could air this one. Hopefully, we'll have one Monday night to air.\"\n\nThis year's Final Four games -- Florida vs. Connecticut and Kentucky vs. Wisconsin -- will air on Turner stations while Monday night's national championship airs on CBS and WKYT.\n\nTurner is also doing a first this year.\n\nWhile the main national broadcast will air on cable-satellite channel TBS, \"teamcasts\" or games called by local commentators will air on on TNT and truTV.\n\nThe Kentucky teamcast by former Wildcat Rex Chapman and WKYT's Rob Bromley and Dave Baker will air on TNT.\n\nSo to watch Kentucky vs. Wisconsin in the Final Four, fans will need cable or satellite service to watch either TBS or TNT. The exact channel number depends on which cable or satellite provider you have and where you live.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year marks the first time the national semifinals of the NCAA tournament won't air on over-the-air television.", "language": "english", "author": "WKYT", "og": {"url": "http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/Reality-Check-Why-the-Final-Four-is-only-on-cable-satellite-this-year-253916081.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/00422B00-BDVQO.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This year marks the first time the national semifinals of the NCAA tournament won't air on over-the-air television.", "title": "Reality Check: Why the Final Four was only on cable-satellite this year"}, "twitter": {"description": "This year marks the first time the national semifinals of the NCAA tournament won't air on over-the-air television.", "title": "Reality Check: Why the Final Four was only on cable-satellite this year", "url": "http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/Reality-Check-Why-the-Final-Four-is-only-on-cable-satellite-this-year-253916081.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/00422B00-BDVQO.jpg", "creator": "@wkyt", "site": "@wkyt", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Reality Check: Why the Final Four was only on cable-satellite this year", "fb": {"app_id": 52140914980, "pages": 33684860765}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "FqJZslm8gAesoZ0HsqSrtOk2ypS-GmcIcdZP8leg9_I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Reality Check Why the Final, Four was only on cablesatellite"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f4d\"", "article_summary": "So to watch Kentucky vs. Wisconsin in the Final Four, fans will need cable or satellite service to watch either TBS or TNT.\nThis year marks the first time the national semifinals of the NCAA tournament won't air on over-the-air television.\nSome of the games will air on CBS while others air on Turner-owned cable-satellite channels TBS, TNT and truTV.\nTo watch Saturday night's Kentucky-Wisconsin game in the Final Four, Big Blue fans will need either cable or satellite service.\nThis year's Final Four games -- Florida vs. Connecticut and Kentucky vs. Wisconsin -- will air on Turner stations while Monday night's national championship airs on CBS and WKYT."}
