If converted this year, then they will be taxed at this year\u2019s marginal tax rate. If retained in the tax-deferred account and withdrawn later, they will be taxed at that year\u2019s tax rate. If this year\u2019s tax rate will be lower than your usual tax rate later in retirement, then look to convert funds to a Roth account this year.\n\nHere is a hypothetical example. Like many retirees, Sue has funds in tax-deferred accounts and taxable accounts. She has $300,000 in taxable accounts and $1,450,000 in tax-deferred accounts. She is 65 and plans to spend about $60,000 a year. For simplicity, we assume she does not qualify for Social Security benefits. She plans to withdraw $60,000 from her taxable account for the next five years, thus allowing her tax-deferred accounts to benefit from five more years of tax-deferred growth. Then, beginning at age 70, she would withdraw over $70,000 of pretax funds from her tax-deferred accounts to provide the $60,000 of after-tax funds.\n\nFor the first five years, her adjusted gross income will consist of interest, dividends, and realized capital gains on remaining assets held in her taxable account. This may be $6,000 in the first year (i.e., 2.5% of the $240,000 in taxable account assets that remain after the first-year\u2019s $60,000 withdrawal). Her adjusted gross income will be even lower in her next four years. Since the sum of personal exemption plus standard deduction in 2015 will be $11,850, her adjusted gross income would not be enough to cover this tax-free portion of her adjusted gross income. In contrast, at age 70 and beyond, she would have about $21,000 of tax-deferred account withdrawals taxed at the 25% tax rate.\n\nThere is a more tax-efficient withdrawal strategy. In the early years, she should convert enough funds from her tax-deferred account to a Roth IRA to fully use the 15% tax bracket. This will reduce or eliminate the amount of tax-deferred account withdrawals later in life that will be taxed at 25%. In short, it is better to convert some funds to a Roth each of the first five years and pay 0% to 15% on these conversions than to withdraw these funds later at a 25% tax rate. She should convert at least enough to ensure that she will fully use the 15% tax bracket. Suppose she converts $49,000 in 2015 and learns in March 2016 that this amount would raise her 2015 taxable income into the 25% bracket by $2,345. Then she recharacterizes $2,345. Perfect!\n\nWhen she reaches 70, she can withdraw sufficient funds from the tax-deferred account to take her taxable income to the top of the 15% bracket, and then withdraw other funds from her Roth account to meet her spending goal. In this fashion, she could avoid paying 25% tax rate on tax-deferred account withdrawals for decades.\n\nWilliam Reichenstein is Powers Professor at Baylor University and head of research atwww.socialsecuritysolutions.com.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "WILLIAM REICHENSTEIN: A key principle that could help many taxpayers extend the life of their financial portfolio is that funds in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) are pretax funds that will eventually be taxed.", "title": "How to Cut Taxes on Tax-Deferred Retirement Accounts", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/06/05/how-to-cut-taxes-on-tax-deferred-retirement-accounts/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IR757_expert_P_20150601145156.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "How to Cut Taxes on Tax-Deferred Retirement Accounts", "description": "WILLIAM REICHENSTEIN: A key principle that could help many taxpayers extend the life of their financial portfolio is that funds in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) are pretax funds that will eventually be taxed.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "WILLIAM REICHENSTEIN: A key principle that could help many taxpayers extend the life of their financial portfolio is that funds in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) are pretax funds that will eventually be taxed.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-05T10:00:24-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/06/05/how-to-cut-taxes-on-tax-deferred-retirement-accounts/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-5698", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "WILLIAM REICHENSTEIN: A key principle that could help many taxpayers extend the life of their financial portfolio is that funds in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) are pretax funds that will eventually be taxed.", "title": "How to Cut Taxes on Tax-Deferred Retirement Accounts", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/06/05/how-to-cut-taxes-on-tax-deferred-retirement-accounts/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IR757_expert_P_20150601145156.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-5698", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-05T11:00:38-04:00"}, "article_summary": "She has $300,000 in taxable accounts and $1,450,000 in tax-deferred accounts.\nLike many retirees, Sue has funds in tax-deferred accounts and taxable accounts.\nIn this fashion, she could avoid paying 25% tax rate on tax-deferred account withdrawals for decades.\nIf retained in the tax-deferred account and withdrawn later, they will be taxed at that year\u2019s tax rate.\nShe plans to withdraw $60,000 from her taxable account for the next five years, thus allowing her tax-deferred accounts to benefit from five more years of tax-deferred growth."}
