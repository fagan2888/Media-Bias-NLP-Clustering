No recording devices were permitted and I\u0092m not at liberty to disclose the exact location. I can tell you it was at a Starbucks somewhere in Silicon Valley.\n\nThrough our interview I discovered Mr. Kim often comes to the United States incognito under the guise of an NBA referee or as a ball boy for the New Orleans Pelicans, hence his close association with Dennis Rodman and his remarkable fluency in English punctuated by the occasional \u0093Yo,\u0094 \u0093Get outta my face\u0094 and \u0093dog.\u0094\n\nThis particular trip was to his favorite Best Buy to get a refund on an iPhone 6 that had evidently been jailbroken by the Geek Squad. Now it was unable to get WiFi and the phone\u0092s data charges were through the roof, sucking money from the North Korean economy that Kim thought could be put to much better use aiding the people with improved nuclear delivery systems and more inspiring statues.\n\nIn his dark glasses, Ray Rice Jersey, bright red Kobe 9 High KRM EXT running shoes, and a baseball cap turned backward, Kim Jong-un had quite an effective disguise. Save for the shock of black hair pushing the ball cap several inches above his head and the body guards attempting to look inconspicuous at nearby tables variously disguised as venture capitalists, software engineers and a barista, he looked like anybody else enjoying a mid-morning Starbucks break.\n\nAs he sipped his caramel brul\u00e9e latte and munched a pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese and a slice of Bermuda onion, we got down to the interview. Following is the word-for-word uncut and unedited transcript.\n\nNote about height, which seems to be a sore point with the Kim family:\n\nKim Jong-un\u0092s father, Kim Jong-il, was listed at 5\u00921\u0094, 2\u0094 or 3\u0094. When it comes to the subject of height, his grandfather Kim Il-song, appears to have had an unlisted number. As to Kim Jong-un being 5\u00929\u0094 \u0097 with a lot of artificial aids perhaps?.\n\nDL: Shall I call you Mr. Kim or would you prefer Dear Leader the way your people address you?\n\nKJ: Dear Leader sounds so formal. Just call me Dear.\n\nDL: Uh, Mr. Kim, I want to get right down to it. People say you had your own uncle killed and his body ripped apart and devoured by wild dogs just because he wasn\u0092t deferential enough toward you.\n\nKJ: A total exaggeration. The dogs were not wild. And he was not my favorite uncle. When he came to visit, he never put the seat up.\n\nDL: You mean down.\n\nKJ: I mean up. You ever go to the bathroom at 2 in the morning and plunk down on a wet sticky seat? If it happened to you a couple of times, how would you react?\n\nDL: We understand you also had his entire family killed.\n\nKJ: You know the saying about the apple not falling far from the tree. Well, it\u0092s the same with the pea. (He laughed heartily at his double entendre. The venture capitalists, software engineers and barista laughed heartily as well).\n\nDL: We hear your people don\u0092t get enough to eat.\n\nKJ: Again an exaggeration. They are on diets.\n\nDL: Diets? The whole country?\n\nKJ: Absolutely. In America there\u0092s an obesity epidemic leading to diabetes and heart attacks. In North Korea we don\u0092t have that.\n\nDL: What about North Korea\u0092s labor camps?\n\nKJ: Okay, what\u0092s your unemployment rate? Like five percent or something? And that\u0092s supposed to be good. Well our rate is zero. Zip. Nada. Everybody works. And there\u0092s no homeless problem. With camps, we have killed two birds with one stone.\n\nDL: What about consumer goods? North Korea seems to have very few cars for example.\n\nKJ: We\u0092re working on that, but it is a most vexing problem. You see it all has to do with our Department of Motor Vehicles. Not unlike the USA, it is very inefficient. And our DMV hasn\u0092t been computerized. So, people can\u0092t get drivers\u0092 licenses. No driver\u0092s license. No car. That\u0092s why we have so few cars.\n\nDL: You mentioned computers, let\u0092s talk about computers. Did you hack Sony pictures, release internal data, and threaten to destroy the company if \u0091The Interview\u0092 were released just because you were the target of an assassination plot in a satirical movie?\n\nKJ: No way Jose. You see the trailer? That flick was an unfunny dog, Dog. I mean the guy who was supposed to be me didn\u0092t look anything like me. He was fat and un-cool. I can state unequivocally and with no fear of contradiction Yo (Mr. Kim turned to several people in the Starbucks) anybody want to contradict me? (They all shook their heads no) Like I said, Dog, with no fear of contradiction, I did not hack Sony.\n\nDL: Did you have somebody else do it?\n\nKJ: Absolutely not, but I can tell you who did it. Republicans.\n\nDL: The Republicans?\n\nKJ: The hackers signed all their messages Guardians Of Peace. GOP also stands for Grand Old Party, the Republican Party\u0092s nickname. A coincidence? I think not.\n\nDL: Well President Obama believes North Korea was responsible and said he would retaliate with a measured response. Do you think that could mean a freeze on shoe-lift exports since the President emphasized the word measured? And would that be aimed directly at you?\n\nKJ: What\u0092s your email address? Who\u0092s your service provider? What\u0092s your YouTube channel? (As my chair was carried to the door -- with me in it -- by a venture capitalist, a barista and two software engineers, Mr. Kim shouted after me) And I\u0092m six foot .TWO AND A HALF IN MY STOCKING FEET.\n\nThis is Don \u00935 foot 7\u0094 Laskin and that was Observations.\n\nAbout Don Laskin\n\nLaskin is an award-winning writer/concepter, whose dry sense of humor occasionally gets him to trouble with people who don\u0092t share it.
