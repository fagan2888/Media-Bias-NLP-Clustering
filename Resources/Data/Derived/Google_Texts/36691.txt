Eagles' 8-year run as conference champs comes to a close

Sometimes, the hardest part about competition is coming to grips with the reality of the situation.

So often athletes are told if they do their best, try their hardest, they have nothing to feel bad about. Saturday's finals of the Northern Conference Swimming and Diving Championships was a specific moment where the theory was tested, and judging from the long faces and some wet eyes in the Thompson Valley contingent, the final outcome wasn't going to sit easy.

The Eagles, who had won the past eight conference titles, fell 11 points short on the afternoon as Silver Creek took their crown at the Mountain View Aquatic Center with 514 points. Coaches scoring the meet off seed times had the Raptors winning the title by around 100 points, but the Eagles made one heck of a run and wasted no time in getting to task.

"We had a team warm up, and (coach) Dale (Leonhart) talked to us and went through all of our races and showed us the places were we could move up," senior Mattea Wabeke, named the conference swimmer of the year, said. "He told us to kick it off with the medley relay, and if we could win it, it would set the tone for the rest of the meet. We won it, and we all kind of fed off each other's races."

Switching Eryn Eddy — who would win the 100- and 200-yard freestyles on the day with Northern Conference record times — to the anchor paid off when she chased down Silver Creek on the final leg. From there, the Eagles kept moving up.

It was little bumps at first, Becca Probasco in the consolation of the 200 free and Lauren Mesikapp in the 200 IM. Then the Eagles started going for the big splash.

Tina Maas, who didn't have a state cut to her name before Friday's prelims, went from the fourth seed to the conference champion in the 50 free, posting a time of 25.90 from Lane 6. After Thompson Valley's divers placed four in the top nine, freshman Sophie Kubik came from behind in the 100 butterfly, going from third to first in the final 10 yards to beat out two Raptors, an eight-point swing all on its own.

The look on Kubik's face was priceless. So was the energy the Eagles picked up.

"Disbelief," Kubik said of her reaction. "I dropped 4 seconds out of the blue, I touched out the girl next to me by .04. I was just really happy because I knew I had to work really hard to get the goal for the team."

Wabeke said the swims by Maas and Kubik gave her goosebumps. Through the first nine races in the pool, the Eagles knew nothing but first. Wabeke was twice, in the 200 IM (2:08.67)and 100 backstroke (58.39), barely missing out on two conference marks in the process. Kubik also won the 500 free and the Eagles followed up the medley relay with a win in the 200 free relay.

After 10 events, the Eagles had a 24-point lead, but Silver Creek was loaded at the finish. They had four girls place in the top eight of the 100 breaststroke, led by Brandi Vu's win in a NC record time of 1:05.52. That flipped the score, giving Silver Creek a 474-471 lead, and the Raptors closed it out by winning the 400 free relay.

"We came to play today," Leonhart said. "I knew if we could win the medley relay we could set the tone for the rest of the meet. When Probasco did her thing, then Mesikapp went nuts in the IM, we started rolling. Tina Maas, her winning the 50 was huge. We kept swimming fast the whole way through. The girls on the 400 relay were at 4:02 yesterday, and today they went 3:52.

"They gave everything they could, and that's all any coach ever wants. I'm really proud of them."

Eddy won the 200 free in 1:49.92 and the 100 in 51.54, breaking the records she already owned, giving her four conference records in all. Katie von der Lippe had a pair of runner-up finishes (200 IM, 100 breast), and Maas, Mesikapp and Jamie Moss each posted a pair of championship swims to boost the total.

It just wasn't enough, and they weren't the only team to know success and coming close at the same time. Mountain View had hoped to get another relay qualified for state, and despite strong efforts in both the 200 and 400 frees — races that produced significant drops from the prelims — the oh-so-close feeling was tough to handle. The 200 free team missed out by .39.

Hannah Morse said it was a bit agonizing to see the board and know the goal was so close to being achieved, but she was able to knock down some individual success. She was fourth in the 200 IM, then came back to take second in the 100 back, dipping below a minute for the first time at altitude.

"That was good, and I had an all-time best time in my IM, so that was surprising to me, too," Morse said. "We dropped so much time, especially Jenna (Powell). She came a long way, so that was really good."

Teammate Kelsey Vreeman hit a goal too, but without even thinking about it. She took second in diving, her 481 establishing a school record for an 11-dive total, taking down the old mark that lasted eight years.

She admitted to shedding a tear and getting a bit emotional when she was informed of the record, but with a state placing already under her belt, she gets to take a more confident approach into state.

"I didn't know I was anywhere close to the school record," said Vreeman, who felt the set built one dive after the next. "It might sink in tonight when I go to bed. It will just calm me more, and I'll be relaxed. I'm happy with where I'm at right now. Going to state is enough."
