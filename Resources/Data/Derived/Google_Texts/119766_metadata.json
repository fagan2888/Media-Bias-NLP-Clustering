Several states have won bi-partisan support for Medicaid expansion by creating plans that offer limited or different benefits to newly eligible Medicaid recipients.\n\nMeanwhile, House Minority Whip Carolyn Hughley (D-Columbus) introduced a slate of bills, called the \u201cA Promise Kept Initiative,\u201d aimed at offering better support to military families.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense has identified ten key metrics to judge how well a state treats its military families. Our neighbors in South Carolina have met all ten of these metrics, but we have not,\u201d Hughley said.\n\nThe package includes five bills that address healthcare, education, employment, and child protective services for military family members.\n\nFor example, the Protecting Guardsmen\u2019s Employment Act would ensure that Georgia workers called into service by the National Guard or Reserves have a job when they return from duty.\n\nThe 33 initiatives brought forth by House Democrats include a variety of bills previously introduced during 2015.\n\nAmong them are a measure to prohibit schools from suspending children in pre-Kindergarten through third grade (HB 135); a bill to put law enforcement agencies on a path toward testing a backlog of sexual assault kits (HB 560); and a bill that would allow voters to cast a ballot in any precinct in their county of residence (HB 26).\n\n\u201cThe 2016 legislative package is a commitment to our shared values as Georgians, and to the understanding that we can move the needle towards progress as we put aside partisan differences to embrace common sense solutions,\u201d Abrams said.\n\n(END/2016)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "High on the list was Medicaid expansion in Georgia, an option under the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) that Georgia Republicans have thus far rejected.\nSeveral states have won bi-partisan support for Medicaid expansion by creating plans that offer limited or different benefits to newly eligible Medicaid recipients.\nThe Affordable Care Act allows states to tailor their own Alternative Benefit Plans.\nMeanwhile, House Minority Whip Carolyn Hughley (D-Columbus) introduced a slate of bills, called the \u201cA Promise Kept Initiative,\u201d aimed at offering better support to military families.\n(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 In the flurry of activity that marked the first week of the 2016 year of the 2015-2016 Legislative Session, members of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus gathered on Thursday, January 14, 2016, to announce their policy agenda."}
