On Friday, the Department of Labor announced that workforce participation still hovered at a 35-year low, and that only 113,000 new jobs were added in January. Meanwhile, last Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that Obamacare would result in \u201ca decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024.\u201d (PDF)\n\n\n\nSignificantly, the CBO did not point the finger at business for the anticipated drop. Instead, the CBO explained that the \u201cestimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply rather than from a net drop in businesses\u2019 demand for labor.\u201d Great, so Wayne and Garth\u2014the basement dwelling metal-heads first made famous on Saturday Night Live in the 1980s, can keep on living with their parents for the rest of their lives.\n\nExcept, the White House and its friends don\u2019t want you to think that it will be the young, fit, and fancy-free who will be the ones most likely to go on welfare\u2014I mean Obamacare. No, instead they want you to believe that those who would work less are 55 year olds who would stay home to care for a sick parent, simultaneously embark on a second or third career, and become Pulitzer Prize-winning writers.\n\nJust listen to White House Spokesman Jay Carney or to his de facto back-up Paul Krugman. According to Carney, \u201cBecause of this law, individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families.\u201d Earth to Jay, 28-year-olds without college degrees or technical training don\u2019t have a whole lot of empowered choices to make.\n\nMeanwhile over at the New York Times, Krugman writes, \u201cIt has always been clear that health reform will induce some Americans to work less.\u201d Now he tells us.\n\n\u201cSome people will, for example, retire earlier because they no longer need to keep working to keep their health insurance,\u201d Krugman continues. \u201cOthers will reduce their hours to spend more time with their children because insurance is no longer contingent on holding a full-time job.\u201d If only.\n\nWe have seen this movie before, and it\u2019s not about noble-minded middle-aged folks juggling competing responsibilities in the midstream of life. No, it\u2019s actually about healthy young people lacking college degrees turning off and dropping out sooner than later.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. Instead, look at what happened in 2005 after Tennessee downsized its Medicaid program and dropped 170,000 adults it was not required to cover.\n\nAccording to Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Business, those who were bounced from TennCare and reentered the workforce tended to be \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults regardless of family status, without college degrees, but with higher incomes than the average Medicaid recipient. Oh, and they were \u201cfar more likely to be white\u201d and under 65.\n\nAnd this should come be no surprise. In this administration, work is meaningful only if it\u2019s \u201ccool,\u201d while toil for its own sake is barely given a second thought. Remember the 2009 stimulus? Back then, Obama & Co. had no trouble ladling out billions of dollars on \u201crenewable energy\u201d\u2014spending more on renewables than it even did on basic energy infrastructure.\n\nIn Obamaworld, bankrupt Solyndra was cool. So too were bankrupt electric car battery maker A123 Systems, bankrupt solar panel manufacturer Abound Solar, bankrupt Beacon Power, and Ener1.\n\n\n\nBut the jobs or failures that the children of Obama\u2019s donor base wouldn\u2019t deign to touch, now they\u2019re uncool and unworthy of this administration\u2019s respect. And so, if a late 20-something decides to work fewer hours, but play more Xbox One, and get an Obamacare subsidy why not? They were never the Obamans\u2019 or Professor Krugman\u2019s kind any way, and what\u2019s the harm of trying to buy them off now, when they may just vote Democratic in the midterms? That is, if they want to get off the couch.\n\nYes, in the aftermath of the disastrous roll-out of Obamacare the president talks about infrastructure. And he is spot-on when he says that infrastructure \u201ccreates jobs,\u201d and \u201cputs people to work.\u201d The problem, however, is that no one really believes Obama. The fact is that when Obama had the chance to do something about infrastructure early on, he made infrastructure the handmaiden of the Democrats\u2019 electoral and donor bases.\n\nThe Obama stimulus was more about pumping dollars to state and local governments, doling out one-shot tax gimmicks, and shelling out money for food stamps, than it was about infrastructure. Or as Michelle Obama admitted, it was an anti-poverty program.\n\nAs Jonathan Alter wrote in his book, The Promise: \u201cA congressman approached the first lady at a White House reception after the [stimulus] bill\u2019s passage and told her the stimulus was the best anti-poverty bill in a generation. Her reaction was \u2018Shhhh!\u2019 The White House didn\u2019t want the public thinking that Obama had achieved long-sought public policy objectives under the guise of merely stimulating the economy, even though that\u2019s exactly what had happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Barack Obama, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201402111045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Health care reform will let people work less, and that means young adults mooching off their parents have one less excuse to get or keep a job.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obamacare Is Waynes World", "tags": "Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:person/barack_obama,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare Is Wayne\u2019s World\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/11/obamacare-is-wayne-s-world.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/11/obamacare-is-wayne-s-world/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46403851.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/11/obamacare-is-wayne-s-world\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-11T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Lloyd Green\",\"tags\":[\"Industryterm\",\"barack_obama\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Barack Obama, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Lloyd Green", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-02-11T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/lloyd-greenhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/11/obamacare-is-wayne-s-world", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Health care reform will let people work less, and that means young adults mooching off their parents have one less excuse to get or keep a job.", "title": "Obamacare Is Wayne\u2019s World", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/11/obamacare-is-wayne-s-world.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/11/obamacare-is-wayne-s-world/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1392115559825.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/l/lloyd-green", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Just listen to White House Spokesman Jay Carney or to his de facto back-up Paul Krugman.\nExcept, the White House and its friends don\u2019t want you to think that it will be the young, fit, and fancy-free who will be the ones most likely to go on welfare\u2014I mean Obamacare.\nAnd so, if a late 20-something decides to work fewer hours, but play more Xbox One, and get an Obamacare subsidy why not?\nYes, in the aftermath of the disastrous roll-out of Obamacare the president talks about infrastructure.\nThe Obama stimulus was more about pumping dollars to state and local governments, doling out one-shot tax gimmicks, and shelling out money for food stamps, than it was about infrastructure."}
