This was taken by most Americans as a promise that new plans would not threaten the health insurance they already had.\n\nFor more and more college students however, this promise seems to have been broken as schools stop offering insurance.\n\nAccording to the AP, experts are divided on whether this trend is positive. Some argue that plans from the marketplace are cheaper than college plans, while opponents say that the plans are less likely to be purchased this way since they aren\u2019t part of a lump sum payment each year or semester.\n\nThere are also concerns that health exchange plans offer less coverage than the college plans previously offered.\n\n\u201cThe main driver of colleges getting out of the insurance business is a provision in the Affordable Care Act that prevents students from using premium tax subsidies to purchase insurance from their college or university\u2026..Add to that the provision that allows young people to stay on their parent's health insurance plans until age 26, plus the expansion of Medicaid in some states and the rising cost of student insurance. The result is cheaper health insurance available for students off campus,\u201d the AP reports.\n\nUniversities that are dropping insurance include William Paterson University, New Jersey City University, University of Washington, Washington State University, and Idaho State University, among others.\n\n\u201cI disagree strongly with Obamacare because I don't believe it is going to work effectively and solve the problem we have with health care. I also think it\u2019s important for any individual to have the freedom to choose what kind of insurance they want, and shouldn't be forced on any government program,\u201d said Soroche Kohistani, junior at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, to Campus Reform.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @NPappas8674", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6442/Insurance.jpg", "description": "Experts are reportedly divided on whether the trend is positive or not.", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "Experts are reportedly divided on whether the trend is positive or not.", "title": "Students being forced off school insurance by Obamacare", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6442", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6442/Insurance.jpg", "height": 600}, "author": "Nick Pappas", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6442/Insurance.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",Obamacare, Insurance, , Nick Pappas", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "published_time": "2015-04-15 11:19:43.0", "description": "Experts are reportedly divided on whether the trend is positive or not.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-04-20 10:30:36.0"}, "twitter": {"description": "Experts are reportedly divided on whether the trend is positive or not.", "title": "Students being forced off school insurance by Obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6442/Insurance.jpg"}, "creator": "@NPappas8674", "site": "@campusreform", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Universities that are dropping insurance include William Paterson University, New Jersey City University, University of Washington, Washington State University, and Idaho State University, among others.\nFor more and more college students however, this promise seems to have been broken as schools stop offering insurance.\nThe result is cheaper health insurance available for students off campus,\u201d the AP reports.\n\u201cI disagree strongly with Obamacare because I don't believe it is going to work effectively and solve the problem we have with health care.\nThis was taken by most Americans as a promise that new plans would not threaten the health insurance they already had."}
