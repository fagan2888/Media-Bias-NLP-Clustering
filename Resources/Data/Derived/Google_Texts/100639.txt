Earlier this summer, former Broncos quarterback and Heisman winner Tim Tebow told The Tennessean that he was working toward an NFL comeback.

“I’m training every day and feel like I’m the best that I’ve ever been,” Tebow told the paper in June. “I still love it, love playing, talking about it, and I’m just excited about whatever the future holds. Who knows what could happen? But I’m excited about it, though.”

Turns out, he wasn’t joking. Not even a little.

Tebow has been been making regular trips to Scottsdale, Ariz., this summer to work out with trainer Ian Danney at Performance Enhancement Professionals, getting in reps in the gym and playing “Danneyball,” a version of beach volleyball created by Danney that uses a medicine ball. To work on his throwing, Tebow said he has also been making trips to Los Angeles to work with Tom House, a former MLB pitcher who has helped other NFL quarterbacks, including Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Carson Palmer.

“I feel great,” Tebow told Fox 10 Phoenix, which obtained exclusive footage of his workouts in Arizona. “I feel the strongest, healthiest, throwing the best I ever have. I’m just really excited about the improvement.”

Tebow, who was drafted by the Broncos in 2010 but played in only 17 games before Denver brought in Peyton Manning, signed on with the soon-to-launch SEC Network to serve as a host on “SEC Nation.” In recent months, though, he’s made it clear that his long-term goal reside on the field, not in the studio.

“One of my favorite quotes is, ‘I don’t know what my future holds, but I know who holds my future,'” Tebow told Fox 10. “And that gives you peace to just continue to work and to go after what your heart desires. And when you do that, I think you don’t have any regrets. I think that’s the best way to live life.”
