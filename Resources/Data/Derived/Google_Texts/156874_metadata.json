He said the criticism is fair game because it relates to a policy difference.\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Cruz, without provocation, blasted Trump for supporting the concept of eminent domain. He said it wasn\u2019t right for governments to take property from private citizens and give it to someone to develop casinos. Cruz used the casino reference as a hypothetical situation, but Trump is known for developing property in Atlantic City.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, eminent domain is unpopular in libertarian-leaning New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe have the right to protect the property of Americans,\u201d Cruz said when answering an unrelated question. \u201cPrivate property is essential to the rights of Americans\u201d\n\nUpdate:5:21 p.m.\n\nCruz was campaigning on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, which nearly went unnoticed.\n\nBut after being asked about it by a voter, Cruz addressed the slain civil rights leader\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cDr. King\u2019s legacy is powerful in many respects, but one is very, very clear. That is the power of speaking the truth in the face of evil, in the face of racism, in the face of bigotry, standing up and speaking the truth with love and a smile has changed the course of history in the country,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cJust as Dr. King did so, we can do so again today. By standing up and speaking the truth, we can restore the arch of history, the arch of America so it once again bends toward justice and not away from the values that built our county.\u201d\n\nCruz pointed out that King was an evangelical leader.\n\n\u201cThe letter from the Birmingham jail was to pastors across this country saying \u2018stand up and fight\u2019 for Biblical values. Stand up and speak the truth. Those are words that desperately need to be heard.\u201d\n\nAt every point on his tour, Cruz asked voters to pray for him and the country, using one of Ronald Reagan\u2019s favorite Bible verses, Second Chronicles 7-14, as inspiration.\n\n\u201cIf my people, which are called by my name, would humble themselves and pray, and seek my faith and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear their prayers and will forgive their sins and I will heal their land,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginal post here:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, who\u2019s in a dogfight with GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, talked with voters in Keene, N.H., on Monday. (Gromer Jeffers/Staff)\n\nKEENE, N.H. \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign for president has featured strong references to faith and Christianity, beliefs he says will help restore the country to greatness.\n\nThe Texas senator and son of a Carrollton pastor is sticking to religion, even in New Hampshire. The voting population there is heavy with libertarians and is not as influenced by evangelicals as the small towns in Iowa, where Cruz has had success in the polls.\n\n\u201cFor too long there has been a spirit of fear and timidity in Washington,\u201d Cruz told The Dallas Morning News on the second day of his New Hampshire tour. \u201cWe should not be ashamed of Christ. We should be willing to speak the truth with a smile.\u201d\n\nCruz said the nation must return to its Judeo-Christian roots.\n\n\u201cPulling this country back from the cliff we\u2019re facing will require us remembering who we are, rediscovering those values that built American in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nThat has been Cruz\u2019s mantra for months, and along the way he\u2019s climbed in the polls for what\u2019s fast becoming a two-way race with New York businessman Donald Trump.\n\nCruz\u2019s approach is as important as any time during the campaign.\n\nIn New Hampshire, he trails Trump by a wide margin. And though it\u2019s not critical for Cruz to win the Granite State, doing well here could give him a boost toward the GOP nomination.\n\nCruz\u2019s message has largely been the same during the campaign, but the issues facing New Hampshire have prompted him to connect with voters in different ways.\n\nDuring a stop in Keene, for instance, he talked about the substance abuse problem that killed his older sister, Miriam.\n\nAll day Monday, Cruz was asked about Trump, his admirer-turned- campaign nemesis.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News, Trump called Cruz unlikable, saying, \u201cEverybody hates Ted.\u201d\n\nCruz fired back, sort of, saying voters would have the final opinion.\n\n\u201cDonald seems to be a little rattled. For whatever reason he\u2019s very dismayed. As conservatives continue to unite behind our campaign, as his poll numbers continue to go down, he\u2019s a little testy,\u201d Cruz said during a stop in Washington, N.H. \u201cI have no intention in responding in kind. If he wants to engage in insults, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d\n\nNot just religion\n\nCruz was not all Bible talk, He promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, investigate Planned Parenthood, abolish the IRS and defeat the Islamic State and terrorism. But he also answered questions on issues specific to the Northeast, like the heroin smack crisis in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI know New Hampshire in particularly has been hit hard. The heroin epidemic is really ugly,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an issue [in which] I have more than passing experience. My older sister, Miriam, died of a drug overdose.\u201d\n\nCruz said later that his sister\u2019s problems had a profound impact on him as a young man, as he and family members fought desperately to save her.\n\n\u201cShe had a hard life. She made a lot of foolish decisions over and over again. She had problems with drinking and substance abuse her whole life until one morning she didn\u2019t wake up,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz told New Hampshire residents that his plan to curb illegal immigration would help fight the drug problem.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important elements to dealing with the drug problem is finally securing the border,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would build a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nAlong with the wall, the U.S. senator from Texas would triple border patrols, establish an e-verify system for employers, develop a biometric entry-exit system for visas and enforce existing laws.\n\n\u201cWe know how ?to do this, \u201che said. \u201cThe only thing that is missing is the political will.\u201d\n\nWhen a man asked if Cruz was really going to get Trump to pay for the wall, Cruz joked: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s fired.\u201d\n\nVoters wanted to know about the Trump-Cruz feud at every stop. The two had agreed not to attack each other during the primary process. But that changed when Trump questioned whether Cruz was a \u201cnatural-born\u201d citizen and eligible for the presidency, because he was born in Canada to an American mother.\n\nCruz inflamed the situation by criticizing Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values\u201d last week.\n\nOn Monday Cruz wasn\u2019t backing down.\n\n\u201cAs the voters get close to election day, they looking more at the records of the candidates,\u201d Cruz told The News. \u201cPeople are tired of being burned\u2026As the voters compare my record and Donald Trump\u2019s record there is difference. I have been fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative, and Donald\u2019s record does not reflect the same.\u201d\n\nThough he\u2019s at the top of the polls in Iowa, Cruz trails Trump in New Hampshire, where the first-in-the nation primary is Feb. 9.\n\nMost of those interviewed leaned toward Cruz or Trump.\n\nKen Sanders, a 54-year-old minister from Westmoreland, said he liked Cruz.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy you can trust,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s consistent. He\u2019s a conservative.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders said he worried that Cruz couldn\u2019t beat the Democrats in November, so he\u2019s also considering voting for Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump has a big stick and could knock the Clintons right out,\u201d he said.\n\nAir Force veteran Bob Stoeckmann of Keene also liked Cruz, but wanted to see more contenders. \u201cHe\u2019ll protect the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Stephanie Plant, a 42-year-old service industry worker from Keene, said she hoped Cruz would repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI have to bust my butt and I can\u2019t seem to get ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe Cruz is a statesman and would be better than what we have now.\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King Day\n\nCruz was campaigning on Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday, which nearly went unnoticed. After being asked about it by a voter, Cruz addressed the slain civil rights leader\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cDr. King\u2019s legacy is powerful in many respects, but one is very, very clear. That is the power of speaking the truth in the face of evil, in the face of racism, in the face of bigotry, standing up and speaking the truth with love and a smile has changed the course of history in the country,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cJust as Dr. King did so, we can do so again today.By standing up and speaking the truth, we can restore the arc of history, the arc of America so it once again bends toward justice and not away from the values that built our country.\u201d\n\nCruz pointed out that King was an evangelical leader.\n\n\u201cThe letter from the Birmingham jail was to pastors across this country saying, \u2018Stand up and fight\u2019 for biblical values. Stand up and speak the truth. Those are words that desperately need to be heard.\u201d\n\nAt every point on his tour, Cruz asked voters to pray for him and the country, using one of Ronald Reagan\u2019s favorite Bible verses, 2 Chronicles 7:14, as inspiration.\n\n\u201cIf my people, which are called by my name, would humble themselves and pray, and seek my faith and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear their prayers and will forgive their sins and I will heal their land,\u201d he said.\n\nTwitter: @gromerjeffers", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMS90ZWQtY3J1ei10YWxrcy10cnVtcC13YXItb24taWxsZWdhbC1kcnVncy1pbi1uZXctaGFtcHNoaXJlLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Gromer Jeffers Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Update: 10:15 p.m. Late Monday night Ted Cruz unleashed another attack on rival Donald Trump.
