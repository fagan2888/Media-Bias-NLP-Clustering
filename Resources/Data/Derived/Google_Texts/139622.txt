The Obama administration says the site can now handle 50,000 unique visitors at a time, but it doesn’t appear able to keep up with the load.

The load-time issues (sometimes more than a minute) reminded me of the problems users encountered in the very first days of the Web site, which handles health insurance enrollment for residents of 36 states. It also appears to contradict what Health and Human Services officials said had been fixed.

After a glowing news conference yesterday citing “night and day” progress on HealthCare.gov, I decided to log in this morning and take the Web site for a test drive, as I’m sure many others are doing. Early reports had been promising . What I found was hardly encouraging — long delays loading pages, an endless circle of tasks (some already completed) and ultimately an error message.

“Response times are under 1 second. Error rates are down well under 1%. And the system is stable, with uptimes exceeding 90%,” HHS bragged in a blog post yesterday.

Additionally, once I had completed and submitted my application and verified my identity, the site told me that I was missing information and had to review it again. Nothing was missing. Ultimately, I got an error message telling me to come back later.

The Obama administration says the site can now handle 50,000 unique visitors at one time and 800,000 over the course of a day. But on Day One of the new-and-improved site, it doesn’t appear able to keep up with the load. No wonder HHS is encouraging users to come back at off-peak hours.

Some screen shots of my experience are below.

Immediately I encountered delays:

The delays continued:

After completing my application and submitting it successfully, I was told information was missing and was asked to go back through it — with delays:

I finally hit a wall I could not jump over — the error message:

I began a live chat on the Web site. Here’s what I was told:

[11:32:32 am]:Kassie

Good morning Charlie

[11:32:40 am]:Kassie

I apologize for the inconvenience.

[11:32:45 am]:Charlie

I keep getting long delays on each page and finally successfully submitted my application, but then was told I was missing things.

[11:33:02 am]:Kassie

Where are you getting stuck at?

[11:33:07 am]:Charlie

When I went back through it, nothing was missing, but I got this error: Sorry, theres a problem with our system Please log out, then try again after 30 minutes.

[11:34:07 am]:Charlie

Is there an overload today or is [it] on my end?

[11:34:25 am]:Kassie

Have you tried logging out and waiting the 30 minutes and then retrying?

[11:34:33 am]:Charlie

Not yet.

[11:34:55 am]:Kassie

[11:35:27 am]:Charlie

I was just wondering if this is on my end. I read that the problems had been fixed and that the load times were much faster, but that hasn't been my experience today.

[11:35:30 am]:Kassie

Write down your application ID number so you have it.

[11:36:07 am]:Kassie

Nothing you did wrong, Charlie. You're fine.

[11:36:24 am]:Charlie

OK. Will try again later.

[11:36:30 am]:Kassie

I went back 30 minutes later and I couldn’t even log on:

Perhaps aware that the site could crash again, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is encouraging users not to log on during peak hours.
