As for market conditions, no one in the health insurance business had ever seen it so chaotic, with implementation of the sweeping Affordable Care Act reform law really getting underway.\n\nNow, about 15 months into the job, Guyette reports that he is \u201chaving the time of my life.\u201d\n\nAs health care delivery and how we pay for it continues to evolve, Blue Cross is clearly ambitious about its role. The vision statement on top of Guyette\u2019s strategic plan summary reads \u201cWe will be Minnesota\u2019s health care leader.\u201d\n\nWhether that describes Blue Cross right now is certainly debatable. It doesn\u2019t have as many people enrolled in its plans as it did in 2008, although with a true statewide presence and annual revenue of $10 billion it\u2019s not exactly an also-ran.\n\nAmong health benefits brokers and other market observers in the Twin Cities, Blue Cross is known for being a step or two slow in its marketing and plan design.\n\nMichael Guyette\n\nGuyette said he doesn\u2019t disagree with that. But he also pointed out that picking up the pace of innovation and adaptation to change isn\u2019t the only priority he\u2019s discussed with the board. With three CEOs in three years, restoring a sense of stability also was a concern.\n\nWhen Guyette started, he made a point within the first couple of months to at least shake the hand of all of Blue Cross\u2019 more than 3,000 employees. The biggest change in its leadership team was removing the chief operating officer position.\n\nHe wanted the organization to be flatter. And to move faster.\n\n\u201cDecisionmaking here was focused on getting 100 percent or 110 percent of the information\u201d before making a decision, he said. \u201cWe are instilling a culture here where we\u2019re saying go ahead and try new things, pilot [a project], that 80 percent of the information is good enough to make a decision.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to move faster. We are piloting more. We are partnering more. We think \u2014 we know \u2014 that will help us transform health care going forward.\u201d\n\nGuyette\u2019s last job before coming to Eagan to take over at Blue Cross was as president of national accounts for Connecticut-based Aetna, a publicly held, traditional health insurer. He was responsible for the bottom line of a multi\u00adbillion-dollar health insurance business that covered about 9 million people who worked for big, \u00adhousehold-name companies.\n\nOf the \u201cstrategic pillars\u201d built into the plan Guyette\u2019s Blue Cross team put together, one he talks about the most is consumer focus. This may sound unremarkable for any business, but by consumer he means the individual in a Blue Cross plan, not necessarily a \u201ccustomer\u201d like the benefits manager at a big employer who picks an insurer.\n\nMore and more of the decisionmaking in health care is falling to the consumer, he said. It\u2019s more than choosing between two different options for insurance based on annual deductibles, but also means making more informed choices for medical care.\n\n\u201cWe know how to reach out to those members, we know how to give them information, we know how to connect to them,\u201d he said of the role for Blue Cross. \u201cAnd, we understand the actuarial risk side very well. We\u2019ve been doing it what, 80 years? That\u2019s not something you can just pick up off the shelf.\u201d\n\nThe focus on the consumer is what led to the creation of what Guyette called a \u201cwar room\u201d at Blue Cross headquarters with staffers working with providers throughout the state on finding ways to eliminate barriers to effective care. It\u2019s everything from transportation to making sure the Blue Cross member sees the right health care professional the first time.\n\nOne example is helping Southern Prairie Community Care (SPCC), a 12-county collaborative in southwest Minnesota that is trying to improve care coordination for people on Medicaid. Blue Cross, through its HMO Blue Plus, is working with SPCC and other stakeholders in the area to identify gaps in the coordination of care in this large rural area.\n\nAsked who is more likely to be an innovation leader in the coming years, a health plan provider like Blue Cross or an integrated clinic and hospital system like Allina Health, Guyette said, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s together.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis investor and Blue Cross board chairman Vance Opperman said the executive team under Guyette \u201cis as strong as it\u2019s ever been, certainly as energetic as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d But it\u2019s too soon to tell if the quicker Blue Cross that Guyette described is succeeding in the marketplace.\n\nThe just-announced results for 2013 demonstrated stability, and Guyette said he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by growth in individual plans in January. In the acutely competitive group market in the Twin Cities there was \u201csome slippage,\u201d although he added that those purchase decisions were mostly made last year and he\u2019s confident going into the next cycle.\n\n\u201cWe should talk again in a year or two,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to know what you are hearing about us then.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Among health benefits brokers and other market observers in the Twin Cities, Blue Cross is known for being a step or two slow in its marketing and plan design.", "title": "Schafer: New Blue Cross leader wants to move faster", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/schafer-new-blue-cross-leader-wants-to-move-faster/253853181/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/108+120269+6screendocs040814.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/108+120269+6screendocs040814.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Among health benefits brokers and other market observers in the Twin Cities, Blue Cross is known for being a step or two slow in its marketing and plan design.", "title": "Schafer: New Blue Cross leader wants to move faster", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/schafer-new-blue-cross-leader-wants-to-move-faster/253853181/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/108+120269+6screendocs040814.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/108+120269+6screendocs040814.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Among health benefits brokers and other market observers in the Twin Cities, Blue Cross is known for being a step or two slow in its marketing and plan design."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98d3\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s everything from transportation to making sure the Blue Cross member sees the right health care professional the first time.\nMichael Guyette said he came to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota as president and CEO in January of last year expecting to take over a \u201cbroken\u201d organization.\nOf the \u201cstrategic pillars\u201d built into the plan Guyette\u2019s Blue Cross team put together, one he talks about the most is consumer focus.\nThe vision statement on top of Guyette\u2019s strategic plan summary reads \u201cWe will be Minnesota\u2019s health care leader.\u201dWhether that describes Blue Cross right now is certainly debatable.\nBlue Cross, through its HMO Blue Plus, is working with SPCC and other stakeholders in the area to identify gaps in the coordination of care in this large rural area."}
