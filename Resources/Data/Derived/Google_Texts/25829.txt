Liberal commentator Bill Maher — not one to hold back when it comes to crude commentary — called the Generation Opportunity anti-Obamacare ad “really perverse.”

Maher lamented the ad, which features a caricature of Uncle Sam performing a very personal medical procedure on female, on his HBO show “Real Time ” on Friday, saying his takeaway was that Republicans were were “always thinking about women’s lady parts.”

“I just want to say about that ad we just watched, I find it really perverse — that the vaginal ultrasound people are saying the government is going to get — they’re the ones who are in women’s vaginas, not the — I mean, I guess the message of that ad is supposed to get here,” Maher said. “But the government is only saying to a young woman, ‘You’re going to have to buy a policy from Aetna.’ The message that’s going to reach young people is that Republicans are creepy pervs who are always thinking about women’s lady parts.”

Watch:

Maher also took issue with the message in the spot, which he said encourages people to break the law.

“And also, can you think about another time where somebody is asking you to disobey the law?” he said. “This is the law. What if the Democrats put out an ad that said you know, ‘You shouldn’t pay your taxes?’”
