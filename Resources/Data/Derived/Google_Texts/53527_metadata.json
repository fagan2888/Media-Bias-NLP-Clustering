Analysis of Medicare patients\u2019 claims found that only 4% of those newly diagnosed with diabetes participate in DSMT programs.\n\nALSO READ: New diabetes treatment strategies for primary care to boost adherence\n\nThe study looked at data from more than 95,000 patients who were diagnosed with diabetes in 2011. Researchers said prior to healthcare reform, a lack of insurance coverage caused many new diabetes patients to skip training programs. But other barriers to participation identified by the study include:\n\nMany insurance plans require a co-pay for DSMT programs\n\nMany insurance plans don\u2019t cover DSMT programs\n\nSome DSMT programs require a physician referral\n\nMany patients don\u2019t know DSMT programs exist, or may have avoidance behaviors toward diabetes treatment.\n\nThe study found that almost 26% of newly-diagnosed diabetes patients are not prescribed medications, so lifestyle monitoring is even more important to deter any further complications. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests using both DSMT and medical nutrition therapy to complement diabetes care, as they provide different techniques to patients.\n\n\u201cAlthough some persons might have participated in medical nutrition therapy, from which they receive nutrition recommendations and interventions, others might have limited knowledge about the dietary aspects of diabetes management,\u201d the study\u2019s authors said. \u201cFor those not prescribed medication for glycemic management, failure to participate in DSMT could mean that their diabetes remains essentially untreated. For those prescribed insulin, lack of participation in DSMT could reduce the likelihood of adequate blood glucose management.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Fewer than 7% of newly diagnosed diabetes patients take part in diabetes self-management and education training.", "Description": "Fewer than 7% of newly diagnosed diabetes patients take part in diabetes self-management and education training.", "og": {"url": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/RC/new-diabetes-patients-aren-t-learning-self-care-study-says", "site_name": "Medical Economics", "description": "New diabetes patients aren&rsquo;t participating in education and training programs that can help them control the chronic condition, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and P", "title": "New diabetes patients aren\u2019t learning self care, study says"}, "DC.identifier": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/node/391084", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.publisher": "Advanstar Communications Inc", "DC.date": "2014-12-09", "last-modified": "Sat, 20 December 2014 00:31:43 GMT", "DC.creator": "Donna Marbury", "DC.source": "Medical Economics eConsult", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "CDC, Diabetes, Diabetes - Diagnosis & Treatment Resource Center, Diabetes care, Medicare, Modern Medicine Feature Articles, Practice Management", "emsContentType": "New diabetes patients aren\u2019t learning self care, study says", "DC.title": "New diabetes patients aren\u2019t learning self care, study says"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9ac\"", "article_summary": "Researchers said prior to healthcare reform, a lack of insurance coverage caused many new diabetes patients to skip training programs.\nNew diabetes patients aren\u2019t participating in education and training programs that can help them control the chronic condition, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAnalysis of Medicare patients\u2019 claims found that only 4% of those newly diagnosed with diabetes participate in DSMT programs.\nThe study found that almost 26% of newly-diagnosed diabetes patients are not prescribed medications, so lifestyle monitoring is even more important to deter any further complications.\nALSO READ: New diabetes treatment strategies for primary care to boost adherenceThe study looked at data from more than 95,000 patients who were diagnosed with diabetes in 2011."}
