White Public Library out of downtown. I lived in Stevens Point from the time I was four years old until I graduated from P.J. Jacobs in 1954. The library was the heart of the city. From the time I was in second grade, I could walk to the library. Even after I graduated from high school, when I was home on breaks from University of Wisconsin-Madison, I would go to the library to study.\n\nThe library has a long history and the current building has a special significance. Charlie White was a figure recognizable to many Pointers. He lived in a rundown hotel on the south side and every day he walked from the south side to downtown. Today he would probably be considered homeless, wearing an overcoat and looking disheveled. A lot of us thought he was going to the square to spend his day in the bars, but the librarians and regular library patrons knew better. He spent much of his day in the library. When he died he left $140,000 to the city for an unspecified \u201cproject or building that will be beneficial\u201d to the people of the community. The city decided to use the money to fund a new library building.\n\nDon\u2019t move this library! Support it! It is part of the history of Stevens Point and a community resource.\n\nMargaret Grimm Kingsbury,\n\nLansing, Mich.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1ua3j4O", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The library is needed at the heart of the city.", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "The library is needed at the heart of the city.", "title": "Letter: Don\u2019t move the Portage County library", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/2014/09/17/letter-move-portage-county-library/15799443/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The library is needed at the heart of the city.", "title": "Letter: Don\u2019t move the Portage County library", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ef3cac4e0458a0e88b4838cf849024d3704e180/c=540-0-2676-2136&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/StevensPoint/2014/09/17/-spjbrd09-13-2014journal1a00120140912imglibrary.jpg11n68h4a68l.jpg", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Portage County Public Library (Photo: Stevens Point Journal Media file photo )Buy PhotoEDITOR: I am appalled by the proposal to move the Charles M.
