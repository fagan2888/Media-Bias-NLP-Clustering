John Kitzhaber was told in early 2014 that the Obamacare state health care exchange his administration spent $305 million building could be made operational. But his administration chose instead to scrap the project and seek a scapegoat to keep the fiasco from harming his re-election, according to evidence turned over to congressional investigators.\n\nThe materials, reviewed by The Washington Times, include emails and memos between state officials and campaign aides as well as a transcript of a conversation from a state official turned whistleblower that suggests federal tax dollars were sacrificed for political convenience.\n\nPHOTOS: Democrats behaving badly: Scandals taint party in a tough election year\n\nThe memos show Mr. Kitzhaber\u2019s election campaign aides took the unusual step of instructing state officials on how to handle the Cover Oregon exchange project, especially when the project was abandoned just before its launch. The campaign aides even sought to supervise the testimony of a state official appearing before the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe memos suggest that the decision to scrap the project before it launched \u2014 creating a massive loss for federal taxpayers and inconvenience to thousands of customers \u2014 was driven more by politics than merit, according to the chairman of a House committee investigating the matter.\n\n\u201cThere is a curious crossover between the political and the executive branch in Oregon, and it doesn\u2019t smell right, and it doesn\u2019t look right and there\u2019s a lot of smoke,\u201d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \u201cThere are hundreds of millions of dollars that need to be accounted for. It\u2019s highly suspicious, and we intend to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: FLASHBACK: Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, fiancee provide new green energy scandal for Democrats\n\nMr. Kitzhaber resigned this year amid an ethics scandal that remains under federal criminal investigation. He raised suspicion in April 2014, during his re-election campaign, when he shut down the oft-delayed Cover Oregon health care exchange just weeks before its scheduled launch.\n\nJanet Hoffman, criminal defense attorney for the former Oregon governor, declined to comment Monday evening.\n\nThe state had accepted $305 million in federal aid to build the exchange, and its shutdown required Oregon to spend another $41 million to join the federal Obamacare exchange as an alternative. It is one of several state health care exchanges that have struggled under Obamacare.\n\nAbout half of the 17 health insurance marketplace exchanges set up by states have had financial trouble, and three of them \u2014 in Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon, which collectively received $517 million in federal funding \u2014 are now using the federally facilitated marketplace instead.\n\nHawaii announced last week that it may be forced to ditch its exchange this year because of financial problems, and technical problems are prompting Minnesota and Vermont to consider using the HealthCare.gov exchange as well.\n\nThe Oregon episode has spurred a significant legal battle, as the main contractor for the project, Oracle Corp., has accused state officials of engaging in conflicts of interest and exercising such poor oversight that it jeopardized a project that otherwise would have succeeded.\n\nThe state has countered by suing Oracle, accusing it of shoddy work.\n\nEvidence from official documents gathered by congressional investigators or obtained under open records laws suggests Mr. Kitzhaber\u2019s aides applied pressure to kill the project even though the governor had been told the exchange could be fixed and made operational.\n\nEmails recovered from computer servers show Mr. Kitzhaber was directly told in February 2014 by Cover Oregon\u2019s director that the state exchange\u2019s problems could be fixed with additional testing and training.\n\n\u201cCover Oregon\u2019s perspective of system readiness is that the system can function with a 90+ percent of accuracy for 90-95 percent of the population,\u201d Cover Oregon\u2019s director at the time, Bruce Goldberg, wrote the governor. \u201c[Oracle] emphasized that best practice would be to release the \u2018final\u2019 system and test for 5 or 6 months.\u201d\n\nIn another email to the governor in February, Mr. Goldberg wrote: \u201cRight now reviews seem mixed but more positive than negative,\u201d and despite problems with logins, \u201cIt appears some of the problems can be overcome with training.\u201d\n\nAnother key figure to emerge as a whistleblower is Carolyn Lawson, the Oregon Health Authority\u2019s former chief information officer. She is suing the state, claiming she was wrongfully terminated for refusing to go along with the administration\u2019s narrative that the exchange was so flawed that it needed to be shut down.\n\nThe exchange was supposed to open in October 2013 but was delayed because of technical glitches. Oracle said it could have had the entire system operational by February 2014, but state officials and Kitzhaber campaign aides plotted to shut it down, the memos show.\n\nMs. Lawson has produced a transcript of a conversation she had shortly before she was terminated suggesting that the Kitzhaber administration was seeking a scapegoat for the shutdown.\n\n\u201cSomebody has to be held to blame for this \u2014 it\u2019s going to be [Cover Oregon\u2019s former Executive Director] Rocky [King] or it\u2019s going to be Oracle or it\u2019s going to be you. We want it to be Oracle, but it can be you if you want,\u201d an Oregon Health Authority official was quoted as telling Ms. Lawson, who recorded the conversation in a letter her attorney sent to the state.\n\nWhen Ms. Lawson refused to follow the Oregon Health Authority script, she was immediately terminated, according to information her attorney filed with the state.\n\n\u201cYou will be resigning today. It\u2019s going to be for personal reasons. You can write the resignation letter or we can write it for you,\u201d another health authority official was quoted as telling Ms. Lawson in the information her attorney made public.\n\nMs. Lawson\u2019s attorney, David Angeli, said his client was not available for interviews.\n\nAn Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe state exchange program struggled under Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democrat who supported Obamacare.\n\nFrom the initiation of the project in 2011 to the point in April 2014 when state officials ultimately decided to abandon the state portal, Cover Oregon had four executive directors, each with no formal or practical information technology training or experience, Oracle told The Times.\n\n\u201cWe were hired to assist Oregon develop technical solutions as we have done in countless other states and for the federal government. The system registered hundreds of thousands of Oregonians and was fully functional by February 2014,\u201d Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cUnfortunately, along the way it became clear that the process in Oregon was being managed by unaccountable campaign consultants whose primary concern was the political implications for the former-Governor and in shifting blame away from state mismanagement.\u201d\n\nClyde Hamstreet, who briefly served as interim executive director for Cover Oregon in 2014, acknowledged political pressure from the Kitzhaber administration to abandon the exchange. He also concluded that gross mismanagement at Cover Oregon, not technical neglect by Oracle, led to the exchange\u2019s repeated delays.\n\nIn a report he delivered to state officials in August, Mr. Hamstreet wrote that there was \u201clittle accountability among management\u201d working on the exchange and \u201chigh level objectives were not aligned and executives were frequently at odds with one another, at times displaying unprofessional conduct such as territorial behavior, open hostilities, and use of strong profanities in verbal communications.\u201d\n\nTwo other companies retained as outside consultants by the state to examine the exchange\u2019s difficulties \u2014 First Data and Maximus \u2014 corroborated Mr. Hamstreet\u2019s concerns in their own reports, saying the state\u2019s poor oversight was responsible.\n\n\u201cThe decision to not use an overall system integrator for the project departs from best practices. This decision created a lack of accountability on the project. It contributed to a lack of scope control, a delay in requirements definition, and unrealistic delivery expectations,\u201d First Data concluded in an April 23, 2014, report.\n\nMaximus, the state\u2019s quality assurance vendor for the project, raised concerns about the decision not to use a system integrator in an initial risk assessment report as early as Nov. 3, 2011, and reported as late as October 2013 \u2014 when the website was scheduled to launch \u2014 that efforts were continuing to \u201clock down\u201d the scope of the project.\n\nMr. Hamstreet told The Times that he endured political pressure in trying to get the exchange launched.\n\n\u201cI was sensitive, given media coverage that the polling on the Cover Oregon brand name could become fodder for political purposes unless it was done carefully and was focused directly on operational questions,\u201d Mr. Hamstreet said in an interview. \u201cI did not know what the campaign committee was thinking.\u201d\n\nJust weeks before the governor announced that Oregon\u2019s federally funded health care marketplace would be abandoned, he gave a green light to a top campaign operative to effectively commandeer the fate of Cover Oregon.\n\nOn Feb. 8, 2014, political operative Patti McCaig \u2014 who was not a state employee \u2014 wrote an email to Mr. Kitzhaber and his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, that assigned roles to other campaign operatives to manage Cover Oregon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we need more accountability and follow thru from the campaign and some specific, intensive management of the Cover Oregon issues. I do not think the governor\u2019s office has the staff capacity on the Cover Oregon piece,\u201d she wrote, adding that state officials \u201cneed to be managing from the gov[ernor\u2019s] office, bridging the information gap with the campaign, and most importantly identifying and teeing up the critical and emerging Cover Oregon issues for the combined team so we can develop a plan and be more prepared both at the state level and the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe need one person who\u2019s entire purpose is getting their head around this from a communication/planning perspective and providing the rest of us with the right level of information to make informed decisions.\u201d\n\nMr. Kitzhaber responded in all capital letters: \u201cthis sounds very good to me!!!\u201d\n\nOregon law prohibits campaign officials from specifically directing state government activities, and the federal Hatch Act prohibits the use of taxpayer resources for political activities. The act applies to executive branch federal employees and to state and local employees who are principally employed in connection with programs financed in whole or in part by federal loans or grants.\n\nOne week later, on Feb. 16, 2014, Ms. McCaig wrote to Mr. Kitzhaber and his chief of staff, Mike Bonetto, that \u201cbeing mindful of not putting too much on paper, I did want to put together an org chart, goals, and overview together for the Cover Oregon team a SWAT Team [that] is a combined team of both public and private resources.\u201d\n\nOn April 2, Ms. McCaig announced that she would take control of a critical conference call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to run tonight\u2019s meeting and I think it should be limited to Cover Oregon issues \u2014 specifically: 1) IT recommendation: content, process, and timing 2) Greg Van Pelt\u2019s appearance tomorrow: goal for committee/Oregon, detailed schedule, response, spokespeople 3) Hamstreet: Contract, reporting authority, messaging, spokespeople.\u201d\n\nMr. Van Pelt, a key adviser to Mr. Kitzhaber, was scheduled to testify about the exchange debacle before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in Washington in the subsequent days.\n\nThe beginning of the end came on April 9 when Ms. McCaig set forth an eight-step plan to phase out Cover Oregon.\n\nOn the possibility of \u201cinvesting further in the Oregon option the consensus is to let it go. We don\u2019t see a path to save it. Regardless, the Cover Oregon Board would hear and accept the federal exchange recommendation April 22, 23, or 24.\u201d\n\nOn April 25, 2014, Cover Oregon\u2019s board voted to switch to the federal exchange.\n\nThe Washington Times made several attempts to contact Ms. McCaig and other Kitzhaber political operatives copied on the email chains by phone and email, but none responded.\n\nOn Feb. 13, the same day Mr. Kitzhaber resigned the governorship, the House oversight committee sent him written notice that the misspent federal funds related to the Oregon health care exchange was under investigation by Congress, and the letter highlighted the campaign\u2019s coaching of Mr. Van Pelt.\n\n\u201cMedia reports indicated campaign staff even edited the testimony of a witness who testified before the Committee on April 3, 2014. It has also come to our attention that an employee in the Governor\u2019s office instructed state officials to remove emails from your personal account from State servers,\u201d the letter says.\n\nMr. Chaffetz said he does not believe Oregon\u2019s failures mean all other state exchanges will necessarily fail.\n\n\u201cThe abysmal failure of Oregon shouldn\u2019t lead the rest of the country to go to a single-payer system. Utah has done quite well and would do better. We shouldn\u2019t gravitate to the lowest common denominator,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth and Human Services gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Oregon. We need to figure out why that took place and how that one essentially got flushed down the toilet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Oregon Gov.
