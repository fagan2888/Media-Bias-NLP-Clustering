During his speech, the Texas Senator served up the fiery, intemperate rhetoric he has become known for. With typical bombast, he told the audience:\n\nThe Obama economy is a disaster, Obamacare is a trainwreck, and the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind \u2013 the whole world is on fire.\n\nHis comment caught the attention of 3-year-old Julia Trant who responded nervously, by asking, \u201cThe world is on fire?\u201d Senator Cruz, rather than clarifying to the child that he was speaking metaphorically, and that there wasn\u2019t \u201ca real fire\u201d burning up the world, instead looked at the girl and repeated the claim. Cruz exclaimed:\n\nThe world is on fire. Yes! Your world is on fire!\n\nThen perhaps recognizing that he might be frightening the young child, he continued:\n\nBut you know what? Your mommy\u2019s here and everyone\u2019s here to make sure the world you grow up in is better.\n\nCruz then continued on his doom and gloom tirade, comparing government regulators to a plague of locusts. He called for abolishing the IRS and dismantling Obamacare.\n\nSenator Cruz was short on practical solutions, instead indulging in right-wing fantasies. He stated:\n\nThere are 110,000 agents at the IRS. We need to put a padlock on that building and take every one of those 110,000 agents and put them on our Southern border. Now look, I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek \u2013 but think about it for a minute. Imagine you\u2019ve traveled thousands of miles in the blinding sun, you\u2019re dripping wet, you swim the Rio Grande and the first thing you see is 110,000 IRS agents? You\u2019d turn around and go home too.\n\nThe fire and brimstone rhetoric did nothing to dissuade the Republicans in attendance. The base ate it up, and clamored for more. One audience member stood up and declared:\n\nIt\u2019s D-Day in America, folks. . . We can\u2019t wait for another Republican. We need Ted Cruz and I don\u2019t care who he runs with. We need him and that\u2019s it!\n\nThere is no question that Ted Cruz can rile up a partisan crowd. However, winning an election requires more than just stirring up the unbridled passion of your most committed supporters. A candidate has to propose policy solutions, and he, or she, also has to demonstrate the temperament to be a leader that Americans can trust.\n\nSenator Cruz offers rhetoric but no solutions. Furthermore, his inability to slow his roll, long enough to reassure a little child that the world isn\u2019t literally on fire, also shows he lacks the temperament to be a leader the American people can feel comfortable with. Senator Cruz\u2019s fiery speech may have won over the conservative crowd in Barrington, but looking at the bigger picture, He just struck a match to his 2016 presidential aspirations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Senator Cruz's fiery talk may have won over hardcore conservatives, he just struck a match to his 2016 presidential aspirations.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "While Senator Cruz's fiery talk may have won over hardcore conservatives, he just struck a match to his 2016 presidential aspirations.", "title": "Ted Cruz Strikes A Match To His 2016 Hopes By Frightening Children In New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/16/ted-cruz-strikes-match-2016-hopes-telling-3-year-old-girl-world-fire.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ted-Cruz-little-girl-e1426519693348.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-16T12:56:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,U.S. Senate,Internal Revenue Service,Man-Made Disaster,Ted Cruz,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "U.S. Senate", "published_time": "2015-03-16T12:55:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T12:56:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Internal Revenue Service, Man-Made Disaster, Ted Cruz"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaee6\"", "article_summary": "On Sunday, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz addressed a crowd of over 100 people in Barrington, New Hampshire.\nWe need Ted Cruz and I don\u2019t care who he runs with.\nThere is no question that Ted Cruz can rile up a partisan crowd.\nSenator Cruz offers rhetoric but no solutions.\nSenator Cruz was short on practical solutions, instead indulging in right-wing fantasies."}
