So another atrocity has us talking about race again. And rightly so. Nothing about America makes sense without understanding the long shadow cast by the original sin of slavery.

And yes, it’s an integral part of the left-right divide. Look at “Why Doesn’t the United States Have a European-Style Welfare State?” by Alberto Alesina — yes, that Alesina — Ed Glaeser, and Bruce Sacerdote. The authors are hardly big lefties; nonetheless, they were driven to the conclusion that it’s mainly about you-know-what:

Racial discord plays a critical role in determining beliefs about the poor. Since racial minorities are highly overrepresented among the poorest Americans, any income-based redistribution measures will redistribute disproportionately to these minorities. Opponents of redistribution in the United States have regularly used race-based rhetoric to resist left-wing policies. Across countries, racial fragmentation is a powerful predictor of redistribution. Within the United States, race is the single most important predictor of support for welfare. America’s troubled race relations are clearly a major reason for the absence of an American welfare state.

To see what they’re talking about, and why their point remains so relevant, look at two maps. First, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act:
