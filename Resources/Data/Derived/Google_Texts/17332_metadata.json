The Green family is under investigation for shipping some ancient clay tablets from Israel to Oklahoma City.\n\nThe items were to be displayed in a religion-themed museum the family is funding in Washington, D.C., The Daily Beast reports.\n\nU.S. Customs authorities in 2011 seized more than 200 of the tablets, each thousands of years old and inscribed in cuneiform, the form of writing used in ancient Assyria and Babylonia, an area that is now Iraq. The investigation has been going on since then, the report says.\n\nThe FedEx shipping labels on the packages misrepresented their contents, according to the Beast. The president of the Museum of the Bible told the news site the delay in Customs is just a matter of \"incomplete paperwork,\u201d but the Beast notes that an investigation that has already lasted four years is likely to involve more than missing dates or signatures.\n\nThe Green family and their business are known for adhering to right-wing Christian principles.
