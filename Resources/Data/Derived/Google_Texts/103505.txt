YEADON >> State Rep. Margo Davidson, D-164, of Upper Darby, will have a free community health fair 2 to 5 p.m. May 21 at the Chapel of the Good Shepard, 654 Church Lane.

“My community health fair is a perfect opportunity for residents of the 164th Legislative District to receive free screening tests and get lots of health questions answered by making just one visit,” Davidson said. “I think it’s very important for the health and safety of my constituents who may not have access to health care.”

Information about the Affordable Care Act will be provided by an expert who can answer questions about the federal health care program.

The health fair features information on wellness from providers, state and county agencies and nonprofit organizations.
