It\u2019s like when you go to see a rock band that spans five decades, you\u2019re not gonna hear all the hits. Or I could just show up in my pajamas and talk at everyone for nine hours. There\u2019s been that much going on.\u201d\n\nFor Winstead, doing her annual show \u2014 dubbed \u201cLizz Miserables\u201d this time around \u2014 has become a home-for-the-holidays tradition as ingrained as getting a Plazaburger at the Convention Grill, a Bloody Mary at Ike\u2019s or a popover at the Oak Grill. Of all the headline-making jaw droppers over the past 12 months, what made hers drop the farthest? Something involving Donald Trump, natch.\n\n\u201cThis mantra that he\u2019s just saying what other people are thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cReally? Dangerous, racist, terrifying things, and people are going yeah! The number of relatives I\u2019ve had to unfriend on Facebook this year, well, it\u2019s been more than most.\u201d\n\nThe other thing chapping her hide has to do with the cause she is most known for championing as its self-dubbed \u201cfun aunt\u201d \u2014 reproductive rights, and the furor over misleading videos about Planned Parenthood, specifically. \u201cPeople are tossing aside science in favor of pretenders,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like believing the cast of \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 over the NIH [National Institutes of Health].\u201d\n\nWinstead will not spend the entire night channeling Debbie Downer on laughing gas, though.\n\nLizz Winstead\n\n\u201cSome good things happened this year, like marriage equality. The Supreme Court ruling the Affordable Health Care Act constitutional. No Keystone pipeline coming through the country. The Confederate flag came down in South Carolina. And the new Canadian prime minister? A very good thing.\u201d (That would be Justin Trudeau, who when asked why half of his cabinet is made up of women, famously replied, \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d)\n\nAsked to lay out a sneak preview of her show, Winstead fired off a few topical one-liners.\n\nIslamophobia? \u201cIt\u2019s taken over in such a horrifying way. When little Ahmed made his clock, the state of Texas set theirs back 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe NRA? \u201cThey should rename themselves the AK47 percent.\u201d\n\nTrump? \u201cHe\u2019s replaced bedbugs as America\u2019s No. 1 pest.\u201d\n\nFemale Viagra? \u201cOne of its unwanted side effects is inducing drowsiness. It should really be called the Cosby.\u201d\n\nThe changing of the guard over at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d which Winstead helped create?\n\n\u201cTrevor Noah has brought a great perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to have a block of television with two men of color hosting [Larry Gilmore follows Noah] and that\u2019s just the way it is \u2014 it\u2019s not being trivialized by being seen as novelty.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make Winstead speechless, but a mention of the name Martin Shkreli \u2014 the young pharma titan who jacked up AIDS-drug prices, then got busted for securities fraud \u2014 almost does it.\n\n\u201cI want to make my money by ripping off dying vulnerable people, yeah, that seems to be the ticket,\u201d she riffed. \u201cThat creepy dude-bro is too awful even for hell. ISIS doesn\u2019t even want him. Wonder where that guy is spending the holidays.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019ll be spending hers in Minneapolis, \u201cwriting right up until the show starts,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Minneapolis-bred wiseacre Lizz Winstead has no shortage of material for her year-in-review show.", "title": "Comic Lizz Winstead winds up 2015 in Minneapolis, with plenty to poke fun at", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/comic-lizz-winstead-winds-up-2015-in-minneapolis-with-plenty-to-poke-fun-at/363466951/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1night12161.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1night12161.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Minneapolis-bred wiseacre Lizz Winstead has no shortage of material for her year-in-review show.", "title": "Comic Lizz Winstead winds up 2015 in Minneapolis, with plenty to poke fun at", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/comic-lizz-winstead-winds-up-2015-in-minneapolis-with-plenty-to-poke-fun-at/363466951/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1night12161.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1night12161.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Minneapolis-bred wiseacre Lizz Winstead has no shortage of material for her year-in-review show."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3953\"", "article_summary": "For the first time, Lizz Winstead says she\u2019s feeling \u201ckind of panicked\u201d about her annual trip home to ring in the new year by acerbically reviewing the year that was.\nWonder where that guy is spending the holidays.\u201dShe\u2019ll be spending hers in Minneapolis, \u201cwriting right up until the show starts,\u201d she said.\nIt should really be called the Cosby.\u201dThe changing of the guard over at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d which Winstead helped create?\nIt\u2019s like when you go to see a rock band that spans five decades, you\u2019re not gonna hear all the hits.\n\u201cI want to make my money by ripping off dying vulnerable people, yeah, that seems to be the ticket,\u201d she riffed."}
