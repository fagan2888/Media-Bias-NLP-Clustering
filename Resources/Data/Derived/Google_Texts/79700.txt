BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Maybe “Bad Judge” is the wrong title.

She’s actually a very good judge. Off the job, she’s somewhat of a bad girl.

Played by Kate Walsh on this upcoming NBC sitcom, Judge Rebecca Wright is a clear break from the cool, polished Dr. Addison Montgomery she played for eight seasons on “Grey’s Anatomy” and its spinoff, “Private Practice.”

“She’s a party girl,” Walsh said, “and she happens to be really, really good at her job.”

On a panel Sunday at the summer TV critics’ meeting, Walsh argued that Wright’s riotously let-her-hair-down style whenever she’s off the bench is, in part, just her form of release from the pressures of her job.

She’s the kind of woman “that we love to watch do things that we don’t necessarily think the people in their position should do,” added executive producer Anne Heche (who doesn’t appear in the show).
