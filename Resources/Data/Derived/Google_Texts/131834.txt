For those with insurance, the amount covered has barely budged over the past several decades. According to the GAO study, the median maximum benefit was $1,500 in 2008 (the last year for which figures are available), about what it has been for the past 30 years. (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act eliminated the annual limit for people younger than 19 in most plans, but it still applies to everyone else.)
