Mark Udall (D-Colo.) with claims health care isn't about politics. We put the ad to the Truth Teller test. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like political ads. I don\u2019t like them either. But health care isn\u2019t about politics. It\u2019s about people. And millions of people have lost their health insurance, millions of people can\u2019t see their own doctors, and millions are paying more and getting less.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Americans for Prosperity ad running in states with competitive Senate races\n\nThis 30-second ad from the limited-government group Americans for Prosperity claims it\u2019s not about politics. But it\u2019s really all about making life difficult for Democrats. In fact, the ad goes by so quickly that viewers may have little time to process the information offered in the ad \u2014 except that the Affordable Care Act is really bad for Americans.\n\nThe Truth Teller team has produced a video (above) which provides instant fact checks as the actress hired for the ad speaks her lines. More detail about the claims is provided below.\n\nThe Facts\n\n\u201cMillions of people have lost their health insurance\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve repeatedly written about this claim, most recently when House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) incorrectly claimed that so many people have lost insurance that there\u2019s even been \u201ca net loss\u201d of people with insurance. Actually, there has been an increase in the number of people with insurance, though not as much as the Obama administration had hoped.\n\nThe Associated Press estimated that nearly 5 million Americans had their insurance canceled, but a large percentage of the people whose old plans were canceled were automatically moved to new plans offered by the same insurance companies. These people may not be happy with their new coverage, but they got a plan without going through HealthCare.gov. Precise figures are not available, as the insurance market is private and fragmented, but insurance company officials say a majority of people could move to new plans they were offered.\n\nThe White House last year ordered an administrative fix that, depending on the actions of individual states, allowed as many as 2.3 million people with \u201ccanceled plans\u201d to simply stay on their old plans for at least another year. (In early March, the White House extended that deadline to 2016.) The administration in December also announced a new catastrophic exemption to fill any remaining gaps in coverage \u2014 estimated to affect as many as 500,000 people.\n\nIn other words, only in a narrow sense have \u201cmillions\u201d lost their health insurance.\n\n\u201cMillions of people can\u2019t see their own doctors\u201d\n\nThis sweeping statement could just as well describe the world before implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Most Americans get their insurance through their employers, and those plans could be changed at any time. Moreover, when people change jobs, they often also change health plans, which could also force changes in doctors. Of course, most plans do not prevent you from seeing a doctor who is not in a network; instead, your co-pays would be higher.\n\nAFP in the past has run ads that feature people upset at losing their doctors, but this line is misleading because it presumes that everything was perfect before the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\n\u201cMillions are paying more and getting less\u201d\n\nThis is another sweeping statement, and the most misleading. (Advocates could argue back that \u201cmillions more are paying less and getting more.\u201d)\n\nIn terms of premiums, there is a fierce dispute now among policy experts about the impact of the law on the cost of health care. When we previously looked at this issue, after President Obama claimed that the law \u201chas helped the cost of health care grow at its slowest rate in 50 years,\u201d we settled on a \u201cverdict pending.\u201d It\u2019s still difficult to compare premiums from before the law with premiums after the law \u2014 or to determine how much the law has to do with health-care costs today.\n\nOne big reason why it is difficult to compare premiums, before and after, is because the law mandates a comprehensive package of benefits \u2014 benefits that many plans in the individual market previously lacked. That increase in insurance coverage, according to a Congressional Budget Office study in 2009, was expected to boost the premiums of nongroup plans by about 30 percent, but the impact would be negligible for large group plans, which already provided many of those benefits.\n\nBut, wait, there\u2019s more: Other factors were expected to reduce premiums in the individual market, so the total difference (before subsidies) was an increase of 10 to 13 percent per person. For people receiving subsidies, the cost of premiums in the individual market would actually decline nearly 60 percent, CBO calculated.\n\nIn other words, the insurance premiums may be slightly higher for some \u2014 or significantly lower for many \u2014 but the plans are also more robust.\n\nSo how does AFP justify that people are getting \u201cless\u201d? Levi Russell said the ad is referring to narrower health-care networks. He pointed The Fact Checker to an article in The Wall Street Journal on a McKinsey & Co. report that found that the percentage of plans with \u201cultranarrow\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d hospital networks had increased \u2014 though that also meant lower premium costs. In fact, many people apparently would happily pay less to get less.\n\n\u201cMcKinsey found that nearly two-thirds of about 150,000 consumers surveyed since 2011 said they were willing to trade provider choice to lower their premium costs,\u201d the article said.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWe realize that 30 seconds is not a lot of time to present a reasoned analysis of the health-care law. But once again Americans for Prosperity makes sweeping claims about the health-care law that lack context or offer a misleading picture.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The newest anti-Obamacare ad from Americans for Prosperity gets the Truth Teller treatment.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The newest anti-Obamacare ad from Americans for Prosperity gets the Truth Teller treatment.", "title": "New anti-Obamacare ad makes misleading claims (video)", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/25/new-anti-obamacare-ad-makes-misleading-claims-video/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BjkW6uMIcAAwMmJ.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/25/new-anti-obamacare-ad-makes-misleading-claims-video/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, americans prosperity, koch brothers, health insurance premiums, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker, truth teller,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, americans prosperity, koch brothers, health insurance premiums, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker, truth teller,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce400\"", "article_summary": "An Americans for Prosperity ad targets Sen.
