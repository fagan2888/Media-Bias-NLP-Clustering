( Through Sept. 20 at the Buell.)\n\nWhile that enthusiasm would be utterly earned, it might also be less than \u201cPippin\u201d deserves.\n\n* * * * musical\n\nDirector Diane Paulus\u2019 take on Stephen Schwartz and Roger Hirson\u2019s 1972 Broadway musical about a bright if entitled prince on a quest for meaning is a high-wire act of pleasure and smarts.\n\nPaulus enlisted choreographer Chet Walker. He danced in the original and worked with Bob Fosse, director-choreographer on that show. She also tapped circus genius Gypsy Snider.\n\nYes, this new \u201cPippin\u201d remains the story of a boy who runs off. Only instead of joining the circus, it joins him.\n\nLeading Player is the show\u2019s winking narrator, its alluring emcee, its whip-cracking ringmaster, and deeper into Pippin\u2019s \u2014 and our \u2014 journey, the character becomes the musical\u2019s uncomfortable charismatic force.\n\nSasha Allen portrays the sly, sensual character. With a voice vast and lush, she arrives on stage with a troupe of acrobats, the Players. After their knock-out number \u201cMagic to Do,\u201d cqq she introduces us to Pippin\u2019s deceptively simple saga.\n\nThe son of King Charlemagne (John Rubinstein)returns home from his studies, hungering to be \u201cfulfilled,\u201d to find, he sings with soaring optimism, his \u201cCorner of the Sky.\u201d It\u2019s a quest \u2014 goosed by Leading Player \u2014 that finds our intrepid Pippin grappling with human endeavors that have promised purpose for centuries: war, sex, revolution. Matthew James Thomas, who originated the role of Pippin in the Broadway revival, stepped in late for this run. He captures the heir with winning humor and a vivid tenor.\n\nBut then The cast as a whole charms. As Pippin\u2019s grandmother Berthe, Lucie Arnaz nearly brings down the house, invitingthey bring up the house lights so the audience to join her in the growing-old ditty, \u201cNo Time At All.\u201d\n\nJohn Rubinstein is bawdy and knowing as Charles. The scene in which Pippin arrives at a cathedral where Charles retreats in prayer is rich, and not just for the twists on the roles of father and son \u2014 Rubinstein played Pippin in the original.\n\nAh, the generations of man.\n\nWalker and Snider mix the erotic charge of Fosse with a carnival\u2019s carnal grace. of the carnival What they have created often stuns.\n\nThe show has a number of one-two punches in which The breezily amusing is followed closely by the deliciously ominous. For instance, Leading Player\u2019s dark anthem on war, \u201cGlory,\u201d follows Charles\u2019 tongue-twister \u201cWar Is a Science.\u201d\n\nLike the brilliant work of its acrobats, \u201cPippin\u201d is a feat of balance. It is playful and deadly serious. A lark and a lesson. A coupling of astounding spectacle and deeply earned sentiment. Often it is all those things in the same instant.\n\nPip, pip, hooray, indeed.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cPIPPIN.\u201d Book by Roger Hirson.
