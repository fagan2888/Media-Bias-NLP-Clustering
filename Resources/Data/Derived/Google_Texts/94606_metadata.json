Allen is a partner with a joint venture between Atlanta-based Hojeij Branded Foods and its Detroit partner, AP United LLC. The venture owns nine restaurants inside the McNamara Terminal at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to work,\" Allen recalls the man saying. But once she told him where the restaurant was located, she said, he dropped his head. He didn't have transportation to get there.\n\n\n\nReliable transportation. Medical challenges. Child care gaps. These are some of the barriers that separate low-income workers from opportunities to move forward in career paths and ultimately increase their incomes. Nearly 1 million households in Michigan fit this profile.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for employers? Rampant turnover by this workforce population gets expensive \u2014 and quickly, to the tune of $3,400 or more per position. The challenges posed by this group of workers, nicknamed ALICE (for \"asset-limited, income-constrained, employed\"), even have caused some Michigan companies to rethink their recruitment and retention strategies. In some cases, employers are offering community resource-type services, all part of an effort to reduce turnover rates.\n\n\n\n\"We're desperate for people right now. We're getting ready to open up our 10th restaurant (this) month and, quite frankly, we're scrambling to get really quality employees out there,\" Allen said. \"Because we don't have a succinct mass transportation system, it's very difficult for people who want to work to get out to that location.\"\n\nMeet ALICE\n\nThough named for a woman, ALICE is a composite of women and men, young adults and seniors, single households and families. The acronym was coined in 2009 by a United Way organization in New Jersey, which sought to identify barriers to employment that hold back low-income workers from achieving career success.\n\n\n\nMore often, they're referred to as the working poor, with incomes above the federal poverty limit but too small to be financially stable. Many have limited education or skills, small family support systems or little savings. ALICE advocates say some of today's low-skilled workers grew up without role models who could demonstrate what it means to work full time or teach \"soft skills\" such as communication and problem-solving.\n\n\n\nCommon industries that employ ALICE workers include manufacturing, hospitality, customer service and construction.\n\n\n\nALICE workers have jobs, but their existence is fragile. One flat tire, an unexpected doctor's visit or a sick babysitter could mean a missed shift and paycheck. That, in turn, could cost them their jobs: Absenteeism is one of the most common reasons ALICE workers are fired.\n\n\n\nNational estimates peg the cost of losing a single employee at about $3,400, based on hiring and training a replacement, lost productivity and even extra overtime for workers who stay. To prevent turnover, many employers across the state are choosing to pool funds for the salary and benefits of a caseworker who meets with qualified employees at their work sites during work hours.\n\nThe partnerships, known as employer resource networks, have helped workers access bus fare or gas money, child care services and help to prevent utility shutoffs. Employers say the networks also have dramatically increased retention.\n\n\n\nAdvocates for ALICE and human resources consultants say business long has maintained that it's not an employer's responsibility to solve their employees' personal problems. But what if they could?\n\n\n\nCompanies that succeed at reducing turnover, they argue, are the ones that attempt to understand the challenges their employees bring to work each day \u2014 which can become distractions to productivity \u2014 and recognize that a solution is not the sole job of government welfare programs or nonprofit human services agencies. (See related story about a Grand Rapids company's resource network.)\n\n\n\n\"As cold-hearted as this may sound, if business doesn't see return on their investment, they're not going to do it,\" said Duane Berger, chief deputy director and COO with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, who travels the state to promote employer resource networks.\n\n\n\n\"It's got to be a business solution,\" Berger said. \"If human capital's stabilized at work, they're probably stabilized in their family lives.\"\n\nNot enough income\n\nData paint an eye-opening picture of the size of Michigan's low-income workforce: Forty percent of the state's households \u2014 1.5 million \u2014 don't make enough money to cover their bills, according to Michigan's ALICE report, released in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanding network\n\nWhen an employee at Coastal Automotive misses a day of work, he or she amasses \"points,\" or demerits. The Rochester Hills-based supplier of energy-absorbing vehicle materials says workers have called off a shift for such reasons as a friend's car had a flat tire and they had no other ride.\n\n\n\nCompany administrators are empathetic, but they say their hands are also tied, since they can't award some employees preferential treatment over others.\n\n\n\n\"So many people we lose because they don't have a way to get to work,\" said Victoria Roberts, Coastal's human resources manager.\n\n\n\nThe supplier three years ago forged a $9.8 million program with the state called Community Ventures, which uses general fund dollars to match employers with human service providers that can help ex-offenders and workers on the state's public assistance or Medicaid rolls hold on to jobs.\n\n\n\nThat program, though, is limited only to employees who live in the city of Pontiac, since the state concentrates its dollars in four of the state's most troubled urban centers \u2014 Detroit, Pontiac, Flint and Saginaw. That means a worker at Coastal who is struggling to make ends meet but lives a few miles away in Auburn Hills isn't eligible to receive any services, such as gas cards or funds to prevent utility shutoffs.\n\n\n\nAs a result, Coastal Automotive has committed to join a startup employer resource network that will serve workers who live in all of Oakland County, extending wraparound services to even more people. Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency will be the network's administrator.\n\n\n\nCoastal recently started a pilot program with ride-sharing service Uber, which arranges to drive employees to work. That program has helped at least one dedicated employee, who works as a team leader, drop off her two children and arrive on time for her shift at 6 a.m., said Wendel Martin, Coastal's commercial director.\n\n\n\nWithout it, he said, she likely would have lost her job due to transportation issues alone, regardless of her job performance.\n\n\n\nSince joining the Community Ventures program, Coastal Automotive's retention rate has improved from about 40 percent over 12 months to roughly 67 percent, the state said.\n\nTurnover cost\n\nEmployers have a definite financial incentive to want to improve retention: The cost of turnover.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Open up their eyes'\n\nAdvocates for ALICE say business has to buy into policy changes that emphasize people along with the bottom line.\n\n\n\nThe state is transitioning away from a manufacturing-centric economy into one that values knowledge-based services and higher education. And a talent shortage in the skilled trades is making it harder for some employers to find new workers to fill the pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe ALICE report \"has started to open up their eyes,\" Dzurka said of employers.\n\n\n\nCompanies that join an employer resource network spend money up front with the hope that they'll reap a greater return on investment. Berger said participating employers repeatedly have noticed improvement in retention.\n\n\n\nHiring a caseworker to handle solutions to social problems also frees up in-house human resources managers to focus on business needs, Berger said.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of companies will say, 'It's not my job to solve social problems. It's not my problem to worry about how they get to work. It's not my problem to worry about their kids.' And to some degree, that's true,\" Berger said.\n\n\n\n\"More and more companies are recognizing, 'Maybe it's not my responsibility, but if I want business bottom line to be (the) best it can be, I've got to have good assets in my human capital.' \"\n\n\n\nEmployers who successfully boost retention don't focus just on raising wages, said Guzzo, of Mercer. Instead, they have perfected a system of employment practices, from scheduling to skills training.\n\n\n\nFor Tanya Allen, who operates restaurants at Detroit Metro for joint venture HBF APU JV LLC, that includes offering a work environment that is conducive to retention.\n\n\n\nHBF APU recently joined the Wayne County employer resource network, at a cost of $10,000 annually. She believes it will pay dividends in reducing turnover costs.\n\n\n\nEmployees who are distracted by outside problems, especially in a customer-facing job, affect the quality of service given to customers, she said. And each time the company has to train a new worker, speed of service declines.\n\n\n\n\"Pay it later or pay it now,\" Allen said. \"If you don't invest in your employees now, you will pay later.\"\n\n\n\nLindsay VanHulle: (517) 657-2204.
