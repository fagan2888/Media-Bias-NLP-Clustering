(AP) - Gov. Pat McCrory praised fellow Republican lawmakers Wednesday night during his second State of the State address for their partnership the past two years, saying that has led to lower unemployment and tax rates and accelerated debt repayment for jobless benefits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to report that the state of North Carolina has come back even stronger today,\u201d McCrory told a joint session of the House and Senate within the Legislative Building. \u201cIts people are resilient and our future is bright.\u201d\n\nBut he said there\u2019s more work to do in the second half of his gubernatorial term that began in 2013, particularly with extending the recent prosperity many state residents haven\u2019t yet experienced.\n\n\u201cMy vision for North Carolina is to have the best of everything,\u201d McCrory said at the close of a 1 hour, 20 minute address televised statewide.\n\nMcCrory laid out a price tag on transportation and government building infrastructure bonds he wants. McCrory re-affirmed his promise to work to raise entry-level teacher pay to $35,000 this fall. And he said he wants to create two new Cabinet-level departments.\n\nBut he provided little meat around the bones of two contentious issues - economic incentives and Medicaid expansion.\n\nHere are some highlights and what other politicians are saying about the address.\n\nDEBT REQUEST: The governor said he\u2019ll ask the legislature to approve a $1.2 billion bond for transportation projects that have cleared environmental hurdles but haven\u2019t quite risen above the threshold to gain traditional road-building funds. He also said he\u2019ll propose $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in bonds for broader infrastructure needs.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer afford this culture of neglect and apathy,\u201d he said, adding \u201cwe have structures all over the state that are a blight to North Carolina\u2019s main streets.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether one or both of the packages would need approval in a statewide referendum.\n\nMORE ON THE ECONOMY: McCrory asked lawmakers in coming weeks to approve his \u201cNC Competes\u201d job recruitment proposal to help his administration compete effectively with other states seeking to land big companies.\n\nHis office said it would encourage manufacturing, attract investment and help universities attract new capital for their next big ideas. But he didn\u2019t spell out exactly what he would be asking lawmakers to approve, save for reviving a tax credit for entities that renovate historic buildings.\n\nMEDICAID CHANGES: The governor re-asserted his support for his \u201cHealthy North Carolina\u201d Medicaid overhaul plan in which state hospital and doctor networks could benefit financially from healthy enrollees and contained costs. The House and Senate tried last summer to reach a deal, but remain at odds over whether out-of-state managed-care companies also could participate.\n\nMcCrory was guarded about whether he would ask them to expand Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of the working poor through President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nThe governor said he\u2019s exploring \u201cNorth Carolina-based options\u201d to cover more of the uninsured. \u201cIf we bring a proposal\u201d to legislators, he added, \u201cit must protect North Carolina taxpayers\u201d and require \u201cpersonal and financial responsibility\u201d by those covered.\n\nNEW DEPARTMENTS: McCrory said he wants a new Department of Veterans Affairs in addition to the Department of Information Technology his administration already requested. The veterans affairs\u2019 agency would help veterans find employment and health care and fight to keep bases open during future rounds of closings nationwide.\n\nWORKERS\u2019 INJURIES: The governor said workers\u2019 compensation costs within state government - $896 million over six years - are too high. He said they can be controlled partly by weeding out abuse or fraud, contending that accounts for about 40 percent of the costs.\n\nLAWMAKERS RESPOND: Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, said the chamber\u2019s Republicans looked forward to reviewing more plan details from McCrory.\n\nIn the Democrats\u2019 official response, also aired on TV, House Minority Leader Larry Hall, D-Durham, said the state\u2019s economic recovery McCrory keeps talking about has fallen short and benefited mostly the wealthy.\n\n\u201cGov. McCrory often brags about an economic comeback. But when it comes to the middle class, all we\u2019ve seen is rhetoric,\u201d Hall said.\n\nOn the public schools, Hall said McCrory \u201cis failing our students\u201d because teachers remain poorly paid on average and classroom spending is near the bottom compared to other states.\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS: McCrory got emotional when he introduced Trooper Michael Potts, sitting in the House gallery. Potts was severely wounded during a traffic stop on the day of McCrory\u2019s first State of the State address in February 2013.\n\nMcCrory went to the hospital after the speech, and has since become friends with the trooper and his family. Potts has now returned to work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
