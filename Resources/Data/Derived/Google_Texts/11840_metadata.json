Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania threw a few elbows at several potential rivals for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, calling possible contenders Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas \u201cbomb throwers\u201d with little experience.\n\n\u201cDo we really want someone with this little experience?\u201d Mr. Santorum said, referring to Mr. Paul, Mr. Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, The New York Times reported. \u201cAnd the only experience they have basically \u2014 not Rubio, but Cruz and Paul because I don\u2019t think Rubio is going to go \u2014 is bomb throwing? Do we really want somebody who\u2019s a bomb thrower, with no track record of any accomplishments?\u201d\n\nDoug Stafford, a senior adviser to Mr. Paul, told the paper they would pass on responding to the \u201calleged wisdom\u201d of someone who lost re-election in 2006 by 18 points and who \u201chas spent the time since then trying to convince people to elect him to an even higher office than the one he was booted out of.\u201d\n\nCruz adviser Jason Miller said Mr. Cruz had \u201cdone exactly what he promised he\u2019d do,\u201d and that Mr. Cruz had led \u201cthe fight to repeal Obamacare, protect the border and defend American sovereignty.\u201d\n\nMr. Santorum also pointed out potential criticism from the right that could be leveled at former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on issues like Common Core education standards, immigration, taxes, and climate change.\n\nShould Mr. Santorum, the last Republican standing against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, decide to give it another go in 2016, he could be battling with all the potential candidates he mentioned for votes among the conservative base of the GOP.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Huckabee said the former governor\u2019s actual views, and not \u201cdistortions\u201d of them, are available through his 12 books, years of television and radio commentary, and frequent postings on social media, dinging Mr. Santorum for \u201cpulling the pin on grenades tossed in our own GOP tent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Sen.
