The hope is to get more people to use the park and make it a destination in the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice park, but it\u2019s in a tricky location,\u201d said Jeff Green, spokesman for Denver Parks and Recreation.\n\nThe 13-acre park sees a lot of drive-by traffic, but it is difficult to get to as there are only nine parking spaces and the nearby streets can be tough to cross.\n\nColorado Boulevard, Alameda Avenue and Leetsdale Drive all directly border the park and in a sense, cut it off from regular use.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of this park is that it\u2019s very underused because it\u2019s an island with large moats around it,\u201d said Denver City Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman, who represents the area and is promoting the survey.\n\nResidents of the Hilltop and Crestmoor neighborhoods are close by as are Cherry Creek North and Glendale.\n\nFour large art pieces that are placed throughout the park serve as the its signature, and Denver Arts and Venues has particular interest in the park because of the art\u2019s historical significance.\n\nThe art pieces were part of an artists symposium in 1968. All of the art was made of plywood and intended to be temporary. Three of the pieces are still plywood and encased in fiberglass. The other was remade out of concrete.\n\nDenver Arts and Venues public art administrator Rudi Cerri sees potential in having artists create more work in the park and doing more with the pieces already in place, such as putting up signs with information about the art. Now, people know that the art is there, but they don\u2019t know why.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have a place for artists to do large-scale temporary work. This could be a place to do that.\u201d Cerri said.\n\nIf access is improved, the park has potential to host events. There was a Denver Arts and Venues event Aug .9. Despite being near three busy streets, the road noise doesn\u2019t bleed into the park, Cerri said.\n\nThe survey is available through Aug. 29 on the Denver Parks and Recreation website, then park planners will begin working on the master plan.\n\nSaid Susman: \u201cI wish us a lot of luck on how we can activate the park and have it be something that people can enjoy up close and personal.\u201d\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver exploring master plan for Burns Park and its public art", "title": "Denver exploring master plan for Burns Park and its public art", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/25/denver-exploring-master-plan-for-burns-park-and-its-public-art/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825_025437_burns.jpg", "height": 412}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825_025437_burns.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T14:36:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:17:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0919\"", "article_summary": "Denver Parks and Recreation, along with Denver Arts and Venues, is conducting a public survey before beginning a master plan for the park.\nDenver is exploring ways to enhance Burns Park, a widely seen but seldom used park known for its four large art pieces at the intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Alameda Avenue.\nThe survey is available through Aug. 29 on the Denver Parks and Recreation website, then park planners will begin working on the master plan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice park, but it\u2019s in a tricky location,\u201d said Jeff Green, spokesman for Denver Parks and Recreation.\nDespite being near three busy streets, the road noise doesn\u2019t bleed into the park, Cerri said."}
