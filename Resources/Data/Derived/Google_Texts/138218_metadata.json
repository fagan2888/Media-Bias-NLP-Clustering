This bill would enable businesses and the government to voluntarily share cyber threat information, not personal information, to better protect Americans from hackers. Tell the Senate, we need to pass CISA now. Hackers aren\u2019t waiting, so why are we?\u201d\n\nFinancial firms and other industries like retailing have long supported the bill, as has a large bipartisan coalition of lawmakers. The White House recently came out in favor, as well.\n\nBut digital rights advocates and a small but growing group of privacy-minded senators oppose the bill. In recent weeks, a number of prominent tech firms, such as Apple, have also said they don\u2019t support the bill in its current form.\n\nWhen CISA hits the floor \u2014 perhaps as early as this week \u2014 lawmakers will consider at least 22 amendments, many of which are intended to assuage these concerns.\n\n\u201cWe urge political leaders to collaborate and get this crucial bill over the finish line,\u201d said FSR CEO Tim Pawlenty.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The industry has long supported the information-sharing bill, which may soon come up.", "description": "The industry has long supported the information-sharing bill, which may soon come up.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The industry has long supported the information-sharing bill, which may soon come up.", "title": "New ad campaign launched for cyber bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257291-financial-lobby-presses-for-cyber-bill-with-radio-video-ads", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257291-financial-lobby-presses-for-cyber-bill-with-radio-video-ads", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-19T10:16-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T10:16:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257291-financial-lobby-presses-for-cyber-bill-with-radio-video-ads", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The industry has long supported the information-sharing bill, which may soon come up.", "card": "summary", "title": "New ad campaign launched for cyber bill"}, "dcterms.title": "New ad campaign launched for cyber bill"}, "article_summary": "This bill would enable businesses and the government to voluntarily share cyber threat information, not personal information, to better protect Americans from hackers.\nADVERTISEMENTCISA is intended to boost the exchange of cyber threat data between the public and private sector, but has been stalled over privacy concerns and worries about the bill\u2019s actual potential to fight cyber crime.\n\u201cWe urge political leaders to collaborate and get this crucial bill over the finish line,\u201d said FSR CEO Tim Pawlenty.\nThe financial sector is launching a new advertising campaign to push cybersecurity legislation though the Senate.\nIn recent weeks, a number of prominent tech firms, such as Apple, have also said they don\u2019t support the bill in its current form."}
