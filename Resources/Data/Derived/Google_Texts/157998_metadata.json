This is a business model rooted in preying on individuals and families that have no ability to repay and the CFPB has a critical opportunity to protect consumers by issuing strong rules.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB outlined a framework for the rules it's considering in March, which mapped out two sets of rules: debt trap prevention or debt trap protection. Lenders would be able to choose which set of rules to follow.\n\nUnder the prevention rules, lenders would have to verify a consumer\u2019s income, debt and borrowing history when determining his or her ability to repay a loan in full and still cover their basic living expenses and loan payments.\n\nUnder the debt trap protection rules, lenders would not be required to do an upfront analysis of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, but all loans would be limited to $500 with one finance charge and lenders would be prohibited from holding a vehicle title as collateral on a loan.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is weighing alternate sets of regulations.", "description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is weighing alternate sets of regulations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is weighing alternate sets of regulations.", "title": "Dems demand 'strongest rules possible' for payday lenders", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244079-senate-dems-urge-cfpb-to-issue-strongest-rules-possible-for-payday-loans", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/2013-11-21-gn-merkley-jeff-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244079-senate-dems-urge-cfpb-to-issue-strongest-rules-possible-for-payday-loans", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-04T16:57-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Loans, Debt, Payday loan, Financial economics, Finance, Banking, Predatory lending, United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Personal finance, CFPB, Business,Jeff Merkley, Dick Durbin, Chris Coons,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T16:57:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/244079-senate-dems-urge-cfpb-to-issue-strongest-rules-possible-for-payday-loans", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is weighing alternate sets of regulations.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dems demand 'strongest rules possible' for payday lenders"}, "dcterms.title": "Dems demand 'strongest rules possible' for payday lenders"}, "article_summary": "Senate Democrats are calling on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to crack down on predatory lending with the \"strongest rules possible.\"\nLenders would be able to choose which set of rules to follow.\n\u201cA CFPB study found that 75 percent of loan fees on payday loans came from consumers with more than 10 transactions over a twelve-month period.\nUnder the prevention rules, lenders would have to verify a consumer\u2019s income, debt and borrowing history when determining his or her ability to repay a loan in full and still cover their basic living expenses and loan payments.\nUnder the debt trap protection rules, lenders would not be required to do an upfront analysis of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, but all loans would be limited to $500 with one finance charge and lenders would be prohibited from holding a vehicle title as collateral on a loan."}
