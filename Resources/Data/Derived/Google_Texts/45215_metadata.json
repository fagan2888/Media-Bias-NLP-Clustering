Drayer told The Daily Signal that these incidents represent \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d at censure because the opposition \u201cknows we have a winning strategy.\u201d\n\nEarlier in July, Created Equal made headlines when Drayer was assaulted during a sidewalk protest of abortion in downtown Columbus, Ohio. This video of an abortion supporter disrupting the event and assaulting Drayer went viral:\n\nDrayer says this is the first physical assault he\u2019s experienced but reports that \u201cthere has been a rise in the number of attacks.\u201d In a separate interview, Created Equal executive director Mark Harrington claimed that \u201cviolent attacks on pro-lifers are becoming more common.\u201d\n\nA national organization with a focus on the millennial generation, Created Equal trains thousands of college students to discuss and debate the abortion issue on college campuses and street corners.\n\nAt each protest, the group prominently displays violent and gruesome images of aborted children to spark conversation. Drayer, who is unapologetic for the graphic content, argues that \u201cevery successful social reform movement has always directly and graphically exposed injustice rather than hiding it.\u201d\n\nWell aware of the inflammatory nature of the topic, Drayer says that his group doesn\u2019t create conflict but rather works to exposes it.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have injustice, it creates a lot of hidden tension because we can\u2019t corporately as a nation kill, decapitate, dismember, and disembowel 3,000 humans every day without there being some byproduct of frustration or pain that\u2019s been hidden or pushed away.\u201d\n\nTo diffuse this tension, the group tries to emulate the American Civil Right movement by following a strict strategy of passive non-violence. Drayer explained that just as Martin Luther King, Jr., \u201ccontrasted racism and love\u201d his group hopes to \u201ccontrast abortion with love.\u201d\n\nAn evangelical Christian, Drayer says that his faith and the example of King have motivated his and the organization\u2019s response to the recent assault. Created Equal has already offered to drop all charges if the abortion supporter will apologize.\n\n\u201cThe offer is still there. We\u2019ve forgiven her and we hold no malice toward her,\u201d Drayer explained.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There has been a rise in attacks on pro-lifers, according to an activist group.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "There has been a rise in attacks on pro-lifers, according to an activist group.", "title": "Pro-Life Group Attacked in Ohio Says Assaults Increasing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Abortion-Activist-Attacks-Pro-Lifers-YouTube-e1405823233434.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1oWLTVB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "There has been a rise in attacks on pro-lifers, according to an activist group.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Abortion-Activist-Attacks-Pro-Lifers-YouTube-e1405823233434.png"}, "title": "Pro-Life Group Attacked in Ohio Says Assaults Increasing", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2014-07-19T22:31:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Pro-Life, Seth Drayer, Created Equal, Pro-Choice, Abortion, Colombus, Mark Harrington, Protest,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81fb\"", "article_summary": "Seth Drayer, Director of Training for pro-life group Created Equal, views the attacks as a sign of the movement\u2019s success.\nCreated Equal has already offered to drop all charges if the abortion supporter will apologize.\nAt each protest, the group prominently displays violent and gruesome images of aborted children to spark conversation.\nThere has been a rise in attacks on pro-lifers, according to an activist group.\nWe\u2019ve forgiven her and we hold no malice toward her,\u201d Drayer explained."}
