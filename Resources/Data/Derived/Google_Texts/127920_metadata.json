Ted Cruz touts his born-again faith, and he recalls how he \u201csurrendered his heart to Jesus\u201d as an 8-year-old at summer camp. Marco Rubio, who has at different times embraced Catholicism, Mormonism and evangelicalism, says his faith is the \u201csingle greatest influence in my life.\u201d Donald Trump, by all appearances, has never attended church regularly and claims that he has never even asked God for forgiveness, but he nonetheless speaks about American Christians as though they\u2019re a persecuted minority and has earned the widespread support of evangelicals.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe, however, that the most religiously driven candidate of all is a man who is remarkably un-theatrical about his beliefs\u2014who even vows, \u201cI don\u2019t go out and try to win a vote by using God. I think that cheapens God.\u201d That would be John Kasich.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThere is no easy way to measure how deeply a person believes, of course, or to what degree a politician is driven by faith. But the Ohio governor has gone to Bible study with the same group of men every other week for the past 20 years. He has attended an Anglican church in Ohio for decades because, as he wrote in his book, Every Other Monday: Twenty Years of Life, Lunch, Faith, and Friendship, he likes receiving Communion every week, a practice uncommon in other Christian denominations. When Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Beau died last year after a battle with brain cancer, Kasich quickly expressed sympathy, offering a prayer on Meet the Press: \u201cI'm going to pray for [Joe] because he\u2019s had a lifetime of tears. God bless you, Joe.\u201d (Cruz, in contrast, trotted out an old joke about the vice president just days after Beau\u2019s death.)\n\nThe irony here is not just that the most pious Republican candidate has been largely overshadowed in a campaign for which Christianity is a major calling card. As Kasich makes what could be his last big campaign push to win Ohio\u2019s primary on Tuesday, his devout faith might actually be hurting him. The governor\u2019s faith appears to drive his politically moderate stances on immigration, climate change and gay marriage\u2014positions that alienate him from mainstream conservatives whose support Kasich needs to have a chance at the nomination.\n\n***\n\nIf the role of religion in Kasich\u2019s life isn\u2019t well-understood, that\u2019s in part because his complex faith journey led him to a denomination that most Americans have never heard of. He was raised Catholic with ambitions to be the best altar boy in his parish, earning him the nickname \u201cPope\u201d among his friends. But around the time he left for college at Ohio State, Kasich\u2019s belief began to wane. He \u201cdrifted away from religion as a young adult,\u201d he wrote in his book. It wasn\u2019t until a drunk driver killed his parents in 1987 that Kasich returned to church. But this time, he entered the Episcopal Church, which his parents had joined later in life.\n\nThis is where things get a little tricky: He stayed with his church as it broke off with the mainstream Episcopal Church in the United States in protest over the denomination\u2019s embrace of openly gay priests and bishops. In 2011, Kasich\u2019s home church, Saint Augustine\u2019s Anglican Church in Westerville, Ohio, is one of those that split off under a new, more conservative denomination called the Anglican Church in North America. In departure from mainstream Episcopalians, the ACNA gives local churches the autonomy to decide whether to ordain women, and it politically opposes abortion and euthanasia, while the Episcopal church acknowledges \u201cthere may be cases that stand beyond judgment.\u201d\n\nIt also supports the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman, and called the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on same-sex marriage last year a \u201cstark departure from God\u2019s revealed order.\u201d\n\nAt face value, those issues don\u2019t diverge much from a typical conservative family-values platform. But in other ways, Kasich\u2019s religious beliefs appear to have put him at odds with Republican Party dogma. Over the years, he has spoken enough about his faith and quoted Scripture often enough, that it is possible to tie many of his political decisions to tenets of his faith\u2014especially the ones that deviate from GOP orthodoxy.\n\nFor example, a cornerstone of Kasich\u2019s governorship has been his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Expanding Medicaid wasn\u2019t a politically savvy move for an aspiring presidential candidate of a party almost single-mindedly dedicated to repealing Obamacare. But, as Kasich told the Christian Broadcasting Network, \u201cI\u2019m playing for a bigger game.\u201d He cited as his motivation a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus speaks about the importance of kindness: \u201cWhatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine,\u201d Jesus tells his disciples, \u201cyou did for me.\u201d\n\nLaura Turner is a writer in San Francisco.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "He might be the truest believer in the race; and it\u2019s come back to bite him.", "title": "How Kasich\u2019s Religion Is Hurting Him With Conservatives", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/john-kasich-2016-religion-213735", "image": "http://static.politico.com/0d/a6/6918cc3b4826b3a82c5752e748c5/kasichchurch.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "He might be the truest believer in the race; and it\u2019s come back to bite him.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4654\"", "article_summary": "The irony here is not just that the most pious Republican candidate has been largely overshadowed in a campaign for which Christianity is a major calling card.\nBut around the time he left for college at Ohio State, Kasich\u2019s belief began to wane.\nFor example, a cornerstone of Kasich\u2019s governorship has been his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\nBut in other ways, Kasich\u2019s religious beliefs appear to have put him at odds with Republican Party dogma.\n***If the role of religion in Kasich\u2019s life isn\u2019t well-understood, that\u2019s in part because his complex faith journey led him to a denomination that most Americans have never heard of."}
