The baseball great cried at her funeral and for 20 years had flowers placed at her crypt several times a week.\n\nThe public displays were unusual for the famously stoic and private DiMaggio. Now, his heartbreak over the breakup of their marriage will get a rare public airing when \u201cMarilyn Monroe\u2019s Lost Archives\u201d goes up for bid at Julien\u2019s Auctions in Beverly Hills next month.\n\n\u201cI love you and want to be with you,\u201d DiMaggio said in one pained letter to Monroe from the collection, written when she announced she was filing for divorce after a matter of months in 1954. \u201cThere is nothing I would like better than to restore your confidence in me.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Marilyn Monroe's lost love letters to be auctioned\n\nThe 300 items also include love letters from Monroe\u2019s third and final husband, playwright Arthur Miller. There\u2019s also a handwritten letter from Monroe to Miller in which the woman who was arguably Hollywood\u2019s greatest sex symbol muses about her many insecurities.\n\nDiMaggio wrote in his letter that he learned Monroe was leaving him when he saw her make the announcement on television.\n\n\u201cMy heart split even wider seeing you cry in front of all these people,\u201d he wrote in the letter addressed to \u201cMrs. Joe DiMaggio\u201d and mailed special delivery.\n\nOther letters in the collection come from such friends as Clark Gable, Cary Grant and Jane Russell, the latter imploring Monroe in 10 neatly handwritten pages to give her marriage to DiMaggio another chance.\n\n\u201cIt really gives you the chills when you read some of the stuff and see the intimacy and the personal nature of it,\u201d said auction curator Martin Nolan, who spent nine months organizing and cataloging the collection.\n\nAuction owner Darren Julien estimates the pieces could fetch $1 million or more, noting a watercolor Monroe painted and planned to give to President John Kennedy went for $80,000 at an estate auction nine years ago. Monroe\u2019s \u201ccollectability\u201d has skyrocketed in recent years, driven in part by deep-pocketed Asian and European collectors with a fondness for American pop-culture artifacts, he said.\n\nThe fact that the centerpiece of this collection is not just celebrity tchotchkes but deeply personal artifacts is also expected to fuel interest.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate a lot of fans will be here. They\u2019ll fly in from all over the world,\u201d said Julien, who will put the items on display to the public at his Beverly Hills gallery for four days before they go on the block Dec. 5-6.\n\nMonroe, who died of a drug overdose at age 36 in 1962, willed \u201cThe Lost Archives\u201d to her mentor, the legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg. He gave it to a friend he trusted would take proper care.\n\nThat friend\u2019s family, which Julien said wants to remain anonymous, obviously met Strasberg\u2019s expectations. Many of the letters look as pristine as the day their authors wrote them.\n\n\u201cPlease, if I\u2019ve ever made you cry or made you even more sadder, ever for a second, please forgive me, my perfect girl. I love you,\u201d Miller wrote in a pencil-scribbled P.S. at the bottom of a typewritten letter.\n\nIn a reply to one of his missives, Monroe takes issue with what the author of \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d had called her nobility in handling a difficult childhood followed by public adulation that nearly crushed her.\n\n\u201cIn other words, there was no choice to make, the same road was always before me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo for you to speak of my nobility, it really wasn\u2019t so noble.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say: \u201cIt\u2019s doubly difficult to understand that you, the most different, most beautiful human being, chose me to love.\u201d\n\nOther items in the collection include a 19-minute reel of a movie made for Monroe after her final picture, 1961\u2019s \u201cThe Misfits,\u201d wrapped. It shows her frolicking happily at the beach with co-star Gable and others.\n\nNotably, there\u2019s also a framed letter she kept on her coffee table from costume designer Cecil Beaton, who assured her she really was a fine actress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see how loved she was,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cLike you thought she was vulnerable and not loved and she craved love and she needed that reassurance. But she had it. She had it with Joe DiMaggio. She had it with Arthur Miller.\u201d\n\nAnd, so it seems, she still has it with much of the rest of the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's no secret Joe DiMaggio loved Marilyn Monroe.
