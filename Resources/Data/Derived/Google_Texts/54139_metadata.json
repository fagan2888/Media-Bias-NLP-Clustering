Anthony List (SBA-List), however, provides a fact sheet to interpret Planned Parenthood\u2019s statistics.\n\nAccording to its annual report, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions in 2013, up from its 327,166 performed in 2012. SBA-List states that, over the past three years, the abortion giant has performed nearly one million abortions.\n\nPlanned Parenthood hopes to draw attention instead to its sexually transmitted disease and contraception services (the latter of which dropped four percent in one year). The organization states three percent of its services were abortions performed, but SBA-List notes that abortions made up 94 percent of the organization\u2019s \u201cpregnancy services,\u201d while prenatal care accounted for only five percent (18,684), and adoption referrals only 0.5 percent (1,880).\n\nSBA-List concludes that, \u201cfor every adoption referral, Planned Parenthood performed 174 abortions.\u201d The pro-life group also observes that \u201cadoption referrals by Planned Parenthood dropped 14 percent in one year, and prenatal care services dropped 4 percent.\u201d Additionally, Planned Parenthood\u2019s cancer prevention services fell 17 percent in the past year.\n\nDespite these declines in provided services, Planned Parenthood reports more than $127 million in excess revenue, and over $1.4 billion in net assets.\n\nIn fiscal year 2013-2014, Planned Parenthood was provided with more than $528 million \u2013 or 41 percent of its total revenue \u2013 in taxpayer funds in the form of government grants, contracts, and Medicaid reimbursements. The organization receives Obamacare \u201cnavigator\u201d grants to help HHS bump up enrollment for President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law \u2013 upon which Planned Parenthood relies greatly, and \u201ceducation\u201d funding for sex ed. Since Obamacare is really all about expanding Medicaid, the abortion giant is extremely motivated to get as many people as possible on Obamacare Medicaid plans.\n\nThe abortion industry giant lists among its accomplishments helping \u201cmore than 125,000 young people in moments of crisis through our Chat/Text program,\u201d helping to \u201cincrease use of long-acting reversible contraception,\u201d and fighting \u201cabortion stigma in popular culture,\u201d particularly through the film Obvious Child, which Planned Parenthood describes as \u201can edgy, hip, funny, remarkably honest story revolving around one woman\u2019s abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe abortion rate may be declining across America, but not in Planned Parenthood clinics,\u201d said SBA-List president Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement regarding the report. \u201cTheir latest annual report is fresh evidence that Planned Parenthood remains an abortion-centered, profit-driven business.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2013, Planned Parenthood upped the number of abortions they performed to 327,653,\u201d Dannenfelser noted. \u201cMeanwhile, their already limited cancer screenings, prenatal services, adoption referrals \u2013 and even contraception services \u2013 continue to drop. Planned Parenthood claims to be an altruistic health care provider for women and girls but their bottom line is all about abortion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Annual Report: All About Abortions and Profits", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Planned Parenthood Annual Report: All About Abortions and Profits", "title": "Planned Parenthood Annual Report: All About Abortions and Profits", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-01-at-11.26.55-AM.png", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/01/01/planned-parenthood-annual-report-all-about-abortions-and-profits/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Annual Report: All About Abortions and Profits", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-01-at-11.26.55-AM.png", "title": "Planned Parenthood Annual Report: All About Abortions and Profits", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Abortion, Planned Parenthood,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Planned Parenthood", "published_time": "2015-01-01T09:28:08-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb98\"", "article_summary": "According to its annual report, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions in 2013, up from its 327,166 performed in 2012.\n\u201cTheir latest annual report is fresh evidence that Planned Parenthood remains an abortion-centered, profit-driven business.\u201d\u201cIn 2013, Planned Parenthood upped the number of abortions they performed to 327,653,\u201d Dannenfelser noted.\nDespite these declines in provided services, Planned Parenthood reports more than $127 million in excess revenue, and over $1.4 billion in net assets.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn the last day of 2014, Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) released its 2013-2014 annual report, revealing an uptick in abortions performed and a drop in both contraceptive and cancer prevention services.\nPlanned Parenthood claims to be an altruistic health care provider for women and girls but their bottom line is all about abortion.\u201d"}
