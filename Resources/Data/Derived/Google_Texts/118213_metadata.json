It was also celebrated with an event at the U.K. embassy in Washington \u2014 which featured a White House cake and joked \u201cOnly sparklers this time!\u201d\n\nWhen the British attacked in August 1814 (during the War of 1812), President James Madison was forced to flee the capital with a small group of aides, while Dolley Madison saved a painting of George Washington before heading out as well. They quickly returned, after the British troops left.\n\nThe War of 1812 is best remembered in America \u2014 when it is remembered at all \u2014 for the American defense of Baltimore, commemorated in Francis Scott Key\u2019s Star Spangled Banner, which later became the national anthem.\n\nMarie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, took the embassy\u2019s tweets in stride, responding via her Twitter account: \u201cThe difference 200 years can make in foreign relations: 8/24/1814: #ItsComplicated vs 8/24/2014: #SpecialRelationship \u201d\n\nStill, you can guess what happened next \u2014 after some mild chuckles and criticism on Twitter, the embassy backtracked and apologized for the tweet.\n\nLater, lead State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. didn\u2019t take any offense to the U.K. embassy\u2019s celebrations. She said those that raised concerns probably didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand British humor.\u201d\n\n200 yrs ago today, British redcoats marched down Penn Ave to set fire to the White House. \u2014 British Embassy (@UKinUSA) August 24, 2014\n\nCommemorating 200 years of peace between the US & UK pic.twitter.com/5fEKRKxBFU \u2014 British Embassy (@UKinUSA) August 24, 2014\n\nCommemorating the 200th anniversary of burning the White House.
