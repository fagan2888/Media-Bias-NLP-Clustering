· Most health insurance plans are no longer allowed to deny, limit, exclude or charge more for coverage to anyone based on a pre-existing condition, including autism and related conditions.



· All Marketplace health plans and most other private insurance plans must cover preventive services for children without charging a copayment or coinsurance. This includes autism screening for children at 18 and 24 months.



There is no cure for ASD but early detection and treatment services at a very young age can help improve a child’s life overall.



The Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated that:

· ASD is almost 5 times more common among boys (1 in 42) than among girls (1 in 189).

· It is estimated to cost at least $17,000 more per year to care for a child with ASD compared to a child without ASD. Costs include health care, education, ASD-related therapy, family-coordinated services, and caregiver time. For a child with more severe ASD, costs per year increase to over $21,000. Taken together, it is estimated that total societal costs of caring for children with ASD were over $9 billion in 2011.



Uniform Advantage’s Reason for Giving

Since Uniform Advantage’s (UA’s) uniforms travel the hallways of many offices and hospitals that wear scrubs on a daily and nightly basis, those charities and organizations that support breakthroughs and improvements in the medical field have a very special place in their hearts. Their valued customers generously support UA’s worthy causes with South Florida and National Charitable organizations. For each partner charity, Uniform Advantage will be donating $1 from the sale of designated scrubs tops and jacket prints. One of their partners for this Fall 2014 season is The Dan Marino Foundation in recognition of Autism Awareness.
