More recently it has put resources into more traditional news coverage.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz General Partner Chris Dixon, who was an early investor in BuzzFeed when he was with New York seed-stage venture firm Founder Collective, joins BuzzFeed\u2019s board.\n\nThe New York Times, which earlier reported the funding, said valuation was about $850 million and that the financing would go toward a major expansion.\n\nDixon said in a blog post announcing the funding that media consumption trends favor BuzzFeed:\n\nWe\u2019re presently in the midst of a major technological shift in which, increasingly, news and entertainment are being distributed on social networks and consumed on mobile devices. We believe BuzzFeed will emerge from this period as a preeminent media company.\n\nBuzzFeed reaches more than 150 million people per month and will generate triple-digit-millions in revenue this year, Dixon wrote.\n\nThe company previously raised more than $46 million in four rounds of venture funding. Previous investors besides Founders Collective include Hearst, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, RRE Ventures, SoftBank Capital and SV Angel.\n\nJonah Peretti, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, previously co-founded the Huffington Post, as did Ken Lerer, manager of Lerer Hippeau Ventures, who is BuzzFeed\u2019s chairman.\n\nWrite to Zoran Basich at zoran.basich@wsj.com.
