A Maryland branch of the Ku Klux Klan is rallying north of Baltimore on Friday to call for the impeachment of President Obama and protest Obamacare.

The “ Confederate White Knights ” announced on their website that the meeting will be held in the Cecil County Administration building in Elkton, Md., where the group's impeachment petition will be discussed and circulated. The site is 95 miles from the White House.

The same group recently rallied at two critical Civil War battlefields: Gettysburg , Pa., and Antietam, Md. Those rallies resembled political gatherings where the president's policies on health care and immigration were assailed.

“Join us for a peaceful meeting and discussion on what we can all do to better our country,” said the KKK website.
