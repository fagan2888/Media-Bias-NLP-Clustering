This incident is nothing compared to America\u2019s aloofness in Syria, but it adds up to American allies believing America doesn\u2019t have their back.\u201d\n\nNephew, however, argues that the Obama administration would be wise to put the situation in context, and not to respond in kind to Iran\u2019s celebratory reaction to it.\n\n\u201cAs for what we should read into it, I think that we should ignore it,\u201d Nephew said. \u201cThe reality is that a few of our guys went into Iranian waters accidentally. They got picked up and got released. Our guys reacted coolly, calmly, and\u2014so far as I am aware\u2014within their training. And we\u2019re hardly humiliated because of it. That Iran is seeking to suggest otherwise is embarrassing for them, not us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei awarded medals to the navy commanders who captured U.S. sailors last month.
