Bernie Sanders of Vermont clashed Thursday night over the future of federal health care policy and the federal tax code, taking starkly different positions that may eventually prove pivotal in the selection of the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nSanders, the \u201crevolutionary\u201d socialist insisted his multi-trillion-dollar national health care plan funded by major tax hikes was both feasible and necessary, while the more pragmatic Clinton dismissed it as \u201cwishful thinking\u201d and vowed to build on the existing Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Single-Payer Plan Would Add Up to $14 Trillion to the Debt\n\nIn one heated exchange, Clinton accused Sanders of trying to plunge the nation and Congress back into another prolonged and likely futile battle over health care coverage that would jeopardize the future of Obamacare and the millions of Americans currently enrolled in the program. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rip away the security that people finally have,\u201d she said.\n\nSanders strongly denied that he would stand by and allow Obamacare to be dismantled by the Republicans while seeking support for his far more ambitious plan for a national health program to replace current government programs and private insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cEvery major country on earth, whether it\u2019s the [United Kingdom] whether it\u2019s France, whether it\u2019s Canada, has managed to provide health care to all people as a right, and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are, he said. \u201cSo I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nSanders did not acknowledge that health care in Britain is rationed as it is in other developed countries, and that not everyone is eligible for the services that Medicare provides in the U.S.\n\nWhile the two remaining opponents in the Democratic presidential campaign agreed that the ultimate goal was to extend health care insurance to the 29 million Americans currently uninsured by Obamacare, their approaches are radically different and go to the essential difference between the two veteran politicians\u2019 strategies:\n\nClinton believes Sanders\u2019 health care and tax proposals are utopian and will never pass in a Congress likely to be controlled by the Republicans for years to come. Sanders insists voters are hungry for visionary ideas that will shatter traditional thinking by the political establishment.\n\nSanders, 74, who is from neighboring Vermont, is leading Clinton in the latest NBC News/Marist poll by 20 points and is favored to win next Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire Democratic primary. Clinton, 68, beat Sanders by a fraction of a percentage point in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses. Now she is trying to make a strong second-place finish in New Hampshire, a state she carried in her unsuccessful bid for the 2008 Democratic nomination.\n\nRelated: Clinton Insists She\u2019s Not Beholden to Wall Street While Raking in $21.4 Million\n\nHealth care reform takes a back seat to concerns about the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire, but it has far more saliency among voters nationally. The high cost of health care and insurance ranks third in the concern of voters across the country, just behind terrorism and the economy, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSanders favors replacing current federal health care programs, including Obamacare, with a government funded \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program that would include the 29 million Americans currently uncovered by Obamacare, who include illegal immigrants. The plan would echo national health care programs in Canada, Europe and Scandinavia.\n\nSanders says his plan would provide full medical and prescription drug coverage and reduce the annual cost to consumers by eliminating the need to purchase private health insurance policies with ever-mounting premiums and co-payments. The new program would also crack down on the pharmaceutical industry and bring down soaring drug costs.\n\nRelated: Democratic hopefuls Sanders and Clinton spar over 'progressive' credentials\n\nHe claims his \u201csingle-payer\u201d program would cost the government an additional $1.4 trillion a year \u2013 or $14 trillion over the coming decade. He would offset the cost by raising revenues from a combination of taxes on average workers, employers, investors, estates and the wealthiest earners.\n\nWhile that would mean higher taxes on middle-income and even some lower income Americans, Sanders argues that the net effect of those taxes on many would be negligible, because they no longer would have to pay premiums and copayments on private health insurance under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf you are paying $10,000 a year to a private health insurance company, and I say to you, hypothetically, that you are going to pay $5,000 more a year in taxes\u2026but you\u2019re not going to pay any more private health insurance, are you going to be complaining about the fact that I\u2019ve saved you $5,000 in your total bills?\u201d he said recently.\n\nClinton dismisses Sanders\u2019 proposal as unworkable, and vows to work to preserve and expand Obamacare if she is elected president. \u201cI\u2019m not making promises I can\u2019t keep,\u201d she said repeatedly.\n\nMoreover, she questions key elements of Sanders\u2019 proposals and insists, \u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t add up from what Sen. Sanders has been proposing. That\u2019s why all the independent experts, all the editorial boards that have better both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable,\u201d she said of Sanders\u2019 health care initiatives.\n\nRelated: How Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Both Won the Iowa Caucuses\n\n\u201cThere is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThe disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen.", "title": "Clinton Attacks Sanders\u2019 $14 Trillion Health Plan as \u2018Wishful Thinking\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/Clinton-Attacks-Sanders-14-Trillion-Health-Plan-Wishful-Thinking", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-sanders_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/05/Clinton-Attacks-Sanders-14-Trillion-Health-Plan-Wishful-Thinking", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-sanders_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Both Won the Iowa Caucuses\u201cThere is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care,\u201d Clinton said.\n\u201cEvery major country on earth, whether it\u2019s the [United Kingdom] whether it\u2019s France, whether it\u2019s Canada, has managed to provide health care to all people as a right, and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are, he said.\nThat\u2019s why all the independent experts, all the editorial boards that have better both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable,\u201d she said of Sanders\u2019 health care initiatives.\nThe plan would echo national health care programs in Canada, Europe and Scandinavia.\nRelated: Democratic hopefuls Sanders and Clinton spar over 'progressive' credentialsHe claims his \u201csingle-payer\u201d program would cost the government an additional $1.4 trillion a year \u2013 or $14 trillion over the coming decade."}
