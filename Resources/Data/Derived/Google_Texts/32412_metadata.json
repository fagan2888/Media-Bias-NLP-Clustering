Main St. in the Livingston County community. It shares the location with Faith Medical Clinic.\n\n\u201cThe perseverance of our students, and their partners in the Faith Clinic, despite the tragedy that occurred in February, shows how dedicated they are to serving the community\u2019s health needs,\u201d says Hari Conjeevaram, M.D., the medical director of the SRFC and a professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School. \u201cThe support from the foundation, and from our many individual donors, including our own students and faculty, will make it possible to continue that mission.\u201d\n\nThe new BCBSMF grant matches funds raised by medical students since the fire. The funds are helping the SRFC pay for part of the cost of renovations at the new location, and operating expenses and supplies. The Faith Clinic is also a recipient BCBSM\u2019s strengthening the safety net program funds, and broad community support.\n\nIn the months since the fire, both the SRFC and Faith Clinic have continued to serve patients from a temporary location \u2013 the former home of the Pinckney Community Library \u2013 but the new location is customized for their use.\n\n\u201cOf the more than 500,000 uninsured residents in Michigan, nearly half live below the poverty line,\u201d said Ira Strumwasser, Ph.D., executive director of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation. \u201cSafety net clinics, such as the SRFC and Faith clinic, are crucial to residents without the coverage or money to pay for care desperately needed to stay healthy and manage chronic conditions. We applaud the work of these clinics and are committed to supporting their efforts to provide free and low-cost health care to those who need it most.\u201d\n\nU-M medical students Philip Asamoah and Chelsea Reighard await patients at the Student Run Free Clinic intake desk\n\nThe SRFC gives students in their first years of medical school experience in running all aspects of a primary care clinic, under the supervision of volunteer physician advisors from the U-M Medical School faculty. This gives them exposure to patient care even before they reach the clinical training years of their medical education. They also confront first-hand the realities of health disparities.\n\nAdditionally, medical students in their third and fourth years of training experience first-hand taking care of patients and mentoring first- and second-year students.\n\nEach Saturday afternoon, the medical students see adult patients for free, under the supervision of volunteer physician advisors from the U-M Medical School faculty. The Faith Clinic team sees patients at the same location on Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings.\n\nThe SRFC has also partnered with U-M School of Public Health students, who are conducting a needs assessment, and SRFC leaders are working with administrators at the U-M School of Dentistry and School of Nursing to find ways to collaborate in the future. Other U-M students will also participate in the clinic, helping patients understand the new insurance options available to them under the Affordable Care Act and Michigan\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nU-M medical students opened the SRFC as a pilot in April 2012 and fully in October 2012, to provide care for community members without insurance. Already, the clinic has handled over 400 patient visits for conditions including diabetes and high blood pressure, and has provided preventive care services including routine checkups and women\u2019s health services. More than 150 students and 25 faculty physicians have accumulated thousands of volunteer hours.\n\nU-M medical student Maksim Shlykov takes a patient's blood pressure at the Student Run Free Clinic\n\n\u201cWe're inspired by the leadership and by the enthusiasm our students have brought to this important work,\u201d says Joseph Kolars, M.D., senior associate dean for education and global initiatives at the U-M Medical School.\n\nAfter the fire, the students appealed to the U-M and Ann Arbor communities to donate \u2013 and their appeal was rewarded by more than $30,000 in donations, as small as a dollar and as large as $9,000.\n\nThe BCBSMF provided a matching grant of $30,000 as part of its commitment to broadening access of care throughout Michigan, especially for the vulnerable and poor. While these contributions have been instrumental to Faith Clinic and SRFC, the partners continue to seek donations to fund equipment, furniture, medical supplies, and ongoing operations to serve the community. Donations to support the clinic\u2019s efforts can be made online.\n\nAbout Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation is dedicated to improving the health of Michigan residents by supporting health care research and innovative health programs.
