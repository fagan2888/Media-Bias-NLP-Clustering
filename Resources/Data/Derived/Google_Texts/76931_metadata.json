He put the figure at $135 million in fiscal 2014.\n\n\u201cWe think a lot of these people will get insurance in other ways,\u2019\u2019 Reese told Democratic Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver (D-Decatur), who questioned the coverage move. He added that some may qualify for subsidies in the health insurance exchange.\n\nReese projected an eventual fiscal 2017 deficit for the State Health Benefit Plan, which covers more than 630,000 state employees, teachers, other school personnel, retirees and dependents.\n\nOther items of interest in the proposed Community Health budget include a total of $42.5 million in the midyear and fiscal 2016 Medicaid budgets to cover expensive new drugs for hepatitis C.\n\nThe agency spending plan also includes hiring eight more nurse surveyors to eliminate a backlog in nursing home inspections; $12 million for the startup of a care coordination program for the disabled population on Medicaid; and more money for new medical residency slots in primary care.\n\nIt also includes forming a task force to figure out how to compensate for the state\u2019s hospitals eventually losing $390 million in federal funding for uncompensated care. These \u201cdisproportionate share\u2019\u2019 cuts come as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The law\u2019s designers believed the reductions would be offset by Medicaid expansion covering more uninsured patients.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Republican leadership has declined to expand Medicaid, saying the projected costs to the state are too high.\n\nMissing from the Community Health budget is any funding to continue the pay increase for primary care physicians who treat Medicaid patients. The reimbursement hike, entirely funded by the feds as a part of the ACA, expired Jan. 1, though some states have maintained the increase by paying for it themselves.\n\nLast week, Chris Riley, Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters that the elimination of the pay raise was a \u201cfederal government cut\u2019\u2019 that the governor has declined to make up for in the state budget. Riley said he hoped the federal government will fill in the pay gap.\n\nState Sen. Renee Unterman (R-Buford) told GHN on Tuesday that the Legislature must fund the pay bump, citing the financial harm to physicians and hospitals. \u201cWe have to,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a choice.\u201d\n\nThe discussion on the non-certificated school workers focused on the amount of money the state spent on subsidizing this coverage.\n\nThe bus drivers and other non-certificated school personnel \u201cwork, on average, fewer than 30 hours per week,\u201d according to the budget documents.\n\n\u201cTeachers and state employees have been heavily subsidizing these non-certificated employees for many years,\u2019\u2019 Reese told reporters after the hearing. \u201cThis is not a new issue.\u201d\n\nReese acknowledged that some of these school workers could fall into the \u201ccoverage gap.\u2019\u2019 That means they would make too little income to qualify for the exchange subsidies, but not qualify for Medicaid because Georgia isn\u2019t expanding the program.\n\nThe Community Health budget also includes the projected injection of more than $150 million in federal money for a higher federal matching rate for Medicaid and PeachCare. The two programs are jointly funded by the state and federal governments.\n\nThat federal increase more than offsets the costs that the state attributes to the ACA, said Tim Sweeney, health policy director for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "The state agency that oversees the health care of almost 2.5 million Georgians has drawn sharp questioning over a budget proposal involving a small fraction of them.", "title": "Ga. agency seeks to eliminate health insurance coverage for 'non-certificated' school personnel", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/ga-agency-seeks-to-eliminate-health-insurance-coverage-for-non/article_8f1ceb52-a170-11e4-86a9-df2d2833d62e.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/34/334062b6-4ca6-11e3-8319-001a4bcf6878/5283e7e7ba693.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "local,local,local,local", "news_keywords": "local,local,local,local", "description": "The state agency that oversees the health care of almost 2.5 million Georgians has drawn sharp questioning over a budget proposal involving a small fraction of them."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde198\"", "article_summary": "Reese projected an eventual fiscal 2017 deficit for the State Health Benefit Plan, which covers more than 630,000 state employees, teachers, other school personnel, retirees and dependents.\nThe Department of Community Health\u2019s $13 billion budget for fiscal year 2016 would eliminate health insurance coverage for 11,500 \u201cnon-certificated\u2019\u2019 school personnel, such as bus drivers and cafeteria workers.\nMissing from the Community Health budget is any funding to continue the pay increase for primary care physicians who treat Medicaid patients.\nThe state agency that oversees the health care of almost 2.5 million Georgians has drawn sharp questioning over a budget proposal involving a small fraction of them.\nThe Community Health budget also includes the projected injection of more than $150 million in federal money for a higher federal matching rate for Medicaid and PeachCare."}
