There is no limit to the amount of new government they want to create. And I don't think that's where the American people want this government to go. They're tired of these big-government solutions. Republicans believe in empowering people so that they can pursue their own American dream.\u201d\n\nAllies on the left contend that Sanders\u2019 proposals are affordable and can be funded by targeted tax increases that fall largely on the wealthy and on businesses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that while the Sanders spending proposals are certainly ambitious, there are a range of progressive tax increases that he has historically supported that have the potential to raise lots of money,\u201d said Josh Bivens, director of research and policy at the Economic Policy Institute, which has worked with Sanders on one of his proposals.\n\nSome of the areas Sanders is targeting include:\n\nEducation\n\nSanders would eliminate tuition for the roughly seven million undergraduates at four-year public colleges and universities, where costs have risen significantly since the 1970s.\n\nCurrently, total tuition at public colleges and universities amounts to about $70 billion a year and climbing.\n\nUnder his plan, the federal government would spend $47 billion a year to states to eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees, while the states would pick up the remaining $23 billion. In order to participate in the program, states would have to meet a number of requirements designed to protect students, ensure quality and reduce ballooning costs.\n\nThe legislation would be fully paid for by imposition of a federal \u201cspeculation fee\u201d on Wall Street investment houses, hedge fund and other speculators of 0.5 percent on stock trades, a 0.1 percent fee on bonds and a 0.005 percent fee on derivatives.\n\nSome have estimated this provision could raise hundreds of billions annually which could be used to create millions of jobs as well as subsidize college tuition.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s in details like this where sometimes Sanders\u2019 proposals run into trouble. While some have, indeed, suggested that the potential revenue from taxing financial markets activity is vast, others disagree. The Tax Policy Center last month examined the prospects of a Financial Transaction Tax and determined that, under a best case scenario, it could raise $50 billion per year and would likely raise less.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nSanders has also proposed a major infrastructure stimulus program that would generate 13 million new jobs by spending $1 trillion to improve or rebuild roads, bridges and other transit systems over the next five years.\n\nSander\u2019s so-called \u201cRebuild America Act\u201d is meant to supplement the existing federal highway program, with annual expenditures of about $148 billion on top of the current $50 billion a year in highway spending.\n\nSanders has vigorously championed the idea as part of his plan to battle income inequality and create more jobs for lower- and middle-income workers. His bill makes targeted investments in roads, bridges, transit, passenger and freight rail, water infrastructure, marine ports and inland waterways, national parks, broadband and the electric grid.\n\nOnce again, he shuns the idea of budget cuts in other areas to offset the cost of his program. Instead, he would raise the revenue by closing tax loopholes that enable corporations to park profits overseas and by overhauling taxes on inheritances and the oil, gas and coal industries.\n\nIt\u2019s tricky to make the numbers work here unless you imagine half the Republicans in Congress wake up the day after President Sanders is inaugurated and declare that they are now Democrats.\n\nEstate taxes and treatment of the fossil fuel industry are two of the biggest flash points between the parties. And the likelihood of the Republicans in Congress changing overseas tax laws to orchestrate a windfall for federal spending is vanishingly small.\n\nYouth Unemployment\n\nCalling unemployment among young Americans as a national tragedy, Sanders would create a $5.5 billion fund with $4 billion earmarked for job placement of people between the age of 16 and 24 and $1.5 billion for job training grants.\n\nSanders says it makes far more sense to invest in employment opportunities for young people than continue to spend $70 billion a year on correctional facilities to house young convicts.\n\nThe Department of Labor would provide $4 billion in grants to provide summer and year-round employment opportunities for low-income youth.\n\nAnother $1.5 billion would be allotted for competitive grants for work-based training programs. The measure also would provide training for hundreds of thousands of young Americans who in many cases have finished high school but have no prospects for college or other training and no job opportunities\n\nCuriously, Sanders does not say how he would pay for the program, which is among the smallest he is proposing.\n\nHealth Care\n\nSanders has backed the Affordable Care Act, but also favors adopting a \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d single-payer system that guarantees health care to all Americans as a right.\n\nHe would pay for the program with a higher payroll tax paid by employers and a progressive \u201chealth care income tax\u201d that would hit those earning more than $600,000 the most.\n\nSanders\u2019 home state of Vermont flirted with the idea of adopting a statewide single-payer health care system, but abandoned the effort last December after Gov. Peter Shumlin conceded that he couldn\u2019t come up with a way to pay for it without hurting the state\u2019s economy. The plan had called for a 11.5 percent payroll assessments on businesses and sliding premiums up to 9.5 percent of individuals\u2019 income.\n\nMany of Sanders\u2019 positions are, in effect, symbolic.\n\nHe may well believe in them but they stand little chance of ever becoming the official policy of the U.S. government. Like Sanders\u2019 campaign itself, his proposals are more about sending a message.\n\nOn \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Sanders continued hammering that message home.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying, enough is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not what this country is supposed to be about. We want to be able to send our kids to college, we want to be able to have decent child care, we don't want to be the only major nation on earth that doesn't guarantee family and medical leave \u2026 We want a government that starts representing working families, and not just wealthy campaign donors, which is what we have right now. And I think that's a message that is resonating all across the country.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published by The Fiscal Times.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Rob Garver", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders wants to change everything from education to healthcare.", "title": "Bernie Sanders' big spending plans would radically change the US", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us-2015-7", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55a42cf1eab8ea2a3c1674b6-506-253/bernie-sanders-big-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us.jpg", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics-contributor,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Bernie Sanders, 2016 Elections, The Fiscal Times, Rob Garver", "description": "Bernie Sanders wants to change everything from education to healthcare.", "author": "Rob Garver, The Fiscal Times", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-13", "sailthru.title": "Bernie Sanders' big spending plans would radically change the US", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/55a42ce36bb3f73c52d1c104-50-50/bernie-sanders-big-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us.jpg", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, 2016 Elections, The Fiscal Times, Rob Garver", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55a42ce36bb3f73c52d1c104/bernie-sanders-big-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-07-13", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/rob-garver"}, "sailthru.description": "Bernie Sanders wants to change everything from education to healthcare.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Bernie Sanders wants to change everything from education to healthcare.", "title": "Bernie Sanders' big spending plans would radically change the US", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us-2015-7", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55a42cf1eab8ea2a3c1674b6-1190-625/bernie-sanders-big-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Bernie Sanders' big spending plans would radically change the US", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55a42ce36bb3f73c52d1c104/bernie-sanders-big-spending-plans-would-radically-change-the-us.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics-contributor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaedb\"", "article_summary": "However, Bernie Sanders is nothing if not audacious, as his myriad policy proposals show.\nHowever, it\u2019s in details like this where sometimes Sanders\u2019 proposals run into trouble.\n\"There's no limit to the number of taxes that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton want to raise.\nAppearing on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said Sanders and Clinton are both \"out of step with mainstream America.\nIn fact, it took a certain amount of audacity for Sanders, an avowed socialist, to even enter the race."}
