They must win at least 56 at Coors to be competitive.\n\nI\u2019m not explaining anything you, and the rest of the world (except those in the Rockies\u2019 front office, and back), don\u2019t already know. The club\u2019s owner-president and the executives, including a new general manager (who was mentored by the old general manager), think if you ignore the advantages of, and issues confronting, baseball at attitude, they\u2019ll just not matter. It matters.\n\nTuring, a genius British mathematician, and the code breakers at Bletchley Park, as portrayed in the sensational recent movie, took on a supposedly impossible problem. In World War II, they broke the code for the German Enigma machine.\n\nBaseball, by comparison, is just a game, figured out by Money Ball, Billy Boy, Harvey\u2019s Wallbangers, the Go-Go Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals, a midmarket team, as the Rockies are, who have won more World Series than anybody other than the New York Yankees.\n\nSo, why not the Rockies, who have plenty of money (don\u2019t ever believe that \u201cpoor us\u201d routine, an incredible fan base and an altitude advantage.\n\nBecause the Rockies don\u2019t get it.\n\nThey receive a multitude of recommendations, but they listen to none.\n\nInstead of bringing in the fences at the major leagues\u2019 most expansive outfield \u2014 where singles turn into triples \u2014 and give the Rockies a \u201clarge ball\u201d superiority, they build a tequila party deck. Rather than make the infield slick as an ice rink, they grow the grass as tall as Vanilla Ice\u2019s hair. Instead of, as former major-league shortstop Nomar Garciaparra suggested lasted year, lining the park with giant misting machines to produce artificial humidity, the Brothers Monfort keep lining their pockets.\n\nInstead of refusing to discuss the altitude, the Rockies should promote the uniqueness of Colorado baseball.\n\nThe address of Coors Field should be changed to \u201c5280 Blake Street,\u201d and there should be signs all over the park proclaiming \u201cAltitude & Attitude.\u201d\n\nMore important, though, the Rockies should, like the Aspen Institute, hold a symposium and gather scientists, physicists, mathematicians, engineers, former major-league players and managers, biomechanics and consulting doctors at the U.S. Olympic Committee headquarters in Colorado Springs. And figure out this altitude thing.\n\nWhen Dan O\u2019Dowd came to town in 1999 as the gleaming general manager of the Rockies, the first question I asked him was: \u201cHow will you deal with the altitude?\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand baseball at this altitude. When I was (assistant GM) with Cleveland, I spent a lot of time in Colorado Springs (with the minor-league team). I have a lot of answers.\u201d\n\nThe Rox had four winning seasons in O\u2019Dowd\u2019s 15. He didn\u2019t have answers.\n\nThe new Rockies GM, Jeff Bridich, is a Harvard graduate.\n\nPerhaps he will listen to smart guys who can crack the code of Coors Field and end the enigma.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Rockies going nowhere until they crack code", "title": "Paige: Rockies going nowhere until they crack code", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/04/paige-rockies-going-nowhere-until-they-crack-code/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T18:41:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:46:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd63b2\"", "article_summary": "But herein lies the paradoxical dilemma: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk to the players about the altitude,\u201d Rockies executives always say.\nThe club\u2019s owner-president and the executives, including a new general manager (who was mentored by the old general manager), think if you ignore the advantages of, and issues confronting, baseball at attitude, they\u2019ll just not matter.\nPerhaps he will listen to smart guys who can crack the code of Coors Field and end the enigma.\nBecause the Rockies don\u2019t get it.\nInstead of refusing to discuss the altitude, the Rockies should promote the uniqueness of Colorado baseball."}
