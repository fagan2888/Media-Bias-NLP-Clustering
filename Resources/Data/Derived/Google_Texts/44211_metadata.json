Instead, they snapped photos of one another or took selfies using city buildings as their backdrop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d a man said on one of the mall\u2019s free shuttles. \u201cIt should be snowing money.\u201d\n\nMemories on ice\n\nStaying in a Denver hotel over Christmas during a family trip to Colorado\u2019s high country, Lori Ann Gotchall wasn\u2019t sure where to take her son, daughter and granddaughter for holiday fun.\n\nThe group \u2014 from Manhattan, Kan., and on a memory-making spree to Breckenridge \u2014 was looking to seize every opportunity they could in the big city.\n\nIce skating, Gotchall thought, would do just that.\n\nThe four headed to Skyline Park, off 16th and Arapahoe streets downtown, where they laced up and took their rental skates for a spin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a memory-making holiday,\u201d a beaming Gotchall said as her family stood nearby. \u201cInstead of giving all these gifts that nobody really needs, we\u2019re splurging on memories.\u201d\n\nMarta Crossey, visiting from Albuquerque and also at the rink, had a similar idea.\n\nWith a camera hanging around her neck and an i Phone out to capture the moment, Crossey watched her husband, sister and nieces navigate the ice amid a symphony of Christmas songs. \u201cWe\u2019re just out here enjoying the city,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect day. You can\u2019t feel the cold on a day like today.\u201d\n\nA stranger\u2019s love\n\nClad in a red fleece suit and donning a Santa hat, Michael Thein sat in his wheelchair at 16th and Champa streets with a mission of love.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d he yelled at passers-by as snow fell on his long, gray beard. \u201cNeed a high-five?\u201d\n\nThe formerly homeless man said he was trying to gather money to help buy a new pair of shoes for someone living on the streets. He said his mission began two years after he was able to buy a needy woman boots to replace the worn footwear she was using to trudge through the snow.\n\nHe said he was waiting to collect enough money before picking out a worthy candidate for this generosity.\n\n\u201cWhen I was homeless, I made $500 one Christmas sitting out here,\u201d he said, pausing to high-five a woman. \u201cI used that to buy a hotel for a month. I had enough left over so I could give the rest away.\u201d\n\nA new tradition\n\nIn the Sun Valley neighborhood, near Fairview Elementary School, a new family tradition \u2014 snowball armageddon \u2014 was born on Christmas afternoon for the Ronans. The family elder, Boris Ronan, 62, was covered in so much fresh snow that his grandchildren were calling him \u201cFrosty,\u201d after the snowman with the corncob pipe.\n\nHis four grandchildren, ages 5-10, had never seen snow before Friday. They live in southern Arizona and came to visit their Denver grandparents over the holidays for the first time.\n\nAn epic snowball battle erupted from what was supposed to be the building of a family snowman. The icy war soon grew to involve three generations and a dozen family members while engulfing at least three yards and part of the schoolgrounds.\n\n\u201cIf I ever thaw out, I\u2019ll never forget this,\u201d said Boris Ronan, just after snowball hit him in the back. \u201cThe little ones love it more than I do, but I can\u2019t run or throw like they do.\u201d\n\nThat prompted Esmeralda Ronan, 9, to offer excitedly: \u201cLet\u2019s do this every Christmas.\u201d\n\nA Jedi night\n\nChristmas came more slowly than usual for a trio of siblings this year, as they waited to see the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. Jeff Oliver, 41, Alan Oliver, 37, and Tina Oliver-Watts, 33, haven\u2019t missed a Christmas-night movie together since they were children.\n\nBoth parents are deceased. Their mom was the last to die, four years ago, but the children have kept the movie-night date each year because their mom insisted as much.\n\nThe first movie they remembered seeing was \u201cErnest Saves Christmas,\u201d which came out in 1988. Alan remembers it because he cried when their parents said no to \u201cDie Hard.\u201d\n\nThis year, there was no argument. The Force was, indeed, with them.\n\nThe siblings, joined by five companions and friends, were at the Century 16 Bel Mar in Lakewood an hour early to see \u201cEpisode VII: The Force Awakens\u201d in 3-D.\n\n\u201cThis stupid family made me wait a week to see it,\u201d joked Tina. \u201cI made everybody get ready early, so we wouldn\u2019t have to miss it if it sells out.\u201d\n\nHoliday glow\n\nAs temperatures sank into the 20s after dark, the red, green and blue lights setting the Denver City and County Building all aglow were lifting holiday spirits anew.\n\nCars streamed by in a procession with children\u2019s faces affixed to backseat windows. And despite the cold, hundreds of people milled around on the plaza to hear the building\u2019s bell tower chime a medley of seasonal favorites, from \u201cHere Comes Santa Claus\u201d to \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.\u201d\n\nAna Espinoza, 67, posed with her children and grandchildren in front of the encased Nativity scene on the front steps.\n\n\u201cIt reminds us,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat comes first at Christmas.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Those braving Denver\u2019s chilly Christmas find joy in each other", "title": "Those braving Denver\u2019s chilly Christmas find joy in each other", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/those-braving-denvers-chilly-christmas-find-joy-in-each-other/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__Skyline_Park_Skatingp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__Skyline_Park_Skatingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T14:04:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:11:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As snow began to fly Friday during Denver\u2019s chilly Christmas, many embraced the cold to find joy in time spent with their families or wandering about.\n\u201cWhen I was homeless, I made $500 one Christmas sitting out here,\u201d he said, pausing to high-five a woman.\n\u201cIf I ever thaw out, I\u2019ll never forget this,\u201d said Boris Ronan, just after snowball hit him in the back.\nThey live in southern Arizona and came to visit their Denver grandparents over the holidays for the first time.\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d he yelled at passers-by as snow fell on his long, gray beard."}
