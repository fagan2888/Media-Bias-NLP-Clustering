(Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\nSTERLING \u2014 Some will transfer on to another school to finish their education; others will head out into the workforce. Either way the 400 graduates of Northeastern Junior College have a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThe college's 71st annual commencement ceremony on Friday started with students proceeding into the Bank of Colorado Events Center to the traditional graduation song, \"Pomp and Circumstance,\" performed by Steven Cordova.\n\nAlumni Mace Bearers Wilmer and Donna Johnson, from the classes of 1950 and 1951, led the students in, along with Faculty/Staff Marshall Connie Henderson.\n\nServing as class escorts were the 2014-15 Associated Student Government officers Denzel Stewart, Olivia Klinzmann and Britten Abbott.

(Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\n\"As we celebrate this milestone today, it's important to remember that we're not done yet. Whether we go into the workforce after this or continue our education, just remember that NJC is a part of you and you are a part of NJC.\"\n\nAfter her speech, several awards were presented, including the Joel Mack Award, which goes to outstanding teachers selected by the student body. Gomez and two other ASG officers, Anna Kindvall and Brooke Miller, presented the award to Cole Briggs, Dr. Scott Thomson and Nate Kelley.\n\nBriggs, the equine management coordinator, ranch horse versatility team coach and sponsor of the equine club, has been at NJC since 2007. He teaches horse training, equine reproduction, equine health and equine science, provides \"great\" professional internships for all of his students and is always available for advising.\n\nSianna Gomez, Associated Student Government, shares a few words of advice with her fellow graduates. (Callie Jones/ Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\n\"His positive attitude and great sense of humor have been a perfect match for NJC,\" Miller said.\n\nThompson, chair of the liberal arts department, teaches a wide range of psychology courses including general psychology, human growth and development and abnormal psychology. Under his leadership the psychology program has grown to be one of the largest programs on campus.\n\n\"He is very popular as an instructor and his classes are always full,\" Kindvall said. \"NJC students and colleagues tend to agree that he is kind, funny, supportive, persuasive and incredibly intelligent.\"\n\nKelley, assistant athletic trainer, serves both student athletes and athletic training students.\n\n\"Students love his ability to make his classes enthusiastic, relevant and hands on,\" Gomez said. \"Students enjoy his teaching style so much they often request him as an instructor. He does a great job maintaining the quality of service to over 100 athletes, while providing invaluable experience and teaching to athletic training students.\"\n\nAfter those awards were presented, Bob Carpio, president of the NJC Alumni Association, gave a few words of advice to the graduates.\n\n\"Live your dreams, make life what you want it, but don't forget that we are all team players in this game of life,\" he told the students. \"Try to fulfill those aspirations and dreams, but please do not do so at the expense of others.\"\n\n\"I would like to wish you all the job satisfaction, but more importantly that your lives are filled with happiness.\"\n\nCarpio then presented the Pride in Association Award, which recognizes a family for their support, dedication and loyalty to NJC over the years, to the Albert and Marjorie Zink family.\n\nLee continued the ceremony, recognizing several students.\n\nThe Charles F.
