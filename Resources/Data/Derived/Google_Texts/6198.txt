Huffington Post Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim stated Ambassador Chris Stevens “took a lot of risks” “And when you take risks like that, you know, terrible things can happen, and that’s what happened here” while discussing Benghazi on Friday’s “McLaughlin Group.”

Grim said, “One thing that hasn’t been talked about at all, by either side here, and I think there’s an obvious reason for it, is, Ambassador Stevens was a particular type of ambassador. And I would say this in the best way possible, he was kind of a cowboy. He was somebody who took a lot of risks and he did so knowingly. He wanted the US image in Libya to be one that was fearless and upfront. He would go jogging around Benghazi without any security protection. He was trying to let the local people there know, you know, that he didn’t look at them as enemies. And when you take risks like that, you know, terrible things can happen, and that’s what happened here. But Hillary Clinton doesn’t want to raise that issue, because then it sounds like you’re blaming him for what happened.”
