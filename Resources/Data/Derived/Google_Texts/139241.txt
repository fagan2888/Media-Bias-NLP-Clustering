These animals are not well-known. But they’re real … and they’re fabulous.

1. Desert rain frog

This adorable species of frog is native to South Africa and Namibia. As a mating call, the frog can emit a very high-pitched whistle, making it look and sound like some kind of squeak toy. They are currently considered vulnerable, with their population experiencing a decline due to extensive mining.

https://www.thedodo.com/rhino-horn-trade-spike-crime-873580449.html Like the desert rain frog, the prehensile-tailed porcupine has a uniquely adorable squeak (this guy sounds like a bicycle horn). Found throughout South America, these amazing critters have muscular, prehensile tails that allow them to move through trees.

3. Solenodon

Contrary to his appearance, the solenodon is not a rat or a shrew who’s had his nose pinched too hard; they belong to their own genus, and were discovered way back in 1833. The solenodon can survive on a number of different foods including worms, reptiles and insects.

4. Beelzebub’s tube-nosed bat

Looking more like a fuzzy refrigerator magnet than an agent of Satan, the Beelzebub’s tube-nosed bat is a relatively new discovery who was found in Vietnam in 2011. Although the bat usually shies away from humans, he can get pretty feisty when confronted with a predator!
