That\u2019s because while getting back to work right after giving birth is unnatural and inhumane, the U.S. doesn\u2019t mandate female employees paid maternity leave.\n\nThat\u2019s right: the U.S. is the only country aside from Papua New Guinea that doesn\u2019t guarantee women paid maternity leave. According to the law, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), women are given only 12 weeks of unpaid leave. This leaves many mothers (especially those with low-income jobs at companies that offer no leave benefits) with a difficult decision: stay with their babies or lose their jobs?\n\nA new Economist video brings up yet another question about paid leave in the U.S.: shouldn\u2019t fathers get paid paternity leave as well?\n\nLeave for both parents would certainly be a step forward for gender equality \u2014 and also be a big help for women, who could go back to work first if they so choose. Currently, 96 countries offer guaranteed paid leave for both parents; and nine countries, including the U.S., doesn\u2019t offer it to either. Most European and Scandinavian countries lead the way here, with many of them offering women up to 52 weeks or more of paid leave \u2014 and fathers over 14 weeks.\n\nThe Economist video discusses the benefits of paternity leave: For example, paternity leave improves children\u2019s performance in secondary school, especially for girls. Scientists have also found that fathers who are given the chance to get close with their newborns during the first few weeks and months sets the stage for the rest of their childhoods; they are more likely to take an active role in childhood tasks later on, according to a study cited.\n\nPaternity leave will give fathers the ability to take charge of some of the home duties when a kid is born. \u201cIt made me familiar and comfortable with doing the work of caring for her and created a valuable bond of trust between us,\u201d Wessel van den Berg of Cape Town, South Africa, told NPR about his fatherly duties.\n\nIf you\u2019re angry about these U.S. laws as much as we are, watch John Oliver\u2019s rant on paid family leave below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "why, america, should, give, maternity, leave, mothers, and, paternity, leave, fathers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In America, there is no mandated paid maternity or paternity leave, but both are beneficial to child development.", "title": "Why Fathers Should Get Paternity Leave, Too [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/why-america-should-give-maternity-leave-mothers-and-paternity-leave-fathers-334072", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/19/father-and-baby_2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In America, there is no mandated paid maternity or paternity leave, but both are beneficial to child development.", "title": "Why Fathers Should Get Paternity Leave, Too [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/why-america-should-give-maternity-leave-mothers-and-paternity-leave-fathers-334072", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/19/father-and-baby_2.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/19/father-and-baby_2.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-05-19T14:07:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-19T14:26:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In America, there is no mandated paid maternity or paternity leave, but both are beneficial to child development."}, "article_summary": "The Economist video discusses the benefits of paternity leave: For example, paternity leave improves children\u2019s performance in secondary school, especially for girls.\nA new Economist video brings up yet another question about paid leave in the U.S.: shouldn\u2019t fathers get paid paternity leave as well?\nPaternity leave will give fathers the ability to take charge of some of the home duties when a kid is born.\nCurrently, 96 countries offer guaranteed paid leave for both parents; and nine countries, including the U.S., doesn\u2019t offer it to either.\nThat\u2019s right: the U.S. is the only country aside from Papua New Guinea that doesn\u2019t guarantee women paid maternity leave."}
