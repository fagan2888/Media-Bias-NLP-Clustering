Hijrah basically means migration. Alhamdulillah, Praise God.\n\nThey, along with 292 others aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, didn\u2019t make it.\n\nThe family traveled a lot. Ms. Ghazalee\u2019s husband, Tambi Jiee, worked for Shell in Kazakhstan and three of the children \u2013 two boys named Afzal and Afruz and a girl, Azmeena \u2013 had gone to school there. The eldest, Afif, studied at Taylor University in Kuala Lumpur. He had joined his siblings and parents for a vacation in Europe before they headed home to Malaysia.\n\nA statement on Taylor University\u2019s website confirmed Afif was on the doomed flight. The 19-year-old had completed his foundation in Natural and Built Environments at the university\u2019s Lakeside Campus and was enrolled to study for a Bachelor of Science in Architecture at the same campus from August.\n\nThe second-eldest son, 17-year-old Afzal, lived with the rest of the family in Kazakhstan, in the city of Atyrau near the northern shores of the Caspian Sea. He was sad to leave. \u201cTwo-and-a-half years ago, I had no problem moving here, knowing that I could and would always visit home; but now that I\u2019m about to move back, unfortunately it seems like I\u2019m never going to come back here, at least not in the near future,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt has been one heck of a journey (admittedly not an action-pack one, but still an unforgettable one). Before it gets too cheesy, I just want to thank everyone who made it bearable for me to live here and for sharing with me amazing memories to reminisce on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe youngest member of the family, 13-year-old Afruz, had been affected by the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. He\u2019d chosen a cartoon of the aircraft, which was lost in March and still hasn\u2019t been found, as his Facebook cover picture. His photo collection, filled with cartoons, included a drawing of hands reaching to the missing plane with the words, \u201cPlease come back.\u201d\n\nAfruz loved his cats and was a soccer fan. He liked Manchester United and was confident that Germany would win the World Cup. Earlier this month, as he left Kazakhstan, Afruz wrote that his time in the country, from Jan. 4, 2012, to July 4, 2014, had been the greatest years of his life. \u201cGoodbye Atyra, Kazakhstan\u2026. Goodbye friends, nice knowing u guys\u2026 Goodbye cats, Hope u\u2019ll get a new kind owner\u2026 please don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nHis sister, Marsha Azmeena, studied at the QSI International School of Atyrau, part of a chain of schools in 27 countries. Her most recent Facebook post was a news clip about violence in Gaza. Prior to that, she wrote a short poem for her father for Father\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so lucky as can be, the world\u2019s greatest dad belongs to me. Happy Father\u2019s Day! I love you Tambi Jiee.\u201d\n\nMr. Tambi\u2019s Facebook page is filled with photos of him and his family. The latest shows them posing together by Titisee Lake in southern Germany. Another is of his wife and children laughing in a waterfall at Sungai Klah Hot Springs, about 150 miles north of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nShell Malaysia said Friday that staff and family members were on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, but it didn\u2019t release any names. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this tragic loss of our colleagues and friends,\u201d the company said.\n\nMs. Ghazalee\u2019s cousin Noraini Hol was at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Friday. \u201cWe hope MAS (Malaysia Airlines) can find the bodies quickly,\u201d she said. Ms. Hol\u2019s son, Azfar Aza, was also there.\n\n\u201cMy mum can\u2019t believe it happened. It is not a normal way for people to die,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013Celine Fernandez contributed to this article.\n\n[View the story \"Facebook Tells Story of One Family on Malaysia Airlines Flight #MH17\" on Storify]\n\n\u2013 Storify by Elana Zak.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Ariza Ghazalee\u2019s final post on Facebook was a picture of 15 pieces of luggage on a sidewalk about to be loaded into a car that would take her family to Schiphol Airport for the flight to Malaysia and a new life.
