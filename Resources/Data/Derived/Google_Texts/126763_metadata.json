She lists her \u201cfour big fights\u201d: rebuilding the economy, strengthening families, stripping dysfunction from government, and protecting the country from security threats.\n\nFrom that framework, one issue not frequently discussed in presidential politics keeps coming to Clinton\u2019s attention: mental health and substance abuse.\n\nShe heard about it last week in Iowa in Council Bluffs, and in Davenport, she said. And on Monday, at a \u201croundtable\u201d here in New Hampshire, Clinton discussed the issue a third time, promising to make it \u201ca big part of [her] campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people are thinking, Well, that\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem. That\u2019s not my problem. And indeed, it is all of our problem,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away.\u201d\n\nAt the event \u2014 a panel-like discussion at Whitney Brothers, a small, family-owned business in Keene \u2014 several of the roundtable participants told Clinton they viewed mental health problems, including substance abuse, as a leading concern.\n\nPam Livengood, an assembler at Whitney Brothers, raised the issue. There is a \u201cgrowing drug problem\u201d in the area, said Livengood, citing a personal example \u2014 a struggling family member. \u201cThere are very limited resources here. And we\u2019d like to see something in that respect. Do you have any further ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I do actually,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI am really concerned, because, Pam, what you just told me, I\u2019m hearing from a lot of different people.\u201d\n\nClinton, who announced her campaign for president just over a week ago, said substance problems persist as an \u201cincreasing problem\u201d but have become less visible. Treatment programs, Clinton added, have also seen \u201csteady cutbacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a quiet epidemic,\u201d said Clinton.\n\nLater Monday, at a house party in Claremont, Clinton told a crowd of about 50 people how much Livengood\u2019s comment had resonated. \u201cIf I were just to read briefing books or I were just to engage in the political back-and-forth,\u201d she said, \u201cwould I have heard what a big problem mental health is in New Hampshire?\u201d\n\nThe roundtables \u2014 the campaign\u2019s main event format during a period aides have called the \u201cramp-up\u201d phase \u2014 may inform policies Clinton introduces later this year. She has said she hopes to \u201cembed\u201d voters\u2019 ideas directly into her agenda.\n\nIn Iowa, voters expressed unease in particular about shuttered in-patient facilities. \u201cI literally heard from one end of the state, to Davenport to Council Bluffs, about this problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was nowhere for people to be sent.\u201d\n\nThe roundtable in Keene, attended by about a dozen local Democrats, was meant to concentrate on the first of Clinton\u2019s four \u201cfights\u201d: the economy.\n\nBut after Livengood, a Keene resident, brought up mental health, Clinton spent a considerable chunk of time discussing the issue with several other panelists.\n\nShe praised the measure in the Affordable Care Act that requires most health insurance plans to cover mental health and substance services. But she said lawmakers have to \u201cdo more,\u201d and called for a \u201cconcerted policy\u201d at the \u201cnational, state, local\u201d levels, and across the public and private sectors.\n\nClinton also framed the problem as a particularly troubling one for local communities. New Hampshire, as well as other northeastern states, has notably faced an increase in heroin abuse in recent years.\n\nState Sen. Molly Kelly, who supported Clinton in 2008 and was in the audience on Monday, said the issue was salient on a \u201clocal, state, and national\u201d level.\n\nAnd in Keene, said Kelly, \u201cit\u2019s an issue that people really bring up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3757933, "userid": 230577}, "description": "Hillary Clinton calls for \"concentrated policy\" on local, state, and national levels. \"This is not something we can just brush under the...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
