This safety net has provided low-income people with quality HIV care for many years, said John Peller, vice president of policy for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.\n\nBut a paradigm shift in how Americans access healthcare has groups representing doctors who treat people with HIV on high alert.\n\nHealthcare reform has been fueled by a desire to cut costs. For people living with an illness that requires a lifetime of medications and specialized care, some policy shifts could curtail HIV treatment.\n\nThe HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) and the American Academy of HIV Medicine (AAHIVM) released guidelines this month urging insurance plans to adopt policies to prevent that from happening. Dr. David Hardy, a Los Angeles doctor who sits on the boards of both organizations, told Healthline the groups want to stave off any changes that could lead to the use of less-than-ideal HIV medications.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, the pharmaceutical [companies] have done a great job with the medications that keep people alive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are easy to take and non-toxic, but very few are generic. We want to make sure the Affordable Care Act does not end up ignoring the data and research that points to preferred regimens.\u201d\n\nThe groups have expressed concern that restrictive drug formularies from insurance companies could result in older, less effective medications being substituted for new ones with far fewer side effects.\n\n\u201cAs recognized by Medicare and other third-party payers, antiretroviral medications are not interchangeable and substitutions cannot be made even within drug class,\u201d the guidelines state. \u201cProviders and their patients must have access to the full range of biomedical tools available to suppress this infectious and deadly virus.\u201d\n\nLearn More: Busting HIV Transmission Myths \u00bb\n\nA resurgence in patients' viral load can not only lead to poor individual health outcomes, but also present a public health hazard. The chances of passing along the virus to another person increase along with viral load.\n\n\u201cThis really is a seismic shift in how people with HIV get coverage,\u201d Peller told Healthline. \u201cWe need to make sure that what's on paper matches up to the reality and there aren't barriers in place that ultimately are going to worsen individual care or the public health by leading to new HIV transmissions. Market-based plans reporting to Wall Street do not have the public health interest foremost in their minds when they report to shareholders.\u201d\n\nBenefits Vary by State and Insurer\n\nAIDS Foundation of Chicago runs a comprehensive website, HIVHealthReform.org, that helps patients navigate the new laws. The site offers specific information for each state because benefits vary widely.\n\nIn some states, like California, people with HIV can make as much as $50,000 per year and still receive assistance for medications under the federally funded AIDS Drug Assistance Program, Hardy said. In other states, like Texas, a person cannot make more than $22,000 to qualify, Peller added.\n\nAntiretroviral medications need to be affordable as well as accessible. Without insurance, the medications can cost about $2,000 a month. So a 10 percent co-pay, as opposed to a flat co-pay, results in a $200 monthly out-of-pocket expense, on top of a monthly insurance premium and office visit co-pays.\n\nSome policies don't cover single-tablet drug regimens, which are easier to tolerate and easier for patients to manage, or they may require a 50 percent co-pay, Hardy said.\n\nExplore the Most Important Parts of the Affordable Care Act \u00bb\n\nDoctor Consistency Is Key\n\nBut it's not just about getting access to the life-saving medications. It's also important for patients to continue to see qualified doctors who can prescribe them, Hardy said. The guidelines urge insurers to allow HIV providers to double as primary care doctors. \u201cHIV [care] is not something that can be done by any doctor, unfortunately,\u201d Hardy said.\n\nAnother concern is that HMO-style plans may force people with HIV to go to a primary care doctor and pay a co-pay just to be referred to an HIV specialist.\n\n\u201cIt makes absolutely no sense for a plan to put administrative barriers in place that could ultimately cause somebody to just drop out of care,\u201d Peller said. \u201cIt's just a waste of resources.\u201d\n\nPeople with HIV in Chicago have six Medicaid managed care plans to choose from, but there are no reporting requirements for patient outcomes. Peller said the plans should be required to report the number of patients they treat who have an undetectable viral load. \u201cWhat carrots and sticks are in place to make sure those plans are focusing on providing HIV care and also protecting public health?\u201d he said.\n\nIn March, AIDS Foundation of Chicago plans to launch a nationwide monitoring project to get to the bottom of HIV access problems under the new laws. \u201cWhen somebody has trouble accessing meds or has a ridiculous co-pay, we want to know about it,\u201d Peller said.\n\nIn the meantime, he urges people with HIV to get navigation assistance when they sign up for a new health plan.\n\nVisit Healthline's HIV/AIDS Learning Center \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/hiv-nearly-50000-hiv-patients-to-gain-coverage-this-year-021014", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, private health insurance, insurance plan, formulary, antiretroviral drugs, co-pay, deductible", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Experts hope the changes brought by the ACA will be positive, but they've identified potential problems for HIV patients under new private insurance plans.", "title": "Nearly 50,000 HIV Patients Will Gain Coverage Under Obamacare, Medicaid", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/hiv-nearly-50000-hiv-patients-to-gain-coverage-this-year-021014", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/hiv/insurance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/hiv/insurance.jpg", "description": "Experts hope the changes brought by the ACA will be positive, but they've identified potential problems for HIV patients under new private insurance plans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nearly 50,000 HIV Patients Will Gain Coverage Under Obamacare, Medicaid"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-10", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Experts hope the changes brought by the ACA will be positive, but they've identified potential problems for HIV patients under new private insurance plans."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd037\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHIV [care] is not something that can be done by any doctor, unfortunately,\u201d Hardy said.\nIn March, AIDS Foundation of Chicago plans to launch a nationwide monitoring project to get to the bottom of HIV access problems under the new laws.\nThis safety net has provided low-income people with quality HIV care for many years, said John Peller, vice president of policy for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.\n\u201cIt's just a waste of resources.\u201dPeople with HIV in Chicago have six Medicaid managed care plans to choose from, but there are no reporting requirements for patient outcomes.\n\u201cIt makes absolutely no sense for a plan to put administrative barriers in place that could ultimately cause somebody to just drop out of care,\u201d Peller said."}
