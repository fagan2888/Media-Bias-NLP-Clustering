But as the price of health care continues to rise, employers are making changes that can impact both your costs and access to care.\n\n\u201cI would say in particular this is a year to pay attention to annual enrollment,\u201d says Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit association that represents large companies.\n\nHere are six health benefit changes to watch for in your work-based health insurance benefits for 2015.\n\n1. Higher out-of-pocket costs. Insurance premiums \u2013 the cost of your health plan that\u2019s typically deducted from your paycheck \u2013 will go up in 2015, though at a lower rate than in years past.\n\nAccording to an annual survey by the NBGH, large employers are projecting an average increase in costs of 6.5 percent in 2015. However, by making changes to health benefits, costs are expected to rise by just 5 percent.\n\nNext year, many companies are shifting costs to workers in the form of higher deductibles, copays and co-insurance. And, according to Marcotte, more employees can expect to see \u201cconsumer-directed health plans\u201d, among their options for coverage. These policies generally have lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles \u2013 cash you\u2019ll have to pay for care before getting any help from insurance.\n\nIn fact, according to NBGH\u2019s annual report, 57 percent of large employers are offering high-deductible plans for 2015; nearly one-third of companies (32 percent) are making these plans the only option. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 50 percent as compared with this year.\n\nIf you don\u2019t go to the doctor much, you may be able to save with a high-deductible plan, which reduces the amount of money that comes out of your paycheck, says Michael Thompson, a health care consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. If you go for care frequently, however, you may do better with a plan that pays for more costs up-front.\n\nMost important, Thompson says, is to understand what the worst case financial scenario is with any plan you choose. \u201cLook at the maximum out-of-pocket expenses, and ask can I afford that. That\u2019s a very important consideration for anybody. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with the level of risk, go with a plan with a higher premium,\u201d and lower out-of-pocket costs, he says.\n\n2. Changing networks. Changes to provider networks are common from year to year, so you should always check to make sure your doctors participate in the plans you're selecting.\n\nAbout one-fourth of employers include a plan with narrow provider networks \u2013 those with fewer doctors that participate with the plan. About half of those firms offer employees incentives to join plans with narrow provider networks, according to the NBGH survey.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to know who is in the network because health plans will always pay much more generously toward in-network services,\u201d Thompson says.\n\nAnother growing trend among employers is to encourage the use of telemedicine and retail health clinics located in grocery stores or pharmacies. These alternatives to the doctor\u2019s office allow you to get quick, convenient care for minor ailments, often at a lower cost.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Even if heart disease runs in your family, you can take steps to dramatically reduce your risk.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Watch for higher out-of-pocket costs, changing networks and more.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Lisa Zamosky", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Watch for higher out-of-pocket costs, changing networks and more.", "title": "6 Changes in Work-Based Health Insurance Benefits", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/10/24/6-changes-in-work-based-health-insurance-benefits", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7a/d5/5eee4b544e7a8f5c7d268b5122fd/140926-moneymedicine-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "6 Changes in Work-Based Health Insurance Benefits - US News", "description": "Watch for higher out-of-pocket costs, changing networks and more.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],health insurance,health savings accounts,Affordable Care Act,HealthNews [Consumer Advice],Lisa Zamosky", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z3rxft", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-10-24", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-10-24"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a73ac02/2147483647/crop/322x322%2B135%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F7a%2Fd5%2F5eee4b544e7a8f5c7d268b5122fd%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140926-moneymedicine-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "job-based insurance, work-based insurance, open enrollment, health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1797\"", "article_summary": "Here are six health benefit changes to watch for in your work-based health insurance benefits for 2015.\nIf you\u2019re among the 149 million Americans who get health insurance at work, now may be the time to select your health insurance coverage options for 2015.\nAnd, according to Marcotte, more employees can expect to see \u201cconsumer-directed health plans\u201d, among their options for coverage.\nBut as the price of health care continues to rise, employers are making changes that can impact both your costs and access to care.\nHowever, by making changes to health benefits, costs are expected to rise by just 5 percent."}
