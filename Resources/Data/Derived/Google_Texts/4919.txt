Soon in Barbour County you won't have to go far to get counseling.



Belington Medical Clinic is about to start offering behavioral health services. It's thanks to a grant from the Affordable Care Act that's going to 6 different health centers in the state. For Belington, Chief Executive Officer Eric Ruf says they saw a need for behavioral health services in the community.



"What we made an application for was to use those dollars to hire a psychologist and a master's level counselor as well as a support person for them," Ruf explained. "And create a behavioral health department here within the Belington Clinic to provide counseling services."



Ruf says they will also hire a health educator to help patients or anyone in the community with specific or group health issues.
