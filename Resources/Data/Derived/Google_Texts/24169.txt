Commerce City police are asking the public’s help to find a driver who shot an officer in the torso during a traffic stop about 7:10 a.m. Sunday.

The officer’s ballistic vest stopped the bullet and he is being treated for non-life threatening injuries, police commander Dennis Moon said.

The officer shot at the suspect as he fled the 9700 block of Peoria Street in a vehicle that police believe was a Nissan Pathfinder, with a license plate number of 679UNZ, or 697UNZ.

The vehicle may have minor damage to the right rear bumper, as well as damage from the shots fired by the officer.

Police are looking for a man in his late 40s, or early 50s, with brown hair. He is thin and was wearing glasses and a black and white scarf around his neck.

Information about the vehicle and suspect came from the officer’s report when he initially stopped the vehicle.

“Detectives are speaking with the officer to get more detail about what led up to the contact. It was a traffic stop, but there were many situations that could apply to the stop,” Moon said.

Police have requested assistance of the Adams County Sheriff’s Office.

Anyone with information should call 911 or contact the Commerce City police at 303-289-3626.

“Anybody who sees the vehicle should contact local law enforcement,” Moon said.

It has been about eight years since a Commerce City police officer was shot, and wounded, Moon said.
