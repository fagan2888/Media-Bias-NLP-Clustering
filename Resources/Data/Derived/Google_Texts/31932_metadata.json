But if you buy a stand-alone dental plan, the most you'll pay, excluding monthly premiums, is $700 per year per person. If you buy a medical plan with embedded pediatric dental coverage, your combined medical and dental out-of-pocket maximum, will be limited to no more than $6,350 per person annually.\n\nUnderstanding and implementing the regulations under the Affordable Care Act are confusing enough without the pediatric dental mandate to chew on, some observers say. While providers and dental insurers cautiously support the increased emphasis on children's oral health, they worry parents and others will have a hard time making sense of them.\n\nEmployers scrambling\n\nEmployers in the small group market, or those who employ fewer than 50, are scrambling to make sure they're ACA-compliant by offering dental coverage, Oklahoma City employee benefit consultant Cher Bumps said.\n\n\u201cEmployers don't have to change their plans and cover dental,\u201d Bumps said. \u201cBut they have to make the coverage available, and it's up to the employee whether or not they buy it.\u201d\n\nInsurers are required to have \u201creasonable assurance\u201d if someone waives dental coverage that they have the mandated pediatric dental coverage elsewhere, Bumps said. She said Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma is having employees who waive dental coverage sign affidavits.\n\nJohn Gladden, president and chief executive of Delta Dental of Oklahoma, believes that under the new mandate, children will be more likely to receive preventive and restorative care.\n\n\u201cAnd if more kids get to the dentist, that's super,\u201c Gladden said. Only about half of Oklahomans have dental insurance, and Delta Dental covers about half of those who do, or 800,000, he said.\n\n\u201cBut the new mandate is so swishy and flexible that it might be difficult to manage,\u201d Gladden said.\n\nLimit opens possible abuse\n\nThe potential difficulty comes because on-exchange, stand-alone plans are required to carry a maximum out-of-pocket limit of $700 per person per year. \u201cAnything past that is paid at 100 percent, so the sky's the limit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when there are no limits, there's an opportunity for abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour dentist could tell you that you need $5,000 worth of work, and you could go out and buy insurance after he's told you that. It's like buying fire insurance after your house burns.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the new laws can cause further conflict and confusion, he said, because the pediatric mandate covers only orthodontics or wisdom teeth removal that is \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d he said. Consumers, he said, mistakenly may think the dental plan they buy covers braces, or removal of their child's wisdom teeth versus only those teeth currently causing problems.\n\nThe pediatric dental mandate will be an actuarial experiment, Gladden said. \u201cOnly time will tell if people who have low utilization of services will generate enough premium to cover those with higher utilization,\u201d he said.\n\nExchange costs more\n\nBecause of the maximum out-of-pocket limit, dental insurance bought inside the exchange costs more than insurance bought outside the exchange or through employers, Gladden said. For example, policies bought on deltadentalok.org run from $25 to $40 per individual per month, Gladden said, while on-exchange rates are \u201ccoming in north of that,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of Friday, reports showed Delta Dental had 60 enrollees in its on-exchange plans, but the company could confirm only six of those, Gladden said. Aside from its own stand-alone plans, Delta Dental will be the administrator of the pediatric dental coverage embedded in the on-exchange health insurance plans of CommunityCare and GlobalHealth Inc., he said.\n\nBroader coverage\n\nTim Fagan, a pediatric dentist in Enid and president of the Oklahoma Dental Association, is excited about the prospect of more children with dental coverage. \u201cBut we'll have to wait and see how it all shakes out,\u201d Fagan said.\n\nThe American Dental Association estimates 8.7 million children could gain extensive dental benefits by 2018, but more than 3 million of that number is because of Medicaid expansion under the ACA and \u201cOklahoma, because it chose not to expand Medicaid, is losing out in that regard,\u201d Fagan said.\n\nMoreover, because of the state's increase in per capita income, Oklahoma in October will receive tens of millions of dollars less for Medicaid, which will put existing pediatric dental services in \u201cserious jeopardy,\u201d Fagan said. But Oklahoma Health Care Authority spokeswoman Jennie Melendez said Tuesday the agency so far isn't planning to cut services.\n\nMeanwhile, Variety Care nonprofit community health clinic \u2014 which serves some 60,000 uninsured, working poor on a sliding scale basis \u2014 this week broke ground on an 8,000-square-foot, $4.3 million, expansion to its six-chair dental center at Straka Family Health Center in south Oklahoma City. Upon completion, the center will feature 21 chairs, with six focused on pediatric dental care.\n\n\u201cIt was a wise decision by the ACA to involve oral health care early,\u201d Variety Care Chief Executive Lou Carmichael said. \u201cSo much of what we see in third-graders \u2014 from decaying teeth to gum disease \u2014 could be prevented with education and care, and save billions of dollars,\u201d Carmichael said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurers, employers scramble to comply with health reform and offer dental insurance.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
