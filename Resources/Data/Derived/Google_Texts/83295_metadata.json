Amidst the chaos of yesterday\u2019s GOP debate in Las Vegas, it was Congress that was quietly gambling away our future. Washington Republicans announced a massive bipartisan budget deal that preserves ObamaCare, funds Planned Parenthood, solidifies Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, and allows the White House to accept thousands of unvetted Syrian refugees.\n\nHuckabee went on, to blast politicians in Washington.\n\nAmericans are sick and tired of the political theatre that passes for productivity in Washington,\u201d he charged. \u201cWith billions in handouts to Hollywood and America\u2019s enemies, this $1.1 trillion deal adds billions of dollars to our $18.5 trillion national debt and continues our country on a path to ruin.
