(PAT GROSSMITH/UNION LEADER) With a national debt clock at $18,416,169,278,121 - and counting upwards - as a backdrop, two-term Ohio Gov. and Republican Presidential hopeful John Kasich holds a town hall Friday with the Manchester business community. (PAT GROSSMITH/UNION LEADER)\n\nKasich: Business regulation review, balanced budget needed\n\n\n\n\u2014 With a backdrop of a national debt clock at $18,416,169,278,121 that's counting upwards, two-term Ohio Gov. and Republican Presidential hopeful John Kasich held a town hall Friday with the Manchester business community, saying he would get the nation to a balanced budget within eight years if he is elected President.\n\n\n\nKasich addressed a small, packed room in the historic Carpenter building with the event billed as a \u201cBalanced Budget Town Hall & Discussion with Business Leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe proposed a plan that calls for the reduction of individual and business taxes, cutbacks to both Medicare and Medicaid, with only the military seeing a budget increase over eight years.\n\n\n\nKasich said he believes those changes would result in a balanced budget through economic growth, which would offset the tax cuts. He said he would shift federal programs \u2013 104 from the U.S. Department of Education alone \u2013 back to the states and review all regulations affecting businesses with an eye towards eliminating those that are small-business killers.\n\n\n\nKasich said the budget must be balanced because continuing to operate with a federal deficit results in a slowed economy and currency devaluation.\n\n\n\nCurrently, he said, the debt amounts to $57,204 per citizen.\n\n\n\nOne man asked him what he would do about Obamacare, saying there was a local sheet metal company that had 49 employees and could hire 10 more, but the cost of the Affordable Care Act was holding it back.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would repeal Obamacare,\u201d Kasich said, although he then acknowledged that he couldn't do it as President.\n\n\n\nHe said, however, he would push Obamacare changes through Congress, which he says is something Congress wants but needs a leader to show them how to do it.\n\n\n\nKasich is open to campaign finance reform, he told one individual, but said he doesn't \u201cgive a rip\u201d who gives him money for his campaign.\n\n\n\nDonors, he said, have no influence on him. He said when he was in Washington, a lot of people didn't like him but now, when he goes there, they do, because they know he can get things done.\n\n\n\nJeanne Peschier, 53, of Manchester, asked questions concerning poverty and why politicians aren't talking about it.\n\n\n\nShe said she wants to work but has health problems and, because she is partially disabled, she cannot collect Social Security disability. She asked Kasich to commit to having the U.S. funding the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria.\n\n\n\nKasich said he wasn't going to do that, because he doesn't know enough about it.\n\n\n\nShe asked him why he wasn't in the lead in Presidential polling.\n\n\n\nKasich said he is doing well in New Hampshire and come February, the numbers will show that.\n\n\n\n\"I need you to help,\" he told Peschier. But she told him since he couldn't commit to her, she was unable to commit to him.\n\n\n\n\"Well, then, good luck with President Trump,\" Kasich quipped, drawing laughter.\n\n\n\nPeschier, after the event, said she has lived on $12,000 a year in the poorest area of the city, where people have been stabbed and shot. She said politicians need to address the issue of poverty, especially how it affects children.\n\n\n\nKasich, asked how he thought Hillary Clinton did before the congressional committee on Benghazi, said he couldn't comment about it because he hadn't watched it.\n\n\n\nHe said he had been busy campaigning in the Granite State.\n\n\n\nTo improve the chance of seeing your comment posted here or published in the New Hampshire Union Leader:\n\n\n\nIdentify yourself.
