By law, intelligence officials are required to notify Congress if they intentionally give reporters classified information.\n\nBut the NSA said it couldn't tell Aftergood what it had told other reporters.\n\nIn denying the request, the spy agency pointed to a section of a 2009 executive order that allows the agency to classify documents that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security\u201d if made public.\n\nAdditionally, the spy agency is legally authorized to \u201cprotect certain information concerning its activities,\u201d it said, which the list of authorized leaks would compromise.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Aftergood criticized the agency\u2019s secrecy.\n\n\u201cThe notion of an authorized disclosure of classified information is close to being a contradiction in terms,\" he wrote. \"If something is classified, how can its disclosure be authorized (without declassification)? And if something is disclosed by an official who is authorized to do so, how can it still be classified? And yet, it seems that there is such a thing.\"\n\nAftergood appealed the denial this week.\n\n\u201cIt is well established that information, including classified information, that has been publicly disclosed on an authorized basis loses its exemption from disclosure under FOIA,\u201d he argued.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The NSA is refusing to release a list of classified information that was given to reporters.", "description": "The NSA is refusing to release a list of classified information that was given to reporters.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The NSA is refusing to release a list of classified information that was given to reporters.", "title": "NSA: List of official leaks to the media is classified", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220254-nsa-list-of-authorized-leaks-is-classified", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-09T13:40:38-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-10-09T13:40-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220254-nsa-list-of-authorized-leaks-is-classified", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-09T10:57-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Freedom of Information Act, National Security Agency,Steven Aftergood,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-09T10:57:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T13:40:38-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/220254-nsa-list-of-authorized-leaks-is-classified", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The NSA is refusing to release a list of classified information that was given to reporters.", "card": "summary", "title": "NSA: List of official leaks to the media is classified"}, "dcterms.title": "NSA: List of official leaks to the media is classified"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e62\"", "article_summary": "The National Security Agency is refusing to release a list of classified information that was deliberately leaked to the media.\n\u201cThe notion of an authorized disclosure of classified information is close to being a contradiction in terms,\" he wrote.\nBy law, intelligence officials are required to notify Congress if they intentionally give reporters classified information.\nAdditionally, the spy agency is legally authorized to \u201cprotect certain information concerning its activities,\u201d it said, which the list of authorized leaks would compromise.\n\u201cIt is well established that information, including classified information, that has been publicly disclosed on an authorized basis loses its exemption from disclosure under FOIA,\u201d he argued."}
