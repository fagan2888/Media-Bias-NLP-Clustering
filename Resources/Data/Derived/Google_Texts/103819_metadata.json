John McCain R-Ariz., a war hero and longtime Washington insider, was considered a moderate presidential candidate in 2008 who could lead the party to triumph over upstart Democrat candidate Barack Obama.\n\nThen, in 2012, it was Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts who implemented a precursor to Obamacare as well as same-sex marriage, who was trumpeted as a centrist who would return the GOP to the Oval Office.\n\nSo what will happen when 2016 comes around?\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, says the GOP candidate needs to be a real, genuine, died-in-the-wool conservative.\n\nIn a speech Thursday to the Conservative Political Action Conference, he first made clear he is not running for president in 2016.\n\nBut he emphasized the need for a conservative who has won a significant election and who has stood on principle when push came to shove.\n\n\u201cWhen conservatives elevate unserious presidential candidates \u2013 candidates who are not principled, positive and proven \u2013 it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the establishment\u2019s fault. It\u2019s our fault, and we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nThe senator said he is tired of Republican politicians offering empty platitudes and wants conservative politicians with real policies and real answers.\n\n\u201cPlease help me find that candidate,\u201d Lee implored the crowd.\n\nLee also made it clear that it\u2019s just as important for conservatives to communicate with moderates as it is for moderates to communicate with conservatives. But as they communicate to moderates, conservatives must stay true to their ideals, he said.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session immediately after his speech, Lee said President Obama\u2019s biggest fault has been his seizure of too much executive power.\n\nObama\u2019s use of executive powers is being challenged on a number of fronts, including his de facto amnesty program and changes in the Obamacare law.\n\nLee also reminded attendees that the Founding Fathers created in the Constitution a separation of powers as well as a division of power between the federal government and the states.\n\nThe senator cited the Founding Fathers\u2019 complaints against King George III, subtly suggesting Obama has become too much like the notorious British monarch.\n\n\u201c[The Founders] understood something about power \u2013 that there\u2019s great harm that can come from government if you allow too much power to be concentrated in the hands of one person, or in the hands of a few people,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAmong the possible GOP candidates in 2016 is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has won three elections in recent years and took on the powerful public-sector unions in Wisconsin and won.\n\nAnother is Dr. Ben Carson, the famed surgeon whose popularity skyrocketed when he confronted Obama\u2019s policies in a speech while Obama sat next to him.\n\nAnother is Carly Fiorina, a business executive who would bring to the table the experience of balancing a budget and meeting the needs of a consumer base.\n\nOthers are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Lindsey Graham, New York Gov. George Pataki, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Ambassador John Bolton, Sen. Ted Cruz, Maryland Gov. Bob Ehrlich, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rep. Peter King, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Sen. Rand Paul, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Sen. Marco Rubio, former Sen. Rick Santorum, and business and television personality Donald Trump.\n\nCheck out WND\u2019s extensive coverage of the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference:\n\nScott Walker \u2018wants to make America great again\u2019\n\nSarah Palin: Obama\u2019s VA \u2018killing our veterans\u2019\n\nJindal pounds Common Core in CPAC speech\n\nCruz: Hillary \u2019embodies the corruption of Washington\u2019\n\n\u2018Next 20 months will be very dangerous\u2019\n\nCruz strongly signals presidential bid\n\nChristie: \u2018I gave up the New York Times for Lent\u2019\n\nFiorina argues for woman to take on Hillary", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 Sen.
