Then a small group chanted, \u2018End the Fed! End the Fed!\u2019 The whole crowd took up the call. Many held up burning dollar bills, as if to say to the central bank, you have done enough damage to the American people, our future, and to the world: your time is up. People know. Even people aged 18-21. But, they need someone to put it into words.\u201d \u2014 Ron Paul\n\n\u2014 Senate Democrats quiet on VA secretary\u2019s future: It\u2019s not surprising that most Democrats have chosen to keep quiet about VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, ostensibly endorsing President Obama\u2019s inaction. What is surprising, however, is that vulnerable Senate Democrats, with their political careers and control of the chamber on the line, are towing the party line. \u201cAs of Thursday afternoon, not a single Democratic senator had called for Shinseki\u2019s resignation,\u201d Alexander Bolton writes at The Hill. \u201cAnd Senate Democrats have been slow to embrace House-passed legislation that would give Shinseki the authority to fire senior executives.\u201d Now, Senate Democrats have said that there should be accountability and called for an investigation into the wait times that have led to the deaths of 40 veterans, but the problems at the VA aren\u2019t new, they\u2019ve been around for a while, and this was something President Obama pledged to address when he ran in 2008, and nothing has been done.\n\n\n\n(Credit: Mike Luckovich, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)\n\n\u2014 Jay Rockefeller\u2019s douchebaggery not backed up by Harry Reid: Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), who isn\u2019t seeking reelection this fall, says opposition to Obamacare is because of President Obama\u2019s skin color, sparking a heated argument with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). But Rockefeller\u2019s comments weren\u2019t backed up by Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). \u201cBetween the two of them. I\u2019m staying out of it,\u201d Reid told reporters. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s something I should stay out of and I\u2019m going to.\u201d When Rockefeller made the comments during a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing, Johnson was the only Republican in the room. You can watch the whole thing below. Get popcorn.\n\n\u2014 Sorry, Republicans, Las Vegas is out for 2016: Regardless of what you may think, Las Vegas is a great town. That said, however, Sin City probably isn\u2019t the best place to hold a political convention. \u201cPrior to the site selection committee vote, Cincinnati respectfully withdrew their bid from the process based upon the criteria set forth by the RNC for the main arena,\u201d the Republican National Committee noted in a statement. \u201cLas Vegas also respectfully withdrew their 2016 bid based on the RNC\u2019s criteria for a traditional arena facility and enough on-site preparatory time to accommodate the 2016 convention.\u201d The site of the 2016 Republican National Convention is down to four cities \u2014 Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, and Kansas City. We\u2019re pulling for Denver. No, really, we are, and it\u2019s because we really like the town, not because of that other thing.\n\n\u2014 Milquetoast Freedom Act clears House, Wyden announces opposition: There\u2019s a fight brewing in the Senate over the USA Freedom Act. The House overwhelmingly passed a severely weakened version of the measure yesterday. Not long after, however, a key Senate Democrat announced his opposition to the watered down measure, taking aim at President Obama. \u201cWhile this bill\u2019s authors may not intend for it to be interpreted so broadly, the Executive Branch\u2019s long track record of secretly interpreting surveillance laws in incredibly broad ways makes it clear that vague language is ineffective in restraining the Executive Branch,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said in a statement. \u201cGiven the Executive Branch\u2019s record of consistently making inaccurate public statements about these laws in order to conceal ongoing dragnet surveillance of Americans, it would be na\u00efve to trust the Executive Branch to apply new surveillance laws with restraint.\u201d Wyden says he\u2019ll support the Senate version of the USA Freedom Act, which is currently awaiting action in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\n(Credit: Ron Paul Problems)\n\n\u2014 NBC News scores interview with Edward Snowden: It\u2019s the first time the NSA whistleblower, who was the subject of some House members ire on Thursday, has been interviewed for American television. \u201c[Brian] Williams\u2019 in-person conversation with Snowden was conducted over the course of several hours and was shrouded in secrecy due to Snowden\u2019s life in exile since leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs a year ago,\u201d NBC News notes. \u201cWilliams also jointly interviewed Snowden and journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has reported stories based on the documents in media outlets around the world, about how they came to work together and the global debate sparked by their revelations.\u201d The interview will air in an hour-long primetime special on Wednesday, May 28 at 10 pm.\n\n\u2014 Fifty senators apparently have nothing better to do: Obamacare is still unpopular, the government is spying on its own citizens, and veterans are dying because of long wait times at VA hospitals, so, naturally, 50 Senate Democrats are concerned about the Washington Redskins. \u201cThe N.F.L. can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this name as anything but what it is: a racial slur,\u201d said the letter to Commissioner Roger Goodell. \u201cWe urge the N.F.L. to formally support a name change for the Washington football team.\u201d Whether the name is offensive is not a matter for the members of United States Senate. This should be between the N.F.L., the Washington Redskins\u2019 ownership, and the offended groups, and, like it or not, the team is under no obligation to change its name. The team\u2019s owner, Dan Snyder, has a lot invested into the merchandise and licensing agreements, as long as he\u2019s puts a winning team on the field every Sunday, people will come to the games.\n\n\u2014 Harry Reid\u2019s inconsistency on money in politics: The Senate majority leader isn\u2019t applying the absurd standard he\u2019s set for the Koch brothers to leftist billionaire Tom Steyer, who is investing $100 million to help radical environmentalist Democrats this fall. \u201cWhatever the federal government does, the extremely rich are going to find a way around it. Still, the inconsistency of Reid\u2019s position toward the various players in the game is distasteful,\u201d Charles W. Cooke explains at National Review. \u201cSure, Reid likes Steyer\u2019s politics and he doesn\u2019t like Charles Koch\u2019s. But if the Kochs are \u2018buying American democracy,\u2019 and \u201coverriding the will of the people,\u201d then so is Steyer. If the Kochs are overly represented in the national conversation, then so is Steyer. If the Kochs are attempting to change the makeup of the Senate to reflect their desires and their interests, then so is Steyer.\u201d Steyer has practically bought presidential policy, and, yet, it\u2019s the Koch brothers whom Reid and Senate Democrats are using to try to take away the fundamental right to free speech. Like Cooke says, it\u2019s a matter of consistency. But, then again, we\u2019re talking about Harry Reid.\n\n\u2014 Uh, Hillary Clinton has made a lot of money since leaving State: Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but Clinton isn\u2019t going to see this kind of money sitting in the Oval Office. \u201cSince leaving State, Clinton has made more than 90 speeches and notable appearances. Her hosts have included private equity firms, investment banks, nonprofit galas, trade association conventions, and a slew of colleges and universities. At least two-dozen of those were paid speeches,\u201d Mother Jones reports. \u201cWith her usual fee of $200,000 a speech, Clinton has banked close to $5 million for her speeches and appearances in the last 15 months.\u201d Clinton has always seemed like someone who prefers power and prestige over money. She\u2019s the real life Frank Underwood.\n\n\u2014 Get liberty direct on your iPhone: Cato Institute\u2019s Libertarianism.org has made an app for its Free Thoughts podcast.
