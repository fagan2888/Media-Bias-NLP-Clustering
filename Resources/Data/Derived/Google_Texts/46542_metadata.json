In the grander scheme of things, these incidents are rare. And what\u2019s even rarer is getting video of the entire birth. But that\u2019s exactly what Jonathan Pettijohn did while driving his wife, Lesia, from their home in Lake Jackson, Texas, to a birth center in Houston.\n\nWithin minutes, Lesia went from having contractions, to breaking her water, to giving full-on birth in the passenger seat of the car \u2014 and the entire event was captured on Jonathan\u2019s GoPro camera. Lesia asked Jonathan to film the birth of their 10-pound, 3-ounce baby when she went into labor. They named him Josiah after discovering he was a boy while in the car.\n\n\u201cI was probably freaking out way more than I should have,\u201d Lesia told ABC 13 Houston. \u201cBut I really didn\u2019t want to have him in the car. I was scared. I didn\u2019t know if he would be breathing OK, or if he would need anything else.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Josiah came out screaming. And because he is the couple\u2019s third child, they knew exactly what to do. \u201cHe\u2019s breathing. If he\u2019s crying, he\u2019s breathing, but hold him upside down, babe,\u201d Jonathan says in the video. \u201cHold him upside down and pat him on the booty.\u201d\n\nLesia said Josiah was her fastest birth. Her first two children, both daughters, took \u201cmore than an hour\u201d after her water broke, Jonathan said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "man, records, gopro, video, wife, giving, birth, 10, pound, baby, while, driving, hospital", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Texas woman gave birth to her 10-pound son in her car, and her husband caught the whole thing on video.", "title": "This Woman Gave Birth To 10-Pound Baby In Her Car [GRAPHIC VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/man-records-gopro-video-wife-giving-birth-10-pound-baby-while-driving-hospital-343716", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/19/man-records-gopro-video-wife-giving-birth-10-pound-baby-while-driving-hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas woman gave birth to her 10-pound son in her car, and her husband caught the whole thing on video.", "title": "This Woman Gave Birth To 10-Pound Baby In Her Car [GRAPHIC VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/man-records-gopro-video-wife-giving-birth-10-pound-baby-while-driving-hospital-343716", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/19/man-records-gopro-video-wife-giving-birth-10-pound-baby-while-driving-hospital.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/19/man-records-gopro-video-wife-giving-birth-10-pound-baby-while-driving-hospital.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-19T16:53:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T11:45:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Texas woman gave birth to her 10-pound son in her car, and her husband caught the whole thing on video."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd08a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s breathing.\nIf he\u2019s crying, he\u2019s breathing, but hold him upside down, babe,\u201d Jonathan says in the video.\nLesia asked Jonathan to film the birth of their 10-pound, 3-ounce baby when she went into labor.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what Jonathan Pettijohn did while driving his wife, Lesia, from their home in Lake Jackson, Texas, to a birth center in Houston.\nWithin minutes, Lesia went from having contractions, to breaking her water, to giving full-on birth in the passenger seat of the car \u2014 and the entire event was captured on Jonathan\u2019s GoPro camera."}
