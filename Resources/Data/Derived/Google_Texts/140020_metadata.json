Instead of health insurance companies, the co-op would pay for every citizen\u2019s healthcare. And instead of premiums, co-pays, and deductibles, Coloradans would pay more taxes to fund it.\n\nOf course, voters are predictably divided over whether single-payer is the answer to a broken system or the evil creep of socialism.\n\nThe grassroots group ColoradoCareYES gathered 158,831 signatures supporting an overhaul of the state\u2019s healthcare system. Last week the secretary of state\u2019s office confirmed the group had surpassed the 90,000 verifiable names needed to put the measure on the November 2016 ballot.\n\nRead More: Scoring Obamacare After Two Years \u00bb\n\nWhat Supporters Say\n\nHere\u2019s how it would work, according to supporters.\n\nEvery resident would have lifelong healthcare coverage. The program would be a cooperative operating in the interest of the residents and would be independent of government agencies and partisan politics.\n\nIt would be fiscally responsible and affordable as a coordinated system and is expected to reduce administrative costs. According to the measure\u2019s advocates, health insurance companies spend about 30 cents of every premium dollar on overhead costs; the new system would bring that down to 4 cents.\n\nCitizens would be free to choose their own doctors. The funding would come from a payroll tax, with employers contributing the same way they do to Social Security and FICA.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 11 percent of Coloradans are presently uninsured.\n\nIrene Aguilar, a doctor and a state senator, has been working on the issue for years. An earlier proposal died in the legislature in the face of insurance industry objections. This time ColoradoCareYes has taken the issue out of legislators\u2019 hands and put it directly to voters.\n\nWe don\u2019t want the legislature anywhere near this. T.R. Reid, ColoradoCareYes\n\nT.R. Reid, author of \u201cThe Healing of America,\u201d is a spokesman for ColoradoCareYes who sees the plan as a way to solve several problems. If the initiative passes, it becomes part of the state\u2019s Constitution and therefore is difficult to change or adapt. To Reid, that is one of its selling points.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the legislature anywhere near this,\u201d Reid said in an interview with Healthline.\n\nHe cited problems in Vermont, where a similar measure passed, only to be scrapped three years later for lack of funding.\n\n\u201cThey [Vermont politicians] larded it up and the price got too high,\u201d Reid said. \u201cPoliticians can\u2019t mess around with this.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t worried about the tax burden either. \u201cThe insurance companies raise their rates at double or triple the rate of inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe priced this out. We won\u2019t need to raise taxes.\u201d\n\nHe sees Colorado as leading the nation toward a system of universal coverage \u201cThis should have been done years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an opinion piece in the Denver Post, Reid explained how \u201cthe new plan will save billions in administrative costs. Private insurers now fritter away 20 percent of premium revenues on paperwork, marketing, salaries, etc. And that\u2019s legal under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRead More: Is It True? Do Doctors Really Loathe Obamacare? \u00bb\n\nWhat Opponents Say\n\nAs soon as the initiative qualified for the ballot, opponents warned that the proposal could be economically devastating or a nightmare to implement.\n\n\u201cA single-payer system would destroy our industry. I don't think there's any question about it,\u201d Byron McCurdy, board president of the Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters, told the Denver Post.\n\nThe insurance industry organization itself, however, has not issued an official statement. According to Tammy Niederman, legislative chair for the organization, a lot of research has to be done first.\n\nThe idea that we\u2019d scrap (the current health exchange) in favor of a new system leaves me speechless. Tammy Niederman, Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters\n\nIn an interview with Healthline, Niederman explained that at this time of year members are busy helping people with open enrollment issues.\n\nShe said the initiative would eliminate four programs in Colorado: workers compensation, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Basic Health program, and the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot to set that [the exchange] up. It\u2019s still in its infancy. The idea that we\u2019d scrap it in favor of a new system leaves me speechless,\u201d Niederman said.\n\nThe Colorado Hospital Association has taken no position yet. Neither has the University of Colorado health system.\n\nThe Colorado Medical Society does not have a position on this issue yet, but its president, Dr. Mike Volz, issued a preliminary statement late last week. He cited the society\u2019s long history in trying to improve access to healthcare.\n\n\u201cAs for support or opposition for ColoradoCareYes by Colorado Medical Society, I think you will see a range of passionate views, not on coverage where are all in general agreement, but rather on the ColoradoCareYes approach as opposed to our current private-public systems of coverage. We will be polling all of our members at some point on this subject.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado Association of Commerce & Industry has spoken out against the initiative.\n\n\u201cAmendment 69 would undoubtedly be the most massive, expensive change in Colorado state government in recent decades,\u201d said Dan Pilcher, CACI executive vice president, \u201cand the effects on the Colorado economy would be huge because it would eliminate the entire health insurance industry, costing tens of thousands of private sector jobs, while creating a giant ColoradoCare bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nRead More: Will Obamacare Spell the End of Flexible Spending Accounts? \u00bb\n\nCitizens Weighing In\n\nWhile many organizations have not picked sides yet, individuals have no such inhibition.\n\nIn a recent issue of the Denver Post, readers spoke up. Diane Merrill of Colorado Springs was one of them.\n\n\u201cMany of the headaches of the current system were brought on by the lack of a single-payer option being included as part of the Affordable Care Act in the first place,\u201d Merrill wrote. \u201cSeems like single-payer (see Medicare) would reduce the complexities of getting affordable coverage and would reduce costs, stress, and confusion for everyone because the insurance companies would no longer be calling the shots and putting profit before patient care.\u201d\n\nRob Piggott of Denver disagreed.\n\n\u201cReid says that ColoradoCare won\u2019t \u2018fritter away\u2019 revenue on administrative costs, keeping those expenses down to 4 percent,\u201d Piggott wrote. \u201cThat lack of administrative expense will curtail the bean counters, which for insurance include the actuaries, underwriters, and adjusters who can give some reasonable measure of risk and protection against fraud. Any form of insurance that cannot accurately measure risk is going to \u2018fritter\u2019 itself into oblivion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/colorado-set-to-vote-on-single-payer-healthcare-system-112515", "news_keywords": "single payer Colorado, Colorado single payer health system, Colorado ballot measure single payer health system, Colorado Obamacare single payer, Colorado November 2016 ballot", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A measure qualifies for the November 2016 ballot in Colorado that would set up a single payer system to replace Obamacare.
