If you're holding cash, finding the highest interest rates on FDIC-insured savings accounts can be a chore. Personal Finance Correspondent Sharon Epperson explains how to get the most out of your money.

Bank savings account rates have hit rock bottom and are poised to move higher when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Yet even now, there are ways to get better-than-average dealsâ€”if you don't mind doing some digging.

For example, the national average percentage yield for bank savings and money market accounts is about 0.1 percent, according to Bankrate.com. But there are some online banks that pay yields of as much as 1.25 percent or more.

The difference may not sound like anything to get excited about. Still, it could have a sizable impact depending on the amount of your savings. For a savings of $10,000, for example, moving your money to an account with a 1.25 percent annual percentage yield (APY) would garner you an extra $125 in interest, compared to only $10 in interest from an account with a 0.1 percent APY.
