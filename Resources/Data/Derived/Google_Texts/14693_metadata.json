Wearing his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans, Jobs made an emotional pitch to the City Council for his passion project \u2014 a centralized Apple campus.\n\n\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s grown like a weed, and as you know we\u2019ve always been in Cupertino,\u201d Jobs said, making it clear throughout his 20-minute presentation that he wanted to keep the company in the city. He died four months later.\n\nMore than two years since that appeal, the council is poised to vote tonight to green-light the project, known as Apple Campus 2. A second, more procedural, hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19 to certify the vote and advance Jobs\u2019 dream toward reality.\n\n\n\nFor such a massive project \u2014 at 2.8 million square feet, the campus would be nearly a million square feet larger than the 49ers\u2019 football stadium in Santa Clara \u2014 it has faced relatively little opposition. One reason is that the tech giant has done extensive community outreach, with more than 80,000 pieces of direct mail, said Dan Whisenhunt, Apple\u2019s senior director of real estate & development. In addition, citizens had the chance to voice their opinions at about 150 \u201cinformative gatherings\u201d and in writing, he said.\n\n\u201cEverything they\u2019ve done to accommodate the city, I think, is phenomenal,\u201d said Maryann Bettencourt, who has lived in Cupertino for 18 years and runs an Allstate agency in the city. \u201cThe layout of their plans, maintaining the trees, the bike paths\u2026all those little attention to details is really pretty admirable.\u201d\n\nAt a public hearing on Oct. 1, City Council members praised the company\u2019s cooperation. \u201cI\u2019ve met with them several times,\u201d council member Barry Chang said. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised that they are willing to look into any option and work out the details.\u201d\n\nUpon completion (with 2016 as the target date), the Apple Campus 2 will feature a spaceship-like, four-story building vast enough to house engineers, support personnel, and research and development staff all in one space. Apple\u2019s current Cupertino workforce of 16,000 is projected to grow to 24,000, and yearly property taxes the company pays to the city are expected to increase from $25 million to $57 million. The project would create about 9,000 construction jobs throughout the three-year building period, according to Apple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Oct. 1 hearing, the company made clear it plans to begin construction as quickly as the city will allow. Whisenhunt joked that he\u2019d start building \u201ctomorrow, if you\u2019d let me.\u201d\n\nLocal business leaders like Shiloh Ballard, vice president of housing and community development for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, turned out on Oct. 1 to urge the council to fast track the project. Her group represents more than 370 companies. \u201cWe are thrilled to see a local, homegrown company planting even deeper roots,\u201d Ballard said.\n\nBut letters submitted to the city reveal pockets of opposition. Sunnyvale resident Gary Beaupre wrote, \u201cI can only imagine how adding several thousand cars from the Apple 2 Campus to the Wolfe/280 and Lawrence/280 on- and off-ramps will make those trips into San Jose feel like a traffic congestion nightmare.\u201d\n\nTraffic wasn\u2019t Beaupre\u2019s only concern. \u201cHow big is too big? Answer: The Apple 2 Campus is too big. It\u2019s time that people acknowledge that a project can simply be too big for a given location, and it\u2019s time for us to do something about it before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nWhen Jobs pitched the project in June 2011, he was gaunt from his battle with cancer. Yet his voice was heard loud and clear: \u201cI think we do have a shot at building one of the best office buildings in the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Apple,Apple Campus 2,Cupertino,cupertino city council,Kasia Grobelny,steve jobs,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Politics & Gov", "description": "At 2.8 million square feet, Apple\u2019s new, spaceship-like campus in Cupertino would be nearly a million square feet larger than the 49ers\u2019 football stadium in\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0de\"", "article_summary": "Wearing his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans, Jobs made an emotional pitch to the City Council for his passion project \u2014 a centralized Apple campus.\nUPDATE, Oct. 16: The Cupertino City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday night to approve the project.\nMore than two years since that appeal, the council is poised to vote tonight to green-light the project, known as Apple Campus 2.\nOn June 7, 2011, in one of his last public appearances, Steve Jobs entered Cupertino Community Hall to rousing applause.\nA second, more procedural, hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19 to certify the vote and advance Jobs\u2019 dream toward reality."}
