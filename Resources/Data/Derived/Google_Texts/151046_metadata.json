(Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) ( Karl Mondon )\n\nCalifornia has tried to make casting a ballot as easy as ordering a pizza online.\n\nWe've scooped up potential voters when they come to the DMV to renew their driver's licenses. We've let Californians register to vote on smartphone apps. We've set up voting booths at city halls around the state weeks before Election Day. We've sent registered voters mail-in ballots every election.\n\nBut while 17.8 million Californians are now registered, more than for any other gubernatorial general election in the state's history, voting experts project that Tuesday's could be the first general election in which turnout falls below 50 percent. That's a far cry from the record 80 percent that cast ballots in 1958, when Democrat Pat Brown beat the GOP's William Knowland in a Republican-leaning state.\n\nYeah, this election has mostly been a snoozer -- mostly because Pat Brown's son, Jerry, is expected to win a fourth term in a landslide. But the problem is bigger than one election. With the exception of slightly better turnouts in the last few general elections, the Golden State's voter participation has been slowly declining for half a century.\n\nOne big reason is the state's sweeping demographic changes. Simply put: White Californians tend to vote a lot more than other Californians. Although whites now make up only 39 percent of the state's population, they're 57 percent of voters who show up.\n\nIn the next quarter century, 8.3 million more Californians will become eligible to vote, 8 million of whom will be people of color. So it will be a tougher task getting people to the polls, unless attitudes toward voting change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFew people know that better than Carlos Marroquin.\n\n\"The Hispanic community here is huge, but they don't vote,\" said Marroquin, 28, who lives and works on San Jose's heavily Latino East Side. \"All we do is complain.\n\n\"We don't get anyone to power. I feel frustrated,\" added Marroquin, who helps run his family business, which provides support services to immigrants. \"There are things that need to change (but) if we don't vote, it will be the same thing.\"\n\nBrazilian citizens pose outside the Brazilian consulate in San Francisco, Calif., on Sunday morning, Oct. 26, 2014, after voting in their presidential run-off election. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) ( Karl Mondon )\n\nVoter registration drives often are paired with citizenship drives in his neighborhood, he said, but those who are just becoming citizens \"probably don't feel that they're part of this country yet. As immigrants, it takes time to realize that this is your new country.\"\n\nAnother reason for the drop in voting is that California voters are increasingly choosing to register to vote without stating a party preference. And those voters are less likely to turn out than partisan voters, said Mindy Romero, who directs the California Civic Engagement Project at UC Davis' Center for Regional Change. The reason is that information provided by parties -- and the get-out-the-vote pressure they exert on their members -- is a big turnout driver that nonpartisans don't experience, she said.\n\nSo if the Golden State doesn't find new and better ways to convince people to vote, demographics dictate that turnout will only get smaller in the coming decades, she said.\n\n\"Instead of seeing how low we can go, maybe we can get a little ticked off,\" Romero said, adding that California should be striving to do better. \"I would love to see this become a rallying cry.\"\n\nAmong the possible solutions: letting people register and then immediately cast a provisional ballot at polling places on Election Day.\n\nThat could boost California voter turnout by almost 5 percent, according to a 2011 research paper co-authored by R. Michael Alvarez, a Caltech political science professor. Based on other states' experiences, the paper predicted, about 9 percent more people ages 18 to 25 -- and about 5 percent more Latinos and newly naturalized citizens -- would vote.\n\nA 2012 California law was aimed at making Election Day registration a reality. But the law won't take effect until the secretary of state certifies VoteCal, California's first centralized, statewide voter registration database.\n\nRepeatedly delayed by technical setbacks, VoteCal isn't expected to be up and running until mid-2016.\n\nBut some experts are skeptical that even Election Day registration will be enough to turn the turnout tide.\n\n\"I still don't think it's going to move the needle too much,\" said Eric McGhee, who studies voting behavior and political participation at the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nInstead, he said, getting nonvoters to become voters means \"reaching out to them and convincing them to change their minds\" with a message they understand from a voice they trust.\n\nCandidates and parties often give lip service to wooing first-time voters, but most actually seek the most bang for their buck by focusing on people who have voted a lot in the past.\n\nPublic agencies such as the Secretary of State's Office and county registrars, as well as some nonprofits, work to persuade nonvoters to sign up. But they lack the money and personnel that campaigns and candidates have -- and thus make little progress.\n\nSome say California and the rest of the country should take a page from several dozen nations that require citizens to vote. In recent elections, the top turnout was down under: Australia chalked up a 93 percent turnout in its 2013 presidential election. Anyone who didn't cast a ballot had to provide a valid reason or pay a $20 fine -- which if left unpaid could increase to $170 and result in a criminal conviction.\n\nTurnout figures for Brazil's just-completed presidential election -- for which citizens last weekend waited in long lines at the Brazilian consulate in San Francisco -- aren't available yet. But the country had an 82 percent turnout in 2010.\n\nIn Brazil, voting is compulsory for literate citizens ages 18 to 70, and scofflaws must pay a fine and risk not being able to renew passports or other government documents.\n\nStill, McGhee said, punishing nonvoters is \"not realistically on the table\" in America, where citizens see voting as a right, not an enforceable duty.\n\nAnother suggestion that's gaining in popularity: Just pay people to vote.\n\nSurprisingly, California law already allows payment for voting in nonfederal elections. And Los Angeles is now mulling a lottery-like chance of cash prizes to those who cast ballots.\n\nBut McGee doubts that paying voters will prove to be \"politically feasible\" on a larger scale.\n\nRomero also questions whether government can do much to increase turnout. Instead, she said, nonvoters instead need to hear about the importance of voting from the lips of people who are their own age and background.\n\n\"Particularly with youth, personal contact makes a huge difference, especially from peers,\" she said. \"Show them the how and the why -- why it connects with their lives. If you get them when they're young, voting is habit-forming and you're much more likely to keep them voting for the rest of their lives,\"\n\nThere's no better place to reach a diverse cross-section of California's youth than its high schools, Romero said, and two new laws authored by Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, D-Los Angeles, might help a bit. One requires high school government classes to teach the importance of voting as well as how to register, use a voter information guide and vote. The other lets high school administrators designate students as \"voter outreach coordinators\" during voter-registration weeks every April and September -- just the kind of peer-to-peer contact that Romero says is crucial.\n\nOf course, early intervention won't always work.\n\nKaitlin Manalo, 18, said she registered to vote at the urging of her government teacher at Hayward's Mt. Eden High School. But Manalo, now a San Jose State student majoring in finance, won't cast a ballot on Tuesday.\n\n\"I kinda feel guilty,\" said Manalo, who is of Filipino descent. \"But it's not really on my radar. I don't have time, and I don't pay attention. I'm not interested. The candidates aren't appealing -- and the ballot measures aren't affecting me.\"\n\nFollow Josh Richman him at Twitter.com/Josh_Richman and Julia Prodis Sulek at Twitter.com/JuliaSulek.
