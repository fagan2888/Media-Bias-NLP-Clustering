To rescue people or bring in much needed supplies to inaccessible areas.\n\n\"It will actually drive over a pretty good-sized tree,\" Baker said.\n\nThe vehicle has room for nine people in the back, or at least two stretchers, and it has a fuel range of 350 miles.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation covers 14 counties in eastern Oklahoma, much of it very rural and rugged. The vehicle will get emergency crews to just about anywhere they need to go.\n\nOver the next month, tribal marshals will undergo certification training to be able to drive the vehicle.\n\nThe turret will be removed to make sure there is clearance to drive under bridges. It will also be retrofitted with a wheelchair ramp on the back.\n\n\"No matter if there is ice, snow, a tree collapse, we can get to these communities that need us,\" Buhl said.\n\nWith only nine thousand miles on it, the Cherokee Nation will get many years of service from the vehicle, starting this upcoming tornado season.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The vehicle has room for nine people in the back, or at least two stretchers, and it has a fuel range of 350 miles.", "author": "Craig Day", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24666532/armored-vehicle-extends-cherokee-nation", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24666532_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The vehicle has room for nine people in the back, or at least two stretchers, and it has a fuel range of 350 miles.", "title": "Armored Vehicle Extends Cherokee Nation's Reach In Emergencies"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24666532_SA.jpg", "description": "The vehicle has room for nine people in the back, or at least two stretchers, and it has a fuel range of 350 miles.", "card": "summary", "title": "Armored Vehicle Extends Cherokee Nation's Reach In Emergencies"}, "wnreadableurl": "armored-vehicle-extends-cherokee-nation", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/02/07", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS29", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf50\"", "article_summary": "It's a 15-ton, six-wheel drive vehicle and it didn't cost the Cherokee Nation a dime due to a program that donates surplus equipment to state and local agencies.\nThe Cherokee Nation covers 14 counties in eastern Oklahoma, much of it very rural and rugged.\nBut Cherokee Marshals will use it during other natural disasters too, like tornadoes...
