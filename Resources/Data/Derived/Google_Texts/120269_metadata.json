For the 17th annual Roger Ebert\u2019s Film Festival \u2014 better known as \u201cEbertfest\u201d \u2014 the critic\u2019s widow, Chaz, and her festival partners selected work and invited guests in keeping with Ebert\u2019s spirit.\n\nOn Friday evening, Ms. Ebert introduced Robert De Niro\u2019s 1993 directorial debut, \u201cA Bronx Tale,\u201d starring Mr. De Niro and Chazz Palminteri, whose one-man play was the source material.\n\nMs. Ebert proudly announced that the 35 mm print used for the screening was donated to the festival from the personal collection of director Martin Scorsese, a longtime friend of Ebert\u2018s.\n\nThe film stars Mr. Palminteri and Mr. De Niro as a Bronx gangster and bus driver, respectively, battling over the soul of Mr. De Niro\u2019s character\u2019s son, played by Lillo Brancato.\n\n\u201cRoger always called this guest \u2018the Chazz with two Z\u2019s,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ebert said as she brought Mr. Palminteri out on the stage with her after the screening.\n\nMr. Palminteri was joined by producer Jon Kilik for a discussion moderated by Richard Roeper \u2014 Ebert\u2019s former television co-host \u2014 and esteemed critic and professor Leonard Maltin.\n\n\u201cMy father was a bus driver; his name was Lorenzo,\u201d Mr. Palminteri said to the crowd gathered at the Virginia Theatre \u2014 a classic single-screen movie house in Ebert\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cA lot of the words in the film are my father\u2019s words. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t waste your life, son, I know you have talent.\u2019 I promised him that I wouldn\u2019t waste my life and do something with it, and it worked out OK,\u201d Mr. Palminteri said to thunderous applause.\n\n\u201cSo many things about this movie felt like divine intervention,\u201d Mr. Kilik said. He recalled Ms. Ebert asking him recently at Cannes which of his film productions is his favorite, to which he responded, \u201cA Bronx Tale.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see it tonight on a big screen with a great audience meant so much to me,\u201d Mr. Kilik said.\n\nMr. Kilik also recalled that Ebert was an early champion of Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d which he produced and was coincidentally screened at Ebertfest last year. Mr. Lee attended the screening.\n\nMr. Palminteri said that \u201cA Bronx Tale\u201d was largely culled from his own life growing up in New York, where he was privy to the activities of local Italian mobsters.\n\nThrough workshops with other actors in Los Angeles, he turned several monologues into what became his one-man show. Mr. Palminteri said he turned down offers of well over $1 million for the rights to make the property a film. Even though the struggling actor had $400 to his name at the time, he said, he feared Hollywood would ruin his baby.\n\nMr. De Niro saw the show and immediately offered to help translate the play onto the screen.\n\n\u201cBut I said, \u2018I want to [play] Sonny, [and] I want to write [the screenplay],\u2019\u201d Mr. Palminteri said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sure, and I\u2019ll direct it. And if you shake my hand, that\u2019s the way it\u2019ll be.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. De Niro was a Hollywood heavyweight in the early 1990s, there was resistance to having him direct a major project for the first time. Every big director wanted to direct \u201cA Bronx Tale,\u201d but Mr. Palminteri knew Mr. De Niro was correct for the work, having grown up as a fellow Italian in New York and knowing the streets.\n\n\u201cWhen I met with De Niro, he said, \u2018Look, I love the story, I won\u2019t touch the story, it should be the way it is,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Palminteri. \u201cThere was an honesty about Bob. I knew he was going to make a great movie.\u201d\n\nThe young man at the center of the film is called Cologero, which happens to be Mr. Palminteri\u2019s real first name. He recalled fondly the audition process for an actor to play Cologero as a 9-year-old.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, this kid walks in and he goes, \u2018How do you doin\u2019, Chazz? Hello, Bob.\u2019 And Bob and me looked at each other and said, \u2018Look at the set on this kid,\u2019\u201d Mr. Palminteri said of Francis Capra, who was ultimately cast. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, Bob, should I cry or should I not cry?\u2019 There was no one even close to him.\u201d\n\nIn an ironic twist, Brancato, who portrayed Cologero as a teenager, served several years in prison for a burglary conviction that involved the shooting death of a police officer. He was released on parole 16 months ago, and the triggerman is still serving a life sentence.\n\nRather than cast actors to portray the neighborhood wise guys, Mr. Palminteri recommended to Mr. De Niro the actual people upon whom many of them were based, such as gambler Eddie Montanaro, aka \u201cEddie Mush.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Listen, just be cool, come over to the car, don\u2019t say nothing, but Bob De Niro\u2019s in the car,\u2019\u201d Mr. Palminteri said of finding Mr. Montanaro at the sports track. \u201cHe says, \u2018I ain\u2019t going to no strange car; I owe too many people money.\u2019 He tapped on the window, and he looks at Bob De Niro and says, \u2018It is you!\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. De Niro entreated Mr. Montanaro to come to his office for a noon audition. Mr. Montanaro said he was due at the track and asked whether he could show up at 3 p.m. instead.\n\n\u201cBob turned to me and said, \u2018He\u2019s perfect,\u2019\u201d Mr. Palminteri recalled.\n\nIn the film, the teenage Cologero begins to romance a black girl, played by Taral Hicks, considered a no-no in both of their respective neighborhoods. Mr. Palminteri related how this was based on his own recollections of being 17 in 1968.\n\n\u201cMy friends would say, \u2018We hate the black kids because we\u2019re poor and this [neighborhood] is ours,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they felt the same way about us going up past Webster Avenue.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have that kind of hate that some of my friends had,\u201d he said of the racially segregated neighborhoods. \u201cThat\u2019s why [the film is] still relevant today\u201d in terms of race relations.\n\nHowever, he said his aim was never to go out purposely to raise his audience\u2019s consciousness. \u201cIf you set out to write message movies, it never happens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe audience laughed hearing the writer/actor recalling that the crucial scene of the craps game used real money, some of which consistently vanished.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Guys, you can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Palminteri said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t help themselves. These guys, they\u2019re thieves.\u201d\n\nThe crowd at the Virginia Theatre also got a good laugh learning that \u201cA Bronx Tale\u201d was in fact shot in the neighboring borough of Queens.\n\nMr. Palminteri continued to sing Mr. De Niro\u2019s praises for leaving the source material alone and for encouraging the up-and-coming actor/playwright, telling him, \u201cChazz, it takes just as much talent to recognize a great idea as it is to come up with it yourself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roger Ebert loved movies so much that the longtime film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times returned to his hometown to found his own film festival as a way to champion films he believed were overlooked or in need of greater appreciation.
