A meme (photo and text, usually a quote) states that Ben Carson said slavery was the “best thing that could have happened” to blacks.

The facts: Absolutely not true. Carson said nothing of the sort.

The meme that has been circulating around the Internet attributes this quote to Carson: “Actually slavery was the best thing that could have happened to us. Because of slavery blacks were brought to America. We met the Christian faith. We met Jesus Christ. If it were not for slavery, we would all be in Africa hanging from trees and worshipping Allah. God always gets it right!”

On Aug. 29, according to Snopes.com, the Facebook page “Fox News the FB Page” published a photograph of Carson, a former neurosurgeon seeking the Republican presidential nomination, with the purported quote.

Snopes.com points out that the quote bore a scintilla of resemblance to earlier comments made by Carson (such as a 2013 comment that Obamacare was “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,” and an op-ed piece by Carson in which he criticized Black Lives Matter protesters), but the words attributed to Carson were never spoken by him.

“Fox News the FB Page” is a parody website that is not affiliated with Fox News Channel and primarily publishes altered versions of current news stories or entirely fabricated content. Prior posts by that group include a claim that NASCAR was replacing its flag with a rainbow gay pride version and a fake news atory headlined: “Kim Davis Announces Engagement to Phil Robertson.”
