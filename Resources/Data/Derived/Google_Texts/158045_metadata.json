It\u2019s the place we feed our family, our friends, our community, and we need to connect that more with our local economies.\n\nSB 330, the so-called Cookie Bill, passed the Wisconsin Senate last week. It would allow home bakers to sell their products without the current requirements for a commercial license or kitchen.\n\nIn a petition opposing the Wisconsin Assembly version of the bill, AB 471, the Wisconsin Bakers Association said current regulations are \u201call designated to assure the prevention of foodborne illness through cross contamination within the regular home environment.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin Bakers Association declined to comment for this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsinites can be punished with $1,000 in fines or six months in jail for selling their home-baked eats.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Wisconsinites can be punished with $1,000 in fines or six months in jail for selling their home-baked eats.", "title": "Farmers Seek End to Ban on Sales of Home-Baked Goods", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160115_BakeBan_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-20T22:40:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NjvjL7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Wisconsinites can be punished with $1,000 in fines or six months in jail for selling their home-baked eats.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160115_BakeBan_Barillas.jpg"}, "title": "Farmers Seek End to Ban on Sales of Home-Baked Goods", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2016-01-20T19:39:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-20T22:40:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cookie bill, Wisconsin, Wisconsin bakers association, Institute for Justice, Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Lisa Kivirist, Dela Ends, Kriss Marion, lawsuit, home-baked goods"}, "article_summary": "Three Wisconsin farmers have filed a lawsuit against their state\u2019s agriculture agency to overturn a ban on the sale of homemade baked goods.\nIn a petition opposing the Wisconsin Assembly version of the bill, AB 471, the Wisconsin Bakers Association said current regulations are \u201call designated to assure the prevention of foodborne illness through cross contamination within the regular home environment.\u201dThe Wisconsin Bakers Association declined to comment for this report.\nIt would allow home bakers to sell their products without the current requirements for a commercial license or kitchen.\n\u201cThe safest place to make food is in our home kitchens,\u201d Kivist said in the Institute for Justice video.\nIt\u2019s the place we feed our family, our friends, our community, and we need to connect that more with our local economies."}
