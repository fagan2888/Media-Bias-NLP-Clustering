The one year they went up, we just happened to have a whole bunch of babies.\u201d In Sound Community\u2019s best year, the bank boasted a 12% reduction in costs.\n\nThese decreases in costs are directly correlated to an increase in participation, so banks make sure to incentivize participants, most commonly through a discount in the healthcare premium.\n\nMany banks go beyond just a simple premium reduction, however, recognizing that the program must be fun and appealing to keep employees engaged.\n\n\u201cThe goal with any of this wellness activity is to make sure you keep your finger on the pulse of the employees,\u201d says James Miller, human resources director at $1.1 billion-assets Bank of Ann Arbor, Mich., which also self insures employees and whose wellness program helped the bank see a 6% reduction in costs from 2013 to 2014. \u201cIf you start adding things that they don\u2019t want to do, they won\u2019t participate and then you\u2019re just wasting your money. I try to keep it fun.\u201d\n\nSmartphones, wearable devices, and online portals are some of the biggest influences shaping wellness programs today, and many banks have instituted a points system that rewards participants for reaching certain goals or points totals for things like steps, food, sleep habits, and more. Some banks have even made their discounted healthcare premiums dependent on a goal or points total. Employees are able to track their progress and points online or through a device like a Fitbit or smartphone. \u201cPeople really seem to like that, because they can keep score throughout the course of the year,\u201d says Miller.\n\nWhile employees are engaged in competition with themselves to reach certain goals, banks recognize the need for a social component to these programs. \u201cWe also cover a spouse or significant other or partner, because we know that people do a better job of staying with an exercise or fitness program if they do it with somebody else,\u201d says Stewart.\n\nFirst National Bank recently partnered with a third party to create an in-house social networking tool that helps employees connect. \u201cOne of the main components around people\u2019s well-being is being able to be socially connected to those who have the same interests that they do. But in large organizations, it can be hard to find people that have similar interests,\u201d says Thom. \u201cThe social tool really allows our employees to form communities.\u201d\n\nEducation is as important as the activities, so that workshops and \u201clunch and learns\u201d on various health and wellness topics also prove popular. \u201cWe believe that people are at different stages in terms of their readiness to change, and so our program offers a big component around education to give people different ways of engaging based on where they are,\u201d says Thom.\n\nAll these offerings aim at increased participation, but top-to-bottom involvement also is important. \u201cIt absolutely makes a difference to hear your executive management team talking about its importance and encouraging people to participate in the program,\u201d says Mariano \u201cJR\u201d Pimentel, human resources development officer at $1.6 billion-assets Bristol County Savings Bank, Taunton, Mass. \u201cThat sends a very loud and clear message that this isn\u2019t just something they want frontline employees to do; this is something that everyone needs to do. It becomes a part of departmental activities and the bank\u2019s culture.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "5osclp9seicb0e7iw04es3fam8gr4ef7ssthoqbjxgzv7nuy98gc-u07z0jxsz-t0d2dy52i4txb8nq0u0y9h9blxkn8k2wlw1lvzl5xb6v9sdlh14o-325rl7vmk98v", "description": "Long before the Affordable Care Act, rising healthcare costs led many banks to invest in wellness programs with the thought that healthier employees would lead to lower healthcare costs.
