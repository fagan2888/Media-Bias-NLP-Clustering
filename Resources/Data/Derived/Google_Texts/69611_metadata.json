Dayton and Democrats,\u201d state Rep. Tara Mack, R-Apple Valley, said in a statement.\n\nObamacare is the name used by some to describe the Affordable Care Act, a federal law past in 2010 that called for the creation of health exchanges for all 50 states.\n\nMinnesota is one of 16 states, plus the District of Columbia, that are creating their own health exchanges, while the federal government is running an exchange that covers Wisconsin and the other remaining states.\n\nLegislation passed this year for Minnesota\u2019s exchange allowed MNsure to withhold up to 1.5 percent of premiums. Depending on whether shoppers purchase policies with lower or higher costs, it will raise anywhere from $3.2 million to $4.6 million, according to MNsure projections.\n\nThe money would cover a sliver of MNsure\u2019s operating costs in 2014 \u2014 $1.2 million out of a total $76.3 million, with the bulk of funding coming from the federal government. The remaining funds would be held in a reserve account.\n\nTodd-Malmlov\u2019s comment about tax credits followed a study released this week by the California-based Kaiser Family Foundation that projected 90,000 people in Minnesota will be eligible for tax credits through the exchange.\n\nThat\u2019s a much smaller number than in similarly sized states such as Wisconsin, where about 300,000 people likely will be eligible for tax credits.\n\nLow premiums in Minnesota are one factor that explains the difference, said Cynthia Cox, a researcher with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe health law offers tax credits to people at certain income levels if they can\u2019t buy a benchmark policy for less than a set percentage of their income.\n\nConsumers with income at 400 percent of the poverty level \u2014 a threshold that works out to $46,000 for an individual, or $94,000 for a family of four \u2014 are not supposed to pay more than 9.5 percent of their income for a health insurance premium, according to the law.\n\nThe law doesn\u2019t set a cap for the share of income that people at higher income levels should pay, but lower-income people are expected to pay a lower percentage \u2014 someone with incomes at 200 percent of the poverty level, for example, is required to pay a premium of no more than 6.3 percent of his income.\n\nTo determine if an individual gets a tax credit, the government takes a consumer\u2019s affordability cap and compares it with the cost of the \u201csecond lowest-cost silver\u201d health insurance policy that\u2019s available for the consumer.\n\nWhen the dollar value of the premium exceeds the affordability cap, a consumer can get a tax credit to make up the difference.\n\nIn low-premium regions like much of Minnesota, some consumers are finding that their benchmark premium is lower than the affordability cap. So, they don\u2019t need a tax credit to get affordable coverage.\n\nA second factor is Minnesota\u2019s decision to expand the Medicaid health insurance program and maintain MinnesotaCare, a state-run program that provides coverage for people with slightly higher income than those who qualify for Medicaid. The programs will catch Minnesotans with incomes below roughly $23,000.\n\nIn both cases, Minnesota\u2019s decision means that those consumers will be covered through a government program. In other states, they will be tapping tax credits applied against the cost of a policy purchased on a health exchange.\n\n\u201cLess people are getting tax credits,\u201d Todd-Malmlov said. \u201cBut the end result of that is that we have more people with affordable coverage, and more comprehensive coverage than in any other state.\u201d\n\nTom Forsythe, a MNsure board member, said he wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that consumers are confused. But in an interview following the board meeting, he stressed that the low premiums \u201cis a good thing.\u201d\n\nBoard member Pete Benner noted that higher premiums in the Rochester area mean that more consumers in the southeast portion of the state will need tax credits to make their out-of-pocket premium costs affordable. And across the state, older people and those with lower incomes will be more likely than younger people with higher incomes to receive the federal subsidies.\n\nChristopher Snowbeck can be reached at 651-228-5479.
