Historically, states have set different eligibility thresholds for Medicaid.\n\nThe findings have implications for today\u2019s Medicaid landscape, says Amanda Kowalski, an economist at Yale University.\n\n\u201cAlthough it will take years to know the long-term impact of current expansions of Medicaid undertaken as part of the Affordable Care Act, this study shows that the investments that the government made in Medicaid in the 1980s and 1990s are paying off in the form of higher tax payments now.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study, released as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, the federal government recouped 14 cents for each dollar spent on childhood Medicaid by the time the children reached age 28.\n\nAssuming these higher tax payments persist, the federal government would recoup 56 cents on each dollar by the time these children reach age 60.\n\nChildren eligible for more years of Medicaid made higher combined income and payroll tax payments as adults and collected less from the Earned Income Tax Credit. Also, women had higher cumulative wages.\n\nResearchers the Office of Tax Analysis at the US Department of the Treasury are coauthors of the paper.\n\n(Featured Photo Credit: Paul Falvo/Flickr)\n\nYale University \u2014 Original Study", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jim Shelton Futurity Kids in the United States who received expanded Medicaid benefits in the 1980s and 1990s have contributed more to the tax system as", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.6 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "Latina Lista: News from the Latino perspective", "description": "By Jim Shelton Futurity Kids in the United States who received expanded Medicaid benefits in the 1980s and 1990s have contributed more to the tax system as adults, were more likely to attend colleg\u2026", "title": "Medicaid for kids in the 1980s is paying off now", "url": "http://latinalista.com/columns/blogbeat-columns/medicaid-for-kids-in-the-1980s-is-paying-off-now", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "http://latinalista.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1980s_kids_1170-770x460.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://latinalista.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1980s_kids_1170-770x460.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "position": 4, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-15T22:38:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T22:38:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda104\"", "article_summary": "Assuming these higher tax payments persist, the federal government would recoup 56 cents on each dollar by the time these children reach age 60.\nChildren eligible for more years of Medicaid made higher combined income and payroll tax payments as adults and collected less from the Earned Income Tax Credit.\nMedicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income people that began in 1965, was expanded dramatically in the 1980s and again in the 1990s, with the establishment of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nThe findings have implications for today\u2019s Medicaid landscape, says Amanda Kowalski, an economist at Yale University.\nBy Jim SheltonFuturityKids in the United States who received expanded Medicaid benefits in the 1980s and 1990s have contributed more to the tax system as adults, were more likely to attend college, and were less likely to die prematurely."}
