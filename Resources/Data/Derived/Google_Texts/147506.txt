Interstate Medical Licensure Could Ease Physician Shortages

With anxiety rising over the potential for a physician shortage in the years to come, a push is on for interstate medical licensure.

Physicians seeking to practice in more than one state and hospitals seeking to alleviate staffing shortages may find their paths eased if a proposal for an interstate licensure compact is approved and adopted.

The proposed Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, crafted by the Federation of State Medical Boards, and released last month would create a commission to oversee interstate medical licenses and function alongside the existing licensing authority of state boards. Humayun Chaudhry, DO, president and CEO of the FSMB, says there is a pressing need for the compact.

The move could be a boon to rural hospitals with chronic staffing shortages and lack of access to specialists. It could also break down staffing barriers impeding the progress of telemedicine.

"The compact would create a new pathway to expedite the licensing of physicians seeking to practice medicine in multiple states, which would address multiple issues," he said this week.

"Among them: physician shortages, the expected influx of millions of new patients into the healthcare system as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and the growing need to increase access to healthcare for individuals in underserved or rural areas through the use of telemedicine."
