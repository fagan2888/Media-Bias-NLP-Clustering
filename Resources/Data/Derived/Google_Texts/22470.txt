After a failed attempt to keep a sex tape secret, “Pippi Longstocking” actress Tami Erin reportedly is shopping it around for a porn company to release the footage, TMZ said.

The 39-year-old actress, who starred in the 1988 movie “The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking,” has given up trying to stop her ex-boyfriend from selling the video, and she likely will sell it herself to the highest bidder.

Miss Erin told TMZ last month that she was “furious” to learn her ex was trying to sell the tape.

“My ex-boyfriend is trying to release it with or without me. I’m beating him to the punch,” she told the gossip site on Sunday.
