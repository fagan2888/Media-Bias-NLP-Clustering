(Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press)\n\nCarly Fiorina might be the woman most likely to be on a presidential ticket in 2016 \u2014 at least if Hillary Clinton\u2019s numbers continue tanking and Vice President Biden gets into the race. If she is the only woman on a ticket, either at the top or bottom, could the GOP erase the gender gap that has bedeviled it for so long?\n\nWell, it is first important to understand where the gap exists and where it is possibly growing. Republicans have held their own with regard to white married women and even white single women. In 2012, Mitt Romney won married women by a 53-to-46 percent margin and lost among single women by a 67-to-31 percent margin. He won white women by a 56-to-42 percent margin and lost among Hispanic women 76 percent to 23 percent.\n\nAs the voting population gets younger, more racially diverse and less likely to marry (female millennials choose to remain single at numbers much greater than their mothers), the groups least likely to vote Republican increase. Ronald Brownstein wrote in 2013:\n\nWhile white men and women represented equal shares of the vote in 1984, in 2012 the women (at 38 percent) outvoted the men (at 34 percent). Combining education and gender underscores the point. Men without a college education have become the most reliably Republican component of the white electorate; women with a college degree are the most receptive to Democrats. In 1984, those blue-collar men cast nearly three times as many votes as the white-collar women; in 2012, for the first time, the college women (at 19 percent) outvoted the noncollege men (at 17 percent). Given that the share of white adults with at least a four-year degree has increased in every year since 1981 except two, and that women are garnering nearly three-fifths of those degrees, this gap is likely to widen. Marital status pushes in the same direction less dramatically. Every Democratic nominee since 1980 has run better among single than married whites. In 1984, married couples represented 70 percent of all white voters; by 2012, that number slipped to 65 percent. (The decline has been especially sharp among married white men, who have voted more Republican than married women in each election since 1984.) Another trend steepening the grade for the GOP is growing secularization. Since 2000, Democrats have averaged a 32-point advantage among whites who identify with no religious tradition, and the share of them has increased from 15 percent in 2007 to 20 percent by 2012, according to studies by the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhat would at least help?\n\nThe answer to most political questions is: Get a good candidate. That is especially so with regard to gender:\n\nOver the course of 2013 and 2014, as Democratic campaigns targeted female voters on abortion rights, equal pay, and access to birth control, Burning Glass worked with the House Republican caucus to train members to avoid Todd Akin-style gaffes about things like \u201clegitimate rape\u201d; with Senate Republican candidates on debate prep and issue messaging around the Affordable Care Act; and with independent expenditure groups on the tone and tenor of their ads. The results speak for themselves. Burning Glass\u2019s 2014 client list reads like a page out of the new Senate roster, including candidates or groups in Arkansas, Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia. In each contest, the Republican candidate outperformed the GOP result from 2012 among women voters. All but Ed Gillespie in Virginia won, and even Gillespie made significant gains among female voters compared to now-Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s nine-point win over Ken Cuccinelli.\n\nConversely, that means not electing someone like Trump whose gender gap is already evident and who refuses to refrain from misogynistic remarks. Think of former representative Todd Akin (R-Mo.), and you see the entire GOP ticket could suffer.\n\nSecond, while abortion and gay marriage remain problematic issues for Republicans with all voters, candidates who do not demonize opponents and who show empathy (as 2014 candidates did) can survive. Moreover, in talking about the importance of family and marriage, Republicans cannot afford to denigrate single women. (It requires walking a fine line, to be sure.) Tone, as we have noted many times, is critical here. Judgmental, angry voices are a huge turnoff for female voters.\n\nThird, understanding that part of the problem in reaching female voters is age and race, Republicans might do very well with a younger, non-white candidate who understands popular culture. That\u2019s an apt description, obviously, of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). To the extent he would carry more non-white and younger voters, he will do well with women as well.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether having the only woman on a presidential ticket would change the GOP\u2019s fortunes with female voters. It surely could not hurt. But attracting female voters is a microcosm of the bigger problem the GOP has experienced in presidential races: It is too reliant on white males, who are a shrinking part of the electoral pie. Key to solving the GOP\u2019s larger problem and the gender gap as well is to select candidates who can broaden the party\u2019s message, signal concern for average Americans and avoid sounding judgmental or nasty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With or without Fiorina, the GOP can draw more female voters.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "With or without Fiorina, the GOP can draw more female voters.", "title": "Gender and the GOP presidential primary", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/17/gender-and-the-gop-presidential-primary/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/17/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Debate-0c359.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/09/17/gender-and-the-gop-presidential-primary/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "GOP gender gap, GOP minority women, GOP married women, GOP younger women", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "GOP gender gap, GOP minority women, GOP married women, GOP younger women"}, "article_summary": "Republicans have held their own with regard to white married women and even white single women.\nWe don\u2019t know whether having the only woman on a presidential ticket would change the GOP\u2019s fortunes with female voters.\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney won married women by a 53-to-46 percent margin and lost among single women by a 67-to-31 percent margin.\nHe won white women by a 56-to-42 percent margin and lost among Hispanic women 76 percent to 23 percent.\nAll but Ed Gillespie in Virginia won, and even Gillespie made significant gains among female voters compared to now-Gov."}
