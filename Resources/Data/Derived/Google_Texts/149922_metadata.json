Cecily was born with a bad tendon in her leg, so Martin will pay for a $2,500 prosthetic leg made by the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in the town of Grafton.\n\nThe school\u2019s own Dr. Emi Knafo, who specializes in avian orthopedics and surgery, will oversee the procedure on Wednesday:\n\n\u201cThe foot tendons contract in an abnormal place,\u201d she said. \u201cIt puts them at risk for sores and infections, and the choices were euthanasia, or try to manage it with pain medication. It could be an uncomfortable life. But as a veterinarian, we always try to evaluate and intervene in a positive way.\u201d \u201cPeople would not think twice about it (the procedure) for another kind of animal,\u201d Dr. Knafo said. \u201cWe want to give her as much of a pain-free life as possible.\u201d\n\nAs weird as this might seem, similar procedures were recently done successfully for a rooster and a duck at other veterinary schools.\n\nAs For Martin, spending so much time and money on a single chicken isn\u2019t anything new for her:\n\nCecily\u2019s rescue and paying for the upcoming procedure is not out of the ordinary for her. She financed a hysterectomy for another of her chickens, named Emily. \u201cThey don\u2019t take the ovaries, so she still lays eggs,\u201d Ms. Martin said.\n\nMight as well start the clock on the \u201cWhen will someone turn this viral story into a new debate point about Obamacare?\u201d count down.\n\n[h/t Worcester Telegram & Gazette]\n\n[Image via Adult Swim]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cecil the Lion is dead, but Cecily the Chicken will live (and walk) on.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot-chicken-intro.jpg", "title": "Chicken Gets $2,500 Prosthetic Leg and Better Health Coverage than You"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cecil the Lion is dead, but Cecily the Chicken will live (and walk) on.", "title": "Chicken Gets $2,500 Prosthetic Leg and Better Health Coverage than You", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot-chicken-intro.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewHusband", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-08-03T13:42:05+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "[h/t Worcester Telegram & Gazette][Image via Adult Swim]\u2014 \u2014>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter\nAccording to the Worcester Telegram & Gazette, the disabled three-month-old poultry came into the care of poultry behaviorist and rehabilitation specialist Andrew Martin in Clinton, Massachusetts.\nCecily was born with a bad tendon in her leg, so Martin will pay for a $2,500 prosthetic leg made by the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in the town of Grafton.\n\u201cIt puts them at risk for sores and infections, and the choices were euthanasia, or try to manage it with pain medication.\nMight as well start the clock on the \u201cWhen will someone turn this viral story into a new debate point about Obamacare?\u201d count down."}
