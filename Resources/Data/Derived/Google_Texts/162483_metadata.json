Why experts disagree\n\nshare tweet pin email\n\nHaving wisdom teeth pulled has long been a rite of passage for many teens and young adults.\n\nFor decades, dentists routinely warned teens and their parents that pesky wisdom teeth below the surface of the gums could not only harm other teeth, but they could also lead to infections, cysts and tooth decay.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many opted to extract those un-erupted teeth to avoid problems down the line.\n\nMichael Conroy / AP\n\nBut, more are now questioning having their wisdom teeth removed when there's nothing wrong with them. A recent article in Fusion challenged the policy of removing millions of apparently healthy teeth annually.\n\nIt's uncertain exactly how many wisdom teeth are removed each year in the U.S., but there are widely cited estimates (without clear attribution) of nine million extractions, at a cost of approximately $3 billion.\n\nTeeth crowding?\n\nOral surgeons once justified the extraction of third molars \u2014 the technical name for wisdom teeth \u2014to avoid damaging the teeth in front of them. Allowing them to erupt could affect the alignment and even the integrity of other teeth, they said.\n\nBut orthodontists now know that lower teeth have a tendency to crowd together regardless of whether or not wisdom teeth have been removed, said Dr. Greg Huang, a professor and chair of the department of orthodontics at the University of Washington. \"There's no good evidence that having third molars removed either helps or hurts the crowding situation,\" says Huang.\n\nHuang said he does recommend wisdom tooth removal if it looks like there won't be enough room for them.\n\nIn 2016 guidelines from the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) members are advised:\n\n\"Given that we cannot confidently predict what the future holds for all patients with asymptomatic, disease-free teeth, we must rely on the clinician's experience and expertise in recognizing the likelihood that pathology will develop and his or her ability to communicate this in realistic terms to the patient.\"\n\nThe patient pamphlet the organization offers on its website is more ominous, noting that pain-free doesn't mean \"disease or problem free,\" even if wisdom teeth come in normally. Only teeth that are \"completely erupted and functional, painless, cavity-free, in a hygenic environment with healthy gum tissue, and are disease-free may not require extraction.\"\n\nNot a disease\n\nDentist and public health expert Dr. Jay Friedman started the argument against the procedure four decades ago in an article published in the Journal of the California Dental Association:\n\n\"The third molar is not a disease. It is not even a vestigial appendage like the appendix without function,\" Friedman wrote. \"Ironically named the 'wisdom tooth,' the third molar is blamed for a variety of ills with a degree of vehemence that reflects more on the wisdom of dentists and especially on the self-serving interests of the specialty of oral surgeons, which derives a major portion of its income from their sacrifice.\"\n\nIn the following decades, more experts have joined Friedman's side.\n\nShutterstock Closeup of x-ray image of teeth and mouth with all four molars vertically impacted.

Rafetto, president of AAOMS, told TODAY that there are studies showing retained third molars lead to an increased risk of periodontal disease. One of those studies found that the risk of developing gum disease in the neighboring second molar rose by a factor of 1.5, or 50 percent, if the third molar had not been removed.\n\nBut that risk must be weighed against the possible risks of the surgery, Friedman said.\n\nRisks of removal\n\nA 2014 study co-authored by Huang found that, among those who had wisdom teeth removed, the rate of paresthesia \u2014numbness and tingling \u2014in the lips and/or tongue was nine times greater than in people who did not have the surgery. The rate of temporomandibular disorder \u2014 jaw pain upon wide opening and pain in the temples, jaw joint or jaw muscles \u2014was nearly four times greater.\n\nThere is also a very rare risk of death, which is generally tied to general anesthesia.\n\nRelated: Teen dies after 'routine' wisdom tooth surgery\n\nRafetto suggests patients talk to an oral surgeon.\n\n\"It's really important to have informed consent on the current situation, as well as the consequences of not removing them,\" said Rafetto. \"There are people who have third molars who can maintain them.\"\n\nWait and see\n\nWisdom teeth are easier to remove when the patient is younger because the roots aren't completely formed, according to the AAOMS.\n\nAnd there was the issue of teens being removed from their parents' insurance policies at age 18. But with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are required to offer coverage up to age 26.\n\n\"Now parents aren't under the gun so much to take out the wisdom teeth at 18, \" says Huang. \"So you can wait and see how they develop. Most of the time, if they're going to erupt, they'll do so by the time you're in your mid-20s.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Having wisdom teeth pulled has long been a rite of passage for many teens and young adults.", "author": "Linda Carroll", "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "description": "Having wisdom teeth pulled has long been a rite of passage for many teens and young adults.", "title": "Is it wise to have wisdom teeth removed?
