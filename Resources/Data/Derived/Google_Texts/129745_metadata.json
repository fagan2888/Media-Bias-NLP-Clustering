Upon further review, Trende is now convinced he\u2019s right, and that Team Obama is cooking the books to serve their narrative:\n\nThere were two major problems with the administration\u2019s numbers. First, of the 4 million new enrollees, more than half of were in states that did not even undertake the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. So we can be pretty comfortable that the number of enrollees due to the ACA is no more than 1.9 million, using the data provided by the administration. (There are probably some previously eligible folk who decided to apply after hearing about the expansion, but their number is likely relatively small.) \u2026 The second issue is that of those 1.9 million, some would have enrolled (or re-enrolled) in the program under the pre-expansion rules. Every state had a Medicaid program in place prior to the expansion, although the eligibility level varied widely from state to state, and therefore would have signed up people in the program absent the new funding.\n\nClick through for Trende\u2019s updated analysis, which examines Arkansas as a case study to extrapolate and estimate the true number of newly-eligible Americans who\u2019ve signed up for Medicaid as a result of Obamacare. (Spoiler: It\u2019s less than a quarter of what the administration is bragging about in public). Meanwhile, the White House won\u2019t tell us what percentage of Americans who have \u201cselected plans\u201d through Obamacare\u2019s exchanges are actually paid up and enrolled. Not that it necessarily matters; even some of those consumers who\u2019ve followed through on every jot and tittle still haven\u2019t managed to obtain coverage. Beyond that, HHS\u2019 recent disclosure on the percentage of \u2018young invincibles\u2019 within state-level risk pools portends significant adverse selection disruptions ahead. And the administration\u2019s \u201ccost containment\u201d story is a fiction. Distorting, withholding and downplaying data: How else is a desperate political operation supposed to shift the punishing winds of public opinion?\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysis: It sure looks like the WH\u2019s Medicaid expansion stats are made up", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "The always-sharp Sean Trende first voiced his suspicions about the Obama administration\u2019s official Medicaid numbers last week, arguing that the advertised \u201c4 million new enrollments und\u2026", "title": "Analysis: It sure looks like the WH\u2019s Medicaid expansion stats are made up", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2014/01/14/analysis-it-sure-looks-like-the-whs-medicaid-expansion-stats-are-made-up/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/lnzoqlcaa0exksimoo5zeg.png", "identifier": "http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/lnzoqlcaa0exksimoo5zeg.png"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/lnzoqlcaa0exksimoo5zeg.png?w=1400", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-14T06:05:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-14T17:58:12+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "First, of the 4 million new enrollees, more than half of were in states that did not even undertake the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\nEvery state had a Medicaid program in place prior to the expansion, although the eligibility level varied widely from state to state, and therefore would have signed up people in the program absent the new funding.\n(There are probably some previously eligible folk who decided to apply after hearing about the expansion, but their number is likely relatively small.)\nAnalysis: It sure looks like the WH\u2019s Medicaid expansion stats are made upposted at 1:05 am on January 14, 2014 by Guy BensonThe always-sharp Sean Trende first voiced his suspicions about the Obama administration\u2019s official Medicaid numbers last week, arguing that the advertised \u201c4 million new enrollments under Obamacare!\u201d figure was almost certainly a wild exaggeration.\nDistorting, withholding and downplaying data: How else is a desperate political operation supposed to shift the punishing winds of public opinion?"}
