Yet more studies are showing it can also be very successful -- in some cases, more so than drugs and lifestyle changes.\n\nDespite what experts are calling \u201cremarkable\u201d results, though, they\u2019re not saying weight loss surgery is a cure.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not for everyone, they stress.\n\nHere\u2019s what they do know: A recent study found that type 2 diabetes can stay in remission for as long as 15 years after weight-loss surgery. Remission happens when a person with diabetes achieves blood sugar levels no longer in the diabetes range without medications for at least one year.\n\nThe research bolstered previous shorter-term findings that suggest the surgery somehow changes the body\u2019s metabolism and calms diabetes in certain people.\n\nSurgeons who routinely do the surgery say they're not surprised at the study's findings. It showed that 30% of people with type 2 diabetes were in remission 15 years post-surgery, compared to 7% whose diabetes was managed with drugs and lifestyle changes.\n\nSurgery could be a life-saver for certain obese people with diabetes, experts say. They include people who:\n\nHave tried to lose weight by traditional methods but could not\n\nHave had trouble managing their diabetes\n\nHad had diabetes for less than 4 years\n\nEven among people with diabetes who are good candidates, surgery should not become the first treatment they try, experts say.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely the last stop. We are there for the person who has tried everything,\u201d says Richard Stahl, MD. He's the medical director of bariatric surgery at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nRecovering from surgery can take up to 2 weeks. Also, people who get surgery must still make major lifestyle changes to keep the benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple fix, it\u2019s a big ordeal to qualify for, and it\u2019s not simple to recover from,\u201d Stahl says.\n\nNor is it typically covered by insurance, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. The recent findings from this study and several others are expected to add to discussion about whether insurance guidelines should be broadened to include the surgery for less-obese people -- and also about whether surgery is the best way to treat diabetes.\n\nThe average cost of weight-loss surgery ranges from $11,500 to $26,500, says Amber Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the society. Costs depend on the type of surgery and where it's done. Three types are common in the U.S. -- bypass, gastric sleeve, and gastric band. Insurance companies vary in their reimbursement policies, Hamilton says. The procedures are covered under the Affordable Care Act in 22 states, she says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Weight loss surgery is an expensive and potentially risky way to treat type 2 diabetes.
