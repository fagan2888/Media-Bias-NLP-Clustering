Man escapes police encirclement in Grover Beach

September 18, 2015

A man suspected of committing multiple felonies evaded capture as Grover Beach police were encircling him Thursday afternoon.

Robert Inacio, 21, ran from officers in the 300 block of North 13th Street. Police then set up a perimeter in the area.

But, Inacio managed to escape. He mostly likely kicked through fences before the perimeter was fully set up, according to the Grover Beach Police Department.

Police are still searching for Inacio. They describe him as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 147 pounds.

At the time of the chase, he was bare chested while wearing jeans and a ball cap.

“No doubt we will see him again,” the police department posted on its Facebook page.
