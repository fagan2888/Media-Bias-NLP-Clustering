Later this month, a university team will be one of 12 groups testing software that lets drones communicate with the system NASA is developing.\n\nThe Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) system, developed in partnership with Google, Amazon, and a handful of other companies, will be akin to the air-traffic-control system used with traditional aircraft, but designed to work with small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) traveling at lower altitudes.\n\nThe system will allow for geofencing (blocking off airspace, like around airports), collision detection, and guidance based on weather conditions, among other things. Ultimately, the goal is a system that functions semiautonomously, with computers handling things like collision avoidance without human intervention.\n\nWhile the use of consumer drones continues to raise privacy and safety concerns, companies like Google and Amazon are anxious to work out the logistics of filling the skies with UAVs. Google received a patent for a drone \"ambulance\" in June, and Amazon wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers.\n\nThe online retail giant says it plans to launch its program when the \"regulatory support needed\" is in place. Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been dragging its feet in actually providing such support.\n\n\"NASA\u2019s effort comes as the FAA has promised to integrate commercial drones into the national airspace,\" according to the Sun article quoted above. The chief engineer on the UNR team said, ultimately, the goal is provide the system to the FAA.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Google, Amazon, and the University of Nevada, Reno are all involved.", "title": "NASA to Begin Testing Air-Traffic-Control System for Drones", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/13/nasa-to-begin-testing-air-traffic-contro", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14394930197174.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Google, Amazon, and the University of Nevada, Reno are all involved.", "title": "NASA to Begin Testing Air-Traffic-Control System for Drones", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14394930197174.jpg", "creator": "@crdenn", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2015-08-13T19:45:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/cr-denning"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3927\"", "article_summary": "Later this month, a university team will be one of 12 groups testing software that lets drones communicate with the system NASA is developing.\nNASA is set to begin testing an air-traffic-control system for drones, the Las Vegas Sun reports:Researchers at [the University of Nevada, Reno] are collaborating with NASA and two drone companies to test an air traffic control system for low-flying unmanned aircraft.\nThe chief engineer on the UNR team said, ultimately, the goal is provide the system to the FAA.\nGoogle received a patent for a drone \"ambulance\" in June, and Amazon wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers.\n\"NASA\u2019s effort comes as the FAA has promised to integrate commercial drones into the national airspace,\" according to the Sun article quoted above."}
