Malone isn\u2019t counting on the team\u2019s leading scorer to play during a seven-game homestand that starts Monday and wraps up March 12.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for him. He was having a career year,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough when you lose a player like Gallo for us because we\u2019re so young and he gives us so many things. But just for him, as a young man, because that\u2019s a lot to handle and for him to hurt it and be out for a long period of time, it\u2019s not good for any of us. But we\u2019ll support him in every way we can and hopefully he can come back even better.\u201d\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nMalone said Gallinari, who suffered the injury in a game Friday at Dallas, had an MRI on Saturday.\n\nThat result confirmed a sprained ankle, but it didn\u2019t hold much \u201cgood\u201d news beyond that.\n\nGallinari will be out until at least mid-March and possibly longer than that. The Nuggets\u2019 season ends April 13 at Portland.\n\n\u201cHe got to meet with the doctors and kind of confer on what\u2019s the best course of action,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd then just do as much rehab as possible\u201d\n\nGallinari is averaging 34.7 minutes and a career-high 19.5 points per game. For the 11 games he played in February, he averaged 19.7 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists.\n\n\u201cFor me, preparing, moving forward to this seven-game homestand, I don\u2019t think he plays in any of these seven games,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHopefully I\u2019m wrong. We\u2019ll have a much better outlook, if you will, in the next couple of days when we really see when the swelling goes down, where it\u2019s at. But we\u2019re going to prepare moving forward without Gallo for the time being.\u201d\n\nMalone said he tried different combinations of players during practice Sunday but hadn\u2019t determined who is going to start games while Gallinari is unable to play.\n\nDenver\u2019s seven-game homestand begins against Memphis, whose roster has undergone an extreme makeover. Trades and a season-ending foot injury suffered by center Marc Gasol have remade the Grizzlies (34-24) into a smaller, spread-you-out team. They can still get physical on the offensive end with Zach Randolph, but the grit-and-grind personality they have been known for has generally been replaced by smaller lineups with more finesse.\n\nThat will help the smaller Nuggets (23-36) in matchups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure right now, to be very honest,\u201d Malone said of his lineup. \u201cWe could go with Will (Barton), we could go with JaKarr (Sampson), we could go with (Darrell Arthur). We could go really small, we could go really big. So, we have some options.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nMEMPHIS AT DENVER 7 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Vince Carter:\n\nEighteen seasons in the NBA haven\u2019t sapped all the energy from Vince Carter, one of the best dunkers in the history of the league. At 39 years old, the North Carolina product doesn\u2019t fly nearly as high. But lately he has been very productive. In his past five games, Carter is averaging 12.8 points and 3.4 rebounds. And he has been a big-time threat from 3-point range, making 46 percent of his shots during that span. Five of his eight double-figure scoring games this season have come in February. He had 19 points in 20 minutes Friday in Los Angeles against the Lakers.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nJameer Nelson suited up for the past three games but didn\u2019t play, primarily because of a wrist injury. He has been downgraded to doubtful for Monday\u2019s game against the Grizzlies. D.J. Augustin has been the backup point guard with Nelson out of action. \u2026 This is the start of the Nuggets\u2019 second-longest homestand of the season. When these seven games have been played, the Nuggets will have only six home games the rest of the season.\n\nGrizzlies:\n\nMarc Gasol had season-ending surgery Feb. 20 to repair a Grade 2 nondisplaced fracture of a bone in his right foot. The 7-footer from Spain finished with averages of 16.6 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. The Grizzlies have played well without him, going 4-2 in the six games he has missed.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari to miss extended period of time", "title": "Nuggets forward Danilo Gallinari to miss extended period of time", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/28/nuggets-forward-danilo-gallinari-to-miss-extended-period-of-time/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160210__Danilo-Gallinarip1-3.jpg", "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160210__Danilo-Gallinarip1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T20:18:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:23:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Sunday he expects veteran forward Danilo Gallinari to miss \u201can extended period of time\u201d because of a severely sprained right ankle.\n\u201cFor me, preparing, moving forward to this seven-game homestand, I don\u2019t think he plays in any of these seven games,\u201d Malone said.\nThe Nuggets\u2019 season ends April 13 at Portland.\nThat will help the smaller Nuggets (23-36) in matchups.\nMalone isn\u2019t counting on the team\u2019s leading scorer to play during a seven-game homestand that starts Monday and wraps up March 12."}
