The family was also very poor.\n\nAt one time, their home was the size of a tool shed with no running water. Garza and his siblings would have to warm up buckets of water on the stove so that when their parents returned from working out in the fields, they would be able to bathe with small cups of warm water.\n\nDespite their needs, Garza\u2019s parents refused to apply for welfare.\n\n\u201cThey were very proud of their self-reliance and independence,\u201d Garza said of his parents. \u201cThey had come to America with the mindset that they were going to work hard and that they were going to save. And that\u2019s exactly what they did.\u201d\n\nEventually, his parents bought a motel using the money they made by buying and selling small properties. They continued to buy and sell properties until they retired with enough money to live comfortably.\n\nFollowing in his parent\u2019s footsteps, Garza went on to be successful as well. He went from being a police officer to being a city council member and eventually a White House aide under President George W. Bush.\n\nGarza is now head of the LIBRE Initiative, which is considered one of the most powerful Latino conservative groups in the nation.\n\nHow the LIBRE Initiative is reaching out to Latinos\n\nGarza launched the LIBRE Initiative in 2011 with the goal of advocating for economic freedom and providing the market-based perspective on a number of issues important to Latinos.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the left has dominated the discussion and the conversation within the Hispanic community for far too long, and there has been an absence of the conservative market-based position,\u201d he told VOXXI. \u201cNow that we can engage at the national level and in every corner of the country, we\u2019re totally going to take that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe LIBRE Initiative is based in Texas and has a total of nine offices in states with large Latino populations, including Florida, California and Arizona.\n\nGarza said his group wants to not only serve as a conservative voice for Latinos but also equip the Latino community with \u201cempowerment tools\u201d they need to be prosperous. Using the money it raises from donors \u2014 among them billionaires Charles and David Koch \u2014 the group provides Latinos with a number of social services to help them succeed.\n\nFor example, the group organizes free health clinics and English classes year-round. Last year, it provided free tax preparation services as well as legal advice related to immigration and home foreclosures. This year, it will begin to offer free GED courses online.\n\n\u201cWe feel those things can be a step-up for people,\u201d Garza told VOXXI of the services it offers Latinos.\n\nBesides providing services to Latinos, the LIBRE Initiative has launched several campaigns like the \u201cShare the Dream\u201d campaign, which is composed of four videos featuring Garza and three other Latinos whose parents are also immigrants.\n\nGarza said the \u201cShare the Dream\u201d campaign focuses on the common thread that often lead Latinos to achieve the American Dream. He added that the campaign aims to highlight some of the policies that have proven to help Latinos become successful in the United States and the ones that haven\u2019t.\n\nAnother campaign by the LIBRE Initiative focuses on highlighting the problems that the group says Latinos face with the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The campaign dubbed \u201cThe Accountability Project\u201d also goes after members of Congress who support the health care law.\n\nLast week, the campaign went after Rep. Joe Garcia (D-Fla.) in a television ad where a Latina doctor from Florida cites some of the concerns she has about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s plans are getting canceled. Their premiums are going up, but politicians like Congressman Joe Garcia support it,\u201d Dr. Grazie Christie says in the ad. \u201cAll we\u2019ve seen are broken promises, so congressman, people demand to know: Why do you support this law?\u201d\n\nGOP turns to Garza for advice on Latino outreach\n\nThe LIBRE Initiative has become so successful that some Republicans are now turning to Garza for advice on how to reach out to Latino voters. He has been invited to speak at numerous Republican events, including last year\u2019s CPAC conference, the largest annual gathering of conservatives.\n\nGarza said he advices Republicans to do more than just talk to Latinos.\n\n\u201cIn order to get the political victories that you\u2019re seeking, of course, you have to earn the trust and the respect of the community,\u201d he told VOXXI. \u201cAnd in order to gain their respect and trust, you have to engage with them not three months before an election but year in, year out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou also have to explain your policy positions in order to earn the vote of the community\u2026 and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve done an effective job of that,\u201d Garza added.\n\nHe also advises the Republican Party to go into Latino neighborhoods and talk to Latinos about issues \u2014 other than immigration reform \u2014 that are important to them. Some issues he recommended are the economy, health care and education.\n\nThe Republican Party has its own Latino outreach efforts in place. The party began to ramp up those efforts following the 2012 elections when Latino voters overwhelmingly voted for President Barack Obama over Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nGarza said he predicts the Republican Party will continue to improve its efforts to attract Latino voters, especially ahead of the 2014 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see the ramping up of the outreach and the engagement with the Hispanic community, which has been a long time in coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the Republican Party stepping up and doing what they need to do.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Census: Latinos By The Numbers Census: Latinos By The Numbers\n\n1 of 21 53 Million The Hispanic population of the United States as of July 1, 2012, making people of Hispanic origin the nation's largest ethnic or racial minority.
