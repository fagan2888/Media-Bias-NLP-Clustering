WASHINGTON — Debbie Houlberg, 53, snagged a selfie with Sen. Ted Cruz after his Value Voters Summit speech. It was her first up close experience with her favorite GOP candidate.

“He can get up and talk from his heart, without reading from a teleprompter. He is not just acting. It is really what he feels,” said Houlberg. “He knows his stuff and has an inner conviction of the truth.”

Cruz’s call for a flat tax and abolishing the IRS resonated with Houlberg, an interior designer from Atlanta.

“My husband and I actually make quite a bit of money, but so much of our money was going to taxes,” she said. “We work really hard and want to make sure that the people that are in control are using our money wisely and being good stewards. He would be.”

David Serenda, 46, has supported Cruz since his 2013 filibuster, and his role in a government shutdown in an attempt to defund Obamacare..

“He is a consistent conservative. He has not committed a sin against conservative values,” Serenda said, contrasting Cruz with other contenders. “He is a principled conservative and stood up to Washington, and stood up to corruption in his own party. That takes a high level of boldness.”

Candidates who’ve never held elected office have led the GOP field: Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina between them have drawn about half of all support from voters. But Serenda, a homemaker from Baltimore, said it’s too risky to support anyone unproven in elected office – given Cruz an edge among the outsiders.

“There is a move to vote for an outsider. My issue is how do we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are going to stand on principle and have the courage to stand alone?” Serenda said.
