(NYSE:UAM) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nResults of Fourth Quarter 2014\n\nUniversal American\u2019s reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $12.5 million, or $0.15 per share. Adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $0.2 million, or less than $0.01 per share, which excludes the following after-tax items:\n\n$1.2 million, or $0.01 per share, of net realized investment losses;\n\n$5.6 million, or $0.07 per share, of tax benefits;\n\n$9.6 million, or $0.12 per share, of legal and settlement costs related to APS Healthcare and Traditional Insurance; and\n\n$7.1 million, or $0.09 per share, of expenses associated with our investment in our Accountable Care Organization (ACO) business.\n\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 were approximately $500 million.\n\nFull Year 2014\n\nUniversal American\u2019s reported net loss for the full year 2014 was $29.5 million, or $0.35 per share. Adjusted net income for the full year 2014 was $5.8 million, or $0.07 per share, which excludes the following after-tax items:\n\n$2.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of net realized investment losses;\n\n$5.8 million, or $0.07 per share, of tax benefits;\n\n$18.7 million, or $0.22 per share, of legal and settlement costs related to APS Healthcare and Traditional Insurance; and\n\n$20.0 million, or $0.24 per share, of losses associated with our investment in our ACO business.\n\nTotal revenues for full year 2014 were approximately $2.0 billion.\n\nManagement Comments\n\nRichard A. Barasch, Chairman and CEO, commented, \u201cDuring 2014, we made significant progress putting past issues behind us and focusing our energy and resources on growing our core businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have entered 2015 with a great deal of optimism. Most importantly, we have reset our Medicare Advantage business to focus on those markets where we can positively impact the quality and cost of healthcare. Approximately 86% of our members are in plans with 4 Stars and we remain highly focused on further improving the metrics that underlie these ratings. In addition, we have set an administrative expense ratio target of approximately 10.5% for Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cWe continued to expand our market leadership in the growing Houston/Beaumont region. Our membership increased 10% for the third straight year, largely as a result of the continued success and expansion of our partnerships with primary care physicians. We have a successful 15 year history of working closely with our physician partners to improve quality and reduce cost for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cAn emerging success story is developing in our Northeast markets, especially central New York. We are in the process of converting a fee for service market into a more value-based system by introducing pay for performance to primary care physicians in the region. We had a strong 2015 Annual Election Period, 26% growth in membership, and combined with our Medicare Shared Savings ACO and our Total Care Medicaid plan, we are the largest sponsor of government programs in central New York.\n\n\u201cWe are also optimistic about the Medicare Shared Savings ACO program, both under the existing rules and especially if the current rule-making process removes some of the weaknesses that now exist and offers ACOs more options to expand their risk taking.\u201d\n\nMedicare Advantage\n\nAs we have previously disclosed, we did not renew our non-core and rural markets for 2015, representing approximately 22,600 members. Our core markets consist of our members in Texas, Upstate New York and Maine.\n\nJanuary 31, December 31, Membership (in thousands) 2015 Est. 2014 Southwest HMO 67.0 61.7 Other Core Network 37.6 29.7 Core Markets 104.6 91.5 Non-Core Network - 20.7 Rural - 1.9 Total Membership 104.6 114.1\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, Financial Performance ($ in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Revenue $ 342.8 $ 410.9 $ 1,409.4 $ 1,635.9 Operating Income $ 4.9 $ 11.7 $ 47.8 $ 53.5\n\nThe Medicare Advantage segment operating income decreased during the three month and full year period ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of the new Affordable Care Act Fee (\u201cACA Fee\u201d), lower membership and a decrease in favorable prior period items, offset by lower administrative expenses.\n\nThe full year 2014 included $22.9 million of expense related to the ACA Fee. The fourth quarter of 2014 included $5.6 million of the ACA Fee.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Medical Benefit Ratio ($ in millions) Premiums $ 1,393.4 $ 1,617.2 Quality Initiatives1 $ 28.4 2.0% $ 28.4 1.8% Medical Benefits 1,142.6 82.0% 1,348.6 83.4% Total Benefits $ 1,171.0 84.0% $ 1,377.0 85.1%\n\n1 Beginning in 2014, in connection with the reporting of minimum medical loss ratios under the Affordable Care Act,we are reporting the costs of quality improvement initiatives in claims and other benefits in the consolidated statements of operations. Historically, these costs were reported in other operating costs and expenses. To maintain consistency with the new reporting classification, we have reclassified $28.4 million and $8.5 million from other operating costs and expenses to claims and other benefits for the twelve months and three months ended December 31, 2013, respectively.\n\nFor the full year 2014, our reported MBR included positive prior period items of $33.0 million, pre-tax. Excluding these prior period items, our adjusted Medical Benefits MBR was 84.2%, compared to the reported amount of 82.0%. Our core markets had an adjusted Medical Benefits MBR of 82.7%, the non-core markets were 88.6% and the rural markets, with approximately 2,000 members, were 98.8%, in each case excluding expenses associated with quality initiatives.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2014 Three Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2013 Medical Benefit Ratio ($ in millions) Premiums $ 339.1 $ 406.6 Quality Initiatives1 $ 6.7 2.0% $ 8.5 2.1% Medical Benefits 276.8 81.6% 328.6 80.8% Total Benefits $ 283.5 83.6% $ 337.1 82.9%\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2014, our reported MBR included positive prior period items of $5.6 million, pre-tax. Excluding these prior period items, our adjusted Medical Benefits MBR was 83.5%, compared to the reported amount of 81.6%. Our core markets had an adjusted MBR of 82.0%; the non-core markets were 88.7% and the rural markets were 92.7%, in each case excluding expenses associated with quality initiatives.\n\nThe administrative expense ratio for the full year 2014, excluding the ACA Fee of $22.9 million and $28.4 million of quality initiative expenses, was 12.0%, compared to 12.7% for the same period in 2013. For the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding the ACA Fee of $5.6 million and $6.7 million of quality initiative expenses, the administrative expense ratio was 14.4%, compared to 15.3% in 2013. Our administrative expense ratio is typically higher in the fourth quarter as a result of sales and marketing costs incurred in that period.\n\nTraditional Insurance Three Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, Financial Performance ($ in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Revenue $ 47.9 $ 55.3 $ 203.8 $ 233.2 Operating (Loss) Income $ (0.8) $ (0.8) $ 2.5 $ 10.9\n\nRevenue in our Traditional Insurance segment declined in the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 due to the continued run-off of our legacy insurance products, which we stopped marketing and selling after June 1, 2012.\n\nCorporate & Other Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Financial Performance ($ in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 Revenue $ 112.3 $ 73.1 $ 431.1 $ 282.9 Operating Loss $ (27.7) $ (124.3) $ (82.8) $ (281.5)\n\nCorporate & Other includes the results of our ACOs, the Total Care Medicaid plan, APS Healthcare, and the operations of our parent holding company, including debt service.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, Pre-Tax Income (Loss) ($ in millions) 2014 2013 2014 2013 ACOs $ (10.9) $ (13.2) $ (30.8) $ (41.6) Total Care 0.4 (0.4) 2.6 (0.5) APS Healthcare 4.4 (1.8) 10.3 (4.1) Legal/Settlement costs (14.7) (1.9) (28.8) (6.2) Interest expense (1.7) (1.7) (7.0) (6.6) Corporate (5.2) (7.6) (29.1) (33.1) APS Asset impairment - (97.7) - (189.4) Operating Loss $ (27.7) $ (124.3) $ (82.8) $ (281.5)\n\nThe ACO loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 decreased $2.3 million from 2013 as a result of lower expenses incurred. For the full year, our ACO loss improved $10.8 million as we received $13.4 million in savings for the first program year.\n\nTotal Care results for 2014 reflect a full year of activity compared to one month in 2013.\n\nAPS Healthcare recorded operating profits for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 compared to pre-tax losses in the comparable 2013 periods due to shedding unprofitable contracts and reducing expenses.\n\nCorporate results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014 were lower than those in the comparable 2013 periods due to corporate expense reduction initiatives and higher investment income.\n\nAs previously disclosed, on February 4, 2015 we completed the sale of our APS Healthcare Puerto Rico subsidiaries to an affiliate of the Metro Pavia Health System. APS Puerto Rico provides managed behavioral health services for the Government Health Plan Medicaid program under a contract that terminates on March 31, 2015.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn September 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s executive compensation deduction limitation for health insurance providers under Code section 162(m)(6), which provided additional information regarding the definition of a health insurance issuer. Based on our analysis of the final regulations, we no longer believe we are subject to the limitation. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a tax benefit of $3.2 million related to prior years and $1.7 million related to the first nine months of 2014.\n\nInvestment Portfolio\n\nAs of December 31, 2014, Universal American had $1.0 billion of cash and invested assets as follows:\n\n25% is invested in U.S. Government and agency securities;\n\nThe average credit quality of the investment portfolio is AA-; and\n\nApproximately 1% of the investment portfolio is non-investment grade.\n\nA complete listing of our fixed income investment portfolio as of December 31, 2014 is available for review in the financial supplement located in the Investors \u2013 Financial Reports section of our website, www.UniversalAmerican.com.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\n\nAs of December 31, 2014, Universal American\u2019s Balance Sheet had the following characteristics:\n\nTotal cash and investments were $1.0 billion and total assets were $2.0 billion;\n\nTotal policyholder liabilities were $1.1 billion and total liabilities were $1.4 billion;\n\nStockholders\u2019 equity was $614.5 million and book value was $7.30 per diluted common share;\n\nTangible book value per diluted common share (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, goodwill, amortizing intangibles and deferred acquisition costs) was $5.57;\n\nUnregulated cash and investments of $109.8 million;\n\n$103.4 million of bank debt; and\n\n$40.0 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, reported as a liability, with an annual dividend rate of 8.5%.\n\nThe ratio of debt to total capital, excluding the effect of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and including Universal American\u2019s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as debt was 19.2%.\n\nConference Call\n\nUniversal American will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 19, 2015 to discuss financial results and other corporate developments.

(1) The effective tax rate was 51.1% for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 9.7% for the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate was 13.1%, compared with 5.4% for 2013. For the three months and full year ended December 31, 2014, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to non-recurring tax benefits net of permanent items, primarily the new ACA fee and preferred dividends, and foreign and state income taxes. Non-recurring tax benefits in 2014 primarily relate to the reversal of executive compensation previously considered non-deductible under Code section 162(m)(6) that resulted in the recording of a $3.2 million receivable, recording of $1.3 million of foreign tax credits related to APS Healthcare and a $0.7 million reserve release related to items on which the statute of limitations has expired. (2) Diluted book value per common share (excluding AOCI) represents Total Stockholders\u2019 Equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d), plus assumed proceeds from the exercise of vested, in-the-money options, divided by the total shares outstanding plus the shares assumed issued from the exercise of vested, in-the-money options. (3) Tangible book value per common share represents Total Stockholders\u2019 Equity, excluding AOCI and intangible assets plus assumed proceeds from the exercise of vested, in-the-money options, divided by the total shares outstanding plus the shares assumed issued from the exercise of vested, in-the-money options. (4) The Debt to Total Capital Ratio (excluding AOCI) is calculated as the ratio of the Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares to the sum of Stockholders\u2019 Equity (excluding AOCI) plus the Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares. (5) Adjusted net (loss) income is calculated as net (loss) income excluding the following items on after tax basis: asset impairment, net realized gains and losses, non-recurring tax benefits/expenses, ACO costs and other non-recurring items.\n\nUNIVERSAL AMERICAN CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In millions, except per share amounts (Unaudited)\n\nUniversal American uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company\u2019s performance for the periods presented in this press release. You should not consider non-GAAP measures to be an alternative to measurements required by GAAP. Because Universal American\u2019s calculation of these measures may differ from the calculation of similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Universal American\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. We have not included a reconciliation of projected earnings per diluted share because projections for some components of this reconciliation are not possible to forecast at this time. The key non-GAAP measures presented in our press release, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, are set forth below.\n\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net loss $ (12.5) $ (101.8) $ (29.5) $ (192.3) Net realized losses (gains), after-tax 1.2 (0.4) 2.4 (9.0) Non-recurring tax (benefit) expense (5.6) 2.0 (5.8) 1.2 ACO results, after-tax 7.1 8.6 20.0 26.7 Asset impairment charge, after-tax - 87.5 - 178.1 Other non-recurring items, after-tax 9.6 1.2 18.7 4.0 Adjusted net (loss) income $ (0.2) $ (2.9) $ 5.8 $ 8.7 Per share (diluted) Net loss $ (0.15) $ (1.16) $ (0.35) $ (2.20) Net realized losses (gains), after-tax 0.01 (0.01) 0.03 (0.10) Non-recurring tax (benefit) expense (0.07) 0.02 (0.07) 0.01 ACO results, after-tax 0.09 0.10 0.24 0.30 Asset impairment charge, after-tax - 1.00 - 2.04 Other non-recurring items, after-tax 0.12 0.01 0.22 0.05 Adjusted net (loss) income $ (0.00) $ (0.04) $ 0.07 $ 0.10\n\nUniversal American uses adjusted net (loss) income, calculated as net loss excluding net realized (losses) gains after-tax, non-recurring tax benefit, ACO results after-tax, asset impairment charge after-tax, and other non-recurring items after-tax as a basis for evaluating operating results. Although the excluded items may recur, we believe that the excluded items do not relate to the performance of Universal American\u2019s core business operations and that adjusted net (loss) income provides a more useful comparison of our business performance from period to period.\n\nTotal Stockholders\u2019 Equity (excluding AOCI) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Total stockholders\u2019 equity $ 614.5 $ 664.9 Less: Accumulated other comprehensive income (12.7) (7.3) Total stockholders\u2019 equity (excluding AOCI) $ 601.8 $ 657.6\n\nUNIVERSAL AMERICAN CORP.
