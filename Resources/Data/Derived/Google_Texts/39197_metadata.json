A week ago he accused the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of unfairly targeting him because of his views on Affordable Care Act. Now, he\u2019s comparing the Obama administration\u2019s healthcare reforms to slavery.\n\n\"You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" Carson said Friday during a speech at the Values Voter Summit. \"And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about healthcare. It was about control.\"\n\nCarson went on to say that slavery was a \u201cclear evil,\u201d as is the Affordable Care Act because it \u201cis going to have a negative impact on everything in our society.\u201d\n\nCarson is a retired neurosurgeon who was the director of pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Hospital. He was recently hired as a contributor at the conservative Fox News network, but according to The Hill, Carson may have his eyes set on the U.S. presidency.\n\n\"[Running for president] is not something I have any desire to do whatsoever, but I certainly listen,\u201d said Carson. \"If the circumstances were to evolve in such a way that that seemed to be what God was calling me to do, I would certainly do it. And I would never turn my back on my fellow citizens, if there was a hue and cry for such.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ben carson, obamacare, slavery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Republican Dr. Ben Carson likened the Affordable Care Act's healthcare reforms to slavery in a speech Friday night.", "title": "Neurosurgeon Ben Carson On Obamacare: \u2018It\u2019s The Worst Thing Since Slavery\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/neurosurgeon-ben-carson-obamacare-its-worst-thing-slavery-259726", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/12/slave.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican Dr. Ben Carson likened the Affordable Care Act's healthcare reforms to slavery in a speech Friday night.", "title": "Neurosurgeon Ben Carson On Obamacare: \u2018It\u2019s The Worst Thing Since Slavery\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/neurosurgeon-ben-carson-obamacare-its-worst-thing-slavery-259726", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/12/slave.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/12/slave.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-10-12T17:37:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-12T17:37:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Republican Dr. Ben Carson likened the Affordable Care Act's healthcare reforms to slavery in a speech Friday night."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc553\"", "article_summary": "\"You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" Carson said Friday during a speech at the Values Voter Summit.\nA week ago he accused the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of unfairly targeting him because of his views on Affordable Care Act.\nNow, he\u2019s comparing the Obama administration\u2019s healthcare reforms to slavery.\n\"And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about healthcare.\n\"[Running for president] is not something I have any desire to do whatsoever, but I certainly listen,\u201d said Carson."}
