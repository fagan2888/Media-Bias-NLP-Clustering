It's just very, very upsetting for anybody who sees the inside of it,\" General Manager Molly Langley said.\n\nThe CO-OP Natural Foods store has been at its current location, off of Minnesota Avenue, since 2005.\n\nMonday, CO-OP managers are meeting with inspectors to assess the damage.\n\n\"It wasn't a flaming kind of thing where people could see, but just melty-type, smoke damage. The food is gone,\" Langley said.\n\nPolice noticed smoke coming out of the building early Sunday morning and contacted fire officials.\n\nLangley says the CO-OP now has 2,500 owners and the support has been overwhelming.\n\nBecause it is a CO-OP, the vendors who supply the goods are now a concern.\n\n\"We have 40 to 60 local vendors who sell through us. So we're like a covered, year-round farmer's market. So this has a tremendous affect on all of those small vendors who sell through us,\" Langley said.\n\nLangley says a POD will serve as a conversation board for CO-OP owners and customers, to stay up to date on the most recent developments, as the store gets repaired. The POD will also hold materials that were salvaged to be used when the store can re-open.\n\nLangley hopes the damage isn't too severe, so they can fix-up the community store and keep it at this location.\n\n\"The cooperative business model is an idea. It's not just a thing or a location. And so we'll go on because we have been here for 40 years, and you can't burn an idea,\" Langley said.\n\nYou can find updates from the CO-OP at its Facebook page and its website.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Owners of the CO-OP Natural Foods store in Sioux Falls are assessing the damage after what they&#39;re calling a weekend burglary and arson.
