Hodges Friday that marriage equality is the law nationwide, as tweeted out by White House photographer Pete Souza.\n\nNot everyone is as elated, of course. Some opponents of the freedom to marry are balking in bad soap opera-ish incidents around the country. Lawmakers in Mississippi are considering denying issuing marriage licenses altogether and Ray Moore, the chief justice of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court, said the ruling was \u201ceven worse\u201d than the Court\u2019s decision in Plessy v. Ferguson upholding the constitutional right of states to enact racial segregation laws under the doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d\u2014a 1896 decision maintained until the 1954 ruling in Brown v Board of Education.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s worse because it affects our entire system of morality and family values,\u201d Moore\u2014who\u2019s always been a states\u2019 rights kind of guy\u2014told CNN on Friday. \u201cI think the law of the land is plain. It\u2019s the United States Constitution. Not an opinion of the Supreme Court which contradicts that law.\u201d So much for his depth of knowledge about how the three branches of federal government operate.\n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, on the other hand, apparently took a civics class in high school and understands that, despite his own personal opinion, the Supreme Court has the final say.\n\n\u201cI have to uphold not only the constitution of Alabama, but I swore to uphold the constitution of the United States and we will uphold the law of the United States. I will uphold the law of the nation and this is now the law,\u201d Bentley told reporters Friday.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates also pushed back. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he\u2019s going to push for a constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz told Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity: \u201cToday, it\u2019s some of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tried to have it both ways: \u201cIt is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate.\u201d\n\nBut for the most part\u2014at least for right now\u2014the country is celebrating the move towards a more perfect union, as President Obama put it.\n\nThough a number of people are questioning Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2018s over-the-top dissent, which will surely endear him to the loony right wingers:\n\n\u201cI join THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s opinion in full. I write separately to call attention to this Court\u2019s threat to American democracy,\u201d Scalia begins, saying:\n\n\u201cThe substance of today\u2019s decree is not of immense personal importance to me. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today\u2019s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. Until the courts put a stop to it, public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best.\u201d\n\nScalia jabs fellow Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, which Scalia says is \u201clacking even a thin veneer of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuried beneath the mummeries and straining-to-be-memorable passages of the opinion is a candid and startling assertion: No matter what it was the People ratified, the Fourteenth Amendment protects those rights that the Judiciary, in its \u2018reasoned judgment,\u2019 thinks the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect.\u201d\n\nScalia quotes Kennedy\u2019s passage about how the \u201cnature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality.\u201d Scalia retorts:\n\n\u201cReally? Who ever thought that intimacy and spirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s style of writing in the opinion \u201cpretentious as its content is egotistic.\u201d Scalia adds:\n\n\u201cIf, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \u2018The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\u2019 I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\n\nAnd to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation. But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today\u2019s judicial Putsch.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez delighted in addressing Scalia\u2019s reference to hippies and his dismissal of California as the handwringing of a loser on the wrong side of history in both the Obamacare and marriage equality rulings:\n\nAs the United States of America evolves, slowly becoming a more tolerant and inclusive nation, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is getting left behind, and now he\u2019s taking out his wrath on California and hippies\u2026.\n\n[Scalia] went from hand-wringing [over Obamacare] to knuckle-dragging on the gay marriage decision, arguing that the court was patrician, pretentious, egotistical and out of touch with America because its justices are successful lawyers (would we want otherwise?) who went to elite schools and grew up in either the elitist East or the wifty West but not the heartland or the South.\n\n\u201cNot a single Southwesterner or even,\u201d Scalia wrote, \u201cto tell the truth, a genuine Westerner. (California does not count.)\u201d\n\nDo you hear that, Californians?\n\nWe are so peculiar that Scalia put us in parentheses, like we had to be quarantined. (Is there any coincidence that the swing vote came from a California native, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy?)\u2026.\n\nI don\u2019t know what hippies have to do with it, but we\u2019ve got plenty of them in California, and no shortage of carnal malefactors of all sexual persuasions.\n\nJustice Scalia has discovered a 10th ring of hell, and we are it.\n\nThere\u2019s only one thing to do, California.\n\nI say we tear our clothes off, fill the streets and party like hell.\n\nWell, while Scalia develops callouses from all that knuckle-dragging, other venues that the next generation takes more seriously are celebrating LGBT Pride Month and the Supreme Court decision. YouTube Spotlight (and parent company Google) put together a compilation of videos from the LGBT community with a description that reads:\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, everyone from moms to presidents have uploaded videos in support of LGBT awareness, to stand up against bullying and discrimination, and to say together, as a community, that marriage equality matters. That\u2019s why we are so excited by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to recognize the constitutional right of all couples to marry. In recognition of Pride Month, and this historic decision, we want to celebrate the many individuals and communities that have helped inspire change.\u201d\n\nMove over Scalia, the lovers, not the H8ers, are taking over the conscience of the nation:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "#video, anthony kennedy, antonin scalia, ray moore, scotus marriage equality, steve lopez, youtube spotlight, gay news, gay los angeles, gay news california", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Frontiers Media", "description": "Something's happening here and it's perfectly clear - the country is turning away from the Culture Wars founded on hate.", "title": "More Marriage Reaction: NY Times, White House and YouTube Celebrate as Scalia\u2019s Ridiculed (Video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "https://www.frontiersmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NYT-Cover--e1435420241871.jpg", "height": 625}, "updated_time": "2015-08-10T13:39:24-07:00", "url": "https://www.frontiersmedia.com/frontiers-blog/2015/06/27/more-marriage-reaction-ny-times-white-house-and-youtube-celebrate-as-scalias-ridiculed-video/", "type": "article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-27T08:58:22-07:00", "fb": {"admins": 1023602871, "app_id": 1473823566216826}, "article": {"section": "Frontiers Blog", "tag": "YouTube Spotlight", "published_time": "2015-06-27T08:58:22-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T13:39:24-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4eb9\"", "article_summary": "More Marriage Reaction: NY Times, White House and YouTube Celebrate as Scalia\u2019s Ridiculed (Video)Something's happening here and it's perfectly clear - the country is turning away from the Culture Wars founded on hate.\n\u201cI have to uphold not only the constitution of Alabama, but I swore to uphold the constitution of the United States and we will uphold the law of the United States.\nToday\u2019s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court.\nIt\u2019s the United States Constitution.\nWell, while Scalia develops callouses from all that knuckle-dragging, other venues that the next generation takes more seriously are celebrating LGBT Pride Month and the Supreme Court decision."}
