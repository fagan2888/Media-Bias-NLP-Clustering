On October 1 —launch day — Obamacare detractors trotted out their expected criticism. Here in Florida, the Republican legislature had spurned federal funds to expand Medicaid. It banned ACA “navigators” from state health department offices where they might do the most good helping people find the best deal for themselves. It refused to set up a state insurance exchange, leaving it instead to the feds to run it without local help. It stripped the Florida’s insurance commissioner’s power to review, negotiate or reject rates set by insurance companies doing business in the state.

Opening day arrived, and despite all the efforts of our elected leaders to protect us from the socialistic ravages of Barack Obama’s signature legislation, people were so hungry for coverage that they overwhelmed the system. Frustrating difficulties continue to bedevil would-be applicants a week after the launch. If the public weren’t so dedicated to the cause of harming itself by seeking affordable health insurance, things might have gone off without a hitch.

Opponents of the ACA have been saying that the rollout — and therefore the entire legislation and the progressive philosophy that gave birth to it — is fundamentally flawed. Never mind that it is a victim of its own popularity.

If the public had bought the line that individuals and families were better off under the Republican alternative, which was to rush to an emergency room when they finally got sick enough, the stampede for coverage never would have materialized. Then, opponents could have claimed it was a nanny-state program nobody wanted, just as they contended.
