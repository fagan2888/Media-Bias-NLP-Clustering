Now, though, it's been sharpened by the words of Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe Amazon CEO wasn't one to tweet before a couple of weeks ago. But he offered a particularly pointed blast on Monday.\n\nIt read: \"Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket.\" This was accompanied by the hashtag #sendDonaldtospace.\n\nBlue Origin is Bezos' company that just successfully launched and returned to earth a reusable rocket.\n\nYou might wonder, though, what had suddenly moved Bezos to this generous, but perhaps barbed, offer. I fancy it was Trump himself.\n\nEarlier on Monday Big Don sent out several tweets deriding Bezos and his company. Sample: \"If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!\"\n\nSadly, there was no hashtag #amascam. I fear Trump missed out there.\n\nIn turn, because I can feel you spinning, you'll wonder what Trump has suddenly got against Bezos.\n\nIt might have been this somewhat mocking piece published by the Washington Post, which Bezos bought in 2013. This suggested that, on the subject of Trump predicting Osama Bin Laden's impact on the world, Trump and facts were somewhat estranged.\n\nNeither Amazon nor Trump's campaign immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nI worry too, though, about Trump's grasp of certain facts. In one of his raging tweets, he declared that Amazon was a \"no profit company.\" This is a touch strange, given that in July it insisted it made $92 million.\n\nPerhaps, though, for a billionaire of Trump's well, enormity, $92 million is indeed nothing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Technically Incorrect: After the leading Republican candidate excoriates Amazon's CEO on Twitter, he gets a wry reply.", "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "description": "Technically Incorrect: After the leading Republican candidate excoriates Amazon's CEO on Twitter, he gets a wry reply.", "title": "Jeff Bezos offers to send Donald Trump into space", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/jeff-bezos-offers-to-send-donald-trump-into-space/", "image": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/15/71a08e29-ece0-4f0c-9d34-46fd64b817e0/thumbnail/670x503/33211704f429beb131cb0c3fa8b98ef5/jeffbezospad.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Technically Incorrect: After the leading Republican candidate excoriates Amazon's CEO on Twitter, he gets a wry reply.", "title": "Jeff Bezos offers to send Donald Trump into space", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/jeff-bezos-offers-to-send-donald-trump-into-space/", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/15/71a08e29-ece0-4f0c-9d34-46fd64b817e0/thumbnail/670x503/33211704f429beb131cb0c3fa8b98ef5/jeffbezospad.jpg", "height": 503}, "creator": "@ChrisMatyszczyk", "site": "@CNET", "card": "summary", "account_id": 30261067}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/jeff-bezos-offers-to-send-donald-trump-into-space/?search=toapp", "app_name": "CNET", "app_store_id": 383989837}}, "tp": {"baseUrl": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetmpxpdk/pdk"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001036810388, "app_id": 16995676698}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.cnet.com/", "fragment": "!", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet"}, "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "msapplication-task": "name=Forums; action-uri=http://forums.cnet.com/; icon-uri=http://www.cnet.com/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "Blue Origin is Bezos' company that just successfully launched and returned to earth a reusable rocket.\nIn turn, because I can feel you spinning, you'll wonder what Trump has suddenly got against Bezos.\nThis suggested that, on the subject of Trump predicting Osama Bin Laden's impact on the world, Trump and facts were somewhat estranged.\nBlue OriginIs the Earth a big enough place for some as huge as Donald Trump?\nYou might wonder, though, what had suddenly moved Bezos to this generous, but perhaps barbed, offer."}
