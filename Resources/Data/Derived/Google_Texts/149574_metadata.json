Voters and volunteers who backed Senator Marco Rubio (R \u2013 Florida) grew increasingly subdued as election returns showed him earning the No. 5 spot in the GOP presidential primary.\n\nRubio\u2019s disappointing 10.6 percent finish must have surprised observers as seasoned as New Hampshire Union Leader editorial-page editor (and Chris Christie supporter) Grant Bosse. Over lunch at the Thirsty Moose Taphouse on Elm Street, he said on Tuesday afternoon: \u201cI don\u2019t think Marco will drop below third.\u201d\n\nNo such luck.\n\nRubio himself acknowledged the problem. Despite the \u201cMarcomentum\u201d after he barely missed second place in the Iowa Caucus, he then whiffed February 6\u2019s GOP debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Marco Rubio greets supporters in Manchester, N.H, on primary-election night. Photos by Deroy Murdock.]\n\n\u201cI know many people are disappointed,\u201d Rubio admitted in the Radisson\u2019s ballroom. \u201cI want you to understand something. Our disappointment tonight is not on you, it\u2019s on me. It\u2019s on me. I did not do wellon Saturday night. So, listen to this: That will never happen again.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s followers loudly cheered his display of personal responsibility for his self-inflicted wounds. His statement also was impressive in this age of widespread finger-pointing. Still, Rubio easily could have identified another font of his misfortune: the relentless, eight-digit attacks against him by former governor Jeb Bush (R \u2013 Florida). The latest pretender from the House of Bush won fourth place. And he won it ugly.\n\nAccording to media monitor SMG Delta, Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, spent roughly $10.2 million in New Hampshire slamming Rubio between December 8 and election night. This included some $8 million in attack ads in January alone, or about $250,000 per day. Right to Rise broadcast more than 41 hours of anti-Rubio spots. This equals 4,920 half-minute commercials, all aimed at wrecking Rubio.\n\nAtop this broadcast onslaught, Bosse recalls \u201can avalanche of slick paper\u201d filling his mailbox. \u201cWe received maybe two dozen pieces hitting Rubio, a dozen hitting Christie, and a handful hitting Cruz and Kasich.\u201d Recovering journalist and Rubio campaign surrogate Drew Cline tells me, \u201cI would estimate that, from early December through the primary, we got more than a couple dozen anti-Rubio mailers from Right to Rise. We would sometimes get two to four a day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n[\u201cJeb Bush\u2019s super PAC Right to Rise virtually sank the Granite State with anti-Rubio fliers, including this one, which activist Fergus Cullen posted online.\u201d]\n\n\u201cMy wife confirms that we received at least 15 anti-Marco mailings,\u201d says Christopher Wolfe, former New Hampshire Republican Party treasurer. \u201cThere also were phone calls and very assertive Bush supporters knocking on the door and trying to arm wrestle her to support him. Yes, Bush was leading an all-out attack on Marco.\u201d\n\nRight to Rise\u2019s anti-Rubio jihad earned a rebuke from the U.S. Senate\u2019s most senior Republican.\n\n\u201cI would rather have any leadership PAC support the person they were formed to support, not by running down others,\u201d Senate President pro tem Orrin Hatch (R \u2013 Utah) told The Hill. \u201cI would not do that. I\u2019d tell them to do things that support Jeb.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubio\u2019s weaknesses had been hammered by weeks of direct mail and television by Christie and Bush, questioning his use of party credit cards, his flip-flopping on immigration, and especially his judgment,\u201d says Andrew E. Smith, Ph.D., director of the University of New Hampshire\u2019s Survey Center. \u201cHad Rubio turned in an average performance in the debate, he might still be the media darling, and the darling of the GOP establishment. Needless to say, the debate has left both all shook up.\u201d\n\nWhile Rubio did not leave his Republican rivals unmentioned, he generally ran a positive campaign. He concentrated on how he would reinvigorate America\u2019s promise and potential, by untethering the republic from the deadweight loss that is Washington, D.C.\n\nSome 500 voters on Monday night braved steady snow, brisk breezes, and temperatures in the 20s to see Rubio at Nashua Community College\u2019s gymnasium. Respecting Mother Nature, volunteers wore badges that read, \u201cFreezin\u2019 for Our Future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristically, Rubio focused his fire on Democrats, rather than Republicans.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders is a socialist - nice guy \u2013 a nice socialist,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a socialist. We can\u2019t go down the road to socialism. People come to this country to get away from socialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton tonight,\u201d Rubio added, \u201cthe FBI confirmed that they are investigating the usage of her e-mails. We cannot elect a president that\u2019s under FBI investigation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n[ \u201cMarco Rubio in Nashua, N.H., on primary-election eve.\u201d]\n\nAs the action heads south, will Rubio sharpen his machete and go after his former mentor?\n\n\u201cSouth Carolina is gonna be a bloodbath,\u201d one Rubio aide predicted to Politico.com \u201cJeb and his people wanted to attack Marco in New Hampshire about abortion? Let\u2019s see how that plays down there. And then there\u2019s Common Core,\u201d Washington\u2019s top-down scheme to control neighborhood schools. Bush would save it. Rubio would scrap it. As his website elaborates: \u201cOn Day One, Marco will issue an Executive Order directing federal agencies to stop any and all activity related to implementing or encouraging Common Core.\u201d\n\nSouthern gentility likely will be scarce between now and February 20\u2019s Palmetto State primary. For now, though, the Granite State taught Marco Rubio that nice guys finish fifth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The mood at the Radisson Hotel here was restrained Tuesday night, to say the least.
