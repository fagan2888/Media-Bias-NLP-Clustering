Every season brings a new headline of failures: the botched roll-out of Obamacare involved 55 uncoordinated IT vendors; a White House report in February found that barely 3 percent of the $800 billion stimulus plan went to rebuild transportation infrastructure; and a March Washington Post report describes how federal pensions are processed by hand in a deep cave in Pennsylvania. The reflexive reaction is to demand detailed laws and rules to make sure things don\u2019t go wrong again. But shackling public choices with ironclad rules, ironically, is a main cause of the problems. Dictating correctness in advance supplants the one factor that is indispensable to all successful endeavors\u2014human responsibility. \u201cNothing that\u2019s good works by itself,\u201d as Thomas Edison put it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the damn thing work.\u201d\n\nResponsibility is nowhere in modern government. Who\u2019s responsible for the budget deficits? Nobody: Program budgets are set in legal concrete. Who\u2019s responsible for failing to fix America\u2019s decrepit infrastructure? Nobody. Who\u2019s responsible for not managing civil servants sensibly? You get the idea. Related Story Don't Worry About the Size of the Government Modern government is organized on \u201cclear law,\u201d the false premise that by making laws detailed enough to take in all possible circumstances, we can avoid human error. And so over the last few decades, law has gotten ever more granular. But all that regulatory detail, like sediment in a harbor, makes it hard to get anywhere. The 1956 Interstate Highway Act was 29 pages and succeeded in getting 41,000 miles of roads built by 1970. The 2012 transportation bill was 584 pages, and years will pass before workers can start fixing many of those same roads. Health-care regulators have devised 140,000 reimbursement categories for Medicare\u2014including 12 categories for bee stings and 21 categories for \u201cspacecraft accidents.\u201d This is the tip of a bureaucratic iceberg\u2014administration consumes 30 percent of health-care costs. Legal detail skews behavior in ways that are usually counterproductive. Why did VA officials regularly falsify waiting times? Bureaucratic metrics required them to meet waiting time deadlines\u2014or else they would forfeit a portion of their pay. Why didn\u2019t they just do a better job? Compliance was basically impossible: Congress had mandated more VA services but only modestly expanded resources. Undoubtedly, better efficiency could have been squeezed out of available resources, but that would require liberating VA officials from civil-service straitjackets so they could manage other civil servants. Rigid bureaucracy, not the inexcusable dishonesty of VA officials, was the underlying cause of the VA scandal. \u201cClear law\u201d turns out to be a myth. Modern law is too dense to be knowable. \u201cIt will be of little avail to the people,\u201d James Madison observed, \u201cif the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.\u201d The quest for \u201cclear law\u201d is futile also because most regulatory language is inherently ambiguous. Dense rulebooks do not avoid disputes\u2014they just divert the dispute to the parsing of legal words instead of arguing over what\u2019s right. Indeed, legal detail often undermines the regulatory goal. \u201cThe more exact and detailed a rule, the more likely it is to open up loopholes, to permit by implication conduct that the rule was intended to avoid,\u201d Judge Richard Posner observed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Put humans back in charge. Law should generally be an open framework, mainly principles and goals, leaving room for responsible people to make decisions and be held accountable for results. Law based on principles leaves room for the decision-maker always to act on this question: What\u2019s the right thing to do here? \"The more exact and detailed a rule, the more likely it is to open up loopholes, to permit by implication conduct that the rule was intended to avoid.\" Until recent decades, law based on principles was the structure of most public law. The Constitution is 10 pages long and provides basic precepts\u2014say, the Fourth Amendment prohibition on \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d\u2014without trying to define every situation. The recent Volcker Rule regulating proprietary trading, by contrast, is 950 pages, and, in the words of one banker, is \u201cincoherent any way you look at it.\u201d Legal principles have the supreme virtue of activating individual responsibility. Law is still supreme. The goals of law are centralized, but implementation is decentralized. Every successful regulatory program works this way. New airplanes, for example, must be certified as \u201cairworthy\u201d by the FAA. There are no detailed regulations that set forth how many rivets per square foot are required. It\u2019s up to the judgment of FAA officials. This system works pretty well. Which would you trust more, a plane approved by experts at the FAA or a plane that was allowed to fly merely because it satisfied a bunch of rules, many outdated? Simplifying regulation\u2014replacing thick volumes of rules with guiding principles \u2014has two more virtues as well. First, democracy is effective only when there\u2019s someone to hold accountable. Second, principles are coherent. People generally know what\u2019s expected of them. Doctrines such as \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d or a \u201cnutritious meal\u201d or \u201cindustry standards\u201d have practical meaning and can be enforced by reference to social norms. \u201cStandards that capture lay intuitions about right behavior,\u201d Posner notes, \u201cmay produce greater legal certainty than a network of precise \u2026 non-intuitive rules.\u201d\n\nPotentially, simplifying regulation can appeal to both sides: to liberals because it offers regulators more leeway, and to conservatives because it simplifies government and avoids mindless compliance costs. Here are three examples of how regulation could be simplified: Oversight of social services: Today, nursing homes, day-care centers, and similar social-service providers are regulated with a maze of input-oriented regulations. \u201cFood shall be stored not less than 15 cm above the floor\u201d; \u201cthere shall be .09 recreational workers per resident\u201d\u2014about a thousand rules in most states for nursing homes. Australia had a similar regulatory structure. But in the wake of scandalous revelations of poor nursing homes in the late 1980s, it abandoned the thick rule book and replaced it with 31 general principles, for example to provide \u201ca homelike environment\u201d and to honor residents\u2019 \u201cprivacy and dignity.\u201d The result was an almost immediate transformation for the better. Nursing-home employees started acting on their instincts of right and wrong, instead of trudging through dreary bureaucratic checklists. Regulators and family members engaged in regular dialogues with nursing homes on how to improve things. Nursing homes became nice. They abandoned the thick rule book and replaced it with 31 general principles. Nursing home became nice. Environmental review: Environmental review and other infrastructure approvals can last a decade or longer in America. Even projects with virtually no environmental impact can last years, as project sponsors jump through scores of bureaucratic hoops. The benefits of streamlining approvals would be enormous: several million new jobs, a greener environmental footprint, and enhanced global competitiveness. Replacing America\u2019s antiquated power grid, for example, would save at least 7 percent of electricity\u2014equivalent to the output of 200 coal-burning power plants. Today the process is interminable, because any naysayer can complain that some pebble was left unturned\u2014and who knows what will happen in court? Far better to give an environmental official responsibility to decide when important facts have been set forth instead of letting the process spin its wheels for a decade and then end up in court. For other permits\u2014for instance, for land-use regulations, navigable-waters approval, landmarks review, and the like\u2014there should also be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d\u2014a lead agency with the job of coordinating all regulatory concerns. That\u2019s how other greener countries such as Germany are able to approve new infrastructure projects in a fraction of the time it takes in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A decades-long obsession with writing excessively detailed laws had made it impossible for real people to get anything done.", "author": "Philip K.
