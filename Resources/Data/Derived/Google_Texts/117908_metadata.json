John Macris was recently targeted by the NSW Crime Commission in an effort to force him to account for his unexplained wealth.\n\nMs Dionys had received more than $493,000 from a divorce settlement, the court heard.\n\nThe mother-of-two claims Mr Dimaris was not an authorised signatory to her \u00adaccount but the bank allowed him to take her money anyway, the court heard. The bank\u2019s barrister Patrick Reynolds told the court Ms \u00adDionys signed a \u201cloan agreement\u201d at the March 2011 meeting, which authorised Mr Dimaris to make the \u00adtransaction.\n\nMs Dionys\u2019s barrister, Sydney Jacobs described the document as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said she was intimidated into signing a \u201cconsulting agreement\u201d, which wasn\u2019t legally binding.\n\nHe said the loan agreement did not resemble one and was not something any law graduate would recognise as one.\n\nThe matter will go to trial later this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A <span id=\"U4032076824437OI\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;\">sydney </span>woman is suing National Australia Bank, claiming it handed almost $500,000 of her money to a business associated with a NSW Crime Commission target and refused to pay her back.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "A <span id=\"U4032076824437OI\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;\">sydney </span>woman is suing National Australia Bank, claiming it handed almost $500,000 of her money to a business associated with a NSW Crime Commission target and refused to pay her back.", "title": "\u2018NAB nabbed my $500k and gave it to company with criminal links\u2019", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nab-nabbed-my-500k-and-gave-it-to-company-with-criminal-links/story-fni0cx4q-1226930229423", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/05/24/1226930/231364-a1831eb2-e2f1-11e3-8e6d-abe4e4200487.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/05/24/1226930/231364-a1831eb2-e2f1-11e3-8e6d-abe4e4200487.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226930229423, "keywords": "development business, bank teller, unexplained wealth, divorce settlement, consulting agreement, authorised signatory, money transfer, bank money, paper bag, services business owner, district court, financial services, mother-of-two claims, forged document, National Australia Bank Limited, Stelios, Patrick Reynolds, sydney woman, John Macris, George Caramanlis, Sydney Jacobs, Daniela Di Paolo, loan agreement", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat May 24 15:13:11 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat May 24 15:13:11 EST 2014", "author": "Brenden Hills"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fb6\"", "article_summary": "NAB\u2019s lawyers denied the claims and told Judge David Arnott SC that Ms Dionys gave permission for Mr Dimaris to act as her agent.\nMs Dionys claims the bank all-owed her cousin and financial services business owner, Matthew Dimaris, to transfer the money to the company, the court heard.\n\u2018NAB nabbed my $500k and gave it to company with criminal links\u2019A sydney woman is suing National Australia Bank, claiming it handed almost $500,000 of her money to a business associated with a NSW Crime Commission target and refused to pay her back.\nThe mother-of-two claims Mr Dimaris was not an authorised signatory to her \u00adaccount but the bank allowed him to take her money anyway, the court heard.\nThe bank\u2019s barrister Patrick Reynolds told the court Ms \u00adDionys signed a \u201cloan agreement\u201d at the March 2011 meeting, which authorised Mr Dimaris to make the \u00adtransaction."}
