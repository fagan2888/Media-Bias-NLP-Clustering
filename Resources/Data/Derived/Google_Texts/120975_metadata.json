Now, the nighthawk approach to telepharmacy could disrupt pharmacy as well. As this happens, pathologists may be wondering when their medical specialty will see its first \u201cnighthawk pathology\u201d disruptors.\n\nRemote Pharmacists Improve Hospital Drug Delivery\n\nOne company bringing the nighthawk model to hospital pharmacy services is PipelineRx of San Francisco, California. Its executives believe that they can make the drug delivery system in hospitals more efficient by filling labor shortages with remote pharmacists, according to a MedCity News article.\n\nPipelineRx CEO Brian Roberts acknowledges that his company is taking a page from the teleradiology playbook. \u201cWe figured we could do the same with pharmacies because of the technology and create an environment and monitor prescriptions in the hospital and allocate it to home pharmacists,\u201d Roberts told MedCity News, adding that it can both trim costs while ensuring adequate monitoring for patient safety.\n\nIt is ongoing improvements in telemedicine technology that make it both feasible and economical for licensed pharmacists working at a central pharmacy site\u2014or from home\u2014to supervise a registered pharmacy technician at a remote telepharmacy site. This is done by the use of video conferencing technology.\n\n\u201cUntil a couple of years ago, [hospitals] were still faxing [prescription] orders down to the basement,\u201d Roberts noted.\n\nTelepharmacy a Win/Win for Hospitals and Pharmacists\n\nIn the MedCity News article, Roberts described telepharmacy as a win-win for both hospitals and pharmacists since hospitals can save between 30% and 70% on labor costs while pharmacists benefit from working more flexible hours. In addition, PipelineRx\u2019s average prescription turnaround time is seven minutes compared to the industry standard of 20 minutes, decreasing the wait time for patients.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why that employee needs to be sitting in the four walls of the hospital at periods when demand is fluctuating,\u201d Roberts stated. \u201cWe\u2019re able to be flexible and offer the hospital a variable cost model.\u201d\n\nPipelineRX is hoping to build on the success of teleradiology and the nighthawk business model of professional services. Nighthawk radiology services solve hospital-staffing problems through use of nighttime teleradiology coverage. By contracting with subspecialists working in locations such as Hawaii, New Zealand or Australia, nighthawk radiologists working remotely can cover cases in the U.S. during evening hours, weekends or vacation shifts.\n\nAmerican Radiologists Provide Services to U.S. from Half a World Away\n\nThe term \u201cnighthawk\u201d to describe remote radiology services comes from a company based in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, called Nighthawk Radiology Services. Founded in 2001, it originally employed American radiologists living in Australia to provide after-hour services in the United States.\n\nToday, on a company website, it says, \u201cNightHawk\u2019s team of U.S. board-certified, state-licensed, and hospital-privileged physicians located in the United States, Australia, and Switzerland, provides services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for approximately 1,560 sites or 27% of all hospitals in the United States.\u201d Pathologists should take note that just one teleradiology firm claims to be delivering its services to one-quarter of all the hospitals in this country.\n\nE. Stephen Amis, Jr. M.D., professor and university chair of the Department of Radiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, says radiology \u201cnighthawks\u201d have performed up to par.\n\n\u201cIt turned out a lot better than everyone thought initially,\u201d Amis stated in an American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) news article.\n\n\u201cTeleradiology is really providing a good service for most hospitals during the night hours when there is a shortage of radiologists. It gives good-quality readings on a very timely basis: Usually, it takes 30-45 minutes between the time the scan is done and a preliminary interpretation is received. Then, the study is double read [by the home institution\u2019s radiologist] the next morning,\u201d Amis continued.\n\nPathologists Watch Local Radiology Groups Lose Contracts to Remote Radiology Companies\n\nFor rural hospitals, teleradiology has been a way to improve patient care. Instead of sharing one traveling radiologists, hospitals outside major population areas can route images, ultrasounds and CT scans over the Internet to a central teleradiologic practice whose team of radiologists and subspecialists are on-call day or night.\n\nOf course, over the past 15 years, there are pathologists who watched their colleagues in the radiology group practice serving the same hospital lose their contract with the hospital when a nighthawk radiology company came in and underbid the radiology group for all the hospital\u2019s radiology and imaging services. These pathologists know how disruptive the teleradiology business model can be in some settings.\n\nThus, if telepharmacy gains the same level of acceptance by hospital administrators as teleradiology, then there is the possibility that outsourcing pharmacy via this business model becomes more common.\n\nIn turn, that makes hospital and health system administrators more comfortable with outsourcing essential clinical services. If companies organized to offer telepathology services appeared on the scene, they may have a ready reception by hospital administrators who like the idea of reducing the cost of professional pathology services while improving access to a wide range of subspecialist pathologists.\n\nIn the field of telepharmacy, PipelineRX seems to be growing. According to the company\u2019s fact sheet, PipelineRx now has more than 120 clinical telepharmacists, of which over 65% have either a post-graduate year one (PYG1) or post-graduate year two (PYG2) advanced residency degree.\n\nThe company currently operates in 31 states but is able to operate in 46 states. Their client hospitals range from 25-bed critical access facilities to 722-bed academic medical centers.\n\nIn December 2014, in a story published by MedCity News, the company said that it had 150 total employees and that \u201cmore than 30 hospitals have adopted its SaaS approach, while more than 200 hospitals, ranging from 25-bed critical access facilities to academic medical centers, have used the company\u2019s pharmacists.\u201d\n\nPathology at a Distance Emerges\n\nAs hospital administrators become increasingly comfortable with outsourcing medical radiology and pharmacy functions, they could see value in adding pathology to their telemedicine services. There will continue to be a need for histotechnology capability at the originating hospital to gross the tissue, create glass slides and then convert them to digital images. However, pathologists working remotely could read and interpret the specimens.\n\nBecause digital pathology is growing slowly and has technical hurdles still to overcome, it may take some time before nighthawk telepathology emerges as a trend. However, the demand for telemedicine seems unlikely to recede.\n\n\u201cThe business case for telehealth is self-evident,\u201d wrote Edward D. Rickert, a Chicago-based health law attorney, in an Inside Counsel article. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has created millions of new healthcare consumers, and President Obama\u2019s November 2014 Executive Action on Immigration will add to the burdens imposed on some state governments to provide healthcare to a new set of eligible beneficiaries. New and innovative ways to provide quality healthcare cost-effectively to more people is needed, and telehealth has emerged to answer the charge.\u201d\n\nSetting aside all the barriers to the adoption of telepathology that exist in most states and at many hospitals, what nighthawk radiology and telepharmacy services are doing is getting hospital administrators more comfortable with outsourcing these types of clinical services. In that sense, as it becomes more feasible to offer remote pathology services to hospitals and companies organize to do that, hospital administrators will be more willing to negotiate and enter into these types of deals.\n\n\u2014Andrea Downing Peck\n\nRelated Information:\n\nSmall Town to a Big City\u20137 Telemedicine Practices from a Rural Hospital\n\nIt is After Hours \u2013 Who\u2019s Interpreting That Study?\n\nPipelineRx Takes Telemedicine to Hospital Pharmacies\n\nImproving Access in Healthcare Through the Use of Telemedicine, Telepharmacy and Telenursing\n\nNightHawk Radiology Brings Overreading from Down Under\n\nDigital Pathology White Paper: Pathology Innovators Use Web 2.0 to Boost Productivity and Create Clinical Value\n\nMore Clinical Pathology Laboratories are Purchasing Digital Pathology Systems\n\nPathologist and Radiologists Head Toward a Collision\u2026or Will It Be a Collaboration", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "medical laboratory, clinical laboratory, pathology, laboratory pathology, laboratory news, nighthawk, digital pathology, pipelinerx, brian roberts, medcity news, edward rickert, inside counsel, affordable care act, lake chelan community hospital, kevin abel, becker\u2019s hospital review, e. stephen amis jr., american college of emergency physicians, albert einstein college of medicine,affordable care act,albert einstein college of medicine,american college of emergency physicians,becker\u2019s hospital review,brian roberts,clinical laboratory,digital pathology,e. stephen amis jr.,edward rickert,inside counsel,kevin abel,laboratory news,laboratory pathology,lake chelan community hospital,medcity news,nighthawk,pathology,pipelinerx,laboratory management and operations,laboratory operations,laboratory sales and marketing,management & operations", "description": "Advances in telemedicine capabilities and digital pathology may be paving the way for remote\u00ac (or so-called nighthawk) pathology to become viable as a service option for many smaller hospitals across the United States."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b59\"", "article_summary": "American Radiologists Provide Services to U.S. from Half a World AwayThe term \u201cnighthawk\u201d to describe remote radiology services comes from a company based in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, called Nighthawk Radiology Services.\n\u2018Nighthawk\u2019 Radiology Services Expand to Hospital Pharmacies: Could Pathology Laboratories Be Next?\nAs this happens, pathologists may be wondering when their medical specialty will see its first \u201cnighthawk pathology\u201d disruptors.\nRemote Pharmacists Improve Hospital Drug DeliveryOne company bringing the nighthawk model to hospital pharmacy services is PipelineRx of San Francisco, California.\nNighthawk radiology services solve hospital-staffing problems through use of nighttime teleradiology coverage."}
