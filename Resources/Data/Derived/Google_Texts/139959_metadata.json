Even more frustrating is that the modeling tools show the ideal coverage scenarios.\n\nOften, each of those ideal benefit scenarios may seem affordable but, when added together, they cost more than the employee\u2019s budget allows.\n\nTina Wilson, senior vice president of Product Management for MassMutual, said her company\u2019s new benefit tool is designed to overcome those limitations.\n\n\u201cMany tools in the market today, you\u2019ll get recommendations around retirement and benefits but when you add it up, it\u2019s not affordable,\u201d Wilson told InsuranceNewsNet.\n\nShe said modeling scenarios that build a coverage plan based on spending $3 when employees have only $1 to spend on benefits doesn\u2019t help employees.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that we look at that is unique, is we show the affordable recommendation and we also show the ideal recommendations,\u201d she also said. \u201cIf they can afford a bit more, what is ideal coverage amount?\u201d\n\nMassMutual\u2019s tool, branded as MapMyBenefits, is one of the latest to take a broader, more holistic approach to benefits purchasing and coverage. This is becoming more important as employer-sponsored benefits move from an \u201cemployer-funded\u201d to an \u201cemployer-enabled\u201d model where employees pay more of the costs.\n\nMapMyBenefits also moves MassMutual closer to financial wellness planning, which many employees say they want.\n\nThe availability of more comprehensive tools to help employees with finances will help reduce financial stress that spill over into the employee\u2019s job, said Elaine Sarsynski, executive vice president of Retirement Services and Worksite Insurance, in a news release.\n\nNearly one in four employees say personal financial problems have become a distraction at work, according to a 2014 PricewatershouseCoopers survey.\n\nAon Hewitt\u2019s \u201c2015 Hot Topics in Retirement\u201d report found that 90 percent of large employers want to introduce or expand financial wellness programs this year, and other surveys indicate employees want more help with cash flow projections.\n\nMapMyBenefits includes mapping benefits from MassMutual and from other carriers made available by employers to their workers.\n\nMassMutual also said its 401(k) and other defined contribution retirement and life insurance products are available through the tool, and that the company plans to make more insurance products available using the tool in the future.\n\nWilson said the tool, which is not available in the retail market, can be used by individual employees or by advisors, some of whom work at the employer rather than at the employee level.\n\n\u201cIt can be used either way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be engaging and interactive regardless of who the user is.\u201d\n\nThe tool, which has received \u201cphenomenal\u201d feedback, was launched as a pilot in January and a national rollout is expected later this year.\n\nWilson also said that MassMutual experts had envisioned heaviest usage of the tool during corporate open enrollment periods, but that interest in the tool seems to peak when employers introduce a new benefit or when a new employee joins an employer.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
