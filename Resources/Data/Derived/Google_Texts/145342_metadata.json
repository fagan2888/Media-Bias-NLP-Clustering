Later this month, the Arrowhead Park Early College High School launches a new Medical Academy that will prepare 60 students to earn an associate of science degree by the time they finish high school.\n\nThe schools are getting off the ground following news that New Mexico State University will host a private College of Osteopathic Medicine on its campus come 2016.\n\nHealth Sciences Academy Early College\n\nLocation: Santa Teresa\n\nStudents enrolled: 150\n\nGrades: 7-12 (initially 7-10)\n\nAffiliation: Las Cruces Public School District charter schoolHigh School Medical Academy\n\nLocation: Las Cruces, NMSU campus\n\nStudents enrolled: 60\n\nGrades: 9-12 (initially 9th grade)\n\nAffiliation: Las Cruces Public School District magnet school\n\nLocal leaders in business and education called the timing of the initiatives both a coincidence and good luck driven by market and student demand for health-related education.\n\nThe new programs track students into health careers amidst a longstanding, statewide shortage of health care workers that is poised to widen as Baby Boomers age and the Affordable Care Act broadens Medicaid coverage to an estimated one-third of New Mexicans. The state ranks 31st in its physician-population ratio, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with the districts to have business involved in the educational process,\u201d said Stacie Allen, chief executive of The Bridge, a Las Cruces nonprofit that fosters collaboration between business, government and education. \u201cTheir problem is our problem. It\u2019s all about employability.\u201d\n\nStudents started classes Monday at the Health Sciences Academy to the scraping sounds of remodeling still going on in half the building. At the Early College High School Medical Academy on NMSU\u2019s campus, where classes begin Aug. 18, classrooms are still under construction. Blueprints sit rumpled on freshly installed counters.\n\nLaura Padilla brought her daughter Eddena to her first day of seventh grade at the Health Sciences Academy. Padilla said she enrolled her because of \u201cthe great opportunities she is going to have.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants to be a veterinarian,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good start.\u201d\n\nSeveral parents \u2013 many arriving in scrubs before they headed to health care jobs \u2013 said they liked the idea of the charter school\u2019s smaller class sizes and career-focused curriculum.\n\nThe Health Sciences Academy, founded by an Albuquerque couple \u2013 Raphael Nevins and Lorna Samraj, who for several years ran a popular tutoring program in Albuquerque public schools \u2013 is open to anyone. It draws students largely from southern Do\u00f1a Ana county.\n\nThe Early College High School Medical Academy similarly rolls health sciences into its curriculum but requires an application; spots are limited.\n\nBoth schools are free.\n\nThe need for health education is due to the population growth in southern New Mexico and corresponding expansion in health care services, said Kiel Hoffman, chairman of the Mesilla Valley Economic Development Alliance and president of Pioneer Bank.\n\n\u201cWe are becoming a nice mecca in southern New Mexico for medical care,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Programs will help alleviate NM&#39;s shortage of health care workers", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Lauren Villagran | Journal Staff Writer - Las Cruces Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/440618/dona-ana-county-becoming-magnet-for-health-career-training.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/a01_jd_05aug_healthed1-1000x750.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Programs will help alleviate NM's shortage of health care workers", "title": "Updated: Two new schools focus on health sciences"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd642a\"", "article_summary": "Laura Padilla brought her daughter Eddena to her first day of seventh grade at the Health Sciences Academy.\nThe Early College High School Medical Academy similarly rolls health sciences into its curriculum but requires an application; spots are limited.\nIt\u2019s all about employability.\u201dStudents started classes Monday at the Health Sciences Academy to the scraping sounds of remodeling still going on in half the building.\nDo\u00f1a Ana County has suddenly become a magnet for health sciences education.\nA new Health Sciences Academy charter school opened its doors Monday in Santa Teresa, serving about 150 students in grades seven to 12, with an eye on integrating health topics into core curriculum and preparing students for careers in health occupations."}
