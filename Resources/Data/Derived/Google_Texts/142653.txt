Welcome to The Upshot’s weekly newsletter. We’ll be sending this out on Fridays, always with at least one brand-new piece, like Nate Cohn’s above. We’ll also be giving you a chance to catch up on some of our best material from earlier in the week, and we'll give you a sense of what you can expect in coming days. Let us know what you think, via Twitter, Facebook or in the comments on this page. A couple of notes on subjects that have attracted high reader interest in recent days:

Leo’s Week

After a recent surge of strong polling for Democrats, the Republicans have done better in the last few days. Thanks to encouraging polls for them in Iowa and (to a lesser extent) Colorado, our Senate forecasting model, named Leo, now gives the Republicans a 58 percent chance of winning Senate control. That’s up from 50 percent two days ago.

Making College Fairer

I’ve written several times about the problem of high-achieving, low-income teenagers who then fail to graduate from college. Rather than attending a university with a lot of resources — like a flagship state university or a private college — many stay closer to home and enroll in a college with a high dropout rate. This week, I wrote about one program — QuestBridge — that has found ways to persuade more such teenagers to attend a top college; on some campuses, like Amherst’s, 1 in 10 students now comes via QuestBridge. You can also check out our recent ranking of colleges based on their commitment to economic diversity. And you can read a study published by the Brookings Institution, which gives a good overview of the problem.
