With the transition to value-based care underway, here are some top collected strategies for healthcare providers to consider.\n\nAcknowledge you are merely playing a game of \u2018Risk\u2019\n\nIn order to stay above water, healthcare providers must develop tactics to adequately manage short-term risk.\n\n\u201cIf policymakers want to successfully transform the current volume-based payment system to one based on value, they need to understand these impediments to risk-taking and offer the tools providers need to make this transition successful,\u201d said Chester A. Speed, JD, LLLM, and Nikita Stempniewicz of the American Medical Group Association.\n\n\u201cIf these issues are overlooked, the opportunity to reform the system for both the benefit of patients and programmatic efficiency may be lost.\u201d\n\nFocus on matters of physician engagement, not just money\n\nC-suite executives are honing in on the importance of engaging physicians to keep costs down and quality high, according to a survey of 157 CEOs from the Advisory Board Company.\n\n\u201c[Physician] engagement is imperative to an organization\u2019s successful transition to value-based care models,\u201d stated Chas Roades, the Advisory Board\u2019s Chief Research Officer.\n\n\u201cDriving fundamental and sustainable changes to providers\u2019 business model is impossible without buy-in from the clinicians on the frontlines of patient care.\u201d\n\nResearchers recommended healthcare providers adapt the following 4 strategies to maintain high performance levels: reformat service portfolios for population health, reinforce primary care physician alignment, develop direct-to-employer contracting, and regulate avoidable utilization.\n\nBy directly associating a physician\u2019s compensation level with care quality, care coordination and overall conditions are reportedly heightened.\n\n\u201cNon-productivity incentives play a key role in the current compensation arena and will continue to gain importance in future years,\u201d stated Justin Chamblee, Senior Manager at the Coker Group. \u201cBut you cannot incentivize physicians based on outcomes when all your reimbursement is on fee for service.\u201d\n\nDo not be afraid to really look at your numbers\n\nFollowing an announcement from the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) about a goal to associate 90 percent of reimbursements to value-based or quality-based care by 2018, healthcare providers are becoming more focused on maintaining a healthy revenue cycle.\n\n\u201cMedicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans are all pushing toward paying hospitals and physicians for value, effectively pushing financial risk upon the providers,\u201d asserted Joe Kuehn, Advisory Partner at KPMG\u2019s Healthcare & Life Sciences Practice.\n\n\u201cFinance departments will need to prepare to manage these challenges and have better systems to measure performance against established targets including the cost and quality of care for example, so they can manage in this new environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cData & analytic tools are an important component for improving the finance function\u2019s effectiveness, especially since there are so many variables that need to be addressed in the delivery of care,\u201d said Mark Jamilkowski, Managing Director.\n\n\u201cThe tools available now can take that unstructured information from patient records, billing, and sources outside the provider organization that can help provide meaningful context around measuring healthcare quality and overall costs.\"\n\nStrengthen value-based readiness weaknesses\n\nAccording to an executive survey from the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) and Humana, 60 percent of senior financial executives confirm their organization will be ready within the next 3 years to handle risk-based value aftermath.\n\nExecutives say they are focused on interoperability, business intelligence, real-time data access, and chronic care management.\n\nAt least half of the 146 CEOs and executives surveyed confirm the incorporation of value-based payment programs yielded positive returns on investment (ROI).\n\nRegarding another hospital survey from Kaufman, Hall & Associates, over 40 percent of hospitals verify at least 10 percent of their revenue stems from value-based contracts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Value over volume is the name of the revenue cycle game, with the reimbursement concept of \u201cless is more\u201d taking precedence.
