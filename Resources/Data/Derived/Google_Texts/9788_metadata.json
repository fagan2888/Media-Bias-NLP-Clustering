These toxic behaviors might be annoying and unpleasant, but they\u2019re also extremely costly to companies, according to new research.\n\nA Harvard Business School study has found that avoiding hiring a \u201ctoxic worker\u201d saves companies around $12,500 or more, while hiring a superstar employee only saves about $5,300 for the company.\n\nThe researchers used employment data from around 60,000 workers at 11 companies, focusing only on the toxic behavior that resulted in a firing. For the purposes of the study, toxic employees were identified as those whose hostile style or manipulative actions could turn the workplace into a lousy environment. Meanwhile, a superstar employee was defined as one most productive 1 percent of workers.\n\nRelated: Federal Employees: Can\u2019t Hire the Best, Can\u2019t Fire the Worst\n\n\u201cAvoiding a toxic worker (or converting them to an average worker) provides more benefit than finding and retaining a superstar,\u201d the study says. As a result, \u201cit may be that spending more time limiting negative impacts on an organization might improve everyone\u2019s outcome to a greater extent than only focusing on increasing positive impacts,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nToxic employees are so costly because their behavior drives out other workers, forcing companies to spend more money training replacement hires. The bad apples also make frustrated co-workers less productive. \u201cIn extreme cases, aside from hurting performance, such workers can generate enormous regulatory and legal fees and liabilities for the firm,\u201d the study says.\n\nRelated: Why Employee Performance Reviews Are So Old School\n\nRemoving toxic workers isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 especially because, according to the study, they may seem to be more productive than their colleagues, at least in terms of quantity if not quality. If they seem to be a good employee, a manager is less likely to want to let them go and might look the other way in terms of their negative behavior. But authors Michael Housman of Cornerstone OnDemand, a talent management software company, and Dylan Minor, a professor at Harvard and Northwestern, say ditching those workers is still the best way to go.\n\n\u201cWe find evidence that such a policy \u2014 one that removes the \u2018big shots\u2019 and \u2018tyrants\u2019 seems to be one that would lead to more productive organizations in general, despite terminating such a productive worker,\u201d they write.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We all have those colleagues who criticize you to co-workers behind your back, make ru", "title": "The Naughty Employee Costing Your Company More Than $12,000", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Naughty-Employee-Costing-Your-Company-More-12000", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12122012_santa_naughtynice_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/02/Naughty-Employee-Costing-Your-Company-More-12000", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12122012_santa_naughtynice_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "We all have those colleagues who criticize you to co-workers behind your back, make ru", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For the purposes of the study, toxic employees were identified as those whose hostile style or manipulative actions could turn the workplace into a lousy environment.\nA Harvard Business School study has found that avoiding hiring a \u201ctoxic worker\u201d saves companies around $12,500 or more, while hiring a superstar employee only saves about $5,300 for the company.\nMeanwhile, a superstar employee was defined as one most productive 1 percent of workers.\nThe researchers used employment data from around 60,000 workers at 11 companies, focusing only on the toxic behavior that resulted in a firing.\nToxic employees are so costly because their behavior drives out other workers, forcing companies to spend more money training replacement hires."}
