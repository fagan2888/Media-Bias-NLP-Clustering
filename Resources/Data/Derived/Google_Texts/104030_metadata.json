A few minutes later in the Q&A following his January 18, 2012 speech, Gruber admits that the public option was an attempt to slip single-payer into the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSo I like the public option. The public option is actually the brainchild of another academic, a guy named Jacob Hacker who\u2019s at Yale. And the public option, basically it was a clever idea. He said look, the left wants single-payer, the right wants competition\u2013how about we have competition where the option is single-payer. It\u2019s kind of a clever way to call both sides bluff. Basically, since it was such a good idea that\u2019s why both sides didn\u2019t like it. Okay, the right didn\u2019t like it because they were afraid that the left was right and the single-payer would work. The left didn\u2019t like it because they were afraid that the single-payer didn\u2019t have enough teeth to really work. And basically, the public option, to be honest, was never going to happen. The public option was really something that was in there. It was a good idea as a debating point but it just was too radical. Remember, the reason this reform passed, as barely as it did, is because it was not trying to rip up things and start over. It was trying to work incrementally off the existing system. The public option was viewed as too radical.\n\nMany are familiar with Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s August 2013 statement that the public option was a \u201creal good run\u201d at single-payer. About a dozen lawmakers and progressive pundits have made similar admissions over the years, often when speaking to friendly audiences. However the major media, i.e. network and cable news outside Fox and major D.C. and New York print media have almost never touched this.\n\nOccasionally, a site would mention some of these factual outbursts, but this piece by Politico is a good example of the result. The clips get mentioned under a bland headline (\u201cMixed messages bolster GOP\u2019s case\u201d) and the story itself suggests these are fluke statements just waiting to be debunked.\n\nThere\u2019s even a quote in the Politico story from HCAN in which a spokesperson says the public option claims are part of a false \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d narrative. The spokesperson says, \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful, it\u2019s not smart and it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d Surely HCAN knows the truth right? They\u2019re the ones pushing the public option. Well, here\u2019s another HCAN spokesman in a less guarded moment admitting the public option is a strategic path to single-payer. Of course that statement never, ever appeared in any news story.\n\nSomehow the major media never put the pieces together on this issue. As Gruber admits, Democrats did try to slide a pathway to single-payer into Obamacare without telling anyone. The proponents of this sneaky path to single-payer (Ezra Klein called it a \u201csneaky strategy\u201c) were so successful in keeping it quiet that the incompetents at Poltifact made \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d their Lie of the Year in 2010. Stop and think about that for a moment. Politifact\u2019s Lie of the Year was true, at least so long as the public option was under consideration.\n\nGruber is wrong about one thing though. It\u2019s not true that the public option never had a chance. That is some after-the-fact rationalization for failure. In reality, it nearly passed. It was stopped only because, up on Capitol Hill, word kept leaking out about what Democrats were doing. Eventually some GOP Senators made a point of talking about it. And when Joe Lieberman caught on to the sneaky plan, that was the end of the public option.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen multiple instances where false statements about Obamacare presented as unassailable facts turned out to be false: the bill will save families $2,500 on premiums per year, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, etc. The media was very slow to catch on to what Democrats were actually doing as opposed to what they were saying. In the case of the public option, we\u2019re still mostly waiting for them to catch on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another Stunning Admission in Gruber's Speech: The Public Option Was Single Payer", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Another Stunning Admission in Gruber's Speech: The Public Option Was Single Payer", "title": "Another Stunning Admission in Gruber's Speech: The Public Option Was Single Payer - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.breitbart.com/t/assets/i/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/blog/2014/07/25/another-stunning-admission-in-gruber-s-speech-the-public-option-was-single-payer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Another Stunning Admission in Gruber's Speech: The Public Option Was Single Payer", "title": "Another Stunning Admission in Gruber's Speech: The Public Option Was Single Payer - Breitbart", "image": "http://www.breitbart.com/t/assets/i/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "creator": "@verumserum", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "FOX, Harry Reid, Politico,The Conversation,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "The Conversation", "tag": "Politico", "published_time": "2014-07-25T15:12:00-07:00", "categories": "The Conversation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe078b\"", "article_summary": "The public option is actually the brainchild of another academic, a guy named Jacob Hacker who\u2019s at Yale.\nAnd when Joe Lieberman caught on to the sneaky plan, that was the end of the public option.\nIn the case of the public option, we\u2019re still mostly waiting for them to catch on.\nPolitifact\u2019s Lie of the Year was true, at least so long as the public option was under consideration.\nAnd basically, the public option, to be honest, was never going to happen."}
