Lee-Pool/Getty Images\n\nWhen discussing presidential candidates, people who do so for a living usually refer to a number of amorphously defined tiers. There\u2019s the top tier (those likely to launch competitive bids, like Sen. Rand Paul and Jeb Bush), the second tier (candidates who could be competitive if they hit their stride, like Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Scott Walker), and bottom-tier jokesters who seem primarily interested in selling books (Newt Gingrich) and basking in the CPAC love (Donald Trump). This year, though, there\u2019s another tier: the Pataki tier.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s George Pataki?\u201d you might ask, if you\u2019re under 30. Don\u2019t let anyone hold your ignorance against you. George Pataki, a moderate Republican who favored stricter gun control laws and abortion rights, served three terms as governor of New York. Since then, he has busied himself with pondering White House bids and launching the George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center. He also joined the Chadbourne and Parke law firm, and co-founded a consulting practice, the Pataki-Cahill Group.\n\nThe George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center recently closed its brick-and-mortar location due to lack of interest.\n\nEvery four years, the former governor floats that he might answer the call to serve his country if such a call comes, and every four years people sort of squint and shrug. His overtures fail to inspire the hair-pulling rage that Sarah Palin\u2019s name generates, and he\u2019s never had the cartoon-twirly-eyed devotion that Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul managed to snag. This hasn\u2019t kept him from looking for ways to flex his GOP-cred before early\u2013primary state notables, which is what he would have done in New Hampshire this week had the blizzard not forced him to cancel his travel plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPast efforts have been comparably lackluster, starting with his eponymous monument to his leadership. The New York Times reported that the George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center recently closed its brick-and-mortar location in Peekskill, N.Y., due to lack of interest. Despite that, the Pataki Center still fights the good fight in cyberspace, where its website optimistically proclaims, \u201cTODAY, WE ARE MAKING HISTORY.\u201d It\u2019s a bit light on original content. One page features pictures of all the New York governors. If you click on one of the images, you\u2019ll go to a page with a short paragraph on when that governor served. Until Tuesday afternoon\u2014when I contacted Pataki\u2019s spokesman David Catalfamo\u2014these paragraphs were copy-and-pasted, without attribution, from the New York Hall of Governors website. For instance, you can compare Pataki\u2019s page on Gov. DeWitt Clinton with the New York State Hall of Governors\u2019 page. The site appears to have copied the entries for all 56 governors. The Hall of Governors did not respond to a request for comment. After I reached out to Pataki\u2019s spokesman, the site added attributions.\n\nBesides the plagiarized mini-bios of the state\u2019s 56 governors, the site also includes a short page encouraging people to give money to the center (there is no link where one can do so, if you were wondering), two short paragraphs explaining how the center aims \u201cto make the American dream a reality for the next generation of young New York leaders,\u201d a \u201cMemorable Speeches\u201d page that only includes one speech, and a \u201cRemembering September 11\u201d page that includes brief remarks the governor gave on the day of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThis is unfortunate, as is much of Pataki\u2019s online presence. In 2010, he helped create a group called Revere America that aimed to capitalize on the nascent Tea Party to push back against the Affordable Care Act. He left the group 10 months later, and it shuttered shortly after his egress. Its website boldly soldiers on, though, despite being partially cannibalized by ads for Internet bingo. On the site\u2019s front page, posts titled \u201cRick Santorum\u2019s take on the Middle East crisis\u201d and \u201c \u2018I\u2019m Not Concerned About The Very Poor\u2019 says Mitt Romney\u201d peacefully co-mingle with entries titled \u201cBingo Bash \u2013 the number 1 android bingo game\u201d and \u201cGo shopping in New York, courtesy We Want Bingo.\u201d There may be an upside here; bingo appears to be a popular pastime in Iowa.\n\nThe former governor hasn\u2019t visited Iowa for this election cycle, but he has been to New Hampshire and South Carolina. And he\u2019s started a political action committee called We the People Not Washington. On the Media section of the PAC\u2019s site is posted the text to a curious article titled \u201cGEORGE PATAKI\u2014QUIETLY CONNECTING WITH CONSERVATIVES UNDER RADAR: \u2018National Media Clueless.\u2019 \u201d Though the media section doesn\u2019t link to the article or give its origin, it appears to have first been published on a site called Conservative Base. It reads like a protracted Internet comment.\n\n\u201cSorry Hillary, once they see and hear George Pataki, most Americans will want him answering the 3AM phone call [sic],\u201d says the article. \u201cYep, the national media and political elites sure didn\u2019t see this one coming.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The former New York governor may be running the saddest campaign for president.", "fb-share": "George Pataki May Be Running the Saddest Campaign for President", "sailthru.author": "Betsy Woodruff", "description": "When discussing presidential candidates, people who do so for a living usually refer to a number of amorphously defined tiers.
