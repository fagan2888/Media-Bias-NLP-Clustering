A judge effectively dismissed a lawsuit brought by George Zimmerman’s parents against actress and comedian Roseanne Barr.

Barr retweeted the couple’s home address in 2012 at the height of anger over the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by Zimmerman

Robert and Gladys Zimmerman’s lawyer argued that Barr sharing the address with her followers (which numbered more than 100,000 at the time) made them feel unsafe in their own house.

Barr’s lawyer said sharing the information, which was already public, was protected by her first amendment rights—and the judge agreed on Tuesday, granting a motion for summary judgment and therefore bringing the case to a close, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

At the time of the incident, Barr reportedly retweeted the address, deleted it, then tweeted “If Zimmerman isn’t arrested I’ll rt his address again. maybe go 2 his house myself,” before deleting that message as well.
