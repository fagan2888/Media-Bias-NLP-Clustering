It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas around Salisbury, especially with the return of the Winter Wonderland of Lights at the Salisbury City Park.

More than a dozen light displays will light up the night, with some recognizable Christmas characters and some local flair thrown into the mix.

Santa, snowmen and Christmas trees are mainstays of the display, but red, yellow and white lights will also illuminate the Maryland flag accompanied by the cherished Wicomico Woody.

Woody also has a new friend this year in a light-up display of Sammy the Sea Gull. Together the tandem of birds, along with the other light displays, aim to put a smile on the faces of community members and infect them with the ever-contagious holiday spirit.

“What’s cool is you can drive by any time and see the lights and walk through the park,” Winter Wonderland of Lights committee chairwoman Kim Hudson said. “People are very appreciative, and when the lights go away sometimes they don’t know how much they enjoyed them until they’re gone.”

The lights will be on display from Saturday, Nov. 28, to Jan. 1, and the committee is having a lighting ceremony Saturday to kick it all off.

The ceremony begins at 5 p.m., and Santa Claus will be in attendance along with Q105 doing a live broadcast on site.

One lucky child will have a chance to get their name drawn to help turn on the lights at about 6 p.m.

“Just come and enjoy the holiday spirit and be a part of your community,” Hudson said. “It’s one of those events that just warms your heart, and kids are always so excited to see the lights.”
