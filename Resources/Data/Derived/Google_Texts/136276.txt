A young child died Saturday night after drowning in a Clarke County swimming pool.

Chief Deputy Barry White says it happened about 8:30 Saturday night at a home on Highway 513, just outside of Quitman. White tells Newscenter 11 the 2-year old boy somehow ended up in the pool during a family gathering. He was transported to Watkins Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

White says the boy's body has been taken to Jackson for an autopsy. This case remains under investigation.
