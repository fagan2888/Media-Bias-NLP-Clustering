The ACA aims to make healthcare more affordable, accessible, and of a higher quality for families, seniors, businesses and taxpayers, regardless of previous insurance history. Incremental changes have been made each year to implement the ACA, and the upcoming year brings about new IRS reporting requirements that affect employers.\n\nWho is Covered?\n\nFirst things first, all employers need to determine how many full-time, or full-time equivalent employees (FTE) they employ. An employee is considered full-time if he or she works on average at least 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month. Click here to determine how to calculate the number of FTE employees you have in your business.\n\nEmployers are required to extend an employee\u2019s coverage to include dependent children under the age of 26.\n\nAm I a large or small employer?\n\nWhen you have calculated the number of FTE employees in your business, you can define yourself as either a large or small employer. There are different requirements for small and large employers.\n\nSmall employers employ between 2 and 50 FTE employees.\n\nLarge employers employ more than 50 FTE employees.\n\nSmall Employer\n\nSmall employers looking to provide coverage for their employees can do so through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP), which is part of the marketplace exchange. SHOP offers small employers increased purchasing power to provide a better choice of high-quality coverage to employees. SHOP also pools risk for small groups and reduces administrative complexity, therefore helping to reduce costs. Enrollment in SHOP is offered anytime during the year.\n\nDisclosure to Employees\n\nEmployers must provide employees with an annual standard \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage\u201d form explaining what their plan covers and what it costs. This form will help employees to understand and evaluate their health insurance options.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nBeginning in January 2016, small employers must report health insurance information to the IRS annually, as well as providing \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage\u201d forms to employees.\n\nSmall employers must complete and file Forms 1095-B (Health coverage) and 1094-B (Accompanying transmittal form) with the IRS by February 29, 2016. Or, by March 31, 2016, if submitted electronically. Employees must also receive a copy of form 1095-B for tax purposes by January 31st, 2016.\n\nNote: Small employers that are members of controlled or affiliated service groups that have at least 50 FTE\u2019s collectively, must also submit Forms 1095-C and 1094-C.\n\nFor small employers with less than 25 employees and average wages of less than $50,000, who provide health insurance will be eligible for tax credits of up to 50%.\n\nLarge Employer\n\nIn 2015, large employers were only required to provide health insurance to their full-time employees and their dependents, if they had 100 or more FTE employees. Beginning in January 2016, all large employers must provide full-time employees and their dependents, with access to affordable comprehensive coverage.\n\nThe Employer Shared Responsibility Provision of the ACA will penalize employers if they do not offer affordable coverage. If at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit or cost-sharing subsidy in the federal or state marketplace, the employer will be penalized $2,160 for each month, divided by 12, multiplied by the number of full-time employees (minus the first 30 employees).\n\nClick here to view the image.\n\nWhat is affordable coverage?\n\nEmployees shouldn\u2019t have to pay more than 9.66% of their household income for healthcare coverage provided by their employer\n\nInsurance coverage should pay for at least 60% of the covered health care expenses for a standard population\n\nThe penalty for employers who are not providing affordable insurance coverage is $3,240 divided by 12, for each full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit that month (up to a maximum of $2,160 for each month, divided by 12 multiplied by the number of full-time employees (minus the first 30 employees)).\n\nClick here to view the image.\n\nDisclosure to Employees\n\nEmployers must provide employees with an annual standard \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage\u201d form explaining what their plan covers and what it costs. This form will help employees to understand and evaluate their health insurance options.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nBeginning in January 2016, large employers must report health insurance information to the IRS for all employees enrolled in the employer\u2019s health plan, as well as providing \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage\u201d forms to employees.\n\nLarge employers must complete and file forms 1095-C (Employer provided health insurance offer and coverage) and 1094-C (Accompanying transmittal form) with the IRS by February 29, 2016. Or, by March 31, 2016, if submitted electronically. Employees, covered by the employer\u2019s health plan, must also receive a copy of form 1095-C for tax purposes by January 31st, 2016.\n\nLarge employers who offer unaffordable coverage to employees, that costs more than 9.66% of their household income, will be exposed to non-deductible taxes for every employee who receives a tax credit subsidy to purchase health care on a public exchange.\n\nFor more information relating to the ACA click here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a94a8070-f1d5-415d-909e-8fffba9d3290", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed by President Obama in March 2010, with the intention of putting consumers back in charge of their health\u2026", "title": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA): what employers need to know | Lexology"}, "Description": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed by President Obama in March 2010, with the intention of putting consumers back in charge of their health\u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Beginning in January 2016, all large employers must provide full-time employees and their dependents, with access to affordable comprehensive coverage.\nFirst things first, all employers need to determine how many full-time, or full-time equivalent employees (FTE) they employ.\nEmployers are required to extend an employee\u2019s coverage to include dependent children under the age of 26.\nUSA November 11 2015The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed by President Obama in March 2010, with the intention of putting consumers back in charge of their health care.\nSmall employers must complete and file Forms 1095-B (Health coverage) and 1094-B (Accompanying transmittal form) with the IRS by February 29, 2016."}
