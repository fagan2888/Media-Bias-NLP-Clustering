[Watch a preview of tonight's show featuring Matt Welch and me.]

Tonight's episode of John Stossel's eponymous Fox Business show (airs 9 P.M. ET and is rerun on Fox Business and Fox News Channel throughout the weekend) is titled "Be Reasonable."

It includes segments on some of the dodgier aspects of life in contemporary America (half of us believe in ghosts) and also one on how Reason magazine changed Stossel's journalism:

Twenty years ago, I wasn't so rational. When neither liberal nor conservative publications made much sense to me, I discovered the libertarian magazine "Reason," which is skeptical of both the left and right. Reason editors Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch (host of "The Independents") say libertarians are more rational than others.
