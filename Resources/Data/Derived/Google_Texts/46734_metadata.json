Analysts have continued to raise their sales estimates on the drug, now putting sales of the blockbuster Hepatitis C drug at $2.87 billion for the quarter, or nearly half of all the company\u2019s $5.85 billion in revenue.\n\nTo recap, Sovaldi is the first in a line of new Hepatitis C regimens to hit the market, offering promise to nearly 3 million patients in the U.S. But the drug has drawn fire for its price tag of $84,000 for three months of treatment, or roughly $1,000 a day. Insurers are calling on Gilead to bring down its price, which the company says is in line with past Hepatitis C drugs that were less effective.\n\nSecond-quarter sales estimates for Sovaldi keep rising, standing at $2.55 billion less than a month ago, and $1.16 billion in March. In turn, that\u2019s driving up the overall projections for Gilead, with earnings now expected somewhere between $1.79 and $1.90 a share. In March, the thought was that earnings would be around 93 cents a share for this quarter. Sales had been projected at $4.1 billion four months ago.\n\nBut the market is waiting on pins and needles, and seems reluctant to move shares up even though Gilead announced it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell a new drug for three types of blood cancer. The new drug, called Zydelig, can now be used to treat certain types of leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nStill, shares of Gilead were up marginally to $89.59 in recent action. The real fireworks, apparently, will come post-market.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nBiogen\u2019s lesson in how to boost an already pricey stock\n\nObamacare ruling nitpicking, or highlighting a viable glitch?\n\nAverage Obamacare hike is 76% without subsidies, study says", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-07-23T13:18:51-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "When Gilead reports its results after the close Wednesday, the world will see just how big a seller its blockbuster Sovaldi drug has become.", "title": "Gilead\u2019s moment of truth arrives: How does Sovaldi impact earnings?", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/23/gileads-moment-of-truth-arrives-how-does-sovaldi-impact-earnings/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CM916_sovald_MG_20140711124155.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "earnings preview,Gilead Sciences Inc.,Hepatitis C,Sovaldi", "article.headline": "Gilead\u2019s moment of truth arrives: How does Sovaldi impact earnings?", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "earnings preview,Gilead Sciences Inc.,Hepatitis C,Sovaldi", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "When Gilead reports its results after the close Wednesday, the world will see just how big a seller its blockbuster Sovaldi drug has become.", "article.published": "2014-07-23T13:18:51-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/23/gileads-moment-of-truth-arrives-how-does-sovaldi-impact-earnings/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "When Gilead reports its results after the close Wednesday, the world will see just how big a seller its blockbuster Sovaldi drug has become.", "title": "Gilead\u2019s moment of truth arrives: How does Sovaldi impact earnings?", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/07/23/gileads-moment-of-truth-arrives-how-does-sovaldi-impact-earnings/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CM916_sovald_MG_20140711124155.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2846", "article.updated": "2014-07-23T13:18:51-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Wednesday is the day we get the verdict on just how well Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s controversial Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi did.\nTo recap, Sovaldi is the first in a line of new Hepatitis C regimens to hit the market, offering promise to nearly 3 million patients in the U.S.\nAfter the close, Gilead /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD is due to report second-quarter earnings, but Sovaldi\u2019s results will be closely watched.\nIn turn, that\u2019s driving up the overall projections for Gilead, with earnings now expected somewhere between $1.79 and $1.90 a share.\nSecond-quarter sales estimates for Sovaldi keep rising, standing at $2.55 billion less than a month ago, and $1.16 billion in March."}
