The website that was supposed to make it easy for Americans to enroll in new plans was plagued by glitches, and the Obama administration admitted that it wasn\u2019t thoroughly tested in time for the roll-out.\n\nNext month, however, federal officials are hoping things will be very different. The White House says that HealthCare.gov is now faster and easier to use. They\u2019ve spent more than five weeks testing the site, including searching for potential weaknesses in the website\u2019s security, and they\u2019re expressing hope that it will offer an \u201ceasier and more satisfying consumer experience\u201d this year.\n\nThe next enrollment period for the health insurance marketplaces kicks off on November 15, and people using the federal site will be able to start browsing plans a month from today. Millions of people are expected to enroll in plans for the first time, while about five million Americans are projected to use HealthCare.gov to make changes to the Obamacare policies they currently have.\n\nFederal officials have significantly streamlined the process for many of those people. About 70 percent of the new customers will only have to complete a 16-page application, compared to the application from last year that involved as many as 76 steps. There\u2019s also a new mobile function that will allow people to enroll on their smart phones. Officials predict it will take about half the time to sign up for a plan.\n\n\u201cConsumers want a faster experience,\u201d Andy Slavitt, the principal deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is responsible for the Obamacare website, told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThey want a more intuitive experience, not to input the same information over and over. And they want mobile.\u201d\n\nSlavitt didn\u2019t rule out the possibility that HealthCare.gov will run into some technological difficulties once millions of people are trying to use the site. But he expressed confidence that his team is more prepared to address them, and he said the website can now handle \u201csignificantly more\u201d concurrent users than it could during the last enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very different spot than we were last year, when we were building from whole cloth. Now we\u2019ve got a body of knowledge that we\u2019re continuing to build and learn against,\u201d Slavitt said at Wednesday\u2019s press briefing.\n\nTo help revamp HealthCare.gov, the government hired a \u201csecond wave of programmers\u201d from Silicon Valley startups and tech giants like Google. Many of the top leadership roles have changed, too; Slavitt, for instance, was brought in after HealthCare.gov\u2019s initial disastrous roll-out to try and rescue the site for its second time around. This week, the Hill noted that the White House is sending an \u201cimplicit message\u201d that the new team leading the effort will be more effective than the people who preceded them.\n\nSome members of the private sector are already gearing up to help Americans navigate the enrollment period. Walmart, the biggest private employer in the country, recently announced that 2,700 of its stores will be staffed with insurance agents to assist people who want to enroll in either the Medicare program or new plans on Obamacare\u2019s insurance marketplaces.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Federal health officials promise that the embattled HealthCare.Gov website is ready for business this month.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Federal health officials promise that the embattled HealthCare.Gov website is ready for business this month.", "title": "Signing Up For Obamacare Is Supposed To Be A Lot Easier This Year", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/09/3577905/obamacare-website-revamp/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacare-enrollment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federal health officials promise that the embattled HealthCare.Gov website is ready for business this month.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacare-enrollment-321x214.jpg", "title": "Signing Up For Obamacare Is Supposed To Be A Lot Easier This Year", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacare-enrollment.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacare-enrollment.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-09T08:59:06+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb88a\"", "article_summary": "Health Signing Up For Obamacare Is Supposed To Be A Lot Easier This Year CREDIT: AP Photo/Jon Elswick, FileAt this time last year, amid the first open enrollment period for Obamacare\u2019s new health insurance marketplaces, HealthCare.gov was a disaster.\nSome members of the private sector are already gearing up to help Americans navigate the enrollment period.\nThe White House says that HealthCare.gov is now faster and easier to use.\nTo help revamp HealthCare.gov, the government hired a \u201csecond wave of programmers\u201d from Silicon Valley startups and tech giants like Google.\nNow we\u2019ve got a body of knowledge that we\u2019re continuing to build and learn against,\u201d Slavitt said at Wednesday\u2019s press briefing."}
