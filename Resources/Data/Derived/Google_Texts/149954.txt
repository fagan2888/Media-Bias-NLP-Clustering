For the second year in a row, the title of Milwaukee's best Bloody Mary goes to Sobelman's Pub & Grill and its massive, appropriately titled Bloody Masterpiece.

The Bloody Mary behemoth – which is available at both its main location at 1900 W. St. Paul Ave., as well as at the Sobelman's restaurant on Marquette's campus – comes with 13 total garnishes, including celery, onion, Brussel sprout, lemon, pickle, shrimp, mushroom, cherry tomato, olive, cheese, sausage, asparagus and green onion. Oh, and a bacon cheeseburger slider. Throw in a Sprecher chaser, and the Bloody Masterpiece is less of a drink and more of a complete, balanced meal.

Coming in second place, nearly 200 votes behind Sobelman's, is The Wicked Hop. It was still a strong showing from the former king of the category, whose loaded-up and well-balanced Bloody Mary still makes it the choice for the OnMilwaukee.com editors. For OMC readers, however, it seems there's just no beating a bonus burger.
