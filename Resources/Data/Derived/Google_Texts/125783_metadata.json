Out of the 182,900 applicants that submitted claims for damages from Sandy, more than 29,000 may have already had private home or car insurance, leading to the possibility that these were duplicate or fraudulent claims, the watchdog report said.\n\nRelated: FEMA Wasted Billions on Administrative Costs\n\nThe report outlines four different reasons why applicants with private insurance may have applied for FEMA money, and not all of them involve cheating the government. They may have had insurance but not flood insurance, or they may have had too little insurance coverage. Some filers may not have known the rules about submitting claims to both FEMA and their insurer. Others were knowingly committing fraud.\n\nAt the same time, the fraud rate might even be higher than detailed in the report because the inspector general determined its numbers using the National Insurance Crime Bureau, but participation in the Bureau by insurance agencies is voluntary and not all companies share their information. \u201cOther than the National Flood Insurance Database, FEMA does not have a reliable tool to verify insurance coverage,\u201d the report said.\n\nAll applicants for FEMA assistance are told that any false statements they make in their claims are against both federal and state laws, but the lax regulations make FEMA an easy and potentially tempting target for crooks.\n\nThe inspector general made three recommendations to FEMA: Clarify the possible consequences of falsifying claims or omitting information on applications, develop or use a comprehensive database to determine whether an applicant has private insurance coverage and review past payments that have a high risk of being incorrect in order to recoup any funds that shouldn\u2019t have been paid.\n\nRelated: FEMA Still Doesn\u2019t Know Where Its Money Is Going\n\nFEMA said that it would work to implement the necessary changes. The agency emphasized that until a comprehensive database is put into place, insurance verification will remain a challenge.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Up to $250 million of the $1.4 billion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (F", "title": "FEMA May Have Wrongly Paid $250 Million in Sandy Relief Funds", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/FEMA-May-Have-Wrongly-Paid-250-Million-Sandy-Relief-Funds", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/FEMA-May-Have-Wrongly-Paid-250-Million-Sandy-Relief-Funds", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Up to $250 million of the $1.4 billion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (F", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c78\"", "article_summary": "They may have had insurance but not flood insurance, or they may have had too little insurance coverage.\n\u201cOther than the National Flood Insurance Database, FEMA does not have a reliable tool to verify insurance coverage,\u201d the report said.\nThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General found that FEMA doesn\u2019t have any system in place to verify that applicants for assistance don\u2019t have other insurance coverage.\nUp to $250 million of the $1.4 billion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) paid to victims of Hurricane Sandy may have been improperly issued, according to a report this month from a federal watchdog.\nRelated: FEMA Still Doesn\u2019t Know Where Its Money Is GoingFEMA said that it would work to implement the necessary changes."}
