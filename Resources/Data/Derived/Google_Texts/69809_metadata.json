That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say they need to actually listen not only to what I\u2019m saying, but look at my life and look at what\u2019s been done,\u201d the retired neurosurgeon told reporters. \u201cIt is the things that have been done that elevate people. Not things that impress people and make them dependent.\u201d\n\nCarson has received world-wide acclaim for decades as a brilliant neurosurgeon. He first gained attention politically with a keynote address he delivered at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast by destroying President Obama\u2019s sacred cows \u2014 from political correctness to Obamacare \u2014 with the commander in chief seated only 10 feet away.\n\nWithin a week of his speech, the ultra-liberal \u201cDaily Kos\u201d pounced with a hit piece headlined, \u201cDear Ben Carson, When A Person Has to Deny Being an Uncle Tom, It Usually Means They Are One.\u201d\n\nDespite his laid-back personality, Carson\u2019s message and the sense of humor he displayed at the Fox News-Facebook GOP presidential debate last week elevated him in the polls.\n\nCarson, who was raised by a single mother in a poverty-stricken section of Detroit, told reporters at the Harlem news conference why the black community so strongly votes Democratic, and what the GOP needs to do to to win it back.\n\n\u201cWell, I think it is because the Democratic Party has ascribed to the Lyndon Johnson philosophy. I don\u2019t know if you know, but Lyndon Johnson said, \u2018If you give those N-words such and such, they\u2019ll vote for us for the next 200 years,\u2019 \u201c he said.\n\n\u201cWhat the Republican Party needs to do is come out and discuss more the kinds of relationships and the programs that will actually bring people out of poverty. That will also give them the ability to use their God-given talents to rise rather than to simply be satisfied in a dependent position in society.\u201d\n\nHe continued that message on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Wednesday, describing the relationship of blacks and the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t truly respect you, who don\u2019t really see you as an equal, but just take care of you in order that you take care of them,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson said his support is growing.\n\nHe revealed that one woman approached him in the airport and told him she loved him despite being a lifelong Democrat, and that many people came up to him while he walked the streets of Harlem and voiced their support.\n\n\u201cThe stuff that I\u2019m talking about has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIt has to do with America and what kind of nation are we going to have and what are we going to pass on to our grandchildren.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip, via Fox News.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Ben Carson might be soft-spoken, but when he hits back against accusations he\u2019s an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d or some kind of traitor to black Americans,\u00a0 his message speaks volumes.
