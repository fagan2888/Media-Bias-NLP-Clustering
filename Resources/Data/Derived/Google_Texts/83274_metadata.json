Participation in biometric screenings went up even more, by 55%, EBRI observes.\n\n\u201cWhile most workers say they participate in these programs to improve their health, financial incentive are very effective at getting workers in the door,\u201d notes Paul Fronstin, director of EBRI\u2019s Health Research and Education Program and co-author of the analysis. \u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that suggests workplace wellness programs may reduce health care spending, but workers have to participate for the programs to work.\u201d\n\nEBRI finds the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) created an inducement for wellness programs, allowing employers to provide financial incentives of as much as 30% of the total cost of coverage when tied to participation in a wellness program.
