Courtney Rhodes, CC BY 2.0\n\nThere\u2019s a new kind of high you can get \u2014 legally \u2014 no drugs required. According to a recent study published in the journal Psychiatry Research, staring into someone\u2019s eyes for 10 minutes can induce hallucinations, from seeing distorted faces to monsters.\n\nEye contact is seen as a great way to foster intimacy, because you can express many of your feelings through your eyes. When you make direct eye contact with someone, you temporarily become disconnected from the rest of your environment or natural surroundings. This is because when we stare at a focal point for a prolonged period of time, details in your peripheral gradually begin to disappear. These feelings of disassociation are part of Troxler\u2019s fading phenomenon.\n\nGiovanni Caputo, an Italian psychologist at the University of Urbino in Italy sought to explore what happens when two people stare into one each other\u2019s eyes for a prolonged period of time, so he recruited a total of 40 young adults, who he sorted into pairs, and then divided into two groups. One served as the control and was asked to stare at a wall for 10 minutes in a dimly lit room. The other group was paired up and the pairs were asked to stare, emotionless, into each other\u2019s eyes for 10 minutes, also in a dimly lit room to enhance facial features.\n\nHalf of the pairs were seated opposite one another, gazing at each other\u2019s neutral expressions. The other half were seated positioned back-to-back, staring at the wall. The participants weren\u2019t informed of the nature of the study and instead were told it was a meditative experience.\n\nAfter 10 minutes, the participants were asked to fill in questionnaires about their experiences in the room. The findings revealed people in the paired group reported more disassociation symptoms than those in the control group, such as experiencing a loss of connection with reality, changes in sound or color perception, and complaining of time \u201cstaying still.\u201d Regarding hallucinations, 90 percent of the paired volunteers reported seeing changes to the face of the person they were staring at, with 90 percent admitting they saw their partner\u2019s face appear deformed, 75 percent saw monstrous beings, and 15 percent even saw traits of a relative\u2019s face appear on their partner.\n\n\u201cThese results indicate that dissociative symptoms and hallucinatory phenomena during interpersonal-gazing under low illumination can involve different processes,\u201d Caputo wrote in the paper.\n\nCaputo admits these are symptoms of dissociation, which is our departure from our connection to reality. However, these symptoms only correlated with the participants\u2019 experience with facial deformity, but not the appearance of strange faces. He believes the hallucinations or \u201cstrange-face apparitions\u201d are a consequence of coming back to \u201creality\u201d after experiencing an altered state of consciousness caused by the lack of sensory stimulation.\n\nThis coincides with Caputo\u2019s 2010 study published in the journal Perception that found when participants gazed upon their reflections in a mirror for 10 minutes in a dimly lit room, they started to hallucinate in less than a minute. Their faces began to warp and change, resembling animals, monsters, or even deceased family members. These strange effects were even more dramatic when the mirror was swapped for another person.\n\nAlthough it is not yet known why the hallucinations occur, Caputo suggests it\u2019s likely due to sensory deprivation. He believes it is possible that they happen as the brain snaps back to reality after zoning out and the mind transmits subconscious thoughts onto the face of the other person.\n\nCaputo\u2019s research can have important implications when it comes to understanding patients who experience hallucinations associated with mental health conditions like schizophrenia.\n\n\"Disconnected parts of the self, which are usually projected during delirium, may be integrated into consciousness,\" Caputo said. \"This integration may be helpful during very early stages of schizophrenia, since the individual might avoid the pathological circle of confirming into its 'reality' what is exclusively an unconscious projection.\"\n\nIt seems like holding someone\u2019s gaze can help you get \u201chigh\u201d and reach nirvana, without LSD.\n\nSources: Caputo GB.
