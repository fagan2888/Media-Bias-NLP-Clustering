She\u2019s doing well in her classes, recently changed her major to biomedical sciences and gets along with her roommate.\n\nWith the help of College Success Arizona, Shawndeena is the first in her family to attend college. Despite being active at Tuba City High School on the Navajo Nation and graduating with a 4.3 GPA, college tuition was something her family just couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nBut thanks to a College Success Arizona scholarship funded by Salt River Project, the Native American student has set her sights on becoming a doctor.\n\nCollege Success Arizona is a nonprofit that provides intensive mentoring and scholarships to low-income and first-generation students across the state. SRP has invested in the unique scholarship program because it has the ability to reach high potential, low-income students and offers support services that helps ensure academic success.\n\nAlong with financial assistance, all College Success Arizona scholars are required to meet with their success advisers at least twice a semester. In addition to the intensive mentoring, College Success Arizona provides career guidance and professional development activities, an Annual Leadership Symposium, and networking activities through their Scholars Success Network events held on campuses across the state throughout the year.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of help from my mentor. I can email or text him any time with questions about anything,\u201d she said. Shawndeena is applying for a four-week program to study science in the United Kingdom\u2014something she might not have known about without that guidance.\n\n\u201cAt SRP, providing financial assistance to students like Shawndeena is an investment in the future,\u201d said Rosemary Gannon, SRP Manager of Community Outreach. \u201cSRP operates the Navajo Generating Station on the Navajo Reservation, so this is also a way to give back to communities in which our employees live and work.\u201d\n\nSRP employee Janet Chee was the first student who was awarded the CSA/SRP scholarship. As the first person in her family to attend college, Chee said the scholarship and mentoring helped guide her when she graduated from ASU with a degree in business management. Chee, who went on to earn a master\u2019s in information management, is an analyst in SRP\u2019s Market Research area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful for all the opportunities and mentoring I had in college and now here at SRP,\u201d Chee said.\n\nCollege Success Arizona relies on corporation contributions from companies like SRP to help pay college tuition costs for students who might otherwise not be able to afford a higher education.\n\n\u201cThis is Shawndeena\u2019s first year in our program, but she has already made a significant impression on me,\u201d said Robert Davis, Shawndeena\u2019s Success Adviser. \u201cShawndeena is a self-motivated, driven student who treats those around her with humble kindness and respect. She will make an exceptional doctor one day. I have no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nFor Shawndeena, she\u2019s grateful for the assistance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one less thing for me to worry about,\u201d she said.\n\nSRP is a community-based nonprofit utility. It is the third-largest public power utility in the nation, serving more than 1 million electric customers in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. SRP is also the largest provider of water to the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, delivering about 800,000 acre-feet annually.\n\nSRP offers assistance to students through a variety of scholarship programs for students pursuing STEM fields of study.
