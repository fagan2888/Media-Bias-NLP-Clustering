He has some com\u00adpany in the 28-year-old be\u00adhind RxApps, John Moore III. Each heads a firm that is find\u00ading a foothold in the chan\u00adging world of health care tech\u00adno\u00adlogy.\n\n\u201cTech\u00adno\u00adlogy is be\u00ading forced on care or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions,\u201d Moore says, cit\u00ading the Health In\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion Tech\u00adno\u00adlogy for Eco\u00adnom\u00adic and Clin\u00adic\u00adal Health Act of 2009, a pre\u00adcurs\u00ador to Obama\u00adcare. The HITECH Act for the first time re\u00adquires hos\u00adpit\u00adals to use elec\u00adtron\u00adic med\u00adic\u00adal re\u00adcords. \u201cNow that hos\u00adpit\u00adals and doc\u00adtors are be\u00ading forced to use these fairly ba\u00adsic soft\u00adware tools, there\u2019s pres\u00adsure to ad\u00adopt more tools,\u201d Moore says.\n\nThe Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act also shif\u00adted the in\u00adcent\u00adives sys\u00adtem for health care pro\u00adviders in a way that en\u00adcour\u00adages the de\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment of new tech\u00adno\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal tools, mak\u00ading fund\u00ading avail\u00adable for chal\u00adlenge grants to test new care-de\u00adliv\u00adery mod\u00adels. \u201cWith so many people now be\u00ading in\u00adsured, there is a much grander fo\u00adcus on pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health,\u201d Moore writes in an email. \u201cThis means a big fo\u00adcus on new ana\u00adlyt\u00adics tools.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s Bo\u00adston-based RxApps is a mo\u00adbile plat\u00adform de\u00adsigned to fa\u00adcil\u00adit\u00adate bet\u00adter com\u00admu\u00adnic\u00ada\u00adtion between doc\u00adtors and pa\u00adtients. If a pa\u00adtient is dia\u00adgnosed with de\u00adpres\u00adsion, for ex\u00adample, Moore says the doc\u00adtor will use RxApps to check in and see how the treat\u00adment plan is work\u00ading. The pa\u00adtient will re\u00adceive a series of texted ques\u00adtions tailored to the in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal and the is\u00adsues he or she struggles with: Did she take her med\u00adic\u00ada\u00adtion? How many hours of sleep did he get?\n\nThe be\u00adne\u00adfits of these re\u00admind\u00aders work both ways. Moore, whose back\u00adground is in mo\u00adlecu\u00adlar bio\u00adlogy and ge\u00adnet\u00adics re\u00adsearch, was in\u00adspired to cre\u00adate RxApps after watch\u00ading friends and fam\u00adily go through treat\u00adment for which \u201cdoc\u00adtors wer\u00aden\u2019t get\u00adting all of the in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion to make fully in\u00adformed treat\u00adment de\u00adcisions,\u201d he says. The free-to-use product re\u00adcently went live, which means the firm can col\u00adlect more data on how doc\u00adtors and pa\u00adtients com\u00admu\u00adnic\u00adate. That will not only help them im\u00adprove res\u00adults for users, but will also help the com\u00adpany at\u00adtract in\u00advestors, for whom cold, hard data is king.\n\nRxApps trains po\u00adten\u00adtial cli\u00adents to ask ques\u00adtions that won\u2019t put them at risk of breach\u00ading the HIPAA pri\u00advacy rules they are all sub\u00adject to. The user manu\u00adal in\u00adcludes in\u00adstruc\u00adtions on cus\u00adtom\u00adiz\u00ading text mes\u00adsages ac\u00adcord\u00ading to those rules: \u201cHow is your mood?\u201d rather than, \u201cHow is your de\u00adpres\u00adsion?\u201d\n\nMean\u00adwhile, An\u00admol Madan\u2019s com\u00adpany, Ginger.io, looks for pat\u00adterns in phone us\u00adage that could help an\u00adswer that ques\u00adtion. The Bo\u00adston-based firm is named after the root, with its famed medi\u00adcin\u00adal powers \u2014 a kind of in\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal sym\u00adbol for the kind of pre\u00advent\u00adat\u00adive care that Madan would like his com\u00adpany to rep\u00adres\u00adent. (\u201c.io,\u201d was simply cheap\u00ader than \u201c.com.\u201d)\n\nThe start-up har\u00adnesses data from pa\u00adtients\u2019 phones to help pro\u00adviders pre\u00addict how they\u2019ll be\u00adhave dur\u00ading treat\u00adment. Us\u00ading this in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion, Madan says, hos\u00adpit\u00adals and doc\u00adtors can gain in\u00adsight in\u00adto how people, par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly with mood dis\u00adorders or at\u00adten\u00adtion de\u00adfi\u00adcit dis\u00adorder, are feel\u00ading and what kind of med\u00adic\u00adal as\u00adsist\u00adance they might need.\n\nPa\u00adtients with de\u00adpres\u00adsion tend to isol\u00adate them\u00adselves, which could ap\u00adpear in a di\u00admin\u00adished amount of out\u00adput and in\u00adter\u00adac\u00adtion on their phones. The soft\u00adware would re\u00adcog\u00adnize such a change in data pat\u00adterns and re\u00adlay this in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion to con\u00adcerned parties, which could, if pa\u00adtients opt-in, in\u00adclude fam\u00adily and friends. \u201cWe call it the \u2018check en\u00adgine light,\u2019 which goes off when something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Madan says.\n\nThe idea for the com\u00adpany came out of Madan\u2019s Ph.D. work at the MIT Me\u00addia Lab; he wrote his thes\u00adis \u201con mod\u00adel\u00ading hu\u00adman be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador us\u00ading mo\u00adbile sensors.\u201d In the two years since it was foun\u00added, the com\u00adpany has grown to 18 Bo\u00adston- and San Fran\u00adcisco-based em\u00adploy\u00adees, most of them sci\u00adent\u00adists or en\u00adgin\u00adeers rather than med\u00adic\u00adal school grads. Madan says Ginger.io cur\u00adrently works with 12 hos\u00adpit\u00adals.\n\nKeep\u00ading people\u2019s most in\u00adtim\u00adate in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion se\u00adcure is a key is\u00adsue health care tech CEOs like Madan and Moore will face go\u00ading for\u00adward. \u201cThe whole be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador\u00adal side of health \u2014 people are really touchy about that. People don\u2019t want oth\u00ader people to know that they have bi\u00adpolar [dis\u00adorder] or anxi\u00adety, be\u00adcause so\u00adci\u00adety stig\u00admat\u00adizes those con\u00addi\u00adtions,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure to en\u00adcrypt everything very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are all things that \u201c\u00a6 most en\u00adgin\u00adeers guard on a day-to-day basis,\u201d says Madan. \u201cThe big\u00adger thing is what is your philo\u00adsophy on that data and who [ul\u00adti\u00admately] owns that data.\u201d And that\u2019s a de\u00adbate just get\u00adting star\u00adted.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/68134/how-your-smartphone-could-improve-your-health", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/10/21/150012782.jpg", "site_name": "National Journal", "title": "How Your Smartphone Could Improve Your Health"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/10/21/150012782.jpg"}, "site": "@nationaljournal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Your Smartphone Could Improve Your Health"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2301\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTech\u00adno\u00adlogy is be\u00ading forced on care or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions,\u201d Moore says, cit\u00ading the Health In\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion Tech\u00adno\u00adlogy for Eco\u00adnom\u00adic and Clin\u00adic\u00adal Health Act of 2009, a pre\u00adcurs\u00ador to Obama\u00adcare.\n\u201cWith so many people now be\u00ading in\u00adsured, there is a much grander fo\u00adcus on pop\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion health,\u201d Moore writes in an email.\nEach heads a firm that is find\u00ading a foothold in the chan\u00adging world of health care tech\u00adno\u00adlogy.\nKeep\u00ading people\u2019s most in\u00adtim\u00adate in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion se\u00adcure is a key is\u00adsue health care tech CEOs like Madan and Moore will face go\u00ading for\u00adward.\nThe Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act also shif\u00adted the in\u00adcent\u00adives sys\u00adtem for health care pro\u00adviders in a way that en\u00adcour\u00adages the de\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment of new tech\u00adno\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal tools, mak\u00ading fund\u00ading avail\u00adable for chal\u00adlenge grants to test new care-de\u00adliv\u00adery mod\u00adels."}
