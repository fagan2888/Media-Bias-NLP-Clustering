1. How have you and other Brownsville leaders been able to pursue the community to pursue a healthier lifestyle?

At the time, I was a private practitioner who did not regularly vote, so I can’t really say I was in the trenches with policy makers at all. But I got involved in an initiative at the University of Texas School of Public Health here in Brownsville to create a farmers market that would be accessible and affordable to people of all incomes and ages.

For that initiative I was usually the person who spoke to the city government about permits and that type of thing, so I learned a bit about how policy is made and how funds are allotted. That led me to become interested in getting involved in a political sense because I realized that if designing and opening a farmers market, which should be a simple, very good thing for the community, was so hard and had so much red tape around it, that I needed to have a stronger voice. Otherwise, the voice of wellness was not going to be heard.

Back then the relationship between wellness or age-friendly communities and the economy was not not understood by policy makers. Translating the health data into its economic implications is what began to get folks listening.



2. Do you remember there being a light bulb moment when you were talking to people and you realized they had got it, at last?

Well, I remember very clearly that as we went from initiative to initiative — we started with farmers’ markets, then we went on to the Challenge, which is a five-month springtime event for engaging the community in healthy living, and then the CycloBia — there were fewer and fewer people who stood up and said “No.”

The rewarding a-ha moment was when that scale tipped and instead of having to make a case and argue for a particular initiative, we received a more enthusiastic welcome. “Oh, you have another initiative. OK, what’s it about? How can we get involved?”
