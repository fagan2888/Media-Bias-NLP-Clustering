Peterson\n\nAndrea Garcia, a health-care navigator with Comunidades Unidas\n\nThough the passage of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act divided conservatives and liberals across the country about the role of government, the ACA\u2019s HealthCare.gov also united millions of Americans of both parties in the hair-pulling frustration of trying to enroll using the glitch-prone website.\n\n\n\nAs intimidating as the website was for Americans who are used to clicking their way through online forms and applications, for many Latinos in Utah, enrolling through the government portal meant getting an e-mail for the first time.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to start all the way from the bottom,\u201d says Andrea Garcia, a health-care navigator with the Salt Lake City nonprofit Comunidades Unidas. She works to help enroll Latinos in the ACA, which often means holding clients\u2019 hands through the basics of the Internet before attempting to tackle HealthCare.gov.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe work creating an e-mail account, creating an account on the marketplace and then having to go through the whole process,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cAnd because there are so many glitches on the website, we\u2019ve had to call the agents on the phone to try to sign them up.\u201d\n\n\n\nNavigators like Garcia are tasked with making sure community members are enrolled under ACA before the March 31 open-enrollment deadline. Under the ACA, funds have been earmarked to help various nonprofit groups get the word out, perform community outreach and guide individuals through the process of enrollment.\n\n\n\nThe ACA is expected to help Utah\u2019s Latino population, which is disproportionately affected by preventable diseases like hypertension and diabetes.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Feb. 11 report by the United States Department of Health & Human Services, there are 86,000 Latinos in Utah who are currently uninsured but could qualify for ACA subsidies. That number represents roughly a third of all Latinos in the state, and nationwide is .8 percent of Latinos eligible for ACA coverage.\n\n\n\nBut as health-care navigators who work directly with their communities know, the official number of eligible Latinos doesn\u2019t provide the whole picture of many households with documented and undocumented family members.\n\n\n\nWhile Garcia has to turn away undocumented Latinos for not being eligible for ACA coverage, she is happy to tell clients that undocumented parents who enroll their U.S. citizen children don\u2019t have to worry that bringing them into the system will expose them to deportation.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe information put on the marketplace will not be used against them,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cSo we remind them that [ACA staff] are not going to be calling ICE on them.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are other fear-based obstacles to ACA enrollment in the Latino community. Angela Castano, a navigator with Alliance Community Services, says many undocumented Latinos are used to receiving health care at community centers or waiting until there\u2019s a health emergency to seek care. Others\u2014even those who are eligible for insurance\u2014are simply unaccustomed to having it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are not used to having insurance,\u201d Castro says. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how it works so they are afraid of buying something when they don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd she says there are some private insurance agents out there who prey on this uncertainty. She\u2019s heard of agents telling Latinos who make too much for Medicaid but not enough for ACA to simply report a higher income on their taxes so that they can get ACA subsidies\u2014a deception that will, in the end, mean that they\u2019ll pay more in taxes because of their inflated reporting.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey confuse and try to enroll people through lies,\u201d Castano says.\n\n\n\nBut both women stress the importance of becoming familiar with health care despite the daunting aspects. Garcia does basic health screenings at the Mexican Consulate and says that she\u2019s sometimes the first one to tell community members who\u2019ve neglected to get simple checkups that they have serious conditions like diabetes or hypertension.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s just astounding that people are unaware that they have a chronic condition,\u201d Garcia says. The ACA, she says, will help a person\u2019s introduction to health care be with a family doc and not an emergency-room team.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to put a focus on preventative health and give people the benefit of getting to know the health system in the first place,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This is the second part in a series looking at how enrollment in the Affordable Care Act will affect different members of Utah\u2019s communities. Part 1 profiled the opportunities and challenges ACA creates for the LGBT community.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "As intimidating as the website was for Americans who are used to clicking their way through online forms and applications, for many Latinos in Utah, enrolling through the government portal meant getting an e-mail for the first time.", "title": "Utah's Latinos face fears, uncertainty about ACA | News | Salt Lake City | Salt Lake City Weekly", "og": {"site_name": "Salt Lake City Weekly", "description": "As intimidating as the website was for Americans who are used to clicking their way through online forms and applications, for many Latinos in Utah, enrolling through the government portal meant getting an e-mail for the first time.", "title": "Utah's Latinos face fears, uncertainty about ACA", "url": "http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/utahs-latinos-face-fears-uncertainty-about-aca/Content?oid=2373840", "image": {"width": 338, "identifier": "http://media2.fdncms.com/saltlake/imager/andrea-garcia-a-health-care-navigator-wit/u/slideshow/2373841/art18830.jpg", "height": 450}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media2.fdncms.com/saltlake/imager/andrea-garcia-a-health-care-navigator-wit/u/slideshow/2373841/art18830.jpg"}, "title": "Utah's Latinos face fears, uncertainty about ACA", "description": "As intimidating as the website was for Americans who are used to clicking their way through online forms and applications, for many Latinos in Utah, enrolling through the government portal meant getting an e-mail for the first time.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ericspeterson"}, "oid": 2373840, "fb": {"app_id": 358760447552497}, "keywords": "News, Politics, Media, Stories, Issues, Commentary, Opinion, Humor, LDS, LGBT, Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden, Provo and Utah, Best of Salt Lake City, Restaurants, Dining, Bars, News, Events, Music, Arts, Guide, Review, Best Of Utah, Salt Lake City, SLC, Park City, Best of Music, LGBT, Party, Band, Venue", "thumbnail": "http://media2.fdncms.com/saltlake/imager/andrea-garcia-a-health-care-navigator-wit/u/slideshow/2373841/art18830.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "news, politics, media, stories, issues, commentary, opinion, humor, lds, lgbt"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe239f\"", "article_summary": "That number represents roughly a third of all Latinos in the state, and nationwide is .8 percent of Latinos eligible for ACA coverage.\nBut both women stress the importance of becoming familiar with health care despite the daunting aspects.\nThe ACA is expected to help Utah\u2019s Latino population, which is disproportionately affected by preventable diseases like hypertension and diabetes.\nThe ACA, she says, will help a person\u2019s introduction to health care be with a family doc and not an emergency-room team.\nShe works to help enroll Latinos in the ACA, which often means holding clients\u2019 hands through the basics of the Internet before attempting to tackle HealthCare.gov."}
