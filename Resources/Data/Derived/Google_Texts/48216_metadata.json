Analysts expect young adults to gravitate toward the bronze and catastrophic plans, which are the lowest-cost options.\n\nBoth the bronze and the catastrophic plans cover basic preventive health services, including cholesterol tests, immunizations and screenings for depression and alcoholism (a full list is here). Both also cover, to varying degrees, all 10 categories of \u201cessential health services\u201d: hospitalizations, emergency services, ambulatory (outpatient care) services, some maternity and newborn care, pediatric care, vision and dental care for children, mental health and behavioral health treatment, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, laboratory services and chronic care services.\n\nThere are some key differences between these two tiers, however. This chart can help you decide which plan may be right for you.\n\nBronze Plans Catastrophic Plans* Available to Anyone who is eligible to buy a plan on the health insurance marketplace. Only those under age 30 or who cannot find coverage for less than 8 percent of their income.

Actuarial Value Bronze plans will have an \u201cactuarial value\u201d of 60 percent, meaning they will cover 60 percent of all health care costs for the average person.

Catastrophic plans will only cover health care costs (beyond three primary care visits and specified preventive services) after the plan deductible has been met. Deductible Maximum deductible of $6,600 for an individual plan ($13,200 for a family plan), but actual deductibles are likely to be significantly lower because plans must cover 60 percent of health care costs for the average person.
