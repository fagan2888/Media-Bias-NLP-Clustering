Practically all tax returns will be filed electronically, the IRS will notify taxpayers of receipt of their returns through a secure email account, and virtually all other interaction \u2013 from making payments to resolving complex tax questions to auditing returns \u2013will be handled by electronically.\n\nIn other words, the new IRS motto essentially will be, \u201cDon\u2019t call us and we won\u2019t call you.\u201d\n\nWith far less spent on customer service and more resources shifted to enforcement operations to crack down on scofflaws and cheats, the IRS will be entering what National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson calls the \u201cbrave new world\u201d of federal tax collection and auditing.\n\nIn her latest annual report issued this week, Olson warns that by essentially \u201cgetting out of the business of talking with taxpayers,\u201d the government is headed down a dangerous path \u2013 one that will alienate millions of average taxpayers, small businesses and even some millennials who prefer or need to communicate in person with the IRS.\n\nRelated: IRS Flunks First Test of Enforcing Obamacare\n\nWhile the IRS did a good job overall in allocating limited resources in the 2015 filing season according to Olson, millions of taxpayers were unable to reach the IRS by phone, millions did not receive a timely response to their correspondence \u2013 or any response, for that matter -- and many more had to pay a tax preparer or professional for answers to tax law questions or assistance that previously came from the IRS.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this increased compliance burden on taxpayers is significant, as is the loss of trust in the tax agency. For a tax system that relies on voluntary self-assessment by its taxpayers, none of this bodes well,\u201d Olson wrote. \u201cIn fact, there is a real risk that the inability of taxpayers to obtain assistance from the government, and their consequent frustration, will lead to less voluntary compliance and more enforced compliance.\u201d\n\nNowhere is this more evident than the IRS\u2019s handling of identity theft, according to Olson. One study found that IRS processes harm victims of identity theft, whose cases are complex and often involve multiple years of tax filings. The biggest problem is that no one IRS employee assumes responsibility for working through the problem.\n\nOlson also challenged the IRS\u2019s strategy of shifting resources from customer service to enforcement, arguing that it is shortsighted and will end up generating less tax revenue from cheats than could be generated by helping others to comply with the tax laws.\n\nRelated: Underfunded IRS Begins Crucial Obamacare Test\n\n\u201cLess than two percent is collected through enforcement action,\u201d she said. \u201cThus, increasing enforced collection would be a hollow victory if voluntary compliance declines because of decreasing taxpayer service and the attendant loss of good will. Moreover, it makes good economic sense to facilitate voluntary compliance because voluntary compliance is far more cost effective than enforced compliance.\u201d\n\nHer analysis is counter to what top IRS officials and lawmakers have argued in recent years in pushing for restoration of Republican-imposed budget cuts in the enforcement operations to enhance revenue collections.\n\nAccording to Olson, if the IRS were to collect 10 percent less in enforcement revenue, it would likely cost the government less than $6 billion in foregone revenue. But if voluntary tax payments were to drop by 10 percent, tax revenues would decline by more than $300 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IRS\u2019s vision of the future rests on a mistaken assumption that it can save dollars and maintain voluntary compliance by automating taxpayer service and issue resolution and getting out of the business of dealing with taxpayers directly in person or by phone,\u201d Olson wrote.\n\nRelated: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax Cheats\n\nThe IRS responded in a statement Wednesday that Olson\u2019s report did not fully reflect the agency\u2019s long-term strategic plan, according to The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe IRS remains fully committed to personal service to taxpayers,\u201d the agency said, \u201cand the IRS believes increasing the availability of self-service interaction frees up in-person resources for taxpayers who truly need them, including those who are not comfortable online or don\u2019t have personal access to a computer.\u201d\n\nOlson, the congressionally appointed watchdog of the controversial agency, acknowledged there were many positive components to the evolving IRS strategy that would speed up filings, payment of tax returns and disseminating information to average taxpayers.\n\nHowever, she warned that relying too heavily on technology over personal interaction may breed a \u201cpay to play\u201d system in which wealthier individuals and businesses can afford to retain tax-accountants and lawyers while less well-to-do or tech-savvy taxpayers will be out of luck.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for the Tax Collector to Come Calling\n\nShe said the large number of taxpayers who have limited or no electronic access or skills will not be able to navigate the system effectively, while the \u201cIRS is largely ignoring this reality, hoping taxpayers will grow out of it in five years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis multi-channel preference even exists for younger and well-educated individuals who typically have greater preferences for online services,\u201d Olson wrote. \u201cAs for businesses, the medium to large companies prefer online services more than small businesses.\u201d\n\nJohn Koskinen, the IRS commissioner, told The Washington Post that the move to online interactions is an obvious effort to \u201ccatch up to get into the 21st Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur surveys show that this is what taxpayers want,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The cash-strapped Internal Revenue Service for years has been moving towards a more au", "title": "New IRS Customer Service Motto: \u2018Don\u2019t Call Us and We Won\u2019t Call You\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/07/New-IRS-Customer-Service-Motto-Don-t-Call-Us-and-We-Won-t-Call-You", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122012_Preparing_Taxes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/07/New-IRS-Customer-Service-Motto-Don-t-Call-Us-and-We-Won-t-Call-You", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04122012_Preparing_Taxes_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The cash-strapped Internal Revenue Service for years has been moving towards a more au", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax CheatsThe IRS responded in a statement Wednesday that Olson\u2019s report did not fully reflect the agency\u2019s long-term strategic plan, according to The New York Times.\n\u201cThus, increasing enforced collection would be a hollow victory if voluntary compliance declines because of decreasing taxpayer service and the attendant loss of good will.\nFor a tax system that relies on voluntary self-assessment by its taxpayers, none of this bodes well,\u201d Olson wrote.\nOne study found that IRS processes harm victims of identity theft, whose cases are complex and often involve multiple years of tax filings.\n\u201cThe impact of this increased compliance burden on taxpayers is significant, as is the loss of trust in the tax agency."}
