With rising health-care spending, private equity firms have been busy scooping assets in the past year that can improve the system\u2019s efficiency and at the same time, contain costs.\n\nIn a sign of the steep price valuation buyers are willing to pay for such assets, H.I.G. Capital sold its stake in medical cost containment service provider PMSI Group LLC to Progressive Medical Inc.\u2014backed by Kelso & Co. and StoneRiver Group\u2014for a more than 50 times return.\n\nTPG entered the fray with the purchase of Envision Pharmaceutical Holdings Inc., a Twinsburg, Ohio-based pharmacy benefit management company.\n\nThe deal, announced in July and completed this month, is no small feat for TPG, given the firm has been on the hunt for a slice of the pie for years.\n\n\u201cHistorically, they have been hard to find as many have been strategically consolidated,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said, referring to acquisitions by large pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nFort Worth, Texas-based TPG didn\u2019t put forward the highest bid, but still beat a private equity peer to the asset. Mr. Rhodes declined to comment on the price of the Envision purchase nor which firm presented the highest bid.\n\nKevin Nagle, Envision\u2019s chief executive, said TPG puts other values on the table.\n\n\u201cTPG\u2019s experience is helpful to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIts M&A team helps us target businesses whether they are clear-cut PBMs, or have similar businesses that cross over to ours and would create synergies by being part of Envision.\u201d\n\nEnvision said it provides integrated pharmacy benefit management, but at a flat monthly management fee. Discounts and rebates are credited back to the more than 10 million individuals it serves.\n\nTPG\u2019s plan for Envision is to strengthen budding operations, like specialty drug management, and expand its reach, particularly to corporate clients.\n\n\u201cWhile employers are shifting healthcare costs to employees, companies are still bearing a significant part of the cost and rising costs are still an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cA recent win for Envision is a large brand name American company that spends over $10 million a year in drug spending and by switching to Envision, it\u2019s able to save 20%.\u201d\n\nMr. Rhodes said the hope is to double or triple the $3.5 billion Envision brings in as annual revenue.\n\nWrite to Amy Or at amy.or@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "TPG Capital believes there are still many opportunities to be had with the cost-saving goal of the nation\u2019s current health-care reform. \u201cIf this is a baseball game, we are in the third innings of cost containment,\u201d said Jeff Rhodes, a principal at the megafirm.", "title": "TPG Believes It Is Still Early Days in Health-Care Cost Containment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2013/11/22/tpg-believes-it-is-still-early-days-in-health-care-cost-containment/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "TPG Believes It Is Still Early Days in Health-Care Cost Containment", "description": "TPG Capital believes there are still many opportunities to be had with the cost-saving goal of the nation\u2019s current health-care reform. \u201cIf this is a baseball game, we are in the third innings of cost containment,\u201d said Jeff Rhodes, a principal at the megafirm.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "TPG Capital believes there are still many opportunities to be had with the cost-saving goal of the nation\u2019s current health-care reform. \u201cIf this is a baseball game, we are in the third innings of cost containment,\u201d said Jeff Rhodes, a principal at the megafirm.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-22T19:33:43-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2013/11/22/tpg-believes-it-is-still-early-days-in-health-care-cost-containment/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-15526", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "TPG Capital believes there are still many opportunities to be had with the cost-saving goal of the nation\u2019s current health-care reform. \u201cIf this is a baseball game, we are in the third innings of cost containment,\u201d said Jeff Rhodes, a principal at the megafirm.", "title": "TPG Believes It Is Still Early Days in Health-Care Cost Containment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2013/11/22/tpg-believes-it-is-still-early-days-in-health-care-cost-containment/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-15526", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-22T19:36:36-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe198a\"", "article_summary": "TPG entered the fray with the purchase of Envision Pharmaceutical Holdings Inc., a Twinsburg, Ohio-based pharmacy benefit management company.\nTPG Capital believes there are still many opportunities to be had with the cost-saving goal of the nation\u2019s current health-care reform.\n\u201cWhile employers are shifting healthcare costs to employees, companies are still bearing a significant part of the cost and rising costs are still an issue,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf this is a baseball game, we are in the third innings of cost containment,\u201d said Jeff Rhodes, a principal at the megafirm.\nWith rising health-care spending, private equity firms have been busy scooping assets in the past year that can improve the system\u2019s efficiency and at the same time, contain costs."}
