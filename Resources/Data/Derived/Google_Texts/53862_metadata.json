We were renting our primary home, which is a small one bedroom in downtown, giving us the opportunity to live for a week in Boulder and another in a small cabin in Evergreen.\n\nIt also allowed us to travel to London and South Africa \u2014 trips we could barely afford without this opportunity.\n\nRenting our place even allowed us to overcome three months of mandatory military training by giving us enough money to find a pet-friendly hotel near my training base and supplemented the difference in income from my civilian job. AirBnB has a direct impact on enabling me to volunteer for more duty with the Air National Guard.\n\nMy wife and I have been hosts on AirBnB for almost two years now. While we were both skeptical and cautious at first, we have found the positive effects of short-term rentals to be numerous.\n\nThe HOA board in my building reworded our covenants to limit short-term rentals for periods of less than 30 days. There was very little discussion or opportunity for opposition due to the lack of a clear model for home-sharing.\n\nWhile we have ceased renting our property, we remain committed to being responsible hosts somewhere else. But we need this ordinance passed so we can have meaningful discussion on the topic with any future neighbors or HOA boards.\n\nBeyond the issue of making this legal is the importance of \u201cdoing our part\u201d for the community. Currently, STR hosts cannot pay the appropriate taxes for rentals even if they wanted to. Passing this ordinance would require hosts to pay the 10.75 percent lodgers tax.\n\nDuring our active hosting months, we had doctors, CEOs, actors, house-hunting transplants and many others stay in our home. Most of them came to Denver for important conferences at the nearby convention center and spent significant amounts during their stay at local places we recommended, such as Falling Rock Tap House and Leela\u2019s.\n\nWe built lasting relationships with many of our guests. Over time, we are more confident with the quality of guests supplied by AirBnB and the platform\u2019s positive effect on our community.\n\nMy wife and I see the passing of this ordinance as an important part to building our communities and making Denver an even better city than it is today.\n\nRobert Martin of Denver is an Airbnb host.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver should legalize short-term rentals", "title": "Denver should legalize short-term rentals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/18/denver-should-legalize-short-term-rentals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160318__DP_NGPS_Export20160320_Z00_OP20G_MARTINp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160318__DP_NGPS_Export20160320_Z00_OP20G_MARTINp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-18T11:22:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:58:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The proposed zoning ordinance to allow short-term rentals in Denver is immensely important for both owners of short-term rentals (STRs) in Denver and for their neighbors.\nThe HOA board in my building reworded our covenants to limit short-term rentals for periods of less than 30 days.\nThe proposed zoning ordinance seeks to clarify the rules for short-term rentals in order to promote their positive effects.\nWhile we were both skeptical and cautious at first, we have found the positive effects of short-term rentals to be numerous.\nBy renting our place out, my wife and I were able to log considerable travel within Colorado and around the world."}
