Today, the scandal is not a warship that isn\u2019t seaworthy, a plane that doesn\u2019t fly, or rotten food. It\u2019s a website, Healthcare.gov, that has not delivered on its mission of enabling millions of Americans to browse and enroll in health insurance plans.\n\nThe debacle is merely the most visible example of how $80 billion spent annually by the federal government on information technology falls far short of delivering the quality or service any private company would expect at a fraction of that cost.\n\nAnd while this is the first time many Americans have become aware of the issues that pervade federal IT architecture, it\u2019s hardly the first time that a federal government IT project has run far over cost and then not worked particularly well. In the wake of the botched launch, opponents of the Affordable Care Act are blaming the federal government itself, suggesting that this just simply shows the government cannot deliver on a project. But they would be wrong to do so.\n\nAt the heart of the federal IT crisis is a complex system of regulations that rewards contractors that are better at bidding on giant federal contracts than at building software. While the political figures who commission or oversee those contractors are ultimately culpable, the work itself is done by the private sector. That\u2019s not only true of civilian agencies, as the world was reminded when a private contractor for the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, leaked key documents from the government and gave then to the press.\n\nIn fact, over the past several decades, more and more core information technology functions have been delivered by private contractors, not in-house staff. While a few government executives look for different approaches, private contracting is now the norm when it comes to how government IT is proposed bought, built, and maintained.\n\nGiven how well the Obama campaign used technology to support getting the Democratic nominee for president elected, I\u2019ve seen many people wondering how his administration has so badly botched the technology behind his signature legislative achievement. To understand why this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, you have to know how different the ways campaigns and government agencies can buy and build tech are, as I said on Washington Post TV this past week, apples and oranges.\n\nThe short answer is that even presidential campaigns have a great deal of freedom to hire (and fire) who they want and take risks with adopting new technologies, from social media to data mining to mobile applications. Government agencies, by contrast, are bound both by regulations and culture. Many people I\u2019ve spoken to in Washington over the past four years, in fact, have concluded that federal government procurement \u2014 how any administration can buy and build technology \u2014- is broken. As former Presidential Innovation Fellow Clay Johnson observed this week, the Healthcare.gov fiasco \u201cis instructive in that it highlights every piece of our procurement process that\u2019s broken.\u201d\n\nCampaigns, by contrast, have much more control over how they buy tech, how they maintain tech, and how they build tech. That\u2019s not to say that all them do it well \u2014 BuzzFeed readers no doubt recall what happened to the Romney campaign and Project Orca \u2014 but it does mean that if there is great political leadership at the top of the campaign and they hire great chief technology staff who manage projects well, they have much greater flexibility to hire fire by an otherwise customized technologies the campaigns needs much more quickly.\n\nThis was abundantly true in 2008 when the Obama campaign used text messaging, email, and a website that will enable people to simply organize themselves to fundraise and sustain grassroots organizing. It was perhaps even more so in 2012 when, as Alexis Madrigal documented in The Atlantic, Harper Reed built an unprecedented technology operation that created the capacity for data mining, personalization and the creation of infrastructure for the campaign to build upon.\n\nFederal agencies and, to be fair, state and local governments, have a much more difficult time buying and using technology.
