The all-volunteer board works to advise the Camera on topics that are important to our community. We've always strived to have people with diverse political views, as well as a range of interests and experience. All care very deeply about this region and its future. We've had scientists and bankers, business owners and activists.\n\nIn addition to advising our editorial board, they write opinion pieces which run on Saturdays.\n\nSince diversity is important for the board's make up, it's critical to us to keep the group evolving. Members often recommend their own replacements. We've also had two community-wide searches. The most recent one just concluded.\n\nHere are brief biographies of the board members, with the year they joined:\n\nMara Abbott (2014) was born and raised in Boulder, graduating from Whitman College in 2008 with a degree in economics. She is currently a professional bike racer who has won both two U.S. national championship titles and two Giro Rosa stage race general classifications. In her spare time she trail runs, adventures in the Colorado mountains, is a yoga instructor and is the current chair for the City of Boulder's Environmental Advisory Board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFern O'Brien (2014) is the principal of O'Brien Law in downtown Boulder. She has lived in Boulder for 19 years and has been actively involved in the community including Downtown Boulder BID Board, Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Boulder Valley Women's Health Center and the Downtown Civic Use Pad Task Force IV.

After six years of freelancing, and becoming a dad, he enrolled in the University of Colorado law school, and graduated in 1992. His mountain bike isn't even worth stealing, and his skis are pretty old school.\n\nChuck Wibby (2014) was born in Detroit and immigrated to Colorado in the early 1970s to ski. After graduating from CU he worked two years for Conoco R&D in Oklahoma and then returned to Boulder.

Don is Senior Producer and Director of the Boulder office of Culture Foundry, a digital media company with a client list that includes Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Esalen Institute and The Kentucky Derby.

They are: Clay Evans, Anne Butterfield, Ed Byrne, Jimmy Calano, and Marc Raizman.\n\nEditor's note: George Will's column is online today, at dailycamera.com.\n\n\u2014 Erika Stutzman, for the Camera editorial board.
