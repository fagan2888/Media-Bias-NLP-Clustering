Jerry insists that only 4 to 6 percent of the population is attractive.\n\nElaine: So basically what you\u2019re saying is 95 percent of the population is undateable? Jerry: Undateable! Elaine: Then how are all these people getting together? Jerry: Alcohol.\n\nLikewise, there are crucial moments in American history Cheever attributes to our need for drink. The Mayflower landed in Cape Cod because the ship ran out of beer. The instigators of the Boston Tea Party got carried away after spending too much time at the Green Dragon tavern. Johnny Appleseed was beloved by settlers because the seeds he scattered resulted in sour apples\u2014ideal for making hard cider. A more sober officer would not have sent his beleaguered troops back into battle the way Ulysses S. Grant did at Shiloh. \u201cGrant had courage where none was called for,\u201d Cheever writes. \u201cHe had confidence in the face of what a sober man might have thought of as a defeat.\u201d On the other hand, she points out that Gen. George Custer was not a drinker.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a different take than your traditional U.S. history\u2014a perspective, she says, that has been lacking until now. Much like her late father, Cheever is a terrific writer as well as a recovering alcoholic. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a drink in more than 20 years,\u201d she maintains. But there\u2019s another pattern here. She points out that \u201call five of our twentieth-century Nobel laureates were alcoholics\u2014Sinclair Lewis, Eugene O\u2019Neill, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and John Steinbeck.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edgar Allan Poe. American writers like to drink. A lot.\n\nWhat Cheever finds remarkable is the very nation that once boasted, in 1830, of an alcohol consumption rate of 7.1 gallons per person annually could, in 1920, ban the sale of alcohol almost entirely. \u201cThe two strands of American character\u2014the drunk and the puritan, the tavern keeper and the temperance crusader\u2014weave around each other as the centuries come and go.\u201d (Incidentally, our current alcohol consumption rate is 2.3 gallons a year.) In explaining how Prohibition came to pass, the author cites four factors: \u201cthe institution of the income tax, the power of women\u2019s suffrage, and World War I, along with the anti-German sentiment and general xenophobia brought about by the war.\u201d The taxes on income were able to replace the taxes levied on alcohol.\n\nSomething else to consider is liquid courage. Aside from the lubricated Grant and other Civil War leaders, Cheever reminds us that Paul Revere stopped at Capt. Isaac Hall\u2019s tavern in Medford, where the owner \u201cprovided Revere with two draughts\u2014tall glasses\u2014of rum to fortify him for the rest of his night ride.\u201d\n\nBut sadly there are just as many examples of alcohol playing a darker role in our history. Consider the deaths of two presidents:\n\n\u201cNine of the 28 Secret Service men who were in Dallas with [President Kennedy] the day he died had been out in local clubs until the early hours of the morning\u2014in one case until five a.m.,\u201d writes Cheever. Short on sleep and fighting hangovers, were these men slow to react? Why did no one push the president to the car floor after hearing the first shot? Chief Justice Earl Warren, heading the commission to investigate the assassination, rebuked the agents: \u201cDon\u2019t you think that if a man went to bed reasonably early, and hadn\u2019t been drinking the night before, he would be a lot more alert than if he stayed up until three, four, or five o\u2019clock in the morning, going to beatnik joints and doing some drinking along the way?\u201d Beatnik joints!\n\nWhile President Lincoln sat in his booth at Ford\u2019s Theatre, his lone bodyguard, John Parker, walked across the street to the Star Saloon to have a drink. His plan was to return to his post at the show\u2019s end. What Cheever leaves out is that earlier that night, the owner of the Star Saloon poured a glass of whiskey and a chaser of water to another customer\u2014John Wilkes Booth.\n\n\u201cBooth\u2019s pale, delicate fingers squeezed the glass, raised it to his lips, and he downed the drink the way a more temperate, thirsty man might swallow the glass of water,\u201d James L. Swanson writes in Manhunt. \u201cBooth savored the warming spirits. It might be a while before he could enjoy another one.\u201d\n\nThere are times in Drinking in America where the author\u2019s politics intrude on an otherwise interesting account. In the chapter on Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Cheever notes that \u201cthe postwar years in the United States were years of grotesque panic about an imaginary enemy with the power to blow up the world\u2014the Soviet Union.\u201d Imaginary? It gets worse before it gets better. \u201cWas President George W. Bush our generation\u2019s Joe McCarthy?\u201d Cheever asks. \u201cOf course there are plenty of differences between Bush and McCarthy,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cOne was a two-term president and the other a flash-in-the-pan firebrand, but both danced with the devil of alcoholism and both contributed largely to our culture of fear.\u201d It helps to have a drink to get through this section.\n\nOne can also make the case that the role of booze is not unique to the history of the United States. Take Russia, for example. In 1606, the Polish prince Dmitriy, who claimed the czar\u2019s throne after the death of Ivan the Terrible, was eventually declared an imposter. Known as the False Dmitriy, he was executed and, according to historian Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, \u201cthe body \u2026 was exposed in Red Square and then burned, and the ashes were fired from a cannon in the direction of Poland.\u201d I don\u2019t suppose alcohol played a role in that?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Reading Susan Cheever\u2019s Drinking in America: Our Secret History reminded me of an exchange between Elaine and Jerry on Seinfeld.
