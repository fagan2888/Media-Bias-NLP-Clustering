It\u2019s been a bad week for state TV.\n\nCoincidentally, Alisyn Camerota announced today that she\u2019s leaving Fox News after 16 years, leaving a vacancy in the 1 p.m. hour. (Seriously, though, I think that\u2019s a coincidence.)\n\nAttkisson, who has been with CBS News for two decades, had grown frustrated with what she saw as the network\u2019s liberal bias, an outsized influence by the network\u2019s corporate partners and a lack of dedication to investigative reporting, several sources said. She increasingly felt like her work was no longer supported and that it was a struggle to get her packages on television. At the same time, Attkisson\u2019s own reporting on the Obama administration, which some staffers characterized as agenda-driven, had led network executives to doubt the impartiality of her reporting. She iscurrently at work on a book \u2014 tentatively titled \u201cStonewalled: One Reporter\u2019s Fight for Truth in Obama\u2019s Washington\u201d \u2014 which addresses the challenges of reporting critically on the Obama administration\u2026 But Attkisson had become a polarizing figure at the network, sources there said. While some championed her relentless dedication to investigations \u2014 ranging from defective Firestone Tires to the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal \u2014 others saw evidence of a political agenda, particularly against President Obama. (The bulk of Attkisson\u2019s work since 2009 has focused on the failures or perceived failures of the Obama administration, including the administration\u2019s failed green energy investments and the attack in Benghazi, though she has reported on several Republican failures as well.)\n\nFast & Furious, Benghazi, Solyndra, the ObamaCare rollout \u2014 she\u2019s spent the last five years digging into all of them. In a different world, she would have been promoted to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d; as it is, per Politico, she spent months negotiating an early end to her contract with CBS. The bit above about her being frustrated with liberal bias rings true, too. She\u2019s been complaining about that, albeit in more oblique terms, for a long time now.\n\nWith the possible exception of Tapper, she\u2019s the most respected major-network reporter working today among conservatives. It\u2019s a fait accompli that her book will make a splash on the right. What then? Fox is the obvious choice, but if CNN decides to double down on hard news, maybe they\u2019ll go after her. They\u2019re planning to fill Piers Morgan\u2019s 9 p.m. time slot at the end of the month with a rotating group of interim hosts, Tapper included. If a newsier hour is well received, maybe they\u2019ll bring in more reporters like Attkisson \u2014 although Anderson Cooper\u2019s show is already sorta hard news and he hasn\u2019t ousted O\u2019Reilly at 8. Maybe it\u2019s time to be truly bold: \u201cSensible Reasonableness\u201d at 9 p.m. with your co-hosts David Frum and Michael Smerconish. Take that, Megyn and Rachel.\n\nBy the way, did we ever find out who was behind that suspicious activity with her home computers? Attkisson had a suspicion about it last summer, but unless I missed something, that\u2019s the last we heard.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cShe increasingly felt like her work was no longer supported\u2026\u201d", "title": "Sharyl Attkisson resigns from CBS, partly due to \u201cliberal bias\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/10/sharyl-attkisson-resigns-from-cbs-partly-due-to-liberal-bias/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "bias, CBS, computer, hack, network, resign, Sharyl Attkisson,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-10T19:21:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T19:18:58+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd5e\"", "article_summary": "Sharyl Attkisson resigns from CBS, partly due to \u201cliberal bias\u201dposted at 3:21 pm on March 10, 2014 by AllahpunditFirst Liz Wahl quits RT over Crimea, now this.\nAt the same time, Attkisson\u2019s own reporting on the Obama administration, which some staffers characterized as agenda-driven, had led network executives to doubt the impartiality of her reporting.\nAttkisson had a suspicion about it last summer, but unless I missed something, that\u2019s the last we heard.\nCoincidentally, Alisyn Camerota announced today that she\u2019s leaving Fox News after 16 years, leaving a vacancy in the 1 p.m. hour.\nThe bit above about her being frustrated with liberal bias rings true, too."}
