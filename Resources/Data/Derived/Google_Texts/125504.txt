There is new chapter in Wichita's saga of increased armed robberies at local businesses. The latest incident involves a trio of teenagers using handguns to separate a store clerk and three customers from their money.

At about 1 a.m. Saturday, police were called to the Valero store near I-135 and E 21st Street.

Upon arrival the 36-year-old man working the register told officers three teenagers entered the store brandishing handguns. They demanded cash from the store and three customers, who were also inside the store.

The employee suffered minor undisclosed injuries and the crooks took money from the register and the three customers before running off behind the building.

Officers checked the area, but were unable to locate the robbers.

The suspects are described as mid to late teens, all wearing dark clothing.
