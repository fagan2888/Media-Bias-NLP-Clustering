Her life was saved but she's taken a massive hit to the wallet because of the hospital where paramedics chose to take her\n\nRothbauer was taken to St. Mary's, the closest hospital to where her heart stopped at Weir Minerals, where she works. That proximity, versus the Meriter Hospital 4/10 of a mile away, cost her $50,000--and it could have been even more\n\nWHAT IS BALANCE BILLING? When a provider bills you for the difference between the provider\u2019s charge and the allowed amount. For example, if the provider\u2019s charge is $100 and the allowed amount is $70, the provider may bill you for the remaining $30. A preferred provider may not balance bill you for covered services. Balance billing is expressly permitted under the Affordable Care Act. Source: Healthcare.gov\n\nWhat seems most pointedly absurd to Rothbauer, a project manager, is that she wasn't even able to stop the ambulance drivers as they rushed her to St. Mary's instead of her in-network Meriter Hospital up the road.\n\nFour tenths of a mile up the road, exactly, where her maximum co-pay would have been $1,500.\n\n'I was in a coma. I couldn't very well wake up and say, \"Hey, take me to the next hospital.\" It was the closet hospital to where I had my event, so naturally the ambulance took me there. No fault to them,' the now 30-year-old told WISCTV.\n\nBut this is not to say that Blue Cross-Blue Shield paid nothing toward Rothbauer's care.\n\nThe company says it paid its maximum for in-network care--$156,000 of the original $254,000 charged by St. Mary's.\n\nIt's called balance billing and its 100 percent legal, even specifically allowed under the Obamacare.\n\nThat left $98,000, which Rothbauer successfully negotiated down to $9,800. However, as WISCTV points out, that doesn't cover bills from specific doctors, for the ambulance, the therapist, etc.\n\nNow the fully-insured professional is stuck with a $50,000 bill because of some bad timing and a few blocks.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield says they've done their part by covering the maximum they'd cover for anyone and pointed to the prices at St. Mary's.\n\nSt. Mary's says they've knocked off such a large amount from Rothbauer's bill that they don't plan to negotiate further.\n\n'It's unfortunate that Meriter is in network and was only three blocks away from St. Mary's,' said Rothbauer, who is now desperately researching ways she might stave off bankruptcy and live the life she sees friends her age leading instead of grappling to get out of medical debt.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Fully,insured,woman,facing,bankruptcy,taken,hospital,didn,t,policy,cardiac,arrest", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2831969/Fully-insured-woman-facing-bankruptcy-taken-hospital-didn-t-policy-cardiac-arrest.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Megan Rothbauer's heart stopped at work in September 2013 and she was taken to the nearest emergency room -- Madison's St. Mary's Hospital.", "title": "Insured woman might go bankrupt because she went to wrong hospital", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2831969/Fully-insured-woman-facing-bankruptcy-taken-hospital-didn-t-policy-cardiac-arrest.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/12/1415824936526_wps_18_Fully_insured_woman_facin.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2831969/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2831969/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2831969, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Fully,insured,woman,facing,bankruptcy,taken,hospital,didn,t,policy,cardiac,arrest", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-11-12T18:48:44.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Josh+Gardner+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-11-12T21:19:13.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Fully insured woman facing bankruptcy taken hospital didn t policy cardiac arrest"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Megan Rothbauer's heart stopped at work in September 2013 and she was taken to the nearest emergency room -- Madison's St. Mary's Hospital.", "title": "Insured woman might go bankrupt because she went to wrong hospital", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2831969/Fully-insured-woman-facing-bankruptcy-taken-hospital-didn-t-policy-cardiac-arrest.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/11/12/1415824936526_wps_18_Fully_insured_woman_facin.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2014/11/12/1418450360_3888460821001_Medic.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Megan Rothbauer's heart stopped at work in September 2013 and she was taken to the nearest emergency room -- Madison's St. Mary's Hospital."}, "article_summary": "The company says it paid its maximum for in-network care--$156,000 of the original $254,000 charged by St. Mary's.\nThat proximity, versus the Meriter Hospital 4/10 of a mile away, cost her $50,000--and it could have been even moreWHAT IS BALANCE BILLING?\nSt. Mary's says they've knocked off such a large amount from Rothbauer's bill that they don't plan to negotiate further.\nThough Madison's St. Mary's Hospital was just three blocks away from where Megan Rothbauer was in September 2013 when she had a heart attack at just 29, it's not part of her Blue Cross-Blue Shield network.\nHer life was saved but she's taken a massive hit to the wallet because of the hospital where paramedics chose to take herRothbauer was taken to St. Mary's, the closest hospital to where her heart stopped at Weir Minerals, where she works."}
