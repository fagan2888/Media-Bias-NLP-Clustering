Slightly more than half reported downing more than the two-drink maximum recommended by scientists, with four in 10 reporting consumption of 10 or more alcoholic drinks per week in the leadup to conception.\n\nOverall, alcohol consumption fell after the first trimester, as women grew into their pregnancies. Women in the study began their first trimesters drinking 11 standard units of alcohol per week, which fell to four drinks and then just under two during the second and third trimesters, respectively.\n\nNot surprisingly, older educated white women with higher socioeconomic status drank the most, supporting previous study showing a greater propensity for drink among the more affluent. Of babies born to the women in the study, 13 percent were underweight while 4.4 percent were a bit on the small side. Four-point-three percent were born prematurely. All of those adverse outcomes were strongly linked to alcohol consumption among the pregnant mothers.\n\nConversely, Yvonne and her colleagues found no behavioral or cognitive problems among 5-year-olds born to mothers in the cohort study, but did find a higher incidence among even mothers who\u2019d drank lightly, adhering to the government\u2019s two-drink per week maximum. Early in pregnancy, even small doses of alcohol increase the risk for premature birth and other complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says such birth complications are completely preventable: if a woman abstains from alcohol during pregnancy.\n\nSource: Kelly, YJ, Sacker A, Gray R, et al.
