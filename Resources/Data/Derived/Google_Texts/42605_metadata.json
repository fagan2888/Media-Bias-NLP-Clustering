Seeking attention, Rader sent a letter to the Eagle, taking responsibility for an unsolved 1986 murder. Over the next year, he continued to send letters, puzzles, and other miscellany to local media outlets . Landwehr led the strategy of \"exchanging coded messages placed in newspaper ads\" to elicit more clues out of Rader.\n\nThe murders began in 1974, when the BTK killer, Dennis Rader, brutally tortured and killed four members of the Otero family . Over the next two decades he killed six more. Following the murder of Dolores Davis in 1991, Rader seemed to disappear. The case was cold.\n\nThe New York Times reports today on the passing of Ken Landwehr , the Wichita homicide detective responsible for solving the case of the BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) murders that had plagued the Wichita area for decades. He was 59.\n\nLandwehr's big break came in early 2005 when Rader sent a message to a Wichita TV station inquiring about a package he claimed to have left at a Home Depot. An employee there told police that his girlfriend had found an odd package\u2014a cereal box\u2014in the back of his truck, but, not knowing what it was, they had thrown it away.\n\nPolice were able to find the box in the trash. Inside were documents describing planned murders. There was also one document with a question: Would it be secure for the murderer to communicate with police via a floppy disk? \"Be honest,\" the note urged. It instructed police to place a classified ad in the paper with the message, \"Rex, it will be OK,\" if it were, in fact, safe.\n\nhttp://dennisraderbtk.blogspot.com/\n\nInvestigators, recognizing the opportunity, ran the requested ad. Two weeks later, on February 16, 2005, a package containing a floppy disk arrived at KSAS-TV in Wichita.\n\nDetectives got to work:\n\nThe disk contained one valid file bearing the message \u201cthis is a test\u201d and directing police to read one of the accompanying index cards with instructions for further communications. In the \u201cproperties\u201d section of the document, however, police found that the file had last been saved by someone named Dennis. They also found that the disk had been used at the Christ Lutheran Church and the Park City library. Landwehr says Rader had taken pains to delete any identifying information from the disk. But he made the fatal mistake of taking the disk to his church to print out the file because the printer for his home computer wasn\u2019t working. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty basic stuff,\u201d Landwehr says about the reconstruction of the deleted information. \u201cAnybody who knows anything about computers could figure it out.\u201d A simple Internet search turned up a Web site for the church, which identified Dennis Rader as president of the congregation.\n\nThey finally had their suspect.\n\nFrom there, police were able to confirm that Dennis Rader was in fact the BTK killer by DNA testing.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, police arrested Rader.\n\nThe New York Times credits Landwehr with the skill and strategy that eventually undid the case:\n\nIt was Lieutenant Landwehr, news reports said, who originated the strategy of playing on the killer\u2019s demonstrated narcissism, prodding B.T.K. in public statements about the case to communicate ever more frequently with the police. It was he who made sure that the small amount of DNA evidence gathered at the Otero crime scene was saved until it was sure to be useful. And after the disk and other evidence pointed to Mr. Rader, it was he who arranged to test the DNA of a relative of Mr. Rader\u2019s to compare with the Otero sample.\n\nDuring interrogations, Rader \"couldn\u2019t get over the fact\" that Landwehr had lied to him. He had trusted Landwehr.\n\n\u201cI need to ask you, how come you lied to me? How come you lied to me?\u201d Rader asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I was trying to catch you,\u201d Landwehr answered coolly.\n\nIn the end, Rader's misplaced trust in Landwehr led to his downfall.\n\n\n\nBut Rader, for his part, blamed the disk: \"The floppy did me in.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The story of how police used a floppy disk to catch the BTK killer.", "author": "Rebecca J.
