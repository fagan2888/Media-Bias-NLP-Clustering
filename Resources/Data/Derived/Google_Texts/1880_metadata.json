Submission deadline is Jan. 9.\n\nThe three winners will be announced Jan. 16.\n\nWard said the hearing aid has really changed her life, both for her and her husband.\n\n\u201cWe would have to have the TV up on 45 and now I can hear it on 10,\u201d she said.\n\nJill Clark, Waco ENT practice administrator, said winners will be selected based on their respective story, degree of need and level of hearing loss.\n\nShe said all the doctors read the submissions and the clinic\u2019s staff comes together to help choose the winners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one person to say there\u2019s nothing free in this world, but this one\u2019s free,\u201d Clark said.\n\nClark said Medicare does not cover the cost of hearing aids and many insurance policies only cover a portion of the cost.\n\n\u201cMore often than not, the patient is responsible for some of the cost and it\u2019s expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more insurances do accept the coverage.\u201d\n\nClark said the clinic has seen patients specifically purchase the Affordable Care Act because of the benefits for the devices.\n\nWaco ENT and Baylor Scott & White have four doctors who hold a monthly free clinic at the Family Health Center for people who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nClark said Waco ENT also has opened a second location at Baylor Scott & White Hillcrest Medical Center after taking over the audiology needs for Hillcrest.\n\nThe hearing aids often give people more than just improved hearing.\n\nUntreated hearing loss can create higher incidents of depression, increased social isolation, accentuation of dementia and dementia-type diseases, Clark said.\n\nIndividuals who can\u2019t hear well are 37 percent more likely to suffer an on-the-job injury, she said.\n\n\u201cI think the tendency is to think it\u2019s older folks who struggle with this, but especially with headphones and Walkmans, we\u2019re seeing a definite decrease in age of those needing hearing aids,\u201d she said.\n\nClark said it\u2019s amazing to watch a person\u2019s life change after they have purchased a hearing aid.\n\n\u201cWe see family members come in and hug us and are so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really does make a difference when you don\u2019t realize you can\u2019t hear a bird chirping.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nAt a glance\n\nSubmissions can be emailed to gift@wacoent.com, mailed to or dropped off at 601 West State Highway 6, Suite 106, Waco, 76710.\n\nLetters of no more than 300 words must explain why a certain person should receive hearing aids.
