Democrats out in the states began to lose election after election. It has gotten so bad that Democrat stalwart Dona Brazile recently complained that she and her party \u201chave absolutely been devastated.\u201d\n\nPolitico\u2019s Jeff Grenfield agreed, saying, \u201cno president in modern times has presided over so disastrous a stretch for his party, at almost every level of politics.\u201d\n\nNow, a new piece in the Washington Post found that Democrats have \u201ctaken a drubbing\u201d in the states.\n\nThe Post piece found that \u201cthe ratio of Republicans to Democrats has tilted to the right in nearly every Senate and nearly every legislature\u201d since Obama was elected to the White House.\n\n\u201cAccording to the NCSL data,\u201d the Post article notes, \u201cthere were 4,082 Democrats in state senates and state houses in 2009. In 2015, there were 3,163\u2013a decrease of 22.5 percent.\u201d\n\nThis massive loss, the article notes, is another reason the Democrat\u2019s bench is so weak all over the country.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2008, Barack Obama rode into the White House on a wave of Democrat votes, in what many believed to be a permanent Democrat majority.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In 2008, Barack Obama rode into the White House on a wave of Democrat votes, in what many believed to be a permanent Democrat majority.", "title": "Since Obama Took Office Democrats Have Been Decimated All Across The Country", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/obama-upset-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/26/since-obama-took-office-dems-have-been-decimated-all-across-the-country/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 2008, Barack Obama rode into the White House on a wave of Democrat votes, in what many believed to be a permanent Democrat majority.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/obama-upset-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Since Obama Took Office Democrats Have Been Decimated All Across The Country", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "democrats,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Obama,democrat", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "democrats", "published_time": "2015-08-26T21:47:21-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd658\"", "article_summary": "But instead of permanent superiority, the Democrat Party has been decimated all across the country with 85 of 98 state legislatures becoming more Republican since 2010.\n\u201cAccording to the NCSL data,\u201d the Post article notes, \u201cthere were 4,082 Democrats in state senates and state houses in 2009.\nThe Post piece found that \u201cthe ratio of Republicans to Democrats has tilted to the right in nearly every Senate and nearly every legislature\u201d since Obama was elected to the White House.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn 2008, Barack Obama rode into the White House on a wave of Democrat votes, in what many at the time believed to be a permanent Democrat majority.\nIn 2015, there were 3,163\u2013a decrease of 22.5 percent.\u201dThis massive loss, the article notes, is another reason the Democrat\u2019s bench is so weak all over the country."}
