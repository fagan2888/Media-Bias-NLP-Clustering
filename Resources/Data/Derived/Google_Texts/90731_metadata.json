Integrity Data\u2019s fun example of how \u2018Claus Resources Inc.\u2019 will be affected by the Affordable Care Act couldn\u2019t come at a better time. All businesses need to take the ACA seriously and find out what they need to do to comply with reporting guidelines.\n\nTo get U.S. employers tuned in to compliance requirements for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Integrity Data, a payroll and human resources software company, has released a series of videos and blog posts that channel Santa.\n\nIn a new package on the company website titled \u201cACA for Santa,\u201d Integrity Data, a developer of business software for IRS reporting required by the health care law, tells the ACA compliance story for employers through what they call \u201cClaus Resources Inc.,\u201d the U.S. operations of Santa and Mrs. Claus.\n\n\u201cWhimsical, yes,\u201d says Patrick Doolin, CEO of Integrity Data, \u201cbut with the clock ticking toward the first filing season for new returns from employers \u2013 and with so much unawareness out there about the risk of steep penalties, we need to make the message as engaging and relatable as possible.\u201d\n\nDoolin is referring to new forms, called 1095-Cs, that certain employees must have in their hands by February 1, 2016 \u2013 the same date that W-2s are due. These forms supplement W-2 forms by breaking down details about what, if any, coverage is offered at a place of employment. When employees go to fill out Line 61 of their individual tax returns, the information on 1095-C forms will be needed.\n\n\u201cMany employers who must produce these forms and then file copies with the IRS, still do not know their first deadline is February 1. Nor what exactly they need to do for it,\u201d Doolin said. \u201cFrom our work with business owners, we find that many exposed to ACA penalties do not see themselves as businesses large enough to need to be in compliance.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the range of points that owners of small and medium-sized businesses must pay attention to, Integrity Data presents workforce data for the following fictitious companies \u2013 separately and together:\n\n\n\nShiny Nose Brigade\n\nN Squared Solutions\n\nRent a Righteous Santa\n\n\u2018No Coal for You\u2019 Studio\n\n\u201cIntegrity Data\u2019s fun example of how \u2018Claus Resources Inc.\u2019 will be affected by the Affordable Care Act couldn\u2019t come at a better time. All businesses need to take the ACA seriously and find out what they need to do to comply with reporting guidelines,\u201d says Sabrina Zimara, Marketing Coordinator for DFC Consultants, a Fargo, N.D.-based reseller of Integrity Data\u2019s ACA software and the first Integrity Data affiliate to share posts about the Santa promotion on social media.\n\nPosts about what Santa and employers like him need to know about ACA compliance \u2013 and act on quickly \u2013 are being shared by Integrity Data on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook and Tumblr.\n\nIntegrity Data\u2019s two educational videos and four related blog posts about ACA compliance must-knows for Claus Resources can be found on the company\u2019s ACA for Santa page.\n\nAbout Integrity Data\n\nIntegrity Data is a longstanding leader in development of software that improves business processes centered on payroll and human resources data.
