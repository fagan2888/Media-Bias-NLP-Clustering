The 41-year-old was shot and killed at his home in July.\n\nA memorial was held Tuesday at the FSU law school as students are still healing from the loss.\n\nPolice said they haven't had much to go on since the father of two's death. Reggie Garcia was a friend and colleague who lives in the same neighborhood as Markel.\n\nIn an effort to make a breakthrough in the case, the reward for information has gone up to $25,000.\n\nThe Tallahassee Police Department released a grainy vehicle of interest photo of a Toyota Prius-type car shortly after the professor's death, but there hasn't been any new information on that since.\n\nGarrick Pursley's office at the law school was right down the hall from Markel's. He said it's tough to be teaching without his friend.\n\n\"I don't know that these kinds of wounds ever heal 100 percent. He was a towering figure,\" Pursley said.\n\nMarkel's ex-wife has stressed a request for privacy during the still-developing case.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
