Ted Cruz said today during an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace at the Washington Ideas Forum.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re in a lot of trouble,\u201d Cruz said about Democrats. Cruz cited Bill Clinton\u2019s call to Obama to make sure Americans are able to keep health insurance plans under the ACA. \u201cBill Clinton has extraordinary political instincts. It\u2019s a little bit like the canary in the coalmine.\u201d\n\nCruz said other Democrats will take cues from the former president.\n\nCruz said Republicans have alternatives in the works. He compared Obamacare\u2019s insurance standards, which many current policies don\u2019t meet, to requiring all drivers to buy a Ferrari. He said Congress should scrap the law, which he said has cost five million people their health insurance policies.\n\nCruz once again placed blame on the White House and Democrats for the government shutdown in October that resulted from the fight over the healthcare law.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want the shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cRepeatedly, I voted to keep the government open.\u201d\n\nTo Cruz\u2019s consternation, the assertion drew laughs from the crowd. The forum is a partnership between The Atlantic, the Aspen Institute, and the Newseum, where the two-day event drew newsmakers from both parties.\n\nCruz also shrugged off questions about a 2016 presidential bid and criticism over his role in the shutdown.\n\nMany, including fellow Republicans, have criticized the tactics he used in his fight against the health care law, which culminated in a 21-hour filibuster and played a central role in the government shutdown.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has consistently criticized Cruz over his role in the shutdown, displayed some of that ire in an appearance just before Cruz\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhere I disagreed with Sen. Cruz was with shutting down the government,\u201d McCain said. \u201cIt hurt my people. When we have to fly food from food banks to people in Tucson because they\u2019re on minimum wage and they\u2019re hungry, I have to say \u2018stop, you\u2019re crazy.\u2019 There was no chance of success, and anyone who thinks there is is very naive about the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a Republican in Washington attacks Republicans from the left, that\u2019s a very popular thing in Washington.\u201d Cruz said, jabbing back during his interview. He said he\u2019s more concerned with representing Texas than engaging in politics.\n\nWallace asked Cruz if alienating those in his own party over his tactics was worth it.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Cruz said. He would not rule out a similar strategy in the future as he continues to fight Obamacare. Another possibility for shutdown comes in January, when the temporary continuing resolution currently funding the government expires.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be plenty of time to focus on the particular tactics,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz denied his fight against Obamacare is part of a bid for presidency.\n\n\u201cFor someone who\u2019s focused on the Senate, you\u2019re spending a lot of time in Iowa,\u201d Wallace noted.\n\nCruz said he\u2019s traveling across the country in his quest to defeat Obamacare, not to campaign for office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much working to keep my focus on the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur country is working very hard to turn things around. It\u2019s my hope that we see a thousand flowers bloom,\u201d Cruz said, indicating his hopes that the grassroots movement that swept him into office continues to gain steam and generate candidates.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS90ZWQtY3J1ei1nb3AtaXJlLXdvcnRoLWl0LW5vdy10aGF0LWRlbXMtanVtcC1zaGlwLW9uLW9iYW1hY2FyZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Nick Swartsell", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0 Even many Democrats are stepping back from Obamacare, Sen.
