The hackers exploited a flaw in Adobe Systems Inc\u2019s software to launch a rash of electronic break-ins that began last December, then left \u201cback doors\u201d to return to many of the machines as recently as last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a memo seen by Reuters. The memo, distributed on Thursday, described the attacks as \u201ca widespread problem that should be addressed.\u201d It said the breach affected the U.S. Army, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, and perhaps many more agencies.\n\nThe personal information of over 100,000 employees, family members and others associated with the Department of Energy was amongst the stolen data, according to the Reuters report.\n\nAccording to officials, the hacking is linked to another case, in which a UK man was charged in connection with hacking into multiple US government computer systems, causing personal data of US military personnel to be compromised and millions of dollars in losses. Lauri Love is alleged to have infiltrated computer systems at the Department of Energy, Army, and the Department of Health and Human Services, among others.\n\nThe FBI wrote, \u201cIt is unknown exactly how many systems have been compromised, but it is a widespread problem that should be addressed,\u201d Reuters reported. The memo advised system administrators on steps to take to determine whether or not their systems have been compromised.\n\nRead the full report from Reuters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a memo it distributed this week, the FBI warned a breach of US government systems was \"a widespread problem that should be addressed,\" according to a report.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "description": "In a memo it distributed this week, the FBI warned that a breach of US government systems was \"a widespread problem that should be addressed,\" according to a Reuters report.\r\nActivist hackers linked to the collective known as Anonymous have secretly accessed U.S. government computers in mu", "title": "Report: FBI warns of US govt breaches linked to Anonymous hackers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hacker.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-16T13:24:44+00:00", "url": "http://legalinsurrection.com/2013/11/report-fbi-warns-of-us-govt-breaches-linked-to-anonymous-hackers/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2013-11-16T13:24:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-16T13:24:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "f_SDILa9XMa3xcLX9n6eq0yDinw8hWKIjXr-0IOcgIE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The FBI wrote, \u201cIt is unknown exactly how many systems have been compromised, but it is a widespread problem that should be addressed,\u201d Reuters reported.\nIn a memo it distributed this week, the FBI warned that a breach of US government systems was \u201ca widespread problem that should be addressed,\u201d according to a Reuters report.\nLauri Love is alleged to have infiltrated computer systems at the Department of Energy, Army, and the Department of Health and Human Services, among others.\nActivist hackers linked to the collective known as Anonymous have secretly accessed U.S. government computers in multiple agencies and stolen sensitive information in a campaign that began almost a year ago, the FBI warned this week.\nThe memo advised system administrators on steps to take to determine whether or not their systems have been compromised."}
