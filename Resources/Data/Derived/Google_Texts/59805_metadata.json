What could be better than freeing the U.S. from dependence on unstable or predatory regimes with vast energy reserves?\n\nThere\u2019s one major flaw in the argument, though. While natural gas does indeed have a domestic market that is largely untethered to gas markets in, say, Europe or East Asia, the same is not true of oil. The world market for oil is highly intertwined, especially for refined products. U.S. consumers would suffer a price shock at the pump in the event of a major disruption in supplies almost anywhere \u2014 say, a major Middle East oil field falls prey to a terrorist attack \u2014 even if the U.S. produced enough for its own consumption.\n\nAnd yet the U.S. continues to impose a ban on oil exports that was enacted in the 1970s in the wake of the Arab oil embargo. For years the ban was relatively harmless, but today it inhibits domestic production and should be lifted.\n\nSoaring U.S. production \u2014 from 5.5 million barrels of crude per day five years ago to 9.2 million today \u2014 is one of the major reasons the world price of oil fell so dramatically last year. But U.S. producers could have an even larger impact on world supplies and thus prices if they could directly export oil rather having to refine it here first \u2014 particularly because many refineries were set up to handle heavier crude imported from abroad.\n\nThe Brookings Institution is one of several policy organizations to conclude the export ban is outdated. Charles Ebinger and Heather Greenley of Brookings summed up their findings last year. \u201cThe report\u2019s analysis shows categorically that the crude oil export ban does not, and for some time has not, advanced U.S. energy security,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTo the contrary, our analysis demonstrates that lifting the ban will increase U.S. oil production, diversify global supply, reduce U.S. gasoline prices and provide net benefits to the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nThe president has the power to lift the ban on his own. Congress could do it, too. If they did, they\u2019d be creating jobs and aiding consumers with a single stroke.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ban on oil exports should be lifted", "title": "Ban on oil exports should be lifted", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/12/ban-on-oil-exports-should-be-lifted/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150410__20150413_Z00_OP13E_OILp1.jpg", "height": 523}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150410__20150413_Z00_OP13E_OILp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T19:12:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T09:31:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe report\u2019s analysis shows categorically that the crude oil export ban does not, and for some time has not, advanced U.S. energy security,\u201d they wrote.\nThe Brookings Institution is one of several policy organizations to conclude the export ban is outdated.\nAnd yet the U.S. continues to impose a ban on oil exports that was enacted in the 1970s in the wake of the Arab oil embargo.\nFor years the ban was relatively harmless, but today it inhibits domestic production and should be lifted.\n\u201cTo the contrary, our analysis demonstrates that lifting the ban will increase U.S. oil production, diversify global supply, reduce U.S. gasoline prices and provide net benefits to the U.S. economy.\u201dThe president has the power to lift the ban on his own."}
