Unlike traditional political action committees (PACs), c4 organizations aren\u2019t required to disclose their donors. As a result, these organizations have become increasingly popular among wealthy donors who want to keep their influence out of public view. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, these groups spent about $300 million during the 2012 election, about 85 percent of it on the conservative side.\n\nSocial welfare organizations are allowed to influence elections to a degree, but can\u2019t make electoral politics their \u201cprimary focus.\u201d The problem is that standard hasn\u2019t been well defined.\n\nThat lack of clarity was at the heart of the IRS\u2019s Cincinnati field office using \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d to examine these groups\u2019 applications for tax-exempt status. In its report on the \u201cscandal,\u201d the IRS Inspector General\u2019s office wrote, \u201cWe also believe that Determinations Unit specialists lacked knowledge of what activities are allowed by\u201d the tax code.\n\nRichard Rubin reported this week for Bloomberg that the rules under consideration \u201cwould give some of the biggest players from the 2012 campaign, including Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, greater certainty to run ads in ways that don\u2019t risk their tax-exempt status going forward.\u201d\n\nThey could run issue-based ads that mention candidates\u2019 names months before an election, and then switch to a direct pitch closer to the vote. \u201cIf I were sitting in the chair of a conservative political operative, I would be rubbing my palms together hoping that these (c)(4) rules would be adopted,\u201d said Greg Colvin, an attorney at Adler & Colvin in San Francisco who specializes in the political activity of nonprofit groups.\n\nBut while deep-pocketed dark money groups on the right should be happy with the proposed rules, that isn\u2019t the case. Rubin writes that the \u201cprospect of benefits for big-money political nonprofit groups \u2014 which are mostly Republican-leaning \u2014 runs counter to the message from Republican lawmakers, who call the IRS rules a political maneuver by the Obama administration to restrict groups favoring smaller government.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because despite the fact that the Inspector General found that the extra scrutiny given to 501(c)4s was a result of incompetence rather than politics \u2014 and that there was no outside pressure from Washington on the field agents \u2014 it\u2019s become an article of faith among conservatives that the IRS tried to suppress groups opposed to Obama\u2019s re-election. Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto went so far as to suggest that it swung the election in Obama\u2019s favor \u2014 he called Obama \u201cPresident Asterisk.\u201d And that narrative survived even after the AP obtained internal IRS documents showing that \u201cterms including \u2018Israel,\u2019 \u2018Progressive\u2019 and \u2018Occupy\u2019 were used by agency workers to help pick groups for closer examination\u201d \u2014 in other words, that conservative groups weren\u2019t the only ones targeted for extra scrutiny.\n\nNonetheless, reports Rubin, \u201cthe IRS has received more than 38,000 comments on the rules, most in opposition. Some commenters have accused the tax agency of shredding the Constitution and others compared the limits to speech restrictions in China.\u201d (Update: There are now over 64,500 comments.)\n\nYou can add your own voice to the mix with a comment here. In December, Sheila Krumholtz, director of the Center for Responsive Politics, told BillMoyers.com, \u201cAt a minimum, their stated goal is to achieve clearer guidelines about political activity by nonprofits. That is plainly necessary.\u201d\n\nWhile that\u2019s true, this may be a case of fighting the last war. As Justices O\u2019Connor and Stevens wrote in a landmark campaign finance case, \u201cmoney, like water, will always find an outlet.\u201d And it\u2019s possible that the next outlet will be 501(c)6 organizations \u2014 ostensibly trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce. Last September, almost a year after the 2012 election had drawn to a close, Politico revealed that a massive and previously unknown pile of dark money had been spent by the Koch brothers-linked Freedom Partners, which had been organized as a c6.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While deep-pocketed dark money groups on the right should be happy with the proposed rules, that isn't the case.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "While deep-pocketed dark money groups on the right should be happy with the proposed rules, that isn't the case.", "title": "Dark Money Groups to Get Clarity From the IRS; Outrage Ensues | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IRS-BUILDING.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-07-31T17:22:27-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/dark-money-groups-to-get-clarity-from-the-irs-outrage-ensues/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While deep-pocketed dark money groups on the right should be happy with the proposed rules, that isn't the case.", "creator": "@JoshuaHol", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IRS-BUILDING.jpg", "title": "Dark Money Groups to Get Clarity From the IRS; Outrage Ensues | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-02-21T14:09:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-31T17:22:27-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140221, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But while deep-pocketed dark money groups on the right should be happy with the proposed rules, that isn\u2019t the case.\nThe IRS is considering new rules that would clarify what political activities 501(c)4 \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization can participate in.\nNonetheless, reports Rubin, \u201cthe IRS has received more than 38,000 comments on the rules, most in opposition.\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, these groups spent about $300 million during the 2012 election, about 85 percent of it on the conservative side.\nThat lack of clarity was at the heart of the IRS\u2019s Cincinnati field office using \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d to examine these groups\u2019 applications for tax-exempt status."}
