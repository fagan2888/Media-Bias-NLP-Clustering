Call has been made for Union Minister of State for HRD Shashi Tharoor to be removed from the Cabinet till the probe into his wife Sunanda Pushkar's suspicious death gets over.

Sunanda Pushkar died on Friday after a row erupted over 'affair' between her husband Shashi Tharoor and Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar.

The first reports of the demand emanate from TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu.

In a statement issued here today, Chandrababu wanted the police to book a case against Shashi Tharoor under the Domestic Violence (Prevention) Act alleging the latter was responsible for Sunanda's death.

"An impartial probe should be conducted into her death without scope for any political interference," the former Chief Minister added.

Chandrababu condoled Sunanda Pushkar's death.
