Meanwhile, the dollar traded at 56.40 rubles, an all-time high.\n\nThe buck traded at USDNOK, -0.0375% 7.32 krone, and USDCAD, +0.1387% 1.155 Canadian dollars, its highest level since July 2009, compared with 7.13 krone and 1.140 Canadian dollars Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBoris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset management, said the intensity of the decline in oil prices is beginning to take its toll on the economies of major oil producers other than Russia as investors adjust their positions to reflect the possibility that the price of oil will remain lower for longer.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we couldn\u2019t even hold the $60 a barrel level suggests that the oil market is just going to free fall right now,\u201d Schlossberg said. \u201cIf we\u2019re in a $60 to $70 market for the next year, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see the severe negative impact for those economies.\u201d\n\nThe Norges Bank\u2019s surprise decision to lower its benchmark interest rate to 1.25% from 1.5% also weighed on the krone. The Norwegian central bank cut its rate in an effort to protect the economy from falling oil prices, according to Jameel Ahmad, chief market analyst at ForexTime.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Russian Central Bank raised its benchmark rate from 9.5% to 10.5% in an effort to prevent the ruble from weakening further.\n\nStrong November retail sales figures pushed the dollar higher against its G-4 rivals, helping it snap a three-day losing streak. The euro EURUSD, -0.0357% traded slightly below $1.24, compared with $1.245 Wednesday.\n\nThe buck traded at 118.90 yen USDJPY, +0.09% compared with \u00a5117.57 Wednesday. It traded flat against the pound GBPUSD, -0.0136% at $1.57.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.06% a trade-weighted measure of the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of six rival currencies, rose 0.38% to 88.60.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-author": "Joseph Adinolfi", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The dollar extends its gains against the ruble, krone and Canadian dollar Thursday as crude oil prices fall below $60 a barrel, a sign that the contagion that afflicts the ruble for the past two weeks is spreading to the currencies of other major oil exporters.", "creator": "@jsadinolfi", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB303_Elvira_ZG_20141211123051.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/central-bank-of-russias-rate-hike-fails-to-support-ruble-2014-12-11", "author": "Joseph Adinolfi", "parsely-title": "Dollar surges against oil-backed currencies  as crude falls below $60", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-11T16:44:00-05:00", "description": "The dollar extends its gains against the ruble, krone and Canadian dollar Thursday as crude oil prices fall below $60 a barrel, a sign that the contagion that afflicts the ruble for the past two weeks is spreading to the currencies of other major oil exporters.", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The dollar extends its gains against the ruble, krone and Canadian dollar Thursday as crude oil prices fall below $60 a barrel, a sign that the contagion that afflicts the ruble for the past two weeks is spreading to the currencies of other major oil exporters.", "title": "Dollar surges against oil-backed currencies  as crude falls below $60", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/central-bank-of-russias-rate-hike-fails-to-support-ruble-2014-12-11", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB303_Elvira_ZG_20141211123051.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB303_Elvira_ZG_20141211123051.jpg"}, "article.id": "5CF5A2B2-8146-11E4-B358-A677207BC7D7", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "The dollar hit an 11-year high against the krone and a five-and-a-half year high against the Canadian dollar Thursday afternoon as crude oil prices settled below $60 a barrel.\nMeanwhile, the dollar traded at 56.40 rubles, an all-time high.\n\u201cThe fact that we couldn\u2019t even hold the $60 a barrel level suggests that the oil market is just going to free fall right now,\u201d Schlossberg said.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.06% a trade-weighted measure of the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of six rival currencies, rose 0.38% to 88.60.\nBloomberg News/Landov Central Bank of Russia Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina\u2019s decision to raise interest rates didn\u2019t stop the dollar from strengthening further against the ruble."}
