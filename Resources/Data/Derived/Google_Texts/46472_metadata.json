They were chattel, possessions toiling in his fields. So it\u2019s not lightly \u2013 or unreasonable \u2013 to invoke the plantation mentality to describe the National Football League.\n\nTom Van Riper, who covers sports for Forbes magazine, points out that of the 31 owners of NFL teams, seventeen \u2013 more than half \u2013 are billionaires. Many boast of being self-made, in the image of Horatio Alger, but are now ensconced in luxury skyboxes far above the proletarians whose own dreams of glory ride vicariously on the grunts and groans of bulky but agile gladiators only one play away from a career-ending collision with the laws of physics.\n\nFor more than a year, public television\u2019s award-winning investigative journalism series FRONTLINE had been collaborating on a new documentary about brain trauma in pro football with journalists from ESPN, the giant sports network. The title: \u201cLeague of Denial: The NFL\u2019s Concussion Crisis.\u201d\n\nA hard-hitting promo for the investigation upset ESPN President John Skipper. \u201cOver the top\u201d was his description \u2014 too \u201csensational.\u201d He was so \u201cstartled\u201d \u2013 his word \u2013 that he pulled the plug on ESPN\u2019s partnership with FRONTLINE. The network has had a reputation for solid, even bold reporting of controversy and scandal in pro and amateur athletics. Not this time.\n\nYou have to ask, what was the actual reason for ESPN\u2019s decision? Could it really be what John Skipper claims? Or is it that NFL games are, as The New York Times recently wrote, \u201cprobably the most valuable commodity in televised sports.\u201d ESPN is paying 15.2 billion dollars \u2013 billion! \u2013 for the rights to telecast \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d for ten years through the year 2021, but it then reaps a fortune in advertising and subscriber fees. The monthly price to watch ESPN is four times higher than the next most expensive national cable network. More than six billion dollars are hauled in from cable ever year. It\u2019s the cash cow for the entire Disney empire. In an interview with the Times, former Disney CEO Michael Eisner said, \u201cTo this day, the Walt Disney Company would not exist without ESPN. The protection of Mickey Mouse is ESPN.\u201d\n\nShortly before his decision, John Skipper had lunch with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and two others in New York City. Sources told the Times, \u201cThe meeting was combative\u2026 with league officials conveying their irritation with the direction of the documentary.\u201d Skipper also admitted to ESPN\u2019s independent ombudsman Robert Lipsyte that he had spoken with Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger. But he insists that the choice to remove ESPN from the FRONTLINE investigation was his own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why did ESPN pull out of an investigation on brain trauma?", "title": "Pro-football\u2019s unsportsmanlike conduct", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why did ESPN pull out of an investigation on brain trauma?", "title": "Pro-football\u2019s unsportsmanlike conduct", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/16/pro_footballs_unsportsmanlike_conduct_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/american-football.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why did ESPN pull out of an investigation on brain trauma?", "title": "Pro-football\u2019s unsportsmanlike conduct", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/american-football.jpeg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bill Moyers and Michael Winship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ESPN, Football, Health Care, Health issues, NFL, Sports, trauma", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd059\"", "article_summary": "The title: \u201cLeague of Denial: The NFL\u2019s Concussion Crisis.\u201dA hard-hitting promo for the investigation upset ESPN President John Skipper.\nCould it really be what John Skipper claims?\nThe protection of Mickey Mouse is ESPN.\u201dShortly before his decision, John Skipper had lunch with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and two others in New York City.\nThe monthly price to watch ESPN is four times higher than the next most expensive national cable network.\nBut he insists that the choice to remove ESPN from the FRONTLINE investigation was his own."}
