John Hickenlooper said he would consider accepting a cabinet post if offered one after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHickenlooper, a Democrat whose second term ends in January 2019, spoke with 9News\u2019 \u201cBalance of Power\u201d on Friday.\n\nHost Brandon Rittiman asked the governor y about serving as secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior considering Hickenlooper once was a geologist.\n\n\u201cI would consider it,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to evaluate and really be convinced that I could make a dramatic difference for the future of the country and do such a better job than the governor of New Mexico or the governor of \u2014 its usually a Western state \u2014 the governor of Washington.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper mentioned family concerns as a reason he might pass on the job. He has a son who is about to turn 13.\n\nSome analysts have also pegged Hickenlooper as a possible nominee for vice president, though he said in the interview that is \u201cpretty far-fetched.\u201d\n\nThe cabinet job, on the other hand, might not be as unlikely.\n\nThe first Interior secretary in President Obama\u2019s administration was Ken Salazar, who served as Colorado attorney general before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. He resigned from the Senate in 2009 to take the cabinet post.\n\nAnd the first woman to hold the position, Gale Norton, who served under President George W. Bush, was another former Colorado attorney general.\n\nBut the connections go back much further. Colorado\u2019s first U.S. senator, Henry M. Teller, served as Interior secretary under President Chester A. Arthur from 1882 to 1885.\n\nThe current Interior Secretary, Sally Jewell, was the president and CEO of Recreation Equipment Inc., the outdoor gear retailer based in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "John Hickenlooper: he\u2019d have to \u201cevaluate\u201d any offer of a cabinet post", "title": "John Hickenlooper: he\u2019d have to \u201cevaluate\u201d any offer of a cabinet post", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/13/john-hickenlooper-hed-have-to-evaluate-any-offer-of-a-cabinet-post/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_024134_john-hickenlooper.jpg", "height": 411}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_024134_john-hickenlooper.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T14:38:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:46:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1404\"", "article_summary": "Colorado\u2019s first U.S. senator, Henry M.
