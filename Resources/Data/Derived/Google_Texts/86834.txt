CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office has reached an agreement with a rug store owner who has been advertising a going out of business sale since last fall.

Attorney General Joseph Foster said the state entered into an agreement with Menashe Cohen, doing business as Epic Oriental Rugs of Hampton, to resolve allegations that he violated the state’s Consumer Protection Act. Cohen published ads until April.

The act prohibits advertising such a sale that lasts for more than 60 days.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cohen must stop advertising the sale and retract any forthcoming going-out-of-business sale advertisements. He also must make a payment to the state in lieu of a civil penalty and will reimburse the attorney general’s office for investigative costs.
