But there was also a sense of uneasiness about what may still lie ahead, the consequences of the plan many of them once so ardently supported.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not spend 90 minutes pissing on Obamacare,\u201d warned Gene Carroll, the moderator for the event\u2019s final roundtable talk and co-director of the New York State AFL-CIO Cornell Union Leadership Institute.\n\nIt was meant as a joke, but wasn\u2019t completely in jest. Though the several dozen invited guests generally agreed Obamacare was a good first step, they all wanted to see changes.\n\nThe height of union disagreement now stems from the so-called Cadillac Tax, which is a 40% excise tax that, starting in 2018, that will be imposed on plans exceeding a certain threshold. Union plans can exceed these thresholds and employers who are required to foot the bill are worried it\u2019ll bite into profits, according to union sources.\n\nAccording to several union leaders, those worries are starting to play out at the bargaining table, or employers have warned them it soon will.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to fighting big fights over wages, or pensions, or other terms and conditions of work. But we\u2019ve always been pretty well successful on finding the accommodations on health care,\u201d International Association of Machinists President Thomas Buffenbarger said.\n\n\u201cNow some of the biggest employers in the country are saying, \u2018We are prepared for war,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nNational union representatives have met with officials from the White House, Department of Labor, the Treasury Department, and others on several occasions to try to make their case for changes to the health care law but so far haven\u2019t had much traction.\n\n\u201cAlthough the agencies have declined a number of requests from unions, discussions continue about ways to address union concerns,\u201d one union health care official told BuzzFeed.\n\nThe official did not specify what requests have been denied.\n\nIn a statement, a White House official acknowledged that a \u201cvariety of stakeholders\u201d have met with officials about the health care law, but declined to elaborate on what those discussions have entailed.\n\n\u201cWe have met with a variety of stakeholders, including labor leaders to talk about issues important to working families, including how the Affordable Care Act is making health insurance more affordable and accessible for workers and employers alike and will continue working together to help more Americans gain access to quality, affordable coverage,\u201d the official said.\n\nUnion tensions with Obamacare have been on the rise as negotiations with the administration have remained unfruitful and employers have become more reluctant when it comes time to renegotiate health benefits.\n\nWhile the White House hasn\u2019t yet appeased any union demands, it has made changes. That includes the recent delay of the soon-to-be canceled plans considered substandard by the new law until well after the midterms and the end of Obama\u2019s tenure. And labor leaders have taken notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear they have chosen not to use what I believe is the same administrative authority and executive authority to address some of the issues that we have been pointing out that they have found basis to use for other areas,\u201d International Association of Fire Fighters General President Harold Schaitberger told BuzzFeed.\n\nUnions last year demanded their Taft-Hartley health care plans be eligible for individual tax breaks on the marketplace, as well as the tax break they already receive for being an employer-provided plans. Late last year the Treasury Department issued a letter stating that it did \u201cnot see a legal way\u201d the plans could receive the additional break.\n\nOthers argue that employers are simply using Obamacare as an excuse, and that health care conditions aren\u2019t much different than they would\u2019ve been had the law not been instated.\n\n\u201cIt appears that employers are using the ACA as an excuse for try [sic] to accomplish a lot of things that they\u2019ve hoped to do for some time \u2013 make further cuts to benefits,\u201d Wayne Ranick, communications director for United Steelworkers International, told BuzzFeed in an email. \u201cSo yes, the ACA has created some new twists and challenges at the bargaining table, but it\u2019s more like variations on a theme than wholesale new concepts that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nLabor officials believe employers are starting to bring up the Cadillac Tax now, four years before it goes into effect, for one of two reasons.\n\nOne is that many employers don\u2019t yet fully understand the tax, and want to hedge on costs now before they get blindsided by them in a few years. The other, like Ranick argued, is that employers understand exactly what\u2019s going on but want to use the still murky and confusing tax to shift health care costs to workers.\n\nTo at least try to quell that first worry, a union health care official said they are hopeful that the Treasury Department, along with the Internal Revenue Service, will release guidelines to employers for dealing with the Cadillac Tax.\n\nBut while several delegates at the event in New York had plenty to say on the downsides of Obamacare, others were insistent that they focus on the root of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we all on the same side against the high cost of health care?\u201d Mitra Behroozi, executive director of Benefit and Pension Funds for the local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, asked at the roundtable.\n\nAs of now, many labor leaders are on the fence \u2014 torn between continuing support for a law they once helped campaign for, and protecting their members from the consequences they believe the law might lead to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just on the political merry-go-round,\u201d said Schaitberger, the IAFF general president.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3066454, "userid": 327482}, "description": "No matter what, it'll take some cooperation from the White House. \"Let's not spend 90 minutes pissing on Obamacare,\" one AFL-CIO...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
