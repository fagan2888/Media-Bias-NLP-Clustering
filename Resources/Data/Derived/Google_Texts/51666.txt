President Obama’s conservative, tea party-loving cousin also happens to be a radiologist who called out the president for his “lies” to the American people.

The personable Dr. Milton Wolf, candidate for U.S. Senate in Kansas, joined Sean Hannity’s “Doctor Summit” Friday evening saying that while one can’t choose their family, one can “rise up and stop family from destroying America.”

Wolf said Obama’s promise that people can keep their doctors and healthcare plans if they liked them “was a lie” that started “one week before Obamacare was voted on.”

He lashed out at Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for “hiding” from Congress the report she had that “showed 14 million Americans would lose their health insurance from Obamacare,” a move, he said, “ensured Obamacare would pass.”

Wolf said his patients are worried at rising insurance rates and about losing their health coverage.

“We talk about access to healthcare,” he told Hannity. “Well, the surest way to keep a patient away from a doctor is to make things too expensive. And that’s exactly what Obamacare does.”

“They call it the Affordable Care Act? But not a word of that is true. It’s not affordable and it does not provide care.”
