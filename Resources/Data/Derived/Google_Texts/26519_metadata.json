The spot, which focuses on delivering health assistance to sick workers and standing up for working families, is \u201cfascinating,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes tweeted, adding, \u201cCould be from a liberal Democrat.\u201d Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post was also blown away: \u201cThis Mitch McConnell ad is remarkable.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, they\u2019re right. It\u2019s a case study in breathtaking hypocrisy, for a man who \u201cfor fifteen years \u2026 all but ignored the problems at the plant\u201d he now touts, and who also has pushed to deny health coverage to millions by trying to repeal Obamacare. Watch it here:\n\nPretty audacious stuff, yes \u2014 but on some level, it shouldn\u2019t be so surprising that McConnell is trying to paint himself as \u201ca liberal Democrat\u201d on economic issues. That\u2019s because, while this fact often eludes the political class, progressive economic values \u2014 like protecting the social safety net \u2014 are widely popular in America.\n\nHow do we know this? Just look at the messages that winning national politicians \u2014 of both parties \u2014 choose to pitch to Americans when seeking their votes.\n\nThere\u2019s McConnell, of course, but also look at 2012. President Obama, who spent much of 2013 dangling his chained CPI proposal to reduce Social Security benefits, didn\u2019t exactly trumpet the proposal when he came before voters the previous year. (The reality is polls show that protecting Social Security, like increasing the minimum wage and unemployment insurance, is widely popular among Americans, and has been for years.) Instead, he ran a populist national campaign explicitly based on the idea that we live in a cooperative society that works best when we lift up those who are struggling.\n\nAs I noted in a recent piece challenging the notion that we\u2019re now living in some new and sudden \u201cliberal resurgence,\u201d the president\u2019s speech directed at a prime-time general election audience at the 2012 Democratic National Convention could have been written by Elizabeth Warren:\n\n\u201cI refuse to ask middle class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire\u2019s tax cut. I refuse to ask students to pay more for college, or kick children out of Head Start programs, to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor, and elderly, or disabled, all so those with the most can pay less.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit. I don\u2019t believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy, or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP wants us to think this is a center-right nation -- but Mitch McConnell's new ad lets the cat out of the bag VIDEO", "title": "New ad inadvertently reveals GOP\u2019s darkest secret: Voters are liberal!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP wants us to think this is a center-right nation -- but Mitch McConnell's new ad lets the cat out of the bag VIDEO", "title": "New ad inadvertently reveals GOP\u2019s darkest secret: Voters are liberal!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/23/the_rights_precious_secret_is_inadvertently_revealed_america_is_liberal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/mcconnell_ad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP wants us to think this is a center-right nation -- but Mitch McConnell's new ad lets the cat out of the bag VIDEO", "title": "New ad inadvertently reveals GOP\u2019s darkest secret: Voters are liberal!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/mcconnell_ad.jpg", "creator": "@blakezeff", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Blake Zeff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Conservatives, Editor's Picks, George W.
