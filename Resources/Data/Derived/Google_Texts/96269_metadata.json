Sepulvado was not on the rig when it blew wild, starting a nearly 3-month-long gusher in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nProsecutors had Sepulvado describe the test in question and other operating procedures.\n\nDuring cross-examination, defense attorney David Gerger asked him whether people in three other positions could order an emergency shutdown if they felt something was going wrong with that test. Sepulvado answered \"yes, sir,\" to each.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Testimony in the trial of Robert Kaluza, a supervisor on the Deepwater Horizon prior to an explosion in 2010, indicated three other people also shared responsibility for shutting the rig down in case of problems.", "language": "english", "author": "The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Trial-Witness-Says-Others-Share-Responsibility-on-Oil-Rig-369279221.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Deepwater+Horizon+oil+spill.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Testimony in the trial of Robert Kaluza, a supervisor on the Deepwater Horizon prior to an explosion in 2010, indicated three other people also shared responsibility for shutting the rig down in case of problems.", "title": "Trial Witness Says Others Share Responsibility on Oil Rig"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Testimony in the trial of Robert Kaluza, a supervisor on the Deepwater Horizon prior to an explosion in 2010, indicated three other people also shared responsibility for shutting the rig down in case of problems.", "title": "Trial Witness Says Others Share Responsibility on Oil Rig", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Trial-Witness-Says-Others-Share-Responsibility-on-Oil-Rig-369279221.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Deepwater+Horizon+oil+spill.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Trial Witness Says Others Share Responsibility on Oil Rig", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Trial Witness Says Others Share"}, "article_summary": "Murry Sepulvado was the second prosecution witness to testify in Robert Kaluza's trial on a misdemeanor pollution charge.\nSepulvado was not on the rig when it blew wild, starting a nearly 3-month-long gusher in the Gulf of Mexico.\nSepulvado answered \"yes, sir,\" to each.\nProsecutors had Sepulvado describe the test in question and other operating procedures.\nAlthough a Deepwater Horizon supervisor is accused of ignoring clear signs that a test showed problems hours before the rig exploded in flames in 2010, another supervisor testified that three other workers shared responsibility for interpreting the test in question."}
