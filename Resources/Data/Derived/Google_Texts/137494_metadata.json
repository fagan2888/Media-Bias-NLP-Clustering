That came after a roller-coaster of a day, following an initial plunge of about 1,000 points at the opening bell. The volatility is driven by concerns over slowing global growth, especially in China, which recently devalued the yuan in an effort to increase consumer spending.\n\nThe dip \u0093will not affect middle-market financing at all,\u0094 insists Theodore Koenig, CEO of Chicago-based lender Monroe Capital.\n\nCIT Group Inc.\u0092s (NYSE: CIT) Neil Wessan agrees. \u0093Assuming that the market settles down this week, I do not see any concerns for middle-market loans or deals,\u0094 he says. Wessan is the group head for CIT Capital Markets. \u0093There is ample liquidity in the market to absorb the current backlog of transactions.\u0094\n\nAlthough middle-market deals and loans may be impervious to a brief slump, dealmakers could find themselves affected if market volatility continues.\n\n\u0093I think that the loan market will have to get used to more broader-market volatility,\u0094 says Wessan. \u0093Under Dodd Frank there has been a contraction of capital on the bank dealer\u0092s desks, resulting in wider bid-offer spreads during periods of market movements up or down. In the current case with the market falling, the primary source of bids initially is from hedge funds, who may be more aggressive in their bids.\u0094\n\nThe movements may persuade some owners that now is the time to sell.\n\n\u0093This added volatility may convince some owners of companies to sell in order to lock in their gains,\u0094 Wessan says. \u0093Thus you may, over the long-term, have even more activity.\u0094\n\nMarket volatility will also affect private equity firms taking out loans to execute transactions.\n\nThe dip could affect pricing on loans in the middle market, according to Lawrence Golub, CEO of middle-market lender Golub Capital, who says that stock market drops cause money to move from middle-market loan funds to broadly-syndicated loan funds, which in one to three months, could make middle-market loans more expensive.\n\n\u0093If broadly-syndicated loan secondary prices stay lower, we expect to see that over the balance of this year having an impact on middle-market pricing,\u0094 Golub says.\n\nThat could translate into a 25 to 50 basis point increase in first- and second-lien loan pricing, and total deal leverage going back down to 4x senior and 5.5x or 6x total, according to Golub.\n\nFor private equity firms, the shift installs the need for increased caution when agreeing to pricing flags on loans. \u0093Smart private equity firms are putting a big premium on pricing certainty,\u0094 Golub says.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_services/dealmakers-say-the-middle-market-remains-safe-from-stock-market-plunge-257818-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/stock-trader.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Dealmakers Say the Middle Market Remains Safe From Stock Market Plunge, For Now"}}, "article_summary": "Dealmakers Say the Middle Market Remains Safe From Stock Market Plunge, For NowThe short-term impact may be minimal, but concerns about increased volatility could spur owners to sell and lenders to raise prices on loansMiddle-market dealmakers are confident that the Aug. 24 stock market drop will not have an immediate effect on loans or M&A transactions.\n\u0093Assuming that the market settles down this week, I do not see any concerns for middle-market loans or deals,\u0094 he says.\n\u0093I think that the loan market will have to get used to more broader-market volatility,\u0094 says Wessan.\n\u0093If broadly-syndicated loan secondary prices stay lower, we expect to see that over the balance of this year having an impact on middle-market pricing,\u0094 Golub says.\n\u0093There is ample liquidity in the market to absorb the current backlog of transactions.\u0094Although middle-market deals and loans may be impervious to a brief slump, dealmakers could find themselves affected if market volatility continues."}
