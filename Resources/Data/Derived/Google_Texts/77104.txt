It’s official: if you make a quarter of a million bucks a year and decide not to pay for health insurance, you’re going to have to fork over $2,448 to the feds.

The Internal Revenue Service finally released its maximum fines for those who choose to go without health insurance. Under terms of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, fines were included for those who decided not to have coverage as an incentive to get more folks to purchase coverage.
