He also defended the hospital\u2019s staffing, which included a reduction of 122 full-time nurses in 2013.\n\nThe hospital has appointed interim directors to replace its chiefs of medicine and surgery and hopes to conclude a nationwide search this year to fill those vacancies, he said.\n\nDenver Health has \u201c6,500 full-time employees,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an organization of that size, there is a normal course of turnover.\u201d\n\nBill Sonn, a Colorado health care communication consultant not involved with Denver Health, said the departure of top-flight talent from any hospital could be a sign of trouble.\n\n\u201cFor any organization, turnover like that is a red flag,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the physician shortage, moreover, keeping physicians engaged is a priority for most provider organizations. Having talent leave often indicates some sort of dysfunction in communication, compensation or shared decision-making.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, The Denver Post learned that at least five hospital leaders have departed since Gonzalez arrived. He succeeded Dr. Patricia Gabow, the longtime hospital leader who helped transform Denver Health from a city hospital into a semi-public entity with more financial flexibility.\n\nDr. Richard Albert, chief of medicine, retired from the hospital but teaches and serves as vice chair for clinical affairs for the Department of Medicine on the University of Colorado\u2019s Anschutz campus.\n\nDr. Gregory Jurkovich, chief of surgery, and Dr. David Brody, head of managed care, both resigned.\n\nStephanie Thomas, chief operating officer, also retired, and Gregory Veltri, chief information and technology officer, departed after a disagreement concerning the hospital\u2019s change of computer systems.\n\nThomas was \u201chighly regarded\u201d and gave advance notice of her retirement plans, Gonzalez said, but he could not discuss the departures of Jurkovich and Brody. They declined to comment, and Albert did not return messages.\n\nVeltri praised Denver Health and its doctors. \u201cThey saved my life two or three times,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he questioned the size of the hospital\u2019s investment in a new computer system, saying the costs could total $300 million, including a $70 million payoff to the current contractor and a doubling of the information technology staff.\n\nHe said he warned that the cost could bankrupt a hospital operating on thin financial margins.\n\n\u201cMy estimates weren\u2019t flattering,\u201d he said.\n\nGonzalez responded that Veltri was \u201cheld in good regard,\u201d but \u201che\u2019s severely mistaken.\u201d\n\nHe said he could not divulge how much it cost the hospital to get out of its current computer contract, citing a confidentiality clause.\n\nDenver Health records show it chose Epic as an electronic medical record system provider partly to share resources and research with other hospitals. Epic now serves about 65 percent of hospital beds across the Front Range.\n\nThe investment is vast already. According to the hospital\u2019s January 2015 board minutes, it completed a temporary building to house the Epic team and hired \u201cthe required 125 person staff.\u201d And while Gonzalez reported record cash collections in 2014, he told the board \u201cthat much of this cash-on-hand is already spoken for with projects such as Epic.\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s finances have been helped somewhat by Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which enables it to seek reimbursement for newly qualified patients.\n\nIn September, the hospital board increased Gonzalez\u2019 base salary from $760,000 to $800,000, which the hospital calls the midpoint for comparable institutions. In addition, he was paid $180,706 last year for achieving organizational goals in 2014 ranging from patient safety to finances.\n\nGonzalez was rewarded at a time when some hospital employees were complaining of staff reductions, particularly among nurses.\n\nIn response to a records request from The Post, the hospital said in October that four nurses had been laid off since Gonzalez was hired, and 71 staff nurses had been \u201cdismissed/terminated\u201d for reasons that \u201care typically performance related.\u201d\n\nMinutes of the hospital\u2019s April 2015 board meeting, however, refer to \u201cthe recent staff reduction of 122 FTE (full-time equivalent) nursing positions.\u201d\n\nGonzalez noted that the April report found no link between an increase in at-risk events, which can be anything from infections to falls, and the reduced nursing staff.\n\nA hospital spokeswoman said the report \u201cwas actually a discussion about the workforce reduction in 2013, which was a combination of leaving positions unfilled, reassigning staff and job elimination, and how, two years later, there was not an increase in \u2018at risk\u2019 events because of this change.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Denver Health spent $2 million for an efficiency consultant named Envigorate to help install a computer-based productivity system. \u201cThis organization-wide system drives our ability to align our staffing with our patient census,\u201d the hospital said.\n\nGonzalez said the hospital achieved \u201cabout $32 million worth of improvements\u201d in return, in part by right-sizing departments.\n\n\u201cWe are just as concerned about departments that are overstaffed as departments that are understaffed,\u201d he said.\n\nGonzalez also raised eyebrows at the hospital by setting aside space on campus for his staff band.\n\nBut he said it amounts to a 10-foot-square space in a previously vacant room on campus converted to office space, so the band rehearsal area didn\u2019t cost the hospital anything.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201can all-volunteer staff band\u201d that rehearses after hours and performs at hospital events such as the employee picnic, he said.\n\nHe plays rhythm guitar.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Health lost top doctors, including medicine and surgery chiefs", "title": "Denver Health lost top doctors, including medicine and surgery chiefs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/denver-health-lost-top-doctors-including-medicine-and-surgery-chiefs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__denver_health_medical_centerp1-1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109__denver_health_medical_centerp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T18:26:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:53:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1962\"", "article_summary": "Denver Health Medical Center has shed top officials and doctors, including its chiefs of medicine and surgery, under the leadership of a new chief executive.\nDenver Health has \u201c6,500 full-time employees,\u201d he said.\nVeltri praised Denver Health and its doctors.\nHe succeeded Dr. Patricia Gabow, the longtime hospital leader who helped transform Denver Health from a city hospital into a semi-public entity with more financial flexibility.\nDenver Health records show it chose Epic as an electronic medical record system provider partly to share resources and research with other hospitals."}
