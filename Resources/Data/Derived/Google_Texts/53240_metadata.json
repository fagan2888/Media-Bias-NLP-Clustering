State of Georgia et al., Richard Pellegrino v. State of Georgia et al, and T. Tucker Hobgood v. State of Georgia et al presented their arguments in hopes that the construction of the stadium would cease and desist. Pellegrino was represented by his attorney, while the other plaintiffs argued on their own behalf.\n\nPellegrino is a Cobb County activist, whose activities have included involvement with the East Cobb Democratic Alliance, Cobb United for Change, and Citizens United for Transparency; and serving as Director of the Cobb Immigrant Alliance.\n\nThe residents argue the trial court erred in validating the bonds, according to a summary issued by the Court.\n\n\u201cTheir primary contentions are that the agreement in which the County agrees to pay for the bonds and the Authority agrees to issue the bonds is not a valid intergovernmental agreement; that validating the bonds violates the debt clause and gratuity clause of the Georgia Constitution; that the project is an improper use of public tax money for a private facility; and that the bonds cannot be authorized without a public referendum,\u201d the summary states.\n\n\u201cThe power of local government bodies to bind their constituents to long-term debt without \u2018the assent of a majority of qualified voters\u2019 for a non-public project like this professional baseball stadium is at the heart of this case,\u201d Hobgood and another attorney write in their brief.\n\n\u201cThere are not only statutory prohibitions against \u2018any county, municipality, or political subdivision\u2019 incurring debt, bonded or not, without an election, but also a constitutional one,\u201d they write.\n\n\u201cThe stadium is not a public project, and the debt incurred by the County is barred by the Constitution\u2019s debt clause. This non-public project also is not authorized by other provisions of the Constitution,\u201d they write.\n\n\u201cThe Braves stadium, which is not public in any normal sense of the word, does not qualify as the type of \u2018facility\u2019 related to \u2018parks, recreational areas, or programs,\u2019\u201d the residents argue.\n\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cpark\u201d as \u201can enclosed pleasure-ground in or near a city, set apart for the recreation of the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no sense in which \u2018parks and recreational areas\u2019 can be stretched to include a facility (professional baseball stadium) run and controlled exclusively for profit by private parties,\u201d they write.\n\n\u201cThere is precedent that was made by this court in Sheffield v. State School Building Authority 1952,\u201d under the 1945 State Constitution, Savage told the Justices during oral argument.\n\n\u201cThe determination of Sheffield is the very root of this case\u2026 The debt clause has an exception regarding intergovernmental agreements; ten percent is the most allowed, except for intergovernmental agreements,\u201d Savage said.\n\nSavage was referring to the bond purchase and validation for financing the new Braves stadium. A bond agreement is not an intergovernmental agreement, which is an agreement between municipalities for services; therefore, the debt clause exceptions cannot apply as it is only meant for true intergovernmental agreements, he argued.\n\nThe project should not move forward until the voters have a choice to decide whether they will be on the hook for the stadium financing, he argued.\n\n\u201cThe issues are with the County Commission, who should have put this question to the voters. It should have been a vote because of the debt clause,\u201d Hobgood argued.\n\n\u201cThe underlying constitutional issue is whether the permitted activity asserted by the County is present here. The county has the power to provide for parks, recreation areas, programming, and facilities. The SunTrust Park Stadium does not fit into that definition. These are private parties who are interested exclusively for profit. It\u2019s against the County power to enter into an agreement, unless they take it to the voters,\u201d Hobgood argued.\n\nOne of two attorneys present for the County and Cobb-Marietta Coliseum & Exhibit Hall Authority was Thomas Curvin, who presented the County\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThe Recreation definition states that recreational activity includes amusement, play, or other form of relation that refreshes the mind and body, and this is from Ballentine\u2019s law dictionary,\u201d Curvin said.\n\n\u201cMany facilities in Cobb County and Stone Mountain you have to pay fees. Lake Lanier Islands, managed by a private company, is state property and visitors have to pay fees. The Braves stadium will offer [in addition to the baseball games] three special events, ten days a year, defining it as a recreational area for use by the public,\u201d Curvin said.\n\n\u201cThe Authority will own the facility and the operations would be handled by the Braves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat will pay back the bonds?\u201d Justice Harold Melton asked.\n\n\u201cPayments come from general taxpayer funds, plus 6.1 million in licensing fees for use of the property paid by the Braves,\u201d Curvin said.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t most bonds being paid by general taxpayers funds which go to a vote? What is your response?\u201d Melton asked.\n\n\u201cThe Thompson case allowed for a permissible, full faith and credit through the county,\u201d Curvin replied.\n\n\u201cWhat is the source of funds?\u201d Justice Melton asked again.\n\n\u201cTax funds collected by Cobb County,\u201d Curvin said.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3f9\"", "article_summary": "(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 On February 03, 2015, the Supreme Court of Georgia heard oral arguments in the case cases against the bond financing of the construction of the new Braves Stadium in Cobb County.\nPellegrino is a Cobb County activist, whose activities have included involvement with the East Cobb Democratic Alliance, Cobb United for Change, and Citizens United for Transparency; and serving as Director of the Cobb Immigrant Alliance.\n\u201cTax funds collected by Cobb County,\u201d Curvin said.\nAs previously reported by Atlanta Progressive News, the Braves are planning to relocate from Turner Field in Atlanta, to a new stadium in Cobb County.\nSavage was referring to the bond purchase and validation for financing the new Braves stadium."}
