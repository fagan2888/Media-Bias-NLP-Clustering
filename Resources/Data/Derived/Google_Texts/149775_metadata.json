Sheri Smallwood Gilligan, R-Cumming, accepted funding from two influential conservative advocacy groups before her July election to a suburban Atlanta House seat, despite vowing to reject campaign contributions from \u201cspecial interests.\u201d\n\nIn campaigning for office, Gilligan, the former Forsyth County Tea Party chair, repeatedly criticized the influence of such groups on her opponents and government in general, emphasizing a need for \u201cindependent, conservative leadership that is not beholden to special interests.\u201d\n\nIn a June 2 interview with the Forsyth Herald, Gilligan made her position clear.\n\n\u201cI am not accepting donations from any special interests or corporations because when I cast my first vote, I do not want to owe anyone anything except the voters who sent me to represent them,\u201d she said.\n\nYet on July 7, one week before the July 14 runoff election for the District 24 seat, Gilligan accepted $500 contributions from two interest groups: The American Federation for Children and the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nAsked about the donations, Gilligan told the AJC the two groups contributed because they appreciated her support for small businesses and school choice.\n\n\u201cThese two groups reached out to me and I did not see it as special interests,\u201d Gilligan said in the interview. \u201cI want a level playing field for all things and I thought, you know, it\u2019s just another way of getting my message out. So maybe I was wrong, but that\u2019s the way I looked at it.\u201d\n\nBoth organizations are conservative lobbying groups based in the Washington area and are a large lobbying presence at the Georgia Capitol. AFC is a member of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and promotes school privatization as well as charter schools. NFIB was the lead plaintiff against the Affordable Care Act in the 2012 Supreme Court case.\n\nGilligan, a Navy Reserve vet and former U.S. intelligence analyst turned technical college instructor, said she had not considered informing voters about the two contributions, which accounted for about 3 percent of the $30,240 that she raised overall.\n\n\u201cI had not even thought about it as a potential issue,\u201d Gilligan said. \u201cLike I said, the people who elected me here in Forsyth County know where I stand on all of these issues.\u201d\n\nThe contributions to Gilligan\u2019s campaign were disclosed on July 10, four days before the runoff. Seth Weathers, political consultant for Gilligan\u2019s opponent in the special election David Van Sant, told the AJC that Van Sant\u2019s campaign was aware of the contributions.\n\nWeathers said he views AFC and NFIB as special interest groups.\n\n\u201cMaybe they were special interests that she happens to agree with,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it any less of a special interest group.\u201d\n\nWeathers said Gilligan\u2019s acceptance of the contributions seems to him like \u201cpolitics as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe maybe wasn\u2019t as different as she tried to portray she was in the campaign,\u201d Weathers said.\n\nLeighton Rowell, a senior at the University of Georgia, is a student in the Georgia News Lab, a collaboration among Georgia\u2019s leading journalism programs, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Channel 2 Action News.

Gilligan\u2019s campaign records that Rowell conducted as part of a News Lab investigation.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/12/27/newly-elected-house-republican-skirts-campaign-vow/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/sheri.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "The following story was written by Leighton Rowell, a University of Georgia student part of The Georgia News Lab, which trains students in investigative journalism and partners with the AJC and WSB-TV to showcase their work.\r\n\r\nNewly elected State Rep.
