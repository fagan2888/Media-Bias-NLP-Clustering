A new paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters shows how unusual such an extreme drought really is. The answer? Very, very rare.\n\nIn fact, the 2012-2014 California drought is the worst drought in the region in the last 1,200 years (at least), and the project\u2019s researchers Daniel Griffin and Kevin J. Anchukaitis figured this out using tree cores.\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s Dana Nuccitelli reports:\n\nThe study used drought reconstructions from tree-ring cores, from the North American Drought Atlas (NADA) and from cores Griffin & Anchukaitis collected from blue oak trees in southern and central California. Blue oak tree ring widths are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. According to Griffin, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s old blue oaks are as close to nature\u2019s rain gauges as we get.\u201d The study compared today\u2019s drought conditions in California to those reconstructed over the past 1,200 years using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), an estimate of available soil moisture.\n\nThey concluded that not only was this drought the worst in over a millennium, but that it was the worst because of record heat.\n\n\u201cTemperature could have exacerbated the 2014 drought by approximately 36 percent,\u201d Griffin and Anchukaitis wrote. \u201cThese observations from the paleoclimate record suggest that high temperatures have combined with the low but not yet exceptional precipitation deficits to create the worst short-term drought of the last millennium for the state of California \u2026 Future severe droughts are expected to be in part driven by the anthropogenic influences and temperatures outside the range of the last millennium.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hello again, climate change?", "title": "California\u2019s drought was the worst in over 1,200 years", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hello again, climate change?", "title": "California\u2019s drought was the worst in over 1,200 years", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/08/californias_drought_was_the_worst_in_over_1200_years/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/california-drought-water-auctions.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hello again, climate change?", "title": "California\u2019s drought was the worst in over 1,200 years", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/california-drought-water-auctions.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, atmosphere, California, drought, precipitation, trees", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20ee\"", "article_summary": "In fact, the 2012-2014 California drought is the worst drought in the region in the last 1,200 years (at least), and the project\u2019s researchers Daniel Griffin and Kevin J.
