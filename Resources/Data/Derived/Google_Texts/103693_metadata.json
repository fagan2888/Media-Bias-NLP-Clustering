This presents a problem since the Obamacare state exchanges need at least 2.7 million American youths in the 18 to 35 age group to sign up and spend a minimum of $5,800 on average. If they don\u2019t, the Obamacare state exchanges will fail and Obamacare will die with it.\n\nThis amazing fact triggered what some pundits labeled the War on Bros, because American youths that are too cheap or unable to insure are called Bros within the insurance world, apparently. They\u2019re attempting to market Obamacare to that demographic in hopes they\u2019ll sign up on HealthCare.gov (assuming, that is, it\u2019s actually working at the moment). To give you an idea how pervasive this marketing is, I was just in a sports bar and Obamacare was part of the marketing for sports games.\n\nSo now not only does Obama want us to talk up Obamacare during Thanksgiving dinner, he\u2019s now sicking the Pajamas Boy onto Twitter in hopes that some will be convinced to sign up pronto. What\u2019s next\u2026 Obamacare Santa?\n\nThe ad features a twenty-something in pajamas holding a cup of hot chocolate and is labeled with: \u201cWear pajamas. Drink hot chocolate. Talk about getting health insurance.\u201d The ad then links to an Obamacare advocacy website that gives tips on how to talk to family members during the holidays (can\u2019t call it Christmas\u2026 you know how antsy government types get over that label).\n\nHow do you plan to spend the cold days of December? http://t.co/Rwf5AYc3bG #GetTalking pic.twitter.com/PBQ397yLf4 \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) December 17, 2013\n\nIn response, many Twitter users made fun of the Pajamas Boy, pointing out how silly he looks and comparing his wardrobe to a giant-size onesie. Even the hipsters are making fun of him. And Atlantic Wire\u2018s Alex Edelman believes that Pajamas Boy is flat-out condescending to the Millennials it\u2019s targeting:\n\n\u201cThe problem with these campaigns \u2013 with all the Invincible-targeted ads in the Obamacare muddle, actually \u2013 is twofold. First they don\u2019t inform all that much\u2026. Second, there\u2019s very little respect for the intended audience.\u201d\n\nEven Chris Christie went on the attack, telling people to get our of their pajamas and start serving the community:\n\nIn New Jersey, we are spending the cold days of December volunteering. #GetOutOfYourPJs #SeasonOfService pic.twitter.com/yhtwDpy2cQ \u2014 Governor Christie (@GovChristie) December 18, 2013\n\nDo you think Pajamas Boy helps or hinders the Obamacare marketing effort?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pajamas Boy is part of an Obamacare marketing campaign attempting to target Millennials, but apparently the pajama \"man-child\" has only started a President", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Pajamas Boy is part of an Obamacare marketing campaign attempting to target Millennials, but apparently the pajama \u201cman-child\u201d has only started a President", "title": "Pajamas Boy: Obamacare Marketing Starts Obama, Chris Christie Twitter Fight", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1066967/pajamas-boy-obamacare-marketing-starts-obama-chris-christie-twitter-fight/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Pajamas-Boy-Obamacare-Marketing-Starts-Obama-Chris-Christie-Twitter-Fight.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-18T23:25:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-19T00:10:37+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Pajamas-Boy-Obamacare-Marketing-Starts-Obama-Chris-Christie-Twitter-Fight.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-12-18T23:25:15+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,chris christie,obama,pajama boy,pajamas,pajamas boy,war on bros,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Pajamas-Boy-Obamacare-Marketing-Starts-Obama-Chris-Christie-Twitter-Fight.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Pajamas Boy is part of an Obamacare marketing campaign attempting to target Millennials, but apparently the pajama \u201cman-child\u201d has only started a President"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Pajamas Boy is part of an Obamacare marketing campaign attempting to target Millennials, but apparently the pajama \u201cman-child\u201d has only started a President Obama, Chris Christie Twitter fight.\n#GetOutOfYourPJs #SeasonOfService pic.twitter.com/yhtwDpy2cQ \u2014 Governor Christie (@GovChristie) December 18, 2013Do you think Pajamas Boy helps or hinders the Obamacare marketing effort?\nIf they don\u2019t, the Obamacare state exchanges will fail and Obamacare will die with it.\nTo give you an idea how pervasive this marketing is, I was just in a sports bar and Obamacare was part of the marketing for sports games.\nSo now not only does Obama want us to talk up Obamacare during Thanksgiving dinner, he\u2019s now sicking the Pajamas Boy onto Twitter in hopes that some will be convinced to sign up pronto."}
