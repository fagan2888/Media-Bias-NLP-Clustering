An air-conditioned 747 flew from Los Angeles, packed with fresh produce destined for Costco, Safeway and Foodland stores here on Oahu.\n\nCompany representative Paul Skellon says there has been quite a bit of additional demand. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that we have access to quite a sizeable fleet of 747 aircraft and larger aircraft than this particular model of 747. So we feel comfortable at this stage that we will be able to match capacity with demand.\u201d\n\nSkellon says Pacific Air Cargo normally runs five round trips per week, with the planes also filled with outbound produce.\n\nHe says there\u2019s also been demand for urgent medical supplies, destined for hospitals across the state.\n\nUnloading of cargo ships on the West Coast is expected to resume on Tuesday. President Obama this weekend sent his labor secretary to California to try to speed up resolution of the labor dispute between the dockworkers\u2019 union and shipping companies, which halted the unloading for the three-day weekend.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As dozens of ships and tens of thousands of cargo containers sit idle at West Coast ports, some stores in Hawaii are turning to airplanes.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411526747", "og": {"site_name": "KHON2", "description": "As dozens of ships and tens of thousands of cargo containers sit idle at West Coast ports, some stores in Hawaii are turning to airplanes.", "title": "Air service helps deliver fresh produce to Oahu stores", "url": "http://khon2.com/2015/02/15/air-service-helps-deliver-fresh-produce-to-oahu-stores/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/air-cargo-service.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As dozens of ships and tens of thousands of cargo containers sit idle at West Coast ports, some stores in Hawaii are turning to airplanes.", "title": "Air service helps deliver fresh produce to Oahu stores", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/air-cargo-service.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@khonnews", "site": "khonnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Working for Hawaii - Hawaii News, Weather, and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.khon", "fb": {"pages": 66874361378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khon2.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b26093ebd87004d2709601aeb29b2013?s=16", "application-name": "KHON2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/khon2news", "published_time": "2015-02-16T03:03:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-16T05:02:44+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "F8HhCy2NOcu_QvRKzZJGqFMMgASTuCT3_KKw72WqXWw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca87b\"", "article_summary": "An air-conditioned 747 flew from Los Angeles, packed with fresh produce destined for Costco, Safeway and Foodland stores here on Oahu.\nUnloading of cargo ships on the West Coast is expected to resume on Tuesday.\nAs dozens of ships and tens of thousands of cargo containers sit idle at West Coast ports, some stores in Hawaii are turning to airplanes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that we have access to quite a sizeable fleet of 747 aircraft and larger aircraft than this particular model of 747.\nHe says there\u2019s also been demand for urgent medical supplies, destined for hospitals across the state."}
