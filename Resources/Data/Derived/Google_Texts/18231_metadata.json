YouTube/screenshot\n\nIf you recall the 1993 movie, The Sandlot, then you know the worst insult for a boy in the film was: \u201cYou play ball like a girl.\u201d Always, the Procter and Gamble feminine hygiene brand, has launched the #LikeAGirl campaign to challenge the insult and teach young pubescent girls self-confidence.\n\nAsking simple questions based off what it means to do things \u201clike a girl,\u201d award-winning filmmaker Lauren Greenfield teamed up with Always to create a campaign video, which features girls and boys acting out their understanding of the phrase. Greenfield asked the participants, for example, to \u201crun like a girl.\u201d\n\nThe older kids, perhaps due to gender norms, immediately respond to the phrase by acting out the stereotypical hyper-feminine hair flipping and prancing about. \u201cOh my hair,\u201d one girl says as she pretend-runs. The video demonstrates how their reactions are fueled by the preconceived notion that women are inferior, and in this case, physically weaker than men.\n\nThe opposite occurs when the youngest girls are asked the same questions. They respond without any preconceived notions of what it means to act \u201clike a girl.\u201d But soon, the older kids realize they\u2019re reinforcing an insult and take a second chance to act like girls.\n\nSimilar recent female empowerment campaigns have included #BanBossy, spearheaded by Sheryl Sandberg, and Dove\u2019s \u201cReal Beauty\u201d ads. At the end of the video, one girl asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t \u2018run like a girl\u2019 also mean \u2018win the race?\u2019\"\n\nWatch the kids in action below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "always, likeagirl, campaign, aims, boost, self, confidence, pubescent, young, women", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Always' new campaign wants to show pubescent girls there's nothing insulting about acting \"like a girl.\"", "title": "#LikeAGirl Campaign Makes You Proud To Be One", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/always-likeagirl-campaign-aims-boost-self-confidence-pubescent-young-women-290370", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/likeagirl.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Always' new campaign wants to show pubescent girls there's nothing insulting about acting \"like a girl.\"", "title": "#LikeAGirl Campaign Makes You Proud To Be One", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/always-likeagirl-campaign-aims-boost-self-confidence-pubescent-young-women-290370", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/likeagirl.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/likeagirl.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-27T15:20:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T15:30:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Always' new campaign wants to show pubescent girls there's nothing insulting about acting \"like a girl.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8eea\"", "article_summary": "Always' #LikeAGirl campaign wants to show pubescent girls there's nothing insulting about acting like one.\nAt the end of the video, one girl asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t \u2018run like a girl\u2019 also mean \u2018win the race?\u2019\"Watch the kids in action below:\nYouTube/screenshotIf you recall the 1993 movie, The Sandlot, then you know the worst insult for a boy in the film was: \u201cYou play ball like a girl.\u201d Always, the Procter and Gamble feminine hygiene brand, has launched the #LikeAGirl campaign to challenge the insult and teach young pubescent girls self-confidence.\nThe video demonstrates how their reactions are fueled by the preconceived notion that women are inferior, and in this case, physically weaker than men.\nSimilar recent female empowerment campaigns have included #BanBossy, spearheaded by Sheryl Sandberg, and Dove\u2019s \u201cReal Beauty\u201d ads."}
