There was one episode like four years ago in which I was wearing some loose jeans mainly because I was out on the pitcher\u2019s mound, and I didn\u2019t want to feel confined while I was pitching, and I think I\u2019ve paid my penance for that. I got whacked pretty good. Since that time, my jeans fit very well.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s \u201cmom jeans\u201d have become an easy target for those looking to poke fun at the commander-in-chief.\n\nFormer Republican Vice Presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin slammed Obama for his denim wear during an appearance on Fox News last week, comparing Obama, \u201cone who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates,\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin, \u201cone who wrestles bears and drills for oil.\u201d\n\nObama, though, believes that despite what his opponents say about his fashion sense, he still has good taste. Daughters Malia and Sasha, he said, agreed.\n\n\u201cThey thought for a dad, I displayed reasonably good taste,\u201d the president told Seacrest of shopping for wife Michelle and his daughters. \u201cThe bar is fairly low, but I didn\u2019t get too adventurous.\u201d\n\nThe president has been making the rounds of media outlets as the open enrollment period for consumers to purchase health insurance under Obamacare draws to a close. His appearance on \u201cOn Air with Ryan Seacrest\u201d is part of an attempt to encourage young people, specifically, to enroll in the law, as their participation is crucial to its success.\n\nObama has employed a host of tactics to convince Millennials to head to healthcare.gov, often using fatherly rhetoric to share the dangers of not having health insurance. But in his conversation with Seacrest, the president cut straight to the chase and told listeners that failing to purchase coverage would leave them paying a monetary penalty.\n\n\u201cIf you can afford it and you just decide you don\u2019t want to get it because your attitude is \u2018nothing\u2019s ever going to happen to me,\u2019 then you\u2019ll just be charged a penalty,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd the reason is because if you end up having an accident and you go to the emergency room, somebody has got to pay for it. And that somebody is folks who\u2019ve been responsible about getting health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe fee for not purchasing the health insurance in 2014 is 1 percent of one\u2019s income or $95. That increases to 2 percent of ones income or $325 in 2015 and 2.5 percent of income or $625 in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Barack Obama has a bit of a sore spot when it comes to those who make fun of his mom jeans, as he lamented to radio host Ryan Seacrest on Friday that he has been \"unfairly maligned\" about his denim wear.", "title": "Obama laments reaction to mom jeans: 'I've been unfairly maligned...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 503, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/03/Obama-Mom-Jeans-503x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/14/obama-laments-reaction-to-mom-jeans-ive-been-unfairly-maligned-about-my-jeans/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "young-people-obama", "published_time": "2014-03-14T15:44:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T15:15:41+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve been unfairly maligned about my jeans,\u201d Obama responded.\nSince that time, my jeans fit very well.\u201dPresident Obama\u2019s \u201cmom jeans\u201d have become an easy target for those looking to poke fun at the commander-in-chief.\nObama has employed a host of tactics to convince Millennials to head to healthcare.gov, often using fatherly rhetoric to share the dangers of not having health insurance.\nPresident Barack Obama has a bit of a sore spot when it comes to those who make fun of his mom jeans, as he lamented to radio host Ryan Seacrest on Friday that he has been \u201cunfairly maligned\u201d about his denim wear.\nHis appearance on \u201cOn Air with Ryan Seacrest\u201d is part of an attempt to encourage young people, specifically, to enroll in the law, as their participation is crucial to its success."}
