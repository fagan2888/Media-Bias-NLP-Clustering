There\u2019s nothing pleasurable about it because even though it might feel physically good, you\u2019re completely disgusted by what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nDecker, 37, developed the mysterious condition known as persistent genital arousal syndrome (PSAS), which causes him to have 30 to 40 erections and dozens of orgasms daily, and at any time of the day regardless of what he\u2019s doing. He began experiencing the uncontrollable orgasms after slipping a disk between his vertebrae (called a herniated disk), which probably irritated nearby nerves. During his subsequent trip to the hospital alone, he experienced five orgasms.\n\nAlthough Decker suffers every day, having embarrassed himself in places like the grocery store, where \u201caround 150 people\u201d watched him orgasm, his entire family is also affected \u2014 the grocery store incident happened while with his kids. His young sons don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with him, and he can\u2019t build a good father-son relationship with them because he\u2019s scared to take them places.\n\nMeanwhile, his relationship with his wife, April Decker is falling apart. \u201cWe really struggle right now as he is unable to work and supply for his family, and I feel like all the strain is on me,\u201d she said. Apart from failed sex, she said they also \u201cargue over things that should not be affecting us,\u201d and, because of nightly episodes, they\u2019ve had to sleep in different beds. \u201cThat can be very frustrating. You want the comfort from another person, particularly your husband, but we don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nDecker is a rare case when it comes to PSAS, which was first identified as a condition in 2002, because it normally appears in women. Despite studies on the condition, such as this one from 2012, which also found that the cause may be from a slipped disk, scientists still haven\u2019t been able to find a way to treat it. Knowing this, Dr. Dena Harris, a New York City gynecologist, said that she hopes \u201che gets the help he so desperately needs,\u201d according to the Post.\n\n\u201cBeing aroused can be a wonderful thing, but this is not like arousal, it\u2019s not even sexual,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrendous spasm and it can be terribly painful. Suicide is always a concern when people suffer from this condition \u2014 they feel like they have no other way to escape it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wisconsin, man, dale, decker, suffers, constant, orgasms, persistent, genital, arousal", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A man from Wisconsin can't live a normal life because he suffers from persistent genital arousal syndrome, which causes him to experience multiple orgasms at any given time.", "title": "After Having Up To 100 Orgasms A Day, This Guy Says He Never Wants Another One [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wisconsin-man-dale-decker-suffers-constant-orgasms-persistent-genital-arousal-syndrome-304524", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/dale-decker.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man from Wisconsin can't live a normal life because he suffers from persistent genital arousal syndrome, which causes him to experience multiple orgasms at any given time.", "title": "After Having Up To 100 Orgasms A Day, This Guy Says He Never Wants Another One [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wisconsin-man-dale-decker-suffers-constant-orgasms-persistent-genital-arousal-syndrome-304524", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/dale-decker.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/dale-decker.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-23T15:26:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T15:26:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A man from Wisconsin can't live a normal life because he suffers from persistent genital arousal syndrome, which causes him to experience multiple orgasms at any given time."}, "article_summary": "He began experiencing the uncontrollable orgasms after slipping a disk between his vertebrae (called a herniated disk), which probably irritated nearby nerves.\nSuicide is always a concern when people suffer from this condition \u2014 they feel like they have no other way to escape it.\u201d\n\u201cBeing aroused can be a wonderful thing, but this is not like arousal, it\u2019s not even sexual,\u201d Harris said.\nAlthough Decker suffers every day, having embarrassed himself in places like the grocery store, where \u201caround 150 people\u201d watched him orgasm, his entire family is also affected \u2014 the grocery store incident happened while with his kids.\n\u201cIt makes you never want to have another orgasm for as long as you live."}
