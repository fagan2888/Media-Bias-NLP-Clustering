His wife, daughters and former teammates openly cry for him. They lament what has befallen him. They dread what his future might hold. \u00b6 Talley\u2019s life is in tatters. Loved ones say his mind is deteriorating. He\u2019s begrudgingly starting to agree. \u00b6 He\u2019s 54, but his body is a wreck and continues to crumble. He suspects collisions from playing linebacker for 14 NFL seasons, a dozen with the Buffalo Bills, have damaged his brain. He\u2019s often depressed beyond the point of tears. \u00b6 He\u2019s bitter at the National Football League for discarding him and denying that he\u2019s too disabled to work anymore. He says the Bills have jilted him, too. \u00b6 He learned after he retired that he\u2019d played with a broken neck. \u00b6 He had a heart attack in his 40s. \u00b6 He lost his business. The bank foreclosed on the Talleys\u2019 home of 17 years. Against her husband\u2019s pride, Janine Talley has accepted money from friends to pay the bills. \u00b6 He contemplates killing himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d Darryl Talley flatly said last month on the patio of the house he and Janine rent. \u201cWhen you go through the s--- that I\u2019ve gone through, you start to wonder: Is this really worth it? Is it worth being here, worth being tortured anymore?\n\n\u201cIt would be just as easy to call it a day. But there are two reasons why I won\u2019t. First of all, my parents didn\u2019t raise a coward. The most important is I want to be around for my grandkids.\u201d\n\nBruce Smith is among those most frightened for Talley.\n\nAlthough they thrived alongside each other during the franchise\u2019s glory days and consider themselves brothers forever, Smith isn\u2019t willing to trust Talley\u2019s rationalizations.\n\n\u201cA moment of weakness, a moment of darkness, a moment of hopelessness,\u201d Smith said from his home in Virginia. \u201cThose are pretty powerful things that can come into play that makes one forget about how we were raised or what state we would leave the rest of the family and friends in.\u201d\n\nTalley, like Smith and the rest of their mates from the Super Bowl era, maintain a mythological presence with Bills fans. They\u2019re like superheroes leaping off the pages of a Marvel comic book. One of Talley\u2019s trademarks was the Spider-Man ski suit he wore under his uniform.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s football legends, however, are not indestructible cartoon characters. They are mortals, as we\u2019ve been reminded through Jim Kelly\u2019s cancer ordeal or 50-year-old Kent Hull\u2019s death from liver failure in 2011.\n\nTalley is the first Bill from the Super Bowl years to disclose ominous mental, physical and financial difficulties seemingly rooted in playing football.\n\n\u201cI never thought this would be our life, but this is the reality of it,\u201d Janine Talley said. She met Darryl at West Virginia University; they\u2019ve been together 34 years. \u201cI don\u2019t see it getting any better. This\u2019ll kill him one way or the other.\n\n\u201cHis mental issues have accelerated a lot in the last year. I don\u2019t know what the future holds for either one of us. I don\u2019t know if in a few years dementia will set in. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to care for him.\u201d\n\nGabrielle Talley, the younger of their two daughters, said through tears, \u201cHope is not in abundance right now.\u201d\n\nOther teams have suffered tragedies linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head trauma.\n\nSan Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson, Philadelphia Eagles safety Andre Waters, New Orleans Saints safety Gene Atkins and Pittsburgh Steelers guard Terry Long are among Talley contemporaries who committed suicide and were found afterward to have CTE.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about real tragedies of life,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThrough Darryl, the Bills and their fans can actually identify a face with the problem now. It\u2019s an ugly problem.\n\n\u201cHopefully this will never happen with Darryl, but we know what path Junior Seau went down. There are a number of other players that chose to take that route and not endure or get back on track.\u201d\n\nThe CTE Center, an independent academic research center at Boston University, explains on its website the disease \u201cis associated with memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse-control problems, aggression, depression and eventually progressive dementia.\u201d\n\nWest Seneca native Justin Strzelczyk, a retired Steelers lineman, was in CTE\u2019s early stages. He was only 36 when he died in September 2004 at the end of a high-speed police chase on the Thruway. Strzelczyk\u2019s pickup truck collided with a tractor-trailer and exploded. He had been hearing voices.\n\nTalley has not been diagnosed with CTE. That can be determined for sure only through an autopsy, although advancements give researchers hope it can be detected in the living. A pilot study last year at UCLA indicated Bills Hall of Fame guard Joe DeLamielleure\u2019s brain carried the abnormal protein characterized by CTE damage.\n\nThere are dark clues surrounding Talley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that I\u2019m dead yet,\u201d Darryl Talley said. \u201cBut the future doesn\u2019t look bright. People say these are supposed to be the twilight years of your life. When are they coming? The stars aren\u2019t twinkling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the damnedest thing to think ... to think that ... it\u2019s over? Not yet, but it\u2019s close. I\u2019m not ready to call it quits yet or phone it in.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just an unbelievable fight to deal with the pain.\u201d\n\nA warrior laid bare\n\nTalley\u2019s street is under construction. He and Janine live in an area of Orlando called Doctor Phillips, about 14 miles from Walt Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom. From the main road, barriers and heavy equipment prevent a quick turn toward their home.\n\nInstead, you must take a detour down Bittersweet Lane.\n\nAll of this reads like a poetic metaphor, but it\u2019s the truth.\n\n\u201cYou never had to worry about Darryl when we played,\u201d former Bills linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. \u201cHe just threw caution to the wind and did whatever he had to do to play on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI worry about him now.\u201d\n\nTalley\u2019s family and friends know how serious his issues have been. They\u2019ve advocated for him. They\u2019ve encouraged him to come forward and admit he needs support.\n\nA significant hurdle, though, is one of the undeniable traits that made Talley such a remarkable player, a two-time Pro Bowler despite an astounding list of injuries.\n\nPride has kept Talley from speaking up, from accepting his circumstances, from seeking relief.\n\nTalley remained his typical, stubborn self until agreeing to sit down with The Buffalo News last month for an exclusive interview about his hardships.\n\nWhen told her father was hosting a reporter, Gabrielle Talley thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no way Daddy\u2019s going to go for it.\u201d The 21-year-old predicted he would back out. Alexandra Talley, 27, didn\u2019t want to discuss her father because she was too distressed over him.\n\nBennett broke down in tears and called it \u201ca shock\u201d when informed Darryl Talley finally wanted to talk.\n\n\u201cThis ... this ... this ... This just took me by ...\u201d Bennett said, his voice breaking. \u201cFor Darryl to talk about it and get help, to hear him say, \u2018I want to get help, and I want to talk about it,\u2019 that is the most ... That is what it\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nThe Talleys are nervous how people will react to their situation. Darryl is particularly uneasy about revealing that his brain isn\u2019t working as well as it should, that his body won\u2019t let him be the man he wants to be, that his business failed.\n\nMost of all, it has been difficult for him to concede the delicate spot his family is in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with the idea of speaking out,\u201d Talley said in his favorite wicker chair, which allows him to sit for longer than a few minutes. His neck was rolled back and his legs fully extended, almost as if lying down.\n\n\u201cIf you tell people you\u2019ve been concussed so many times and forget what you\u2019ve walked into a room for, they\u2019re going to go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a scarlet letter!\u2019 \u201d\n\nHis hope is to salvage a more tolerable future and to shine a light on the truth many former players face long after they have served their purpose to the NFL.\n\nTalley received the NFL\u2019s total-permanent disability B plan, which pays $50,000 a year. The league ruled he didn\u2019t file his paperwork in time to qualify for the A plan, which pays $120,000 a year. The Talleys contend he applied for his disability benefits in accordance with the collective-bargaining agreement that he played under.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re done playing,\u201d Darryl Talley said, \u201cyou\u2019re like a piece of meat. They treat you like, \u2018None of what you say is our fault. None of these injuries happened from playing football.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey tell you whether or not you hurt. Ain\u2019t none of them son of a bitches took a hit ... took a knife cut.\n\n\u201cNone of us playing this game is normal. To compare an NFL player\u2019s pain threshold to the average person who\u2019s never done it? They\u2019re going to tell me I don\u2019t hurt?\u201d\n\nWithout naming names, Talley claimed to know several retired players who tanked their disability exams or lied throughout the process to gain full benefits.\n\nThe doctor who evaluated Talley\u2019s disability case ruled he was capable of working at a job where sitting or standing was required. A significant problem, Talley insisted, is that his body can do one or the other for only a few minutes at a time. He wondered aloud if some company would hire him to be a staggering receptionist.\n\n\u201cI want to let everybody know what this has done to me,\u201d Talley said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have a voice. There are a lot of guys that didn\u2019t say anything before they died.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s got to ring the bell.\u201d\n\nBehind closed doors\n\nA visitor to the Talleys\u2019 ranch home wouldn\u2019t detect anything amiss. Darryl and Janine reside in a prim gated community dotted with gorgeous palm trees. The front lawn is thick. Their back yard is on a golf course.\n\nTheo, their Shih Tzu-Maltese mix, rambunctiously trots around with a golf ball in his mouth, eager to play.\n\nJanine Talley confessed they don\u2019t own this house, which is half the size of the one they were evicted from last year.\n\nThe Talleys are tenants now. They\u2019ve had to move twice in the past 17 months. Their credit is so nuked from the foreclosure and the failed business that their landlord required them to pay three months rent in advance. They didn\u2019t have the money.\n\nDarryl Talley used to own superb credit. On just a signature, banks would lend him whatever money he needed for his business or personal needs.\n\nTo move into their home, three old friends \u2013 Smith, Bennett and Thurman Thomas \u2013 gathered the rent deposit and gave it to Janine without Darryl\u2019s knowledge because they knew he would be too proud to accept it. When Darryl learned where the money came from, he cried.\n\nThe Talleys are convinced their lives would be different if the NFL institution took proper care of its own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most disappointing thing ever to go out and play and to stand up for that shield and then to have them f--- you the way they do,\u201d Darryl Talley said. \u201cI put team and league in front of everything, in front of my family.\n\n\u201cWhere are the team and league to back me up now?\u201d\n\nDarryl Victor Talley\u2019s toughness is unquestioned.\n\nHe was a 146-pound linebacker with a 28-inch waist at Shaw High in East Cleveland. He played much larger, a sideline-to-sideline berserker.\n\nHis nickname was Big Chief from his Native American bloodlines and resemblance to the \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d character. Both front teeth were knocked out when he ran into a telephone pole to catch a football in his neighborhood.\n\nScholarship offers were limited because he played only 10 varsity games. A broken ankle kept his senior season to three games.\n\nEven so, West Virginia was amazed by Talley\u2019s tenacity.\n\nHe became WVU\u2019s first consensus All-American in nearly three decades. The College Football Hall of Fame inducted him in 2011.\n\nThe Bills drafted him 39th overall in 1983. He missed one game in 12 years for the Bills (not counting the three-game NFL strike in 1987) and five his entire career, which included one-year stops with the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings before he retired in 1997.\n\n\u201cThe league is full of tough guys,\u201d former Bills special-teams coordinator Bruce DeHaven said. \u201cBut if I had to go down a dark alley and could pick one guy to go with me, it\u2019d be Darryl Talley.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s the best fighter, but I know two things: He\u2019d have my back, and he\u2019d stay there until they killed him.\u201d\n\nEarly in the 1990 offseason, Talley underwent surgeries on each elbow and one knee on the same day. He then had surgery to repair a torn meniscus two weeks before starting in the season opener.\n\nHe recalled resetting his own mangled right ring finger after it got entangled in Miami Dolphins guard Keith Sims\u2019 jersey and breaking his left middle finger so he could remove it from Los Angeles Raiders fullback Steve Smith\u2019s facemask.\n\nThen there was the time Talley, while with the Vikings, walked six snowy blocks back to the hotel after knee surgery.\n\nTalley emits his infectious, warbling laugh when he blithely explains how he handled myriad injuries and 14 surgeries.\n\nBut he and his wife were dumbfounded to learn during a 1998 post-retirement NFL Line of Duty disability examination that years earlier he\u2019d suffered a broken neck.\n\nHe can remember only two major neck injuries: versus Washington in 1987 and Pittsburgh in 1991. Each time, the Bills\u2019 medical staff cleared him for the next game.\n\nOn the drive home from his Line of Duty exam, the Talleys phoned the Bills to request medical records pertaining to his neck. The Talleys said the Bills told them those files no longer exist.\n\nThe Bills declined to respond to the Talleys\u2019 allegation about missing medical records.\n\n\u201cOur alumni play a very important role in the Bills organization, and each individual is unique in his own way,\u201d the Bills said in a statement to The News for this story. \u201cDarryl Talley has always been one of our favorites throughout our storied history, but we believe, respectfully, that some of the accounts for this story are factually incorrect.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the Bills organization is very proud to have assisted many former players, either personally or with their various endeavors, that dates back to the 1960s. The fact that our organization currently employs three of Darryl\u2019s former teammates should also be noted.\u201d\n\nThe Bills\u2019 statement didn\u2019t impress the Talleys.\n\n\u201cThe Bills\u2019 response is disappointing and comes off to me, Darryl and our daughters as dismissive,\u201d Janine Talley said. \u201cWe were specific, but they\u2019re not specifying what they debate to be inaccurate.\n\n\u201cWhy would we lie?\u201d\n\nDarryl Talley noted an NFL team wouldn\u2019t draft a college prospect with X-rays that showed he once had a broken neck. Yet he\u2019s convinced he played for Buffalo with that serious injury.\n\n\u201cHe loved being the person nothing could stop,\u201d Gabrielle Talley said. \u201cThat man wasn\u2019t stopping until a doctor or a coach told him he wasn\u2019t allowed. Nobody ever did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL culture. As much as I resent my dad for not having his own well-being in mind when he played, that\u2019s what medical professionals are there for. Trainers and doctors went to school for that, to be the responsible voice of reason.\u201d\n\nOnly five players in Bills history played more seasons or games than Talley. He\u2019s on their Wall of Fame and was voted to their 50th anniversary team in 2009.\n\nTrouble sleeping\n\nBut for years he hasn\u2019t been able to flip his shirt collar down or fashion a necktie. His arms can\u2019t rise up and bend that way.\n\nHe rarely sleeps longer than 90 minutes, frequently climbing onto the floor with his legs propped on an ottoman for back relief.\n\nHe sometimes must use his knees to steer his pickup truck because of wrist pain from jamming linemen and tight ends.\n\n\u201cThis is not what he signed up for,\u201d Gabrielle Talley said. \u201cMy dad is one of the toughest people you\u2019d ever meet. He\u2019d walk through a wall for you.\n\n\u201cBut nobody would sign up to put their brain and their body through that if they knew what the risks were.\u201d\n\nJanine Talley was asked what she felt the biggest points were to make about her husband\u2019s story.\n\nShe looked up from her laptop and studied her husband. She thought for a few moments.\n\nJanine: \u201cWhat I want people to know is how much he loved being a Buffalo Bill and how difficult it was to leave the team.\u201d\n\nDarryl: \u201cOooooooo ...\u201d\n\nJanine: \u201cDarryl offered to play for the veteran minimum wage.\u201d\n\nDarryl: \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to leave. The man is dead now, but [former Bills General Manager] John Butler said he offered me a contract, and he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJanine: \u201cThe separation was awful for him and awful for me to watch.\u201d\n\nDarryl: \u201cThat sent me into a deep depression. There\u2019s nothing in this world that I\u2019ve seen or heard that will replace that void of playing in front of those fans.\u201d\n\nThe Talleys agreed that it took him at least four years to get over his 1995 Bills departure.\n\nWithin that gloomy period, Janine Talley started to get frightened for her husband. One particular incident confused and scared her.\n\nShe woke up at about 3 a.m., and Darryl wasn\u2019t in bed anymore. She searched the house yet couldn\u2019t figure out where he was. She saw no lights on.\n\nEventually, she opened the door to their recreation room. In pitch blackness, Darryl sat cross-legged in front of the pool table, a glass of Jack Daniels in his hand, staring at the framed jerseys of his former teammates: Andre Reed, Hull, Smith, Thomas, Bennett.\n\nShe asked what he was doing. He didn\u2019t answer.\n\nUpon hearing his wife recount that story, Darryl Talley muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve felt that way a number of times: \u2018I\u2019m just lost.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe never was diagnosed with a concussion, but he\u2019s no fool. Seau and Strzelczyk didn\u2019t have documented concussions either.\n\nSo how many concussions would Darryl Talley guess he suffered? He emitted that warbling laugh again.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d Talley replied. \u201cI\u2019ve hit people, got up, felt like my eyes were bouncing back and forth, or I\u2019d see mini lights. I\u2019d have to say at least 75 times I saw little lights. I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s got to be more than 100 concussions.\u201d\n\nDr. Julian Bailes is the former neurology department chair at the Talleys\u2019 alma mater. They have not met, but Bailes knows those flashbulbs Talley described.\n\nBailes is co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute in Evanston, Ill. He has conducted brain autopsies on NFL players, oversaw DeLamielleure\u2019s living CTE exams, examined Strzelczyk\u2019s brain and sits on several sports safety boards. Bailes is chairman of the Pop Warner medical advisory committee.\n\n\u201cEvery time you get hit and see flashing lights and you feel it in your head,\u201d Bailes said, \u201cthat\u2019s probably a significant subconcussion blow.\u201d\n\nSubconcussions are brain injuries that might not rise to the level of a diagnosed concussion. Players don\u2019t necessarily wobble off the field or experience memory loss with a subconcussion. But the damage from repeated subconcussions can accumulate exponentially and may contribute to CTE.\n\nThe Talleys have lived in the same area for the past 17 years, but Darryl cannot remember the garbage is collected every Monday and Thursday. He cannot remember their ATM identification number, which hasn\u2019t changed since his rookie year.\n\nOn a visit to Gabrielle Talley\u2019s home in Birmingham, Ala., he tried to make repairs to her SUV. Each time he needed a tool, he went to her second-floor apartment to retrieve it rather than get the toolbox.\n\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t make the simple connections that come easily for the rest of us,\u201d Gabrielle Talley said.\n\nDepression and suicidal thoughts are common CTE characteristics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible, and it has to be taken seriously,\u201d Bailes said. \u201cJunior Seau played football for 30 years. You think of his style of football and how he played his position. He drove off a cliff two years before he shot himself in the chest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely terrible and poignant part of the emerging CTE profile. We always worry that prior brain injury can be associated with an increased incidence of suicide later in life.\u201d\n\nSeau shot himself in the chest two years ago, preserving his brain for examination. A year earlier, Dave Duerson killed himself the same way and left directions in a suicide note for his family to donate his brain.\n\nSeau and Duerson had experienced failed businesses, memory loss, abrupt mood swings, angry outbursts and other issues the Talleys can identify.\n\nDarryl Talley admitted an especially dark moment while a guest at the 2002 Pro Bowl. Miserable over how much he missed football, he considered jumping off the balcony at the Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel.\n\nIn explaining why he wouldn\u2019t kill himself now, Talley emphasized over and again that he\u2019s not a \u201ccoward.\u201d Upon reflection, he regretted using that word and took it back. He didn\u2019t want to disparage anyone\u2019s memory or offend their families.\n\n\u201cI think he needs to look at suicide prevention,\u201d Duerson\u2019s widow, Alicia Duerson, said from her home in the Chicago area. \u201cIf he\u2019s ever done some study on that or dealt with anybody who\u2019s lost a loved one, it\u2019s not about being a coward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s someone who\u2019s in agony and pain and can\u2019t deal with it anymore. I don\u2019t think people realize how hard it is to take your own life.\u201d\n\nAlicia Duerson paused for a moment before rushing off the phone.\n\n\u201cPeople who commit suicide are not cowards,\u201d she said. \u201cI just ... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t talk right now. I have to go.\u201d\n\nFailure and denial\n\nDarryl and Janine Talley tried to prepare for NFL retirement the prudent way. They saved money while he played. Their goal merely was to keep working, make enough money to exist, send their daughters to private school and then pay for their college educations.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play golf every day, chase hos up and down the street or do drugs,\u201d Darryl Talley said.\n\nWhat he initially wanted to do was serve as a Bills assistant coach. He said he called owner Ralph Wilson to inquire about an entry-level job but was told the Bills don\u2019t hire former players. Alex Van Pelt and Pete Metzelaars later became Bills assistants while Wilson was alive.\n\nDarryl Talley in August 1999 purchased Sentry Barricades, a business that handled traffic signage and detour control for emergencies, construction sites, road closures and the like.\n\nEven though Talley was coping with depression and physical decline, Sentry Barricades grew to 17 employees.\n\nThe economy ravaged Sentry Barricades in 2008. Some clients went bankrupt. Not only did those contracts evaporate, but so too did the money they owed Talley\u2019s company.\n\nJanine Talley said he tapped his 401k and bought out his NFL pension at 25 percent value to salvage Sentry Barricades, but they still couldn\u2019t honor their vendors or make payroll.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s work ethic and perseverance is what you see in children\u2019s books and people tell myths about,\u201d Gabrielle Talley said. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t do anything to save the business even though he kept trying.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t get it to work and feels that he\u2019s let everyone down.\u201d\n\nMost heartbreaking to Darryl and Janine was cashing in their daughters\u2019 college funds.\n\n\u201cDo you know how humbling that was?\u201d Janine Talley said. \u201cAt this point in our lives, we thought we probably would be retired, golfing and have enough financial security to travel, visit our girls, be able to buy a vehicle when one broke down.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it\u2019s played out. I don\u2019t see at our age where things are going to get any better.\u201d\n\nThe Talleys couldn\u2019t afford to attend Reed\u2019s induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame last August. Just as Smith, Thomas and Bennett helped with the rent and some of Gabrielle\u2019s college, they picked up the tab to get the Talleys there.\n\nSmith is paying for the Talleys\u2019 health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s all-time sacks leader has reached out to the Bills to get Talley some help but came away disillusioned with the team\u2019s indifference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a conversation or two, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI was somewhat optimistic, but there was no follow up. That was the disappointment,\u201d\n\nSmith declined to divulge names or specifics about the Bills\u2019 lack of response.\n\n\u201cFor someone to be so loyal to his previous employer,\u201d Smith said, \u201cfor someone who gave his all to their organization, to see the lack of support is just very concerning. It\u2019s sad.\n\n\u201cThere should have been a lot more help than is being presented to him. It\u2019s imperative we do whatever we can to make sure this does not end up as a tragic story of someone who was beloved by players, coaches, fans.\u201d\n\nThe Bills declined to comment on Smith\u2019s frustrations. Smith conceded the Bills could be in an awkward spot by assisting one former player but not all of them.\n\nThen Smith rattled off a handful of times when Talley played hurt or came back from surgery seemingly faster than possible for the Bills.\n\n\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t show your allegiance and commitment to the organization, I don\u2019t know what does,\u201d Smith said. \u201cDarryl wanted to help the team win.\n\n\u201cOnce a player is done playing, the team pretty much washes their hands clean so they don\u2019t have issues with retired players. From my standpoint, though, there\u2019s something that should be done in this circumstance.\u201d\n\nDarryl Talley isn\u2019t a fan of all this sympathy and charity.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want it, but he knows his family needs it.\n\n\u201cTo rely on somebody else to help you? It hurts like you don\u2019t want to believe,\u201d Darryl Talley said. \u201cYou can lay in the bed and cry thinking about it. It drives at you. It eats at you.\n\n\u201cNot to be able to do whatever you want to do mentally or physically, you have a dignity ... It\u2019s very disheartening. But I want to see my kids get old. That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nHis hands cradled his forehead then slumped hard onto the wicker chair\u2019s armrests. Janine Talley watched from the couch across from him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve used up most of my useful life,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe part that hasn\u2019t been used up doesn\u2019t look like it can be too useful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass. Getting old is not for sissies, but what drives me nuts is the NFL doesn\u2019t think it has anything to do with it.\u201d\n\nemail: tgraham@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports, american football", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "BN Blitz", "description": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 Those closest to Darryl Talley are terrified.
