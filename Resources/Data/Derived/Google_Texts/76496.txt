STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — As he carefully checked the security cameras and door locks Tuesday in what is expected to be among the first retail pot shops in Steamboat Springs, Public Safety Director Joel Rae knew a lot was at stake.

In just a matter of days, adults 21 and older likely will be stopping by Rocky Mountain Remedies to legally purchase recreational pot for the first time.

Acting as the city’s marijuana licensing authority for the first time, the Steamboat Springs City Council on Tuesday night will consider approving the first licenses for recreational pot shops in Steamboat.

#Following the inspection of Rocky Mountain Remedies on Tuesday, Rae said he’d be surprised if it did not meet all of the city’s requirements to earn the license by next week.
