But many also are victims of wage theft, a catch-all term for payroll abuses that cheat workers of income they are supposedly guaranteed by law.\n\nOver the last few years employers ranging from baseball\u2019s San Francisco Giants to Subway franchises to Farmers Insurance have been cited for wage violations. More often, though, wage abuses are not reported by victims or punished by authorities despite being routine in some low-wage industries.\n\n\u201cIf you steal from your employer, you\u2019re going to be hauled out of the workplace in handcuffs,\u201d said Kim Bobo, a Chicago workers rights advocate and author. \u201cBut if your employer steals from you, you\u2019ll be lucky to get your money back.\n\nVictims typically are low wage, low-skilled workers desperate to hang on to their jobs. Frequently, they are immigrants\u2014the most vulnerable and least apt to speak up. \u201cThey know that if they complain, there\u2019s always someone else out there who is willing to take their job,\u201d said Maria Echaveste, a former labor official during the Clinton administration who is now at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law.\n\nWhile heart-breaking for employees, wage theft also robs federal and state treasuries of many billions of dollars in taxes, and puts employers who play by the rules at a serious competitive disadvantage.\n\nWhile there are no exact figures on the extent of wage theft, authorities say it is rampant in such industries as construction, garment manufacturing, restaurants and home health care. The Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor reported in 2012 that of more than 1,800 restaurant investigations it conducted on the West Coast over several years, it found violations in 71 percent. Of more than 1,500 investigations of garment firms, violations were discovered in 93 percent.\n\nA landmark survey survey of thousands of low-wage workers in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago found that 26 percent had been paid less than the minimum wage the week before they were interviewed. According to the 2009 report by the National Employment Law Project and two other groups, 76 percent of the workers who put in more than 40 hours did not get paid or were underpaid the required time-and-a-half overtime rate. About 17 percent of the workers put in unpaid time \u201coff the clock\u201d before or after their shifts, another violation. In the three cities alone, the study estimated, low-paid workers were losing more than $56.4 million per week to wage theft.\n\nAs the main cop on the beat, the Wage and Hour Division over the last five years has put almost $1.1 billion in back wages back in the pockets of underpaid workers. But with just over 1,000 investigators to oversee about 7.3 million business establishments, agency officials concede that violators have a good chance of not getting caught. Said Laura Fortman, the agency\u2019s deputy administrator: \u201cSome businesses may take that kind of calculated risk because the likelihood of being investigated is actually so low.\u201d\n\nBusiness advocates say many violations are unintentional and involve close calls, such as decisions about whether to exempt certain employees from overtime or treat others as independent contractors.\n\n\u201cWage theft, by its very nature, implies an intention to steal wages,\u2019\u2019 said Richard J. Reibstein, a New York attorney in the labor and employment practice group of Pepper Hamilton LLP. \u201cYou should not put the same label on all of these things.\u2019\u2019 There are \u201cgray areas as well as black-and-white areas.\u2019\u2019\n\nFrank Cronin, a lawyer in Costa Mesa, Calif., who has represented employers for more than 30 years, called wage theft an \u201cactivists\u2019 bumper sticker to get politicians a basis for passing more laws.\u201d Violations are \u201calmost always unintended misinterpretations\u201d of complex laws, or \u201ca new interpretation being imposed by extremely aggressive lawyers and/or regulators.\u201d\n\nMatthew Haller, a spokesman for the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said that many franchise operators cited for violations \u201care people that have never been in business before, that with good intentions may run afoul of these complex regulations.\u201d\n\nBut some firms have shown real ingenuity in cheating and covering it up. In 2009, for example, federal investigators found that several Los Angeles garment makers were using specially designed software to create false payroll records. The firms were paying workers piecework rates that fell below the minimum wage. However, according to an investigation report, the software allowed them \u2018\u2019to generate falsified payroll registers that displayed an appearance of compliance.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn other cases, officials say, construction firms have declared workers to be part-owners to deny them wage and hour protections and workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\n\nGlobalization, the decline of organized labor, and an immense pool of immigrants who are afraid to rock the boat all have played a part, along with limited enforcement staffs. Moreover, even when compelled by judgments or settlements to pay back wages, some employers disappear or go out of business before victims can collect.\n\nFundamental shifts in employment practices have also helped wage theft to flourish, officials and experts say.\n\nOne trend\u2013misclassifying workers as independent contractors \u2014is not new but has drawn increased attention as a pervasive feature of the underground economy. Independent contractors are supposed to be people who set their own hours and offer services to multiple clients. But the label has often been imposed as a condition of employment on working stiffs who in no way are running their own businesses. When that happens, the worker loses wage protections, while the employer escapes payment of Social Security, Medicare, unemployment taxes and workers\u2019 comp.\n\n\u201cEmployers are working very hard not to pay wages, and to put employees in difficult situations where it\u2019s a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 type of situation,\u201d said Gary K. Pechie, director of the Connecticut Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Workplace Standards Division.\n\nThe \u201cvery challenging\u201d task of interpreting differing state laws is behind many of these cases, Reibstein argues, adding: \u201cThe standards and tests for independent contractor status are anything but clear.\u2019\u2019\n\nEven so, the incentives to misclassify workers are powerful. A report by the Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general found that for each worker making $43,007 (which the report called an average wage), misclassification saves the employer $3,710 per year in federal taxes alone. \u201cThe misclassification of employees as independent contractors is a nationwide problem affecting millions of workers that continues to grow,\u201d the report said. Since 2011, the Wage and Hour Division has signed cooperative agreements with the IRS and 15 states to fight misclassification.\n\nOutsourcing hiring to staffing agencies and subcontractors also encourages wage abuse, authorities say. It can result in companies at the top of the food chain pushing responsibility for labor standards onto smaller, weaker companies that are less likely to comply.\n\n\u2018\u2019Every time there\u2019s that kind of increased distance between a company and their core work force, then the probability of wage theft goes up,\u201d said Janice Fine, an associate professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. When the top-tier companies are \u201cmany levels disconnected from\u2019\u2019 the work force, they \u201cdon\u2019t have to accept responsibility\u201d for working conditions, Fine said. \u201cAnd when the profit margins they\u2019re offering to contractors are so tight,\u2019\u2019 the contractors \u201care skimping on things like wages.\u201d\n\nThe outsourcing of hiring to alleged violators of wage standards has been the focus of a federal class-action suit in Los Angeles against Walmart and three of its contractors and subcontractors. The suit by workers at Walmart-leased warehouses in the Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles claims that Walmart is jointly responsible for employees being \u201cforced to work long hours, under oppressive workplace conditions, for legally inadequate pay.\u201d Walmart says it did not control hiring or pay practices and was not to blame if violations occurred. Under a proposed settlement filed in court this week, one of the Walmart contractors, Schneider Logistics, will pay a settlement to the workers of $21 million, and claims against both Schneider and Walmart will be dismissed.\n\nSmall Names, Big Names\n\nWhile small, fly-by-night companies are often the culprits in wage cases, large and iconic businesses have been cited, too.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants baseball club, which pays its most famous employees spectacularly well, last year agreed to pay more than $500,000 in back wages to dozens of clubhouse and administrative workers the Labor Department said had not received minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nIn recent years, scores of fast food restaurants\u2013including McDonald\u2019s franchises in Colorado, Subway stores in Michigan, Ohio and Florida; Dunkin\u2019 Donuts shops in New Jersey and New York; and Domino\u2019s Pizzas in Florida\u2014paid back wages after being cited for such violations as failing to pay employees for all hours worked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pay violations are becoming more widespread in low-wage industries -- despite enforcement efforts", "author": "Myron Levin, Stuart Silverstein and Lilly Fowler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pay violations are becoming more widespread in low-wage industries -- despite enforcement efforts", "title": "How corporations get away with rampant wage theft", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/17/report_regulators_cant_stop_wage_theft_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/walmart_store-e1418919435716.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pay violations are becoming more widespread in low-wage industries -- despite enforcement efforts", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/walmart_store-e1418919435716.jpg", "title": "How corporations get away with rampant wage theft", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How corporations get away with rampant wage theft", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Department of Labor, FairWarning, wage theft, Wal-Mart", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d70\"", "article_summary": "While there are no exact figures on the extent of wage theft, authorities say it is rampant in such industries as construction, garment manufacturing, restaurants and home health care.\nFundamental shifts in employment practices have also helped wage theft to flourish, officials and experts say.\nIn the three cities alone, the study estimated, low-paid workers were losing more than $56.4 million per week to wage theft.\nWhile heart-breaking for employees, wage theft also robs federal and state treasuries of many billions of dollars in taxes, and puts employers who play by the rules at a serious competitive disadvantage.\nOver the last few years employers ranging from baseball\u2019s San Francisco Giants to Subway franchises to Farmers Insurance have been cited for wage violations."}
