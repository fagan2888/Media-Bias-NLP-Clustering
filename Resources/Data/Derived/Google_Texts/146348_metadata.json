And that was a huge relief.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 veteran first baseman, who still hasn\u2019t played this summer because of a concussion and neck injury, hit batting practice on the field for the first time since he went on the disabled list May 14.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the ball travel and be out with the boys,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cIt feels like another step in the process.\u201d\n\nMorneau vowed again that his goal remains to return to the Rockies this season. And he hinted that he\u2019s looking for a break in his rehab soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through a regular routine this homestand. I\u2019ll see how it feels, then we\u2019ll see (what\u2019s next),\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be out here if I didn\u2019t think (I could return). That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nMorneau, 34, suffered whiplash and a concussion after diving for a ball May 13 in Anaheim against the Angels. He also missed significant time in 2010 and 2011 with concussions.\n\nThe Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big step,\u201d Colorado manager Walt Weiss said of Morneau\u2019s batting practice. \u201cHe\u2019s been building up to this.\u201d\n\nMorneau has been hitting off a tee and against pitching in an indoor cage at Coors Field. But he\u2019s not traveling with the team. After winning the National League batting title last season, Morneau said he\u2019s been able to find his swing, but hurdles remain on his comeback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be like the first day of spring training where it seems like everybody is throwing 120 mph,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we get back to that point, hopefully I\u2019ll have seen some guys in the minors. That\u2019s the goal I\u2019m working toward right now.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Justin Morneau hits live BP for Rockies in big step after concussion", "title": "Justin Morneau hits live BP for Rockies in big step after concussion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/14/justin-morneau-hits-live-bp-for-rockies-in-big-step-after-concussion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150814__SP11ROCKIESCUBS_AC29646xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150814__SP11ROCKIESCUBS_AC29646xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T19:22:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T10:41:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a big step,\u201d Colorado manager Walt Weiss said of Morneau\u2019s batting practice.\n\u201cIt feels like another step in the process.\u201dMorneau vowed again that his goal remains to return to the Rockies this season.\nAfter winning the National League batting title last season, Morneau said he\u2019s been able to find his swing, but hurdles remain on his comeback.\nJustin Morneau peered through the batting cage at Coors Field on Friday like he was just another player.\nThe Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season."}
