Pat Toomey appeared in Philadelphia Monday to voice his opposition to the sanctuary city policies Mayor Jim Kenney has championed.\n\nWhile that stance lines up with Trump\u2019s rhetoric, Toomey has not endorsed the presumptive GOP nominee, and authored a Philadelphia Inquirer op-ed Sunday calling him \u201cnot my first, second, or third choice.\u201d He also criticized the business tycoon and reality TV host, writing that his \u201cvulgarity, particularly towards women, is appalling.\u201d\n\nBut Toomey struck a somewhat more conciliatory tone at Monday\u2019s news conference, noting that he agreed with Trump in certain areas \u2014 specifically repealing Obamacare and \u201csimplifying\u201d the tax code.\n\n\u201cHe's got a lot of work to do to unite the Republican Party and win the presidential election,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nRELATED: State rep.: I was 'ambushed' by immigration activists\n\nThe op-ed came as the campaign of Toomey\u2019s opponent, Democrat Kate McGinty, a former state director of environmental protection, has begun trying to associate him, in voter's minds, with Donald Trump \u2014 referring to his campaign as the \u201cTrump-Toomey\u201d ticket.\n\nRegardless of whether Toomey sees differences between Trump and himself, he was in town to pitch his bill to cut off some federal funding to sanctuary cities like Philadelphia. Trump has also been intensely critical of sanctuary city policies, and his stark stances on immigration \u2014 including a temporary ban of all new Muslims \u2014 have polled well among Republican voters.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia has one of the most extreme sanctuary city policies in America,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nToomey called the policy an example of \u201cpoliticians in a misguided way overriding the judgment of the law enforcement community.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe that the vast majority of Philadelphia police officers believe Philadelphia should not be a sanctuary city,\u201d Toomey said. He said that opinion is based on \u201cnumerous conversations\u201d with members of law enforcement.\n\nRELATED: State rep defends anti-sanctuary city bill against accusation of 'hate'\n\nToomey\u2019s words came just days after Kenney met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who personally asked Kenney to reinstate limited police cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Kenney refused.\n\nFormer Mayor Michael Nutter originally instituted Philly\u2019s sanctuary city policy, meaning local police are directed to not alert federal Immigrations & Customs Enforcement (ICE) when an illegal immigrant is arrested, and to not follow \u201cdetainer holds\u201d from ICE requesting individuals be held in detention.\n\nNutter changed the policy just before leaving office to match new ICE guidelines, allowing cooperation involving individuals convicted of violent crimes or suspected of gang involvement or terrorism activity, a move that prompted criticism from immigrant advocacy groups. Kenney undid that change on his first day in office.\n\n\u201cMayor Kenney refused to modify Philadelphia\u2019s sanctuary city status even just to that very modest degree,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nToomey was joined by state Rep. Martina White, a Republican who represents parts of Northeast Philly and has taken intense flack for her legislation to end the city\u2019s sanctuary city status. Her bill would also make the city \u201cliable\u201d for any crimes or damages committed by illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cI believe the safety of American citizens should be our number-one priority,\u201d White said. \u201cIt is just too dangerous to allow this policy to continue.\u201d\n\nNew Sanctuary Movement (NSM), an immigrant advocacy group that has argued sanctuary city policies make Philly safer by encouraging undocumented residents to contact and cooperate with local police, decried Toomey\u2019s statements.\n\n\u201cIf Philadelphia stops being a sanctuary city, we will not feel safe to leave our homes, or to live a normal life,\u201d said Estela Hernandez, an undocumented mother, Catholic and NSM leader, in a statement on Monday. \u201cWe will be very afraid. If Senator Toomey is Catholic, he should give people a second chance. He should put himself in our shoes, to understand our sufferings, and should know we love our kids the same as he loves his kids.\u201d\n\nBut Toomey cited the death of San Francisco woman Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had previously been arrested and released by San Francisco police under that city\u2019s sanctuary city status, as an example of the dangers of the policy.\n\nHe also mentioned the case of Alberto Suarez, an illegal immigrant who allegedly grabbed a woman off the street at 8th and Race streets in 2010 and raped her against the wall of a nearby SEPTA station. Suarez is also charged with previously raping a Montgomery County teenager, and a Pittsburgh woman. The FBI tracked Suarez down in Mexico, where he was arrested in 2014.\n\nToomey said the sanctuary city policy meant in Philadelphia someone like Suarez, or someone suspected of links to terrorism, would essentially be protected from immigration authorities.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia\u2019s response is, \u2018No thanks, we\u2019ll release him, come back after he\u2019s committed a crime,\u2019\u201d Toomey said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too dangerous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gearing up for a re-election campaign during a presidential race badly shaken up by Donald Trump, U.S. Sen.
