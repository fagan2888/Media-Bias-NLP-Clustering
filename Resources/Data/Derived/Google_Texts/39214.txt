World news photos: Monster truck kills 8; nearly nude Obamacare and more

Despite the ongoing shutdown of the U.S. federal government over Obamacare, one group in Denver found a cheeky way of getting the word out that health exchanges and Medicaid expansion were up and running … more or less.

The Associated Press reports that “promoters and health insurers fanned out with multimedia ads to encourage sign-ups. Colorado HealthOP, a consumer-run cooperative selling insurance plans on the exchange, sent models in skimpy clothing — and sporting signs with information — to greet Denver's 16th Street Mall lunch crowds.”

Washington state’s health exchange site hit a snag right off due to a software issue and Colorado’s was out of commission for a time because of a barrage of applicants.

Tragedy struck in Mexico on Saturday, The Associated Press reports, "when an out-of-control monster truck shot into a crowd of spectators at a Mexican air show, killing at least eight people and hurting 80 others, dozens seriously.

Carlos Gonzalez, spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, said the driver appeared to have lost control of the truck after leaping over cars it was crushing during a demonstration at the "Extreme Aeroshow" on Saturday. Video taken by a spectator and provided to The Associated Press shows the truck making an initial pass over two cars, then making a second pass at higher speed, coming down sharply nose-first and bouncing violently before piling straight into the crowd, which stood directly in the path of the monster truck, unprotected by any wall or barrier.
