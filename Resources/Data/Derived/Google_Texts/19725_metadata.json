The skinny: This bugger would expand federal cradle-to-grave surveillance of we, the people, and further centralize our already micromanaged economy. And Rep. Paul Ryan, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Rep. Mia Love are leading cosponsors. Jigga what?\n\nA \u201cunit record\u201d system is basically a one-stop, portable data profile of every person who enters higher education. The idea is to make it easier for government to track, and eventually influence, who enters what field of study and subsequent career. To justify this monstrosity, the press release from Love and Co. echoes widespread complaints about how a college degree (and its accompanying debt) doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to a job that can help students pay off that debt as comfortably as they\u2019d like. We\u2019ve all heard that, right?\n\nEarlier this year, for example, President Obama said, while promoting job and manufacturing training: \u201c[A] lot of young people no longer see the trades and skilled manufacturing as a viable career. But I promise you, folks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree.\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott recently encapsulated the general Republican view: \u201cIf I\u2019m going to take money from a citizen to put into education then I\u2019m going to take that money to create jobs. So I want that money to go to degrees where people can get jobs in this state. Is it a vital interest of the state to have more anthropologists? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe Federalist recently explored what\u2019s philosophically wrong with these views when Gov. Scott Walker demanded earlier this year that Wisconsin universities focus more on output and workforce preparation. For the record, I\u2019m in the Peter Lawler camp of \u201ceducation is about way more than generating robots to push buttons in the economy so politicians have more tax dollars to waste on further engineering society into oblivion.\u201d But since he thought through the underlying ideas better than I can, just go read his article. Here, let\u2019s discuss the political problem with a unit-record system as a potential solution to the very real problem that America\u2019s higher-education system is certainly consuming millions if not billions of dollars that never benefit the individuals using them, let alone the rest of us, who provide them.\n\nWhat Is a Unit-Record System? The Student Right to Know Before You Go Act of 2015 would eliminate the federal ban on a unit-record system and demand that colleges send the federal government more information about students so federal bureaucrats can connect and expand several existing government and private data systems. The idea is to track kids through college and into the workforce to find what majors in what schools lead to what jobs and incomes. But that\u2019s not the half of it.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about accelerating the already-in-progress federal surveillance system over education and the economy. The text of the bill indicates that the U.S. Education Secretary can tap whatever agencies he wants to mix and match this data. Smooth\u2014if one is all aboard with letting unelected bureaucrats control what information the feds collect about American citizens who, remember, are supposed to boss government, not get bossed by it. Previous iterations of unit-record proposals have included these agencies and databases: federal student loans; the federal college student registry (IPEDS, in which all full-time students who attend colleges that accept federal funds are already tracked); K-12 data systems the Obama administration has paid every state to expand and link other non-education state and federal agencies, including social services, employment, health, and criminal justice; and income monitoring agencies such as the Social Security Administration and U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nSo we\u2019re really not talking merely about letting people know that 82 percent of people who major in economics at Whatever College are employed in their field within two years and earning an average of $67,000 after ten. (Which, by the way, colleges can tell prospective students already and have been able to do for decades using this little, voluntary thing called \u201calumni surveys.\u201d) We\u2019re talking about accelerating the already-in-progress (PDF) federal surveillance system over education and the economy.\n\nFrank Balz of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities summarizes the enduring opposition to a unit-record system: \u201cthe act of enrolling in college, even if for a single course, should not require permanent entry into a federal registry. No proposals allow individuals either to opt into or out of the data base, or even to be informed of its existence. Postsecondary institutions also have the legitimate concern that the existence of such a massive registry will prove irresistible to future demands for use and expansion beyond educational purposes.\u201d\n\nWhat I Do With My Degree Is My Business The bottom line is that a unit-record system is an unacceptable trade of crucial liberties for a convenience that is available through entirely non-coercive means. There is no justification for enabling federal administrators to create comprehensive dossiers on American citizens detailing our entire education, social, and economic history (down to that first-quarter history quiz grade in fifth grade and records of our ability to pee properly in preschool). It\u2019s just none of their damn business. Ever.\n\nThere is no justification for enabling federal administrators to create comprehensive dossiers on American citizens, including our ability to pee properly in preschool. If I want to get a degree in anthropology and follow it by spending the rest of my life building earthen houses by hand and composting my own poo, it\u2019s none of their damn business, either. \u201cI am the master of my fate, / I am the captain of my soul.\u201d (Sentiments brought to you courtesy of my \u201cuseless\u201d but so far quite lucrative English major.) It\u2019s the Chinese government that keeps detailed dossiers on all its citizens, which furthers its policy of economic and social planning and enforces citizen compliance. In America, we\u2019re supposed to do things differently. Government doesn\u2019t mind our business. We mind our own business, and our own business includes government.\n\nSo why do \u201ceven Republicans\u201d think what people choose to do in college or the workplace is their business? They\u2019ve accepted the premises of the permanent welfare state, in which we are all on the government dole and therefore all subject to the same insulting paternalism and privacy invasion as welfare queens. Think back to Rick Scott: \u201cIf I\u2019m going to take money from a citizen to put into education then I\u2019m going to take that money to create jobs.\u201d Since when is it government\u2019s business to create jobs? Government can only destroy jobs. It can\u2019t create them. Individuals create jobs\u2014when government doesn\u2019t ban them, regulate them into insanity, or tax them to redistribute the fruits of their labor to people it\u2019s decided to prioritize instead.\n\nThis is markets 101, people. Scott\u2019s essentially espousing Keynsianism, the insane idea that the way to boost the economy is to take money from productive people, filter it through a pile of bureaucrats, and redistribute the remainder to privileged populations. And nobody calls him on it because we\u2019re all swimming in the same water. We\u2019re hoping he and our other political demigods will deign to designate us a privileged population instead of telling them to cut it the heck out and let people rise or fall by their own efforts.\n\nWhat Problem Is a Unit-Record System Trying to Solve? So the real question is: Why is federal pressure necessary to make colleges do something that is clearly in potential college-goers\u2019 self-interest? The simple answer is, a critical mass of college goers don\u2019t think examining the value-added of a particular degree is important. It sounds crazy, but there\u2019s no other explanation. If enough people attending college demanded to know what was in it for them economically, colleges would provide that information (just as some already do), because they\u2019d have to do so to keep enrollment and thus dollars. This is also econ 101.\n\nSo what\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m going to argue for several converging problems. Feel welcome to suggest more in the comments.\n\nAnyone who has a pulse can get into community college, and therefore anyone with a pulse can get your tax dollars to pay for it. There\u2019s always the possibility that America\u2019s undergraduates are more concerned with enlarging and beautifying their souls than they are with making money. Excuse me while I wipe blinding tears of laughter from my eyes. So, next: Most college students receive federal money, as loans, grants, or both. This means they\u2019re wagering with other people\u2019s money, not their own, or even their family\u2019s.\n\nWe all know that how we spend other people\u2019s money is radically different than how we will spend our own. Congress is perhaps the most trenchant example of this. And the Obama administration has done a lot to pin even more student debt to taxpayers, thus expanding moral hazard (e.g., loose spending of easy money from other people). We\u2019re talking debt \u201cforgiveness\u201d to the tune of an estimated $14 billion per year just for one program. This is just plain fiscal madness.\n\nSecond, federal subsidies go to students regardless of their academic track record. Anyone who has a pulse can get into community college, and therefore anyone with a pulse can get your tax dollars to pay for it. Estimates say the college graduation rate for recipients of the federal Pell Grant, which is intended for low-income families but actually makes its way to many middle-income families, is 40 percent. Yes, two-thirds of kids getting your money through this program never net a degree (and it\u2019s well demonstrated that dropping out before getting a degree results in essentially no economic benefits). This is more madness. The reason why should be obvious, but if you need a hint here\u2019s a picture of who should not be eligible for money forced from working people\u2019s pockets:\n\nThe third converging factor is our society\u2019s cruel insistence that college is the only potential path to a career, despite reams of evidence this isn\u2019t true. We all just assume that a college degree will result in a desirable job. People don\u2019t typically feel the need to prove what everyone around them assumes is a self-evident truth. Given that this is not true, as admitted unit-record system proponents (remember, it\u2019s their major justification for making this sweeping change), it\u2019s a cruel illusion to perpetuate. But leaders up to and including President Obama continue to do so.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 26 May 2015 07:18:29 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Congressional GOP leaders need to stop drinking the planned economy Kool-Aid, because it's leading us another step closer to China's surveillance state.", "title": "Surveillance Isn't The Solution To America's College Woes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_187628540.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-28T07:42:10+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/05/26/surveillance-isnt-the-solution-to-americas-college-woes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Congressional GOP leaders need to stop drinking the planned economy Kool-Aid, because it's leading us another step closer to China's surveillance state.", "title": "Surveillance Isn't The Solution To America's College Woes", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_187628540.jpg"}, "creator": "@JoyPullmann", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Education", "tag": "data collection,higher education,Marco Rubio,Mia Love,Paul Ryan,student data,unit record system", "published_time": "2015-05-26T07:18:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T07:42:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Congressional GOP leaders need to stop drinking the planned economy Kool-Aid, because it's leading us another step closer to China's surveillance state."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca840\"", "article_summary": "We all just assume that a college degree will result in a desirable job.\nSo, next: Most college students receive federal money, as loans, grants, or both.\nGiven that this is not true, as admitted unit-record system proponents (remember, it\u2019s their major justification for making this sweeping change), it\u2019s a cruel illusion to perpetuate.\nWhat Is a Unit-Record System?\nWhat Problem Is a Unit-Record System Trying to Solve?"}
