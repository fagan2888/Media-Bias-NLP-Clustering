Degree to CEO of One of America\u2019s Fastest-Growing Companies\n\nWhen John Millett enrolled in Santa Fe College\u2019s Nuclear Medicine Technology program, he did not intend to start his own mobile cardiac imaging business.\n\n\u201cI thought I would take a job in a lab,\u201d says Millett, now the owner and president of Nuclear Medicine Professionals, Inc. (NMPI), which is based out of Gainesville, Florida. \u201cI moved from Tampa to go to Santa Fe College because it has one of the best nuclear medicine programs in the country. I needed a career that would give me a good return on my college investment. Dollar for dollar, my Associate of Science degree has been a solid investment.\u201d\n\nMillett\u2019s original ambition was to become a pediatrician, but that changed when he took a tour of UF Health Shands Hospital.\n\n\u201cI took a tour at Shands Hospital, and when I walked into the Nuclear Medicine Lab, they were doing a bone scan on a patient and it looked like something from the future,\u201d Millett said. \u201cI fell in love with the field.\u201d\n\nNuclear medicine is a branch of medical imaging that uses small amounts of low-level radioactive material to diagnose diseases and determine their severity. Nuclear medicine technologists help doctors and patients by providing therapy, analyzing biologic specimens and creating images of body organs.\n\nHard work reaps rewards\n\nMillett, motivated by his family responsibilities, was driven to be a top performer in the nuclear program at Santa Fe College. As he neared the end of his two-year program, he started making calls to people in Florida with a radioactive materials license looking for work. His tenacity was rewarded.\n\n\u201cI graduated on Friday and went to work on Monday at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was another job opening when I was hired so I recommended one of my classmates for the other position. The person who hired me said, \u2018If she\u2019s a Santa Fe College graduate, she must be good.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter graduation Millett was awarded the Palm Dohr Scholarship and had the honor of traveling to Sweden to study nuclear cardiology under Dr. Olle Palm at the University of Lund, one of Europe\u2019s oldest institutions. For the next four years, Millett would spend time working for a hospital, a mobile provider, an imaging clinic and a nuclear pharmacy.\n\nSeeking new opportunities, Millett recognized the severe shortage of technologists and decided to start his own staffing company, Nuclear Medicine Professionals, Inc. At first, Millett hired himself out as a private contractor but was soon able to begin hiring other trained technologists to provide staffing for labs, hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices throughout Florida.\n\nMillett continued to keep track of the ups and downs in the market for nuclear medicine and eventually decided to evolve his company into the full-service nuclear imaging provider that it is today. With this new service option, a physician or hospital needs only to sign up for the service, schedule and bill. NMPI handles the imaging, staffing, accreditation and all required licensures. Other services offered by NMPI include staffing, mobile imaging and lab management.\n\nNMPI takes flight\n\nMillett recalls building the first mobile nuclear lab to be a major challenge but says it paid off in the end. By 2007, NMPI had two trucks that could provide diagnostic imaging equipment at doctors\u2019 offices. With these setups, patients could be tested inside the trucks. Later that year at a trade show, Millett met an entrepreneur who was developing a small-footprint, dedicated nuclear cardiac camera. Together with the entrepreneur, Millett helped design what are now the mobile imaging cameras used by NMPI. Nine months later, Nuclear Medicine Professionals purchased the first two mobile cameras built to Millett\u2019s specifications.\n\n\u201cWith the ability to bring the nuclear cameras into the physician\u2019s office, demand for our service skyrocketed,\u201d Millett said.\n\nINC. Magazine took note of NMPI\u2019s success, naming it one of America\u2019s fastest-growing private companies for four consecutive years (2009-2012). Mercedes-Benz was also impressed, noticing NMPI\u2019s adaptation of their Sprinter vans for medical health care delivery and showcased NMPI in their Sprinter ad campaign.\n\nWith mobile imaging, the future is now\n\n\u201cWe had to do a lot of innovating because most of what we do has never been done before,\u201d Millett explained. \u201cThe result is an affordable means to provide extremely sensitive in-office cardiac imaging allowing physicians to provide these services at their office, lab or healthcare facility for a fraction of what it would normally cost. Our services are ideal for population health.\u201d\n\nAccording to Millett, the biggest challenge for mobile imaging providers today is getting physicians to fully understand the benefits of these services under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMore and more doctors will be called upon to do in-office testing because the way they are being paid is changing,\u201d he explained. \u201cInstead of getting paid a fee for service, doctors will be paid according to how many patients they treat successfully. With our service, physicians are able to reduce costs and offer testing that they otherwise would not be able to afford for their patients.\u201d\n\nHis proudest accomplishment to date, Millett said, is receiving U.S. and Canadian patents for his Mobile Cardiac Positron Emission Tomography (moPET) Camera. This design will give physicians and technologists a more sensitive, useful and diagnostic tool. While the production of the moPET is still pending the necessary funding, Millett believes his invention and the ability to provide mobile PET imaging will be the next big advancement in the nuclear cardiology field.\n\nSanta Fe College is an incubator for success\n\nMillett credits Santa Fe College for contributing to his success. And, he knows firsthand the high level of education SF students receive. In fact, all of Millett\u2019s current employees are Santa Fe College graduates.\n\n\u201cThe quality of instructors at Santa Fe College is phenomenal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe classes are small, and the professors are always available.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for his advice to nuclear medicine technologists in training, Millett was quick to respond.\n\n\u201cPut in the effort, and don\u2019t be satisfied with just getting by,\u201d Millett said. \u201cKeep on top of how the nuclear medicine field is changing, what the doctors and hospitals are doing, and what\u2019s going on with the equipment. Our field is still in its infancy, don\u2019t be afraid to invent a solution to a problem.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Santa Fe College Health Sciences programs at our Health Sciences Web page.\n\nAbout NMPI\n\nNuclear Medicine Professionals, Inc. (NMPI) provides simple equipment and staff leases, which allow physicians to offer cardiac stress tests in their offices, eliminating the need to refer patients to physicians outside of the practice. This, in turn, allows for greater continuity of care for patients and dramatically increased positive health outcomes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Today at Santa Fe", "description": "When John Millett enrolled in Santa Fe College\u2019s Nuclear Medicine Technology program, he did not intend to start his own mobile cardiac imaging business. \u201cI thought I would take a job in a lab,\u201d sa...", "title": "John Millett:  From A.S.
