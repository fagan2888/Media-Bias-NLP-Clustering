Jason Stephens said at least 100 people, as many as 200, were at the scene when officers arrived. Officers found a 22-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the leg. He was taken by private vehicle to St. Joseph Hospital and was later taken to St. Francis. He is currently listed in serious but stable condition.\n\nPolice determined that partygoers had become upset when the festivities ended. As they were leaving, one man pulled a gun and began firing, Sgt. Ron Hunt said. A second man then fired back at the suspect. The man who was shot in the leg was a bystander, Hunt said.\n\n\"Another victim was in the same vehicle,\" Stephens said, \"and fell out of the back of the pickup truck as they were leaving.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old woman was taken to a nearby hospital with minor head injuries. She is currently in stable condition.\n\nPolice say a 21-year-old man reported that his car had been damaged by the gunfire but he was not injured.\n\nPolice believe there could be other victims who haven't yet come forward.
