Victims\u2019 families issue primal cries for regulation of these deadly weapons and gun activists respond by waving the Constitution and declaring their \u201cfundamental right\u201d to bear arms is sacrosanct. Indeed, such right-wing luminaries as Joe the plumber, who not long ago shared the stage with the Republican nominees for president and vice president, said explicitly:\n\n\u201cYour dead kids don\u2019t trump my constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nIowa Republican Senate candidate Jodi Ernst, known for her violent campaign ads in which she is seen shooting guns and promising to \u201cunload\u201d on Obamacare, had this to say when asked about Isla Vista:\n\n\u201cThis unfortunate accident happened after the ad, but it does highlight that I want to get rid of, repeal, and replace [opponent] Bruce Braley\u2019s Obamacare. And it also shows that I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. That is a fundamental right.\u201d\n\nThis argument is set forth by gun proliferation advocates as if it has been understood this way from the beginning of the republic. Indeed, \u201cfundamental right to bear arms\u201d is often spat at gun regulation advocates as if they have heard it from the mouths of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson themselves. But what none of them seem to acknowledge (or, more likely, know) is that this particular legal interpretation of the Second Amendment was validated by the Supreme Court all the way back in \u2026 2008. That\u2019s right. It was only six years ago that the Supreme Court ruled (in a 5-4 decision with the conservatives in the majority, naturally) that there was a \u201cright to bear arms\u201d as these people insist has been true for over two centuries. And even then it isn\u2019t nearly as expansive as these folks like to pretend.\n\nFor instance, that gun-grabbing hippie Justice Antonin Scalia went out of his way in that decision to say that beyond the holding of handguns in the home for self-defense, regulations of firearms remained the purview of the state and so too was conduct. He wrote that regulating the use of concealed weapons or barring the use of weapons in certain places or restricting commercial use are permitted. That\u2019s Antonin Scalia, well known to be at the far-right end of the legal spectrum on this issue. Most judges had always had a much more limited interpretation of the amendment.\n\nJustice John Paul Stephens discussed his long experience with Second Amendment jurisprudence in his book \u201cSix Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution,\u201d and notes that when he came on the Supreme Court there was literally no debate among the justices, conservative or liberal, over the idea that the Second Amendment constituted a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to bear arms. Precedents going all the way back to the beginning of the republic had held that the state had an interest in regulating weapons and never once in all its years had declared a \u201cfundamental right\u201d in this regard.\n\nSo, what happened? Well, the NRA happened. Or more specifically, a change in leadership in the NRA happened. After all, the NRA had long been a benign sportsman\u2019s organization devoted to hunting and gun safety. It wasn\u2019t until 1977, that a group of radicals led by activists from the Second Amendment Foundation and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms took control and changed the direction of the group to one dedicated to making the Second Amendment into a \u201cfundamental right.\u201d\n\nWhat had been a fringe ideology was then systematically mainstreamed by the NRA, a program that prompted the retired arch conservative Chief Justice Warren Burger to say that the Second Amendment:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The notion that the framers meant for every nut to have unlimited guns is a sham.
