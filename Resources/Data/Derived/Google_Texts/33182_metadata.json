(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\n4057494\n\nObamacare\u2019s secret numbers are leaking out, and they\u2019re looking very red.\n\nSeven states and the District of Columbia have released age data, showing that only one-in-five, or 22 percent, of their new signs-ups are the much-desired, profit-generating younger people, dubbed \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d according to a calculation by Reuters.\n\nThat 22 percent is barely half the 38 percent target sought by the administration.\n\nWithout enough young healthy people paying extra dollars into the system, the nation\u2019s insurance companies will bleed red as they pay for the many older and sicker people who have rushed to sign up for the government-directed insurance.\n\nIn turn, the companies will ask the White House for a huge financial bailout, which will likely be unpopular, especially among likely voters.\n\nThe companies will also be under intense pressure to spike their requests for 2015 price increases during the 2014 summer.\n\nEither eventuality will drop a political anvil on Democrats and President Barack Obama in the run-up to the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nBut the bailout may not be as expensive as feared because fewer than expected people have signed up for Obamacare.\n\nBy the end of December, only 2.1 million people had signed up for the government network, far below the December target of 3 million. Administration officials hope to sign seven million people up by the end of March.\n\nAdministration officials claim that six million people have enrolled in Obamacare, but that claim includes four million people who were notified they are eligible for Medicare. But those notifications include many eligible people who could have signed up for Medicare even without the Medicare expansion included in Obamacare in 2010.\n\nThe number of Obamacare-enabled signups for Medicare may be as few as 380,000, according to a recent analysis by RealClearPolitics. \u201cAs more people utilize the exchanges, we\u2019ll see increasing numbers of \u201cObamacare Recipients\u201d entering the system \u2026 for right now, the \u20184 million enrollees\u2019 number looks like a significant exaggeration,\u201d said the RCP report.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Only half the expected number of young people have signed up", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare's secret numbers are leaking out, and they're looking very red.
