Now Carson is trying to parlay his adoration among conservatives and tea party groups into a run for president, announcing Tuesday that he formed an exploratory committee, a precursor to a White House bid. But while Carson enjoys strong grassroots support, he faces a number of obstacles should he pursue a presidential campaign.\n\nCarson, who at 33 years old became the head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, is known politically for his oratory skills and railing against the Affordable Care Act. His name is often among the top five in the latest polls out of about a dozen possible 2016 GOP presidential candidates.\n\nBut Carson\u2019s ability to energize crowds comes with liabilities. For one thing, he\u2019s gaffe-prone. He compared Obamacare to slavery. On Wednesday, he said he believes that being gay is a choice, because there\u2019s no other explanation for why some people enter prison straight and come out gay.\n\nPhoto: Reuters\n\nAnd while Carson, 63, has loyal supporters, he doesn\u2019t have seasoned campaign operatives for a grueling campaign, according to Katie Packer Gage, a Republican political consultant with Burning Glass Consulting who served as deputy campaign manager for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cI think that he is a very inspirational speaker and he is very clearly a smart person, and so he\u2019s able to communicate his message in a very appealing way. But I think something we\u2019ve learned over time is that it takes more than that to win a presidential campaign, and I don\u2019t see him having other pieces in place that will make him long term a particularly viable option,\u201d Gage said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have a team around him to protect him from gaffes and missteps and misstating policy positions.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nTo that point, Carson is set to tap Terry Giles, a Houston-based lawyer whose past clients include Richard Pryor (after the comedian set himself on fire during a cocaine binge in 1980) and a teacher who claimed to have an affair with Monica Lewinsky, as his campaign manager, according to Politico and the Texas Tribune.\n\nMeanwhile, Carson has ambitious goals of raising $130 million for his campaign and taking the largest share of the general election popular vote since Ronald Reagan\u2019s 55 percent in 1984, according to Politico. Gage said that\u2019s unrealistic for a political newcomer with no donor network. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s like rubbing a magic lamp or wishing upon a star, but that\u2019ll be a tough thing for [potential 2016 GOP candidate] Jeb Bush, and he has most of the high-level bundlers with him,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother problem for Carson is that he\u2019s a one-issue candidate; he is a respected voice on health care but little else. \u201cThere does come a time in a campaign where it becomes more than just getting a crowd off its feet. It always does become more important on the presidential stage because when push comes to shove, you can\u2019t run the country focusing on just one issue. You have to be well versed and have a grasp of a really broad range of issues,\u201d Gage said. \u201cHe certainly knows a lot about Obamacare, but he doesn\u2019t have the breadth and depth of issues to carry him in the long term,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore his National Prayer Breakfast speech, Carson was known for his inspiring story emerging from poverty in inner-city Detroit, Michigan, to a renowned neurosurgeon who became the first doctor to successfully separate conjoined twins at the head. That success made him a role model, especially in the black community. But his story won\u2019t translate into crossover appeal with both tea party voters and African-Americans because blacks will separate his personal experience from his political positions, according to Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\u201cIn terms of his life story and overcoming poverty and becoming a world-class neurosurgeon \u2026 I think that that part of his legacy is always going to be there,\u201d Gillespie said. But \u201cBen Carson as a political figure is entirely different, and the audience that is attracted to him as a political figure, that constituency is different from the constituency that\u2019s heard the story. Ben Carson has not had broad appeal as a potential presidential candidate in the African-American community,\u201d she added.\n\nPart of the reason blacks aren\u2019t enthralled by a potential Carson campaign is because he\u2019s not viewed as a realistic presidential nominee, Gillespie said. She noted that in 2007 blacks were reluctant to support then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D.-Ill., until he proved he was viable with a win in the Iowa caucuses, a Midwestern state that is roughly 93 percent white.\n\n\u201cWhile Carson has done well in some of these early straw polls, we\u2019re still a year away from early primaries. I think most people don\u2019t realistically think he\u2019s got a serious chance for the Republican nomination for president,\u201d Gillespie said, before adding, \u201cAfrican-Americans have often shied away from political candidates that they didn\u2019t think were viable.\u201d\n\nGillespie said Carson\u2019s campaign is comparable with that of 2012 GOP candidate Herman Cain, who, like Carson, is black, had tea party support and was a political neophyte. But as a former CEO, Cain was at least listened to on economic issues in a way that Carson will be ignored -- and it still didn\u2019t lead Cain to the GOP nomination or broad support among blacks. \u201cEven somebody like Herman Cain appeared to do more outreach in African-American communities, and his presidential candidacy was not successful, so the idea that African-Americans would be drawn to Republican primaries and to the Republican Party in 2016 because of Ben Carson suggests that\u2019s not the case,\u201d she said.\n\nGage said the fairer comparisons are the 2012 candidacies of Donald Trump, Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry, who all had brief moments in the sun before flaming out. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of candidates that excite the grassroots and talk about what the grassroots are thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately people will be given pause, and he\u2019ll ultimately be a flash in the pan,\u201d she conceded.\n\nCarson not having held elected office may be an attractive quality to voters disgusted with Washington, D.C., but candidates with campaign experience will be able to pounce on the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s vulnerabilities, according to Gage.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a campaign against this guy yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThe minute he becomes a very serious contender, the hordes of opposition researchers are going to dig up the things that make him a wrong choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ben carson, ben carson 2016, ben carson president, ben carson for president, can ben carson win in 2016, ben carson republican primary, ben carson republican primary 2016, gop candidates 2016, republican candidates 2016, ben carson tea party, carson", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is adored by the tea party, but he faces a number of obstacles in a potential run for president.", "title": "Ben Carson 2016 President: Is The Retired Neurosurgeon And Tea Party Darling A Viable Candidate?", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ben-carson-2016-president-retired-neurosurgeon-tea-party-darling-viable-candidate-1836174", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/03/04/ben-carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is adored by the tea party, but he faces a number of obstacles in a potential run for president.", "title": "Ben Carson 2016 President: Is The Retired Neurosurgeon And Tea Party Darling A Viable Candidate?", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ben-carson-2016-president-retired-neurosurgeon-tea-party-darling-viable-candidate-1836174", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/03/04/ben-carson.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/03/04/ben-carson.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-03-04T15:30:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-04T16:23:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is adored by the tea party, but he faces a number of obstacles in a potential run for president."}, "article_summary": "His name is often among the top five in the latest polls out of about a dozen possible 2016 GOP presidential candidates.\nBut while Carson enjoys strong grassroots support, he faces a number of obstacles should he pursue a presidential campaign.\nAnother problem for Carson is that he\u2019s a one-issue candidate; he is a respected voice on health care but little else.\nPart of the reason blacks aren\u2019t enthralled by a potential Carson campaign is because he\u2019s not viewed as a realistic presidential nominee, Gillespie said.\nBen Carson has not had broad appeal as a potential presidential candidate in the African-American community,\u201d she added."}
