The video is about 6 mins.\n\nOriginal release date was March 19, 2014 and original writeup is below.\n\n\"This isn't just a second amendment issue, it's not just a firearms issue. It's an issue of an overreaching government that wants to come into your kitchen, that wants to come into your living room, and just see what you're doing,\" says Dimitrios Karras, CEO of Ares Armor in Oceanside, Calif.\n\nLast week, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) raided Ares Armor to confiscate 80 percent polymer receivers for AR-15s. These receivers are the lower part of the gun that contain the trigger operations when fully completed. The polymer version that the ATF is contesting is not completed and requires the purchasers to finish machining it. The ATF claimed that these are unlicensed firearms, but Karras says otherwise.\n\n\"It's an object that's in the shape of a receiver, but it hasn't been completed to a point that it would be considered a firearm,\" says Karras. \"This was a nice way for them to get their arm inside of the business and grab the information that they are actually looking for. To think that this is over a piece of plastic is ludicrous.\"\n\nKarras says the true reason for the ATF's piqued interest in his shop was his refusal to relinquish the list of customers who had purchased the polymer product. He sat down with Reason TV's Tracy Oppenheimer to discuss why he plans to continue fighting the ATF to maintain his customers' privacy and other Constitutional issues at stake.\n\n\"They have trampled on the entire Bill of Rights,\" Karras says.\n\nAbout six minutes.\n\nProduced by Tracy Oppenheimer.
