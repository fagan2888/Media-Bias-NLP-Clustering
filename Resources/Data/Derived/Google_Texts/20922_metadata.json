The primary care offices in Camden, N.J., have access to some of the most sophisticated patient data in the country.\n\nThey can track many of their sickest and most expensive patients across the city\u2019s healthcare system, which gives them a better handle on the kind of primary care that will keep them out of the hospital.\n\nBut the efforts of the Urban Health Institute \u2013 one primary care office in the city \u2013 show why for all of data\u2019s promise there are real world limits.\n\nEvery morning, a team of nurses, social workers, and healthcare coordinators reviews the patient data that pours in from the city\u2019s three hospitals. If one of their patients has been admitted, they\u2019ll go to that patient\u2019s bedside to set up a primary care appointment.\n\nTo do list - Jessica Kourkounis\n\nStudies show hospital readmissions drop if a patient gets primary care follow-up within seven days of discharge. One of the biggest tests for the healthcare system is how well doctors and hospitals find ways to respond to the lives the data reveals.\n\nUHI\u2019s Amy Kaplan says while the data leads right where she needs do go, she doesn\u2019t know who she\u2019ll find in that room.\n\n\u201cA majority of the encounters [with patients] are not simply: you go in, the phone number is correct, you make the appointment, you leave.\u201d\n\nOften, she says, \u201cit takes digging around, and that takes time.\u201d\n\nMany patients are what are called \u201cpoor historians\": folks who aren\u2019t sure which medications they are taking, the name of their doctor, or even their home address. Other patients don\u2019t have phones or are only able to occasionally borrow a neighbor\u2019s phone.\n\nMarcia Johnson (left) and her team of nurses and health workers at the Urban Health Institute - Jessica Kourkounis\n\nOne morning a few weeks ago, the team discussed the case of a patient with a leg wound that required a refrigerated antibiotic. The problem: he\u2019s homeless, so he has no refrigerator.\n\nThe solution was to send a homecare nurse to meet him on a street corner a few times a week.\n\nThe nurses in the meeting agreed that solution only delayed the inevitable: the guy back in the hospital.\n\nSocial worker Marcia Johnson, who oversees the UHI team, knows no amount of data or well-meaning efforts from her staff gets this patient a stable life so he can recover.\n\n\u201cWe sit and have these conversations and just kind of think through it,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cHealthcare doesn\u2019t know how to solve some of these problems.\u201d\n\nAnd while the efforts to help the nearly homeless patient are wholly inadequate to solve all of his problems, it\u2019s a start. It used to be the case that these kinds of patients would just disappear after leaving the hospital.\n\nThanks to the data they\u2019ve gone from invisible to visible.\n\nThis ongoing series on healthcare and data is produced in partnership with Healthy States.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/06/13/health-care/diagnosis-data/data-opens-doors-healthcare-then-what", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/bed.PNG?itok=lsBpB2qo", "type": "article", "description": "A test for the healthcare system is how well providers respond to data.", "title": "Data opens doors in healthcare, but then what?"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "ZAIFp9mAXU+ai31Qp1Kn0Pc3BGBDaD6wCwqNNlY6cCVSAPxeoVL9Q34VDMelD0PfjKNLEhCzX5p705W8CRNOdQ==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa13\"", "article_summary": "The primary care offices in Camden, N.J., have access to some of the most sophisticated patient data in the country.\nEvery morning, a team of nurses, social workers, and healthcare coordinators reviews the patient data that pours in from the city\u2019s three hospitals.\nHealth worker Amy Kaplan meets with a patient bedside at Cooper University Hospital - Jessica KourkounisIn healthcare these days, data is king.\nThis ongoing series on healthcare and data is produced in partnership with Healthy States.\nIf one of their patients has been admitted, they\u2019ll go to that patient\u2019s bedside to set up a primary care appointment."}
