Imagine that you invested each year in the stocks the experts said to avoid. With such a strategy, you would have made three times as much money as you would have by investing in experts\u2019 top picks.\n\nThis is not some fluke of the digital era or the after-effects of the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nIn 1978, Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith claimed that General Motors was so dominant that it could no longer be constrained by either consumers or competitors. Galbraith, who served in four presidential administrations, believed that auto firms would never compete with each other because they shared a common interest in soaking the consumer by raising prices.\n\nThe nationally recognized expert also said that no other auto company would be foolish enough to take on GM. Why? \u201cEveryone knows that the survivor of such a contest would not be the aggressor but General Motors.\u201d\n\nThe auto giant\u2019s market share was a remarkable 46 percent at that point. It never again reached such lofty heights. In fact, GM\u2019s share of the market declined for 29 of the next 36 years, eventually leading it into bankruptcy and a government bailout. It went from selling 46 percent of all cars in 1978 to 35 percent a decade later, 29 percent a decade after that and just 17 percent in 2014.\n\nWhat happened? Apparently firms like Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai didn\u2019t read Galbraith\u2019s warning. In 1978, those firms had a combined 8 percent of U.S. auto sales. Within a decade, that share had doubled to 17 percent and has since doubled again to 35 percent. In several recent years, Toyota alone has sold more cars worldwide than GM.\n\nSo, as you listen to what all the experts predict for 2016, retain a healthy skepticism.\n\nThe reason is not because the experts are stupid. It\u2019s just that in a nation of more than 300 million people, there are far too many variables for any one person to predict.\n\nConsider the 2016 presidential race as a great example. Nobody really has any idea who will win at this point. Political experts weigh all the things that they believe are important \u2014 demographics, money, connections, etc. A year ago, these same things led many to believe Jeb Bush was the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn truth, the state of the economy will matter more than all the variables the political pundits are obsessing about. So will the level of terrorist activity and public perceptions of Obamacare. The reason we can\u2019t be sure who will win the election is because we can\u2019t be sure how any of these fundamentals will play out.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 SCOTT RASMUSSEN\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're in a season when experts and pundits like to make predictions about what will happen next year.\nBut an interesting column found at Marketwatch.com casts doubt on the value of those predictions....", "title": "2016 Forecast: The Experts Will Be Wrong | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/28/2016_forecast_the_experts_will_be_wrong_129141.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/337120_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "We're in a season when experts and pundits like to make predictions about what will happen next year.\nBut an interesting column found at Marketwatch.com casts doubt on the value of those predictions....", "title": "2016 Forecast: The Experts Will Be Wrong | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "2016 Forecast: The Experts Will Be Wrong | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Election 2016,"}, "article_summary": "So, as you listen to what all the experts predict for 2016, retain a healthy skepticism.\nImagine that you invested each year in the stocks the experts said to avoid.\nGalbraith, who served in four presidential administrations, believed that auto firms would never compete with each other because they shared a common interest in soaking the consumer by raising prices.\nWe're in a season when experts and pundits like to make predictions about what will happen next year.\nWith such a strategy, you would have made three times as much money as you would have by investing in experts\u2019 top picks."}
