But more action will be needed, he went on.\n\n\u201cI think we have no choice except to ultimately defeat radical Islamism. I think it is totally inadequate,\u201d he said of the House vote. \u201cBut I think it is the first step, in the right direction. There will be many more steps. It doesn\u2019t mean it has to be American forces on the ground. We need a new strategy for combat forces where we basically pay for other people, not ourselves. But we can get there. This was a step in that direction,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said.\n\nMr. DeLay, meanwhile, said in a separate interview that his support for the House vote \u2014 which authorizes funding to train and arm Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State \u2014 is tempered by his distrust of the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of torn between understanding that we\u2019re in a war on terror, that there\u2019s all kinds of groups, including ISIS, that we have to go after, and destroy, but at the same time I don\u2019t trust this president to do the right thing. So I\u2019m hoping that saner heads will prevail and I was hoping for a resolution that was an expression of the American people \u2014 what they want to see done \u2014 contrary to what the president seems not to be doing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Majority Leader Tom DeLay and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, leaders of the 1994 Republican-led revolution that swept through Congress, agreed in a recent interview that America needs to fight radical Islamism -- but neither were enthusiastic about the idea of President Obama leading that charge.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Former Majority Leader Tom DeLay and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, leaders of the 1994 Republican-led revolution that swept through Congress, agreed in a recent interview that America needs to fight radical Islamism \u2014 but neither were enthusiastic about the idea of President Obama leading that charge.", "title": "Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay lukewarm on arming Syrians, dubious Obama is up to the task", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/18/newt-gingrich-tom-delay-lukewarm-arming-syrians/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/08/conservatives-gingrich-jpeg-05fb9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/08/conservatives-gingrich-jpeg-05fb9.jpg", "description": "Former Majority Leader Tom DeLay and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, leaders of the 1994 Republican-led revolution that swept through Congress, agreed in a recent interview that America needs to fight r", "card": "summary", "title": "Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay lukewarm on arming Syrians, dubious Obama is"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
