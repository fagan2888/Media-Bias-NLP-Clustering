If you engage consumers too often, you risk waste, repetition and member abrasion. Too little engagement or reaching them via the wrong channel results in a failure to shape behaviors and improve outcomes. At this year's WHCC, Eliza will demonstrate how behavior-driven analytics and multichannel communication strategies make individual interventions more efficient and effective and help health plans close critical gaps in care.\"\n\nHealth Engagement Panels:\n\nIn today's healthcare landscape, reaching consumers is more difficult than ever before.
