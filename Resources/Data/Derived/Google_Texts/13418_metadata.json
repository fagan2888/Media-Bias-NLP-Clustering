But if Tax Day (that\u2019s April 18th this year) is bearing down on you and you\u2019re still putting off dong your taxes, the professionals have some recommendations.\n\nGet an extension. This is the nearly unanimous advice. If you think you\u2019re not going to be able to get your tax return in by the 18th, the IRS has information here about how to file for additional time to complete your tax return (which you can even do online). This buys you an extra six months to get your tax paperwork filed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no cost to doing that and there\u2019s no downside to doing that, meaning it doesn\u2019t increase your audit risk,\u201d says consultant and tax expert Barbara Weltman.\n\nPay up. Although about 75% of taxpayers wind up getting a refund, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert with TurboTax, an extension doesn\u2019t get you off the hook for paying your taxes by Tax Day. If you owe money, you\u2019ll be charged penalties and interest on the unpaid amount. If you don\u2019t bother getting the extension, you\u2019ll also be hit with a late filing fee on top of that.\n\nEstimate your obligations. If you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll owe money, you can use the IRS\u2019s estimation tool to get a ballpark idea of what you\u2019ll owe and pay that by April 18 to lessen the late payment fees you\u2019ll have to pay. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to pay interest of 3% above the federal short-term interest rate, plus a penalty fee of one-half of one percent of what you owe.\n\nSet up a payment plan. \u201cIf you do owe money, the IRS is willing to work with people,\u201d Greene-Lewis says. So if you\u2019re procrastinating because you know you owe and don\u2019t have the money, you can set up an installment plan on the IRS site, provided what you owe in taxes, penalties, and interest is less than $50,000.\n\nUse online tools. Not only will it be easier than joining the late-night scrum at the post office on Tax Day, but filing online means you can keep cranking away right up until the deadline. You can use online tools such as IRS Free File or TurboTax to crunch the numbers so you don\u2019t make a math mistake in your haste.\n\nMake qualifying contributions. \u201cDon\u2019t forget \u2014 you have up until the April deadline to make a deductible contribution to an IRA, but if you get a filing extension, it doesn\u2019t give you more time,\u201d Weltman says. So if you\u2019re counting on an IRA contribution to lower your tax bill, make sure you take care of that by the 18th too.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "If you're waiting until the last minute to file your taxes, here's what the experts recommend.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Going right down to the wire with your return?
