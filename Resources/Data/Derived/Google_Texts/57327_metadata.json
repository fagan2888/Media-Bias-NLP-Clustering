Brett Smith began the season as one of the Mountain West\u2019s most highly touted players, and Jason Thompson was Smith\u2019s talented backup.\n\nPlaying time for anyone else at the position was a pipe dream.\n\n\u201cA lot of times I came home and said: \u2018What am I doing here? I should just quit,\u2019 \u201d Kirkegaard said. \u201cThat\u2019s the obvious answer. You\u2019re going to be the senior quarterback on scout team. It hurts your pride.\u201d\n\nKirkegaard, an Arizona native who played one season at Phoenix College before transferring to Wyoming, decided to use 2013 as a redshirt season. Delaying his final year of eligibility didn\u2019t offer the promise of the starting gig, though. Far from it.\n\nWhen the Cowboys concluded a 5-7 season last November, Smith still had another year of eligibility remaining and Thompson, the obvious choice as Smith\u2019s successor, had two more years. For Kirke gaard, it appeared it was clipboard deja vu.\n\n\u201cColby had no hope of playing at all,\u201d said Wyoming wide receiver Dominic Rufran, who graduated from Palmer High School in Colorado Springs.\n\nFast forward to Wyoming\u2019s camp this past week, and the guy with no hope is poised to be the starting quarterback for first-year Cowboys coach Craig Bohl, thanks to perseverance and a fortuitous chain of events that finally gave Kirkegaard an opportunity.\n\nFirst, Smith made the curious decision to forgo his senior season and enter the NFL draft. Smith went undrafted, was cut one week after signing a free-agent contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and is now on the practice squad of the Canadian Football League\u2019s Toronto Argonauts.\n\nThen, Thompson transferred to Utah, where Dave Christensen, fired as Wyoming\u2019s coach at the end of the 2013 season, is now the offensive coordinator.\n\nAll of a sudden, Kirkegaard\u2019s sacrifice as a career backup gave him a prime opportunity, one enhanced by Wyoming\u2019s transition from a spread offense to a pro-style, West Coast attack that better suits his strengths.\n\n\u201cIf I had decided to look somewhere else,\u201d the fifth-year senior said, \u201cthis is exactly the kind of offense I would have looked for.\u201d\n\nBohl\u2019s offense emphasizes sound decision-making from the quarterbacks, who are charged with mastering a bevy of audible calls to ensure proper play selection. Bohl, who was hired last winter after leading North Dakota State to three consecutive Football Championship Subdivision national titles, said Kirkegaard\u2019s maturity has helped him grasp the scheme.\n\n\u201cHe takes coaching well, and he owns the mistake,\u201d Bohl said. \u201cMany times the quarterback position has so many other people that function around them. Human nature sometimes says to point fingers at somebody else. He says, \u2018I\u2019m ultimately in charge of this group. If something goes wrong, that comes back on my watch.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThat accountability has endeared Kirkegaard to teammates. With Bohl aiming to instill a blue-collar culture where players take pride on \u201cgrinding every day,\u201d a player who went to work behind the scenes for three years to earn a chance in the spotlight makes for a role model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complete inspiration to see a guy persevere through every situation he\u2019s been through,\u201d center Rafe Kiely said. \u201cFrom being low on the depth chart to having his name not be out there, to fight through all that and overcome every obstacle he\u2019s had, it\u2019s really inspiring.\u201d\n\nThough Bohl hadn\u2019t officially named his starter by the end of the Cowboys\u2019 first week of camp, he made it clear Kirkegaard was the front-runner.\n\nBut Kirkegaard isn\u2019t ready to celebrate, not with daylight still peering through the depth chart.\n\nAsked if he could envision what it would mean to start when Wyoming begins its season at home against Montana on Aug. 30, the animated 23-year-old suddenly became quiet.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516 or nkosmider@denverpost.com\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe top two quarterbacks on the Wyoming depth chart, Colby Kirkegaard and Tom Thornton, played for high schools 13 miles apart in Arizona. Kirkegaard threw for 5,083 yards and 47 touchdowns during his career at Arcadia High School in Phoenix. Thornton was a dual-threat quarterback at Marcos de Niza down the road in Tempe, Ariz., where he threw for 2,500 yards and 20 touchdowns as a senior in 2011.\n\nUpdated Aug. 10, 2014: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Wyoming\u2019s quarterback in the headline.
