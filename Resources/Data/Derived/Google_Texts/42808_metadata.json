About 800,000 people get coverage through New Jersey's individual and small-group health insurance markets.\n\nAmeriHealth\u2019s decision follows announcements last week by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest health insurer, and Aetna that they would not extend cancelled health plans next year.\n\nFor its part, Horizon said it proved \u201cimpossible\u201d to create essentially new plans in the short period before the end of the year, while Aetna said the plans it already developed for next year are competitively priced, and that reintroducing old plans now only would create consumer confusion.\n\nTheir decisions means that more of the state\u2019s small employers and individuals will be in store for potentially significant changes to their health insurance next year \u2013 from expanded benefits to possibly higher premiums. The law\u2019s major tenets \u2013 including the minimum essential benefits that insurers must cover and changes in factors they must consider when setting rates \u2013 take effect for plans sold after Jan. 1.\n\nHowever, many individual purchasers, depending on their income level, will be eligible for either subsidized coverage through New Jersey\u2019s federally run insurance exchange or for the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program.\n\nAmeriHealth, which covers about 9,200 people in the individual market and about 92,000 people through small group plans, said it will provide customers with plan choices for 2014 that are comparable to their current plans.\n\n\u201cOur new plans provide a variety of options at various price points as well as more comprehensive benefits, which we believe will help further enhance the health and well-being of our members,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe only other major insurer in New Jersey that has yet to announce its decision on cancelled health plans is UnitedHealthcare. The carrier, which sells coverage under the Oxford brand in New Jersey, provides insurance to about 100,000 people in the state\u2019s small group market and nearly 17,000 people in the individual market.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','economy','health-news','insurance','obamacare'", "title": "AmeriHealth becomes latest N.J. insurer to not extend cancelled health plans in 2014", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"AmeriHealth becomes latest N.J. insurer to not extend cancelled health plans in 2014\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/12/amerihealth_becomes_latest_nj.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/13953970-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11841713\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-17T20:40:50Z\", \"author\": \"Ed Beeson/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"economy\",\"health-news\",\"insurance\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/business_impact/photo/13953970-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna last week announced they wouldn't be renewing plans in 2014 that had been cancelled because they didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 17, 2013,  3:41 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/business_impact/photo/obamacare-healthjpg-dd9e6cf7ba215f30.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"ebeeson\", \"author_nickname\": \"Ed Beeson/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"9827178\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Business\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna last week announced they wouldn't be renewing plans in 2014 that had been cancelled because they didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards.", "title": "AmeriHealth becomes latest N.J. insurer to not extend cancelled health plans in 2014", "url": "http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/12/amerihealth_becomes_latest_nj.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 17, 2013,  3:05 PM", "article_author": "Ed Beeson/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna last week announced they wouldn't be renewing plans in 2014 that had been cancelled because they didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's standards."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3af\"", "article_summary": "The only other major insurer in New Jersey that has yet to announce its decision on cancelled health plans is UnitedHealthcare.\nAmeriHealth\u2019s decision follows announcements last week by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest health insurer, and Aetna that they would not extend cancelled health plans next year.\nAbout 800,000 people get coverage through New Jersey's individual and small-group health insurance markets.\nAmeriHealth New Jersey has become the third insurer in the state to decide against renewing individual and small group health plans next year that had been cancelled because they didn\u2019t meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\nAmeriHealth, which covers about 9,200 people in the individual market and about 92,000 people through small group plans, said it will provide customers with plan choices for 2014 that are comparable to their current plans."}
