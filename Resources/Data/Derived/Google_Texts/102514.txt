Which generation has become the nation’s largest living generation by population? Baby boomers? Generation X? Nope. The millennials — aka Generation Y — are projected to number more than 75 million this year, according to Pew Research.

They’re the young professionals of today. In fact, more than one in three American workers in 2015 is a millennial, ranging in age from 18 to 34. That means millennials have the largest share in the country’s workforce, and as more finish college and enter the working world, the number will only increase.
