If so, you\u2019re far from the only one, and you are contributing both to a frenzy of multibillion-dollar corporate dealmaking and a major change in the agricultural industry.\n\nAs the WSJ\u2019s Jacob Bunge reports:\n\nThis intensifying appetite for protein is one of the main forces driving Tyson Foods planned $7.7 billion acquisition of Hillshire Brands\n\nIncreasingly wealthy consumers in emerging economies are piling more meat on their plates and feeding their children more milk products.\n\nIn the U.S., meanwhile, some health-conscious consumers are replacing carbohydrates like bread and cereal with more animal protein, including meat, yogurt and eggs.\n\nThe trend has given rise to new meat-industry giants such as Brazil\u2019s JBS and China\u2019s WH Group, and is propelling sales by U.S. companies such as Hillshire, maker of Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, and Chobani Inc., the country\u2019s biggest Greek yogurt brand.\n\nIt is also prompting farmers around the world to expand their production of meat as well as the corn, soybeans and other crops used to feed livestock.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog
