The five-time Pro Bowler\u2019s gesture followed the deaths of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in an execution-style shooting as they sat in their patrol car working overtime in Brooklyn.\n\nWearing an NYPD hat, @nickmangold walks into the stadium. pic.twitter.com/dcsVTGz9jr \u2014 Kristian Dyer (@KristianRDyer) December 21, 2014\n\nCoughlin, a two-time Super Bowl winner, displayed a more subtle tribute to the slain police officers during the Giants\u2019 away game against the St. Louis Rams.\n\nTom Coughlin wearing a black strip on left shoulder and peace sign under NY in honor of #NYPD officers Liu and Ramos pic.twitter.com/yr6tshDCTr \u2014 New York Giants (@Giants) December 21, 2014\n\n\u201cWe wore this because the New York Giants wanted to honor and mourn the assassination of the two New York City policemen that took place last night in our city,\u201d Coughlin said after the game:\n\nWe also wanted to wear this pin to represent peace. Let\u2019s hope that the voice of reason can prevail. Violence never solves anything. I realize there are issues, but solve them with nonviolent means.\n\nPolice said the shooter, identified as Ismaaiyl Brinsley, killed the officers to exact \u201crevenge\u201d on law enforcement following the deaths of Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner of Staten Island, N.Y., in confrontations with police. Both men were black and unarmed; grand juries declined to bring charges in either case.\n\n>>> 13-Year-Old Son of Fallen NYPD Officer Posts Heartbreaking Goodbye to Father on Facebook\n\nMangold told Yahoo Sports that after he heard about the shooting, he reached out to a friend with connections in the NYPD to get the cap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here nine years,\u201d the Jets center said:\n\nEvery one of those [police officers] that\u2019s out there, they risk their lives every day. They go out there to keep the community safe, and for that to happen to those two guys, their families, that\u2019s a raw deal.\n\n\u201cFor that to happen to those two guys, their families, that\u2019s a raw deal,\u201d says New York Jets center @NickMangold.\n\nMangold\u2019s statement came just weeks after five St. Louis Rams players made the \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d gesture to protest Brown\u2019s death before a Nov. 30 game. The players faced some backlash for their actions, and reports differ as to whether or not the team apologized.\n\nWhen asked if he feared a similar response to his gesture, Mangold said he hadn\u2019t thought about it.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t cross my mind. Even if there was backlash, those families deserve support,\u201d Mangold told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI would have been happy to take it. I just wanted to do something to support them.\u201d\n\nMangold\u2019s salute to the NYPD earned him praise from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, whom the player supported in that campaign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nick Mangold, Tom Coughlin, Metlife Stadium, New York Jets, New York Giants, Wenjian Liu, Rafael Ramos, NYPD, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Mitt Romney", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Less than 24 hours after two New York City police officers were shot and killed in broad daylight Saturday, New York Jets player Nick Mangold...
