Rockefeller III.\n\nAsia Society President Josette Sheeran said the institution\u2019s search for a museum director was the first arts hire in a strategic plan that began a rollout in 2014.\n\nAmong the ongoing agenda items is to build a board in which half the trustees are from Asia and half from the West.\n\n\u201cWe are a globally deployed institution,\u201d said Ms. Sheeran, adding that to maintain and heighten that active presence, the society interviewed people from all over Asia for the museum role. \u201cWe were determined to find someone with a finger on the pulse of the exploding, dynamic art scene in Asia.\u201d\n\nMr. Tan managed Singapore\u2019s pavilion at the 50th Venice Biennale and was assistant chief executive for museums and programs under Singapore\u2019s National Heritage Board.\n\n\u201cHe brings expertise from curation and administration,\u201d said Ms. Sheeran. \u201cSingapore is such a crossroads. It really showed in his perspective.\u201d\n\nAsia Society\u2019s museum exhibits traditional Asian art, as well as an extensive collection of photography and new-media works by Asian and Asian-American artists.\n\nAmong Mr. Tan\u2019s new duties will be overseeing those collections, as well as orchestrating dialogue about the Asian art field through directing the Asia Society Arts and Museum Network and its Arts & Museum Summit.\n\nWrite to Pia Catton at pia.catton@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2015-08-25T20:28:00.000Z",
