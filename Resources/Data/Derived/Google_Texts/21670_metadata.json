That was not a pleasant experience.\u201d\n\nShelafo was one of hundreds to attend an Amarillo Area Foundation symposium aimed at answering questions about the law many have dubbed Obamacare. Health care providers, administrators, business owners, and other citizens showed up to have their questions answered, foundation Vice President Charlotte Rhodes said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that we did something that was a neutral setting and we wanted to present the facts,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublican State Representatives John T. Smithee and Four Price, and Republican State Sen. Kel Seliger, began the discussion Thursday morning in Amarillo Civic Center Grand Plaza. Seliger spoke of rising health care costs in Texas, and said the time is near when lawmakers would have to have a \u201csubstantive discussion\u201d on how those costs will be covered.\n\n\u201cThere is no indication there will be a slowdown or cessation of that growth,\u201d Seliger said.\n\n\u201cWe are headed, I think, for something of a budgetary crisis,\u201d Seliger said.\n\nPrice said state lawmakers achieved a great deal in improving health care during the 83rd Legislative Session. Among those accomplishments were increasing funds for mental health programs, allotting new resources to detect Medicare fraud and other measures.\n\nState lawmakers struggled to address the Affordable Care Act due to the politicized nature of the law and because they received few answers from the federal government over how the law would work, Price said.\n\n\u201cThere was so much concern, so many unanswered questions,\u201d he said.\n\nTexas Hospital Association Senior Vice President of Government Relations John Williams echoed Seliger\u2019s statement that health care expenses are unsustainable at their current rate.\n\nOne major expense he pointed out was the $5.5 billion hospitals have reported in uncompensated care, often resulting from patients who don\u2019t have access to primary care or mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n\n\u201cYou have to invest in services to help people get more appropriate medical care,\u201d he said.\n\nRepealing the Affordable Care Act, Williams said, is not an option unless lawmakers can work with insurers and health care providers to find a viable alternative. Maintaining the status quo is untenable, he said.\n\n\u201cSo the dilemma is, how do you make insurance available to folks, make it more affordable ... do you do it through a mandate? Do you do tax incentives? Do you de-link it from employment? Do you create risk pools for folks who are uninsurable?\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think these are the debates we\u2019re going to have going forward.\u201d\n\nTexas Medical Association Vice President of Medical Economics Lee Spangler talked about how the U.S. is demanding \u201cmore for less\u201d from health providers.\n\nSpangler said uncertainty over health care regulations has kept\n\npractice-owning physicians from hiring new doctors and prevented new physicians from starting their own practices.\n\n\u201cPhysicians basically get frozen\u201d in the face of stringent regulations, he said, and costs to provide care to Medicare patients makes making a living hard for physicians who accept those plans.\n\nAnother problem with the Affordable Care Act lies in how physicians are supposed to provide care for the millions of additional Americans who will begin receiving insurance coverage, Spangler said.\n\nIn light of the act, physicians, insurers and hospitals are forming \u201caffordable care organizations,\u201d defined by the Department of Health and Human Services as a group of health care providers who coordinate patient care to improve overall quality of care.\n\nSpangler warned that regulation on which groups can call themselves ACOs are lax, and that patients and providers should do their research on any ACO they are asked to join.\n\nDr. William Biggs, CEO of local ACO Amarillo Legacy Medical, said his organization of 110 health providers has seen numbers of hospital admission rates, re-admission rates, and rates of diabetes, pneumonia and heart failure drop among patients under the Legacy Medical umbrella.\n\nThe organization allows providers among five different practices to share patient information and compare performance standards among physicians.\n\n\u201cWe are promoting the right care at the right time in the right place,\u201d Biggs said.\n\nShelafo said she would like to see the government be more transparent and make information on the Affordable Care Act available to people in terms that they can understand.\n\n\u201cI think the federal government needs to be more open ... with what all of these rules are,\u201d Shelafo said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that have a lot of questions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, News, RUSSELL ANGLIN, Betty Shelafo, Charlotte Rhodes, Government Relations, John T.
