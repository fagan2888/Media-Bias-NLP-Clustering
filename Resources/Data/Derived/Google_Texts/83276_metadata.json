It has funded research detailing how expansion could benefit health care providers and the Kansas economy. It also has commissioned multiple surveys, each of which has shown that a majority of Kansans support expansion.\n\nHowever, those efforts have failed to substantially move the needle on the issue. Gov. Sam Brownback and Republican legislative leaders remain steadfastly opposed to expanding KanCare coverage to an estimated 150,000 Kansans, most of whom are low-income but non-disabled adults.\n\nBrownback reiterated his opposition to expansion in his session-opening State of the State speech.\n\n\u201cIt was Obamacare that cut Medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals,\u201d Brownback said, referring to reductions in Medicare payments included in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt was Obamacare that caused the problem. We should not expand Obamacare to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nBrownback\u2019s remarks were designed to counter claims that expanding KanCare would bolster the finances of many struggling Kansas hospitals and could have prevented the closure last fall of Mercy Hospital in Independence.\n\nKansas is one of 19 states that so far have rejected Medicaid expansion.\n\nMissing out on the first three years of expansion has cost the state more than $1 billion in additional federal money, according to the hospital association, which keeps a running total on its website.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Kansas Health Foundation is the main funder of the Kansas Health Institute, parent of the editorially independent KHI News Service, one of the partners in Heartland Health Monitor.\n\nJim McLean is executive editor of KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "A new organization is forming to strengthen the lobbying effort for Medicaid expansion in Kansas.
