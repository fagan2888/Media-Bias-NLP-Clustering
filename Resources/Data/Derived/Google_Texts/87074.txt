JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Gov. Jay Nixon gave his annual State of the State address in the Capitol today, presenting his annual budget and laying out a broad agenda calling for more education funding, Medicaid expansion, anti-discrimination protections for LGBT Missourians, and tax credit reforms.

Nixon touted his own agenda, taking no time to mention Missouri’s shrinking unemployment and 44,000 additional jobs in the last year. Nixon also spent time defending his veto of last year’s tax cut legislation and reiterating his support for lower taxes.

“Missouri employers will save $70 million this year alone because we cut the corporate franchise tax,” Nixon said during his speech. “But here’s what I won’t do: I will not support anything that takes money out of our classrooms.”

While Nixon voiced his support for reforming the state’s tax credit programs and new campaign finance restrictions, he didn’t offer a specific course of action on either front.

Nixon also voiced his strong support for Medicaid expansion while attempting to distance the issue from Obamacare.

“We all know there are problems with Obamacare, and Washington’s implementation of it has been abysmal,” Nixon said. “But rejecting Medicaid won’t fix any of those things. It won’t keep Missourians from having to pay federal taxes or exempt our businesses from new requirements under the law.”

Nixon also defended the state’s education establishment and instructed lawmakers not to “tear down our teachers.” While calling for a “fix” to the current school transportation law, Nixon didn’t mention a specific solution.

Noticeably missing from Nixon’s agenda was any mention of Right-to-Work legislation, which he has in the past threatened to veto and which some Republican leadership have promised will be a priority this year.

Republicans hammered Nixon’s address in their official response, delivered by House Speaker Tim Jones, R-Eureka. Republicans said Nixon had created his own consensus revenue estimate in order to fund his own projects.

“This budget accounts for nearly $1 billion in new funding,” Jones said. “This budget is about $310 million more than the estimates agreed on by the House and Senate for the budget, as well as the University of Missouri experts who weighed in.”

Jones accused Nixon of “smoke and mirror” budget games, reiterating that Republicans in the House supported an increase in K-12 funding in 2013, and chiding Nixon on withholding funds and treating the budget like a “slush fund.”

Budget Chairman Rick Stream, R-Kirkwood, said Nixon chose a revenue estimate outside of the one determined by non-partisan House and Senate staff.

“We’re going to hold the line on those numbers, we are determined not to spend more than we take in,” Stream said.

Reactions to Gov. Nixon’s address:

“I am shocked [Gov. Nixon] never mentioned our highways or freedom to work. He seemed to be more interested in handing out money to his allies. I would love to have a leader in this state that helps all the citisens and no just his friends.”

–Rocky Miller, R-Osage Beach

“The Governor’s commitment to improving funding for education is exactly what our state needs. For years many in the capitol have talked a big game about education, and it is good to see a powerful person putting all their might behind helping our public schools.”

–Michael Butler, D-St. Louis City

“I agree with the focus on increased education funding, but you can’t pay for $800 million in new spending by simply cutting 80 government jobs. His budget is not realistic, even if well intentioned.”

–Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia

“I’m glad the Governor addressed the education needs of our state. As he said it’s about time we put children first. No more politics, Let’s just fund the education formula like we all promised to during our campaigns.”

–Vicki Englund, D-St. Louis City

“In a world of infinite revenue, I think the Governor knocked it out of the park. I just wish this was the world we lived in.”

-Caleb Jones, R-California

“Out of all of Governor Nixon’s addresses this was the best one, hands down. This is the direction we need to go. At the end of the day the people of Missouri and those elected to office will do the right thing.”

-Jeremy LaFaver, D-Kansas City

“The Governor created a consensus revenue estimate 40 percent higher than everyone else so he was able to promise increases to every department in the state. My colleagues and I are done with partisan gestures and looking to provide real solutions, not empty promises. Let’s be the tip of the spear, not the rear guard.”

–Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield

“Governor Nixon showed leadership with strong budget priorities by tripling funding for early childhood education. Education is the greatest economic development tool available.”

–Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City

“I’m extremely disappointed in the Governor’s immediate position on tax reform and I’m very curious to see his [consensus revenue estimate].”

–Casey Guernsey, R-Bethany

“I was elated to know that the Governor is ready to put more money into the foundation formula.”

-Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis City

“I’m surprised there wasn’t more bipartisan support. Some of the stuff was deserving of a standing ovation. Medicaid, Medicaid probably helps rural areas more than the urban core.”

-Rep. Clem Smith, D-St. Louis

“No states are spending our money. It’s money borrowed on the backs of future generations.”

-Rep. Tim Remole R-Moberly

“I felt like I needed to look for a leprechaun to look for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Apparently, Governor Nixon has forgotten the importance of a balanced budget.”

-Rep. Mike Kelley Rep R-Carthage

“In 2005, with a Republican Governor and Republican Senate, we passed the Foundation Formula. We’re just now funding it nine years later.”

-Rep. Jacob Hummel, D-St. Louis

“One of the better state of the state addresses I’ve ever heard. It’s unfortunate the Republicans didn’t consider it the same way.”

-Rep. Tommie Pierson, D-Florissant

“I think we need to take a look at the whole picture on what we’re doing on tax policy. I think reform is long over due in some areas.”

-Sen. Bob Dixon, R-Springfield

“He was talking about high tech jobs. We established the career tech board to help create high tech jobs. He has yet to appoint a member to that board.”

-Sen. Brian Muntzlinger, R-Lewis County

“I was just happy the governor committed to fully fund education. Your children are your future.”

-Rep. Elaine Gannon, R-De Soto

“The general assembly has struggled with fair and balanced tax credit reform policy,”

-Rep, Bart Korman, R-Chesterfield

“It’s Christmas in January. He proposes this budget and we’re the ones who look like the bad guys when we need to cut it.”

-Rep. Kevin Engler, R-Farmington
