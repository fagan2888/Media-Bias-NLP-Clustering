(We\u2019ll wait while you pull up Wikipedia.)\n\nIf, say, you\u2019re a woman who lives in Louisiana, you\u2019re more likely to know that Mary Landrieu voted for it than you are that David Vitter voted against it.\n\nThat\u2019s one insight from a new article (ungated) by political scientist Philip Edward Jones. He finds that women know more about how their female senators vote and are more likely to hold them accountable for those votes than when they\u2019re represented by men. There\u2019s also suggestive evidence that this might be true for male voters as well. Maybe electing women makes for better citizens.\n\nJones was curious about whether \u201cdescriptive representation\u201d \u2014 women being represented by women \u2014 affected whether female voters paid attention to their senators\u2019 activities. To find out, he used national survey data from the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, which asked respondents if they knew how their senators voted on a variety of matters, including the Affordable Care Act, extending capital gains tax cuts, and Supreme Court confirmations.\n\nFemale voters were more likely to know the legislative records of their female senators than male senators. In 2006, for instance, Jones found that controlling for a host of other factors \u2014 partisanship, how long a senator had been in office, and so forth \u2014 women knew were able to correctly identify about 45 percent of the votes of their male senators. But when they were represented by women, they were able to say how they voted about 52 percemt of the time.\n\nThe votes of female senators were also more consequential for how their female constituents evaluated them. Jones looked at how often voters\u2019 own policy positions matched the votes that their senators cast. He then examined the effect that had on senators\u2019 approval ratings.\n\nTo see how this works, imagine two otherwise identical female voters, one whose positions were the same as her senator\u2019s 25 percent of the time, and the other whose positions were the same as her senator\u2019s 75 percent of the time.\n\nThe difference in the approval ratings those two voters gave their senator was about 40 points when represented by a man. When represented by a female senator, though, the gap was 54 points. In other words, the congruence between a female voter\u2019s policy positions and her senator\u2019s votes mattered more when the senator was a woman than when the senator was a man.\n\nJones doesn\u2019t find the same statistically significant gaps when analyzing male voters, which he reasonably interprets as evidence that there\u2019s something unique about women being represented by women.\n\nMy read of the data is slightly more expansive, however. Although the effects for women are clearer and stronger in a statistical sense, the overall patterns are quite similar for male voters. And in 2008, in fact, men were significantly more likely to correctly identify the votes of female senators than male senators.\n\nOf course, the absence of statistical significance is meaningful, but I was struck by the consistency of the pattern for both women and men voters. Research examining knowledge of House members\u2019 votes could shed additional light on whether these patterns are specific to women, or to voters in general.\n\nUltimately, Jones\u2019 findings clearly suggest that being represented by a women makes women more attentive to the legislative records of their senators. On one hand, familiarity may be advantageous for women politicians, since they will be rewarded when they effectively represent their female constituents\u2019 interests. But as Jones notes, greater knowledge could cut the other way if \u201cfemale politicians face an electorate that is, overall, more attentive to any policy missteps that they make.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research shows that women voters know more about the voting records of female senators -- and men might too.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New research shows that women voters know more about the voting records of female senators -- and men might too.", "title": "Electing women makes for better citizens", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/06/23/electing-women-makes-for-better-citizens/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/files/2014/06/imrs2V0HV2CC.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/06/23/electing-women-makes-for-better-citizens/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "women senators, women politicians,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "women senators, women politicians,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd055d\"", "article_summary": "Female voters were more likely to know the legislative records of their female senators than male senators.\nUltimately, Jones\u2019 findings clearly suggest that being represented by a women makes women more attentive to the legislative records of their senators.\nJones was curious about whether \u201cdescriptive representation\u201d \u2014 women being represented by women \u2014 affected whether female voters paid attention to their senators\u2019 activities.\nMaybe electing women makes for better citizens.\nAnd in 2008, in fact, men were significantly more likely to correctly identify the votes of female senators than male senators."}
