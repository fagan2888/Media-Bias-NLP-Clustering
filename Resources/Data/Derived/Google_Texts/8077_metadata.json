Actual medical spending growth, however, could be 4.8% when benefit plan changes are taken into account, but that figure still will be up from 2014, the report says.\n\niStock\n\nThe expected increase in inflation is the first the medical community will see since the downturn hit all sectors of the economy in 2009.\n\nA number of changes in health care \u2014 including the advent of Obamacare, doctors and hospitals consolidating operations, and a push toward higher-deductible health plans that force patients to act more as consumers \u2014 have brought down medical inflation from the annual double-digit hikes of the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nWhat has analysts puzzled, though, is whether the measures taken will prevent a return to what many viewed as out-of-control inflation rates. While cost increases are down, health-care inflation remains double to triple that of the rest of the economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to do,\u201d said Rick Judy, principal for PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 health-care advisory practice. Judy says a move toward higher-deductible plans will keep patients more engaged as health-care consumers than before, thus keeping better controls on costs.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re very optimistic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study shows that roughly 26% of those in employer-sponsored plans will be in high-deductible programs this year, up from 8% in 2009. By contrast, those in preferred-provider organizations or health-maintenance organizations have seen their numbers drop by 10 and 4 percentage points, respectively.\n\nJudy says nearly half of all employers, 44%, are considering making a high-deductible plan their only option for employees.\n\nFurther, some of the 2015 increase may be due to a rise in spending on specialty drugs, such as Gilead Sciences Inc.\u2019s /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD Sovaldi, for treatment for hepatitis C.\n\nSpecialty-drug spending more than doubles every four years, and should reach more than $192 billion in 2016, up from $87 billion in 2012. By 2020, that figure could reach more than $401 billion, the study says.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\n\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nAbbott to buy Russian drug maker, but says it\u2019s not a tax inversion deal\n\nShire says its sales should double by 2020\n\nAllergan, Valeant trade more salvos in takeover war", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-06-24T00:01:19-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Health-care inflation has hit a low point and is poised to start rising again, but it's unclear whether annual medical cost hikes are heading back to the double-digit increases of years past.", "title": "Health-care inflation heating back up", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/24/health-care-inflation-starting-to-head-back-up-as-economy-turns-study/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CG379_caduce_MG_20140530141848.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "health care,medical inflation,PricewaterhouseCoopers", "article.headline": "Health-care inflation heating back up", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "Health-care inflation has hit a low point and is poised to start rising again, but it's unclear whether annual medical cost hikes are heading back to the double-digit increases of years past.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "health care,medical inflation,PricewaterhouseCoopers", "article.published": "2014-06-24T00:01:19-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/24/health-care-inflation-starting-to-head-back-up-as-economy-turns-study/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Health-care inflation has hit a low point and is poised to start rising again, but it's unclear whether annual medical cost hikes are heading back to the double-digit increases of years past.", "title": "Health-care inflation heating back up", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/24/health-care-inflation-starting-to-head-back-up-as-economy-turns-study/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CG379_caduce_MG_20140530141848.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2724", "article.updated": "2014-06-24T10:24:27-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde92a\"", "article_summary": "While cost increases are down, health-care inflation remains double to triple that of the rest of the economy.\nHealth-care inflation has hit a low point and is poised to start rising again, but it\u2019s unclear whether annual medical cost hikes are heading back to the double-digit increases of years past.\nWhat has analysts puzzled, though, is whether the measures taken will prevent a return to what many viewed as out-of-control inflation rates.\niStockThe expected increase in inflation is the first the medical community will see since the downturn hit all sectors of the economy in 2009.\nJudy says a move toward higher-deductible plans will keep patients more engaged as health-care consumers than before, thus keeping better controls on costs."}
