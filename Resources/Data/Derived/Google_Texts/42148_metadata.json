Or 364, really, if you count the glory that is next-day, soggy-fried-onion, green bean casserole leftovers.\n\nSo, why do I love it?\n\nI trace it back to my Wisconsin roots, a state where no church potluck was complete without 10 different casseroles and where one of my favorite childhood foods involved egg noodles and cream of chicken soup. Wisconsin may be the Dairy State, but if you ask me, it\u2019s also the Casserole State. (Wisconsin, somehow, came in second on Del Monte\u2019s index, at 77 percent. It\u2019s Kentucky that loves green bean casserole the best, say the Del Monte bean counters, at 78 percent. Colorado\u2019s 71 percent ranked a respectable eighth.)\n\nI\u2019m a purist when it comes to my green bean casserole, too. Green beans (frozen, not canned \u2014 just like my mom makes it), cream of mushroom soup, milk, black pepper and French\u2019s French Fried Onions \u2014 that\u2019s all I need. Mix it all together and cook it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, plus a few more to get the fried-onion topping extra crispy. Instant Thanksgiving.\n\nI was a little surprised when I saw soy sauce listed on both the Del Monte and Campbell\u2019s recipes. Is that a thing now? (Only French\u2019s was a holdout.) According to Del Monte, other favorite additions include bacon, cheese, mushrooms, bread crumbs and almonds, but I\u2019m fine without, thank you very much.\n\nAnd to the 29 percent in Colorado, those of you who don\u2019t care for green bean casserole, that\u2019s just fine with me, too.\n\nJust pass the casserole dish \u2014 I\u2019ll gladly take your share.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Del Monte Green Bean Index,green bean casserole,Thanksgiving", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/11/26/green-bean-casserole-thanksgiving/", "type": "blog", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/11/20141119__green-bean-casserolep1-495x328.jpg", "site_name": "The Den", "title": "Thanksgiving without green bean casserole?
