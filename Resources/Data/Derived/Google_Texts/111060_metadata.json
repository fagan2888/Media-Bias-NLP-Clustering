In 2013, the year with the most recent data, there were 8,027. That\u2019s a 20 percent decline.\n\nLikewise the teen pregnancy rate has also dropped 20 percent. In 2010 there were 37.5 births per 1,000 teen girls. In 2013, the number was 30.3 per 1,000.\n\nInterpretation of that data varies widely, often depending on whether a person is pro-life or pro-choice.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana CEO Betty Cockrum believes the statistics show girls are less likely to get in the position where they have to choose between an abortion or giving birth, and she credits better access to contraceptives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Affordable Care Act, with the introduction of birth control without copays, is making a difference,\u201d she says.\n\nCockrum admits the Affordable Cara Act, aka Obamacare, hasn\u2019t been around for long, so there might also be other factors playing into the decline. She says it could also be that if the drop is this stark early on, the abortion rate will likely continue to drop as more people take advantage of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s benefits.\n\nOne of the other factors contributing to the decline could be that Hoosiers are crossing into neighboring states where there are fewer restrictions on abortions.\n\nTake Michigan for example. That state\u2019s abortion rate actually increased 18 percent from 2010 to 2013. Health officials say the number of non-residents getting abortions there doubled over the last year.\n\nBut pro-life advocates cite other reasons for the decline, including new state laws.\n\n\u201cOne category was consent information for women,\u201d says Sue Swayze, a spokeswoman for Indiana Right to Life. \u201cIn Indiana, for example, prior to 2011, we didn\u2019t have anything in writing that she had to get, so in 2011 we upgraded our law to give her some information in writing much like you and I would get before we get any medical procedure.\u201d\n\nThat included giving women the option of viewing their ultrasound.\n\n\u201cIn my day, I remember when Roe [v. Wade] came in and we thought it might be a blob of tissue or something,\u201d Swayze says. \u201cBut today\u2019s generation, they\u2019ve grown up with ultrasounds. They don\u2019t know any different. It\u2019s something we share, we put on Facebook, so social media and technology like ultrasounds have shown that that\u2019s a baby.\u201d\n\nInstead of implementing more laws focused on abortions themselves, some health experts are advocating for more sex education.\n\n\u201cI would love to see fewer and fewer abortions,\u201d says Kathryn Brown, a health and sexuality educator at the Indiana University Student Health Center. \u201cI would love to see fewer and fewer women go through what for most of them is probably an agonizing decision that stays with them for many months or years.\u201d\n\nThe way to do that, she says, is to make young women aware of new contraceptives.\n\n\u201cWe have so many good, very effective, long-acting reversible contraceptives now,\u201d she says. \u201cMeaning you take it and it can last for years\u2013IUDs and implants that give not 100 percent, but nearly 100 percent protection. Do these young people know about these methods? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSchools in Indiana aren\u2019t required to teach sex education and when they do, they don\u2019t have to teach about contraceptives. Instead, the state mandates they teach abstinence.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Betty Cockrum says that\u2019s not working.\n\n\u201cHere in Indiana, there\u2019s clearly no comfort with the whole conversation around sex ed, and that takes its toll,\u201d she says. \u201cIt takes its toll on young people\u2019s behaviors, and it takes its toll on how many young women are giving birth and how that contributes to the cycle of poverty.\u201d\n\nAnother organization that is trying to move beyond the abortion debate is the All Options Pregnancy Resource Center in Bloomington.\n\nThe center\u2019s mission is in its name\u2013to present women with all of their options. It provides free pregnancy tests, peer counseling, diapers and baby clothes, referrals for HIV tests, and, unlike many crisis pregnancy centers, abortion funding.\n\nAll Options Pregnancy Center Director Shelly Dodson knows that last service is controversial, but she says helping women know what\u2019s available to them throughout their pregnancy and meeting people where they are is more effective than fighting over abortions.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to have these conversations that move beyond pro-life and pro-choice and how do we support people in all their experiences,\u201d Dodson says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether abortion is right or wrong. It\u2019s about how we can support all of their needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana's pro-choice advocates attribute the state's decline in abortions to availability of contraceptives.
