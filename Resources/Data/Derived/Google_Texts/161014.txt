As his second term winds down, President Barack Obama has grown looser, more comfortable and bolder in his initiatives. Earlier this fall, he became the first sitting President to visit a federal prison; he’s also taken ground-breaking steps toward clean energy requirements to go with what was previously his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. With the help of one rapper and one magazine, he might also become the first President to choose the dirty over you: in a video for GQ‘s Men of the Year feature, a series of celebrities offer gifts and words of congratulation to Obama. And while Steph Curry, Amy Schumer, Tracy Morgan and the rest try their hardest, they come up short compared to Future. The Atlanta rapper offers our 44th President a bottle of Sprite and a stack of styrofoam cups, adding, “I would like–I would love for you to listen to DS2.”

Though it would seem to most like this is the time for Future to take a victory lap, maybe play some golf, he shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it was just today (Nov. 18) that he tweeted a cryptic message that has led some to speculate that Ape Shit, his full-length collaboration with the super producer Mike WiLL Made It, could be arriving next week. That would come after a year that saw not only DS2, but the Drake collaboration What a Time To Be Alive, Beast Mode, which was produced entirely by Zaytoven and 56 Nights, which is technically a DJ Esco mixtape, titled for his stint in a Dubai jail. In 2014, Future dropped his tepidly received sophomore album, Honest, and the brutal Monster.
