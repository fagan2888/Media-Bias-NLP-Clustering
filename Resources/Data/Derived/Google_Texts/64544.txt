Ontario Provincial Police said they received a call from a passenger just after 9:10 p.m. Saturday as the bus was passing through Burlington eastbound from Hamilton on the 403, heading for Union Station.

The bus driver had no idea the call had been made, until OPP and Halton police stopped the vehicle just after 9:30 p.m. on the QEW in Oakville near Royal Windsor Drive.

According to Halton police, the man had pulled the knife during a verbal altercation between passengers.

He was arrested without incident and a small knife was recovered from where he had been sitting. He was charged with assault with a weapon, although no injuries were reported.

"An assault can take place by a gesture or act, and that was the case," said Halton Regional Police Staff Sergeant Craig Platt.

The man was released and is due in court in Milton on Oct. 21.
