Barry Goldwater\u2019s doomed presidential bid.\n\nThe speech, \u201cA Time For Choosing,\u201d led prominent Californians to beg him to run for governor of their state, which he won twice, raising his status to national contender and priming him for, eventually, the White House. Indeed, Mr. Goldwater may have lost that November, but in raising the status of leaders like Mr. Reagan \u2014 and conservatism itself \u2014 it was, as Ambassador Bill Middendorf writes, \u201cA Glorious Disaster.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s been five decades, too. And ten years ago, Ronald Reagan the man left us here on our own. And since he gracefully exited the public arena years before then, whole generations of Americans have been born.\n\nIn the ensuing years, citing his name has become clich\u00e9. When challenged to name their political hero in the Republican National Committee chairman debate in 2011, candidates had to dig deep: They weren\u2019t allowed to say Ronald Reagan. In the 2012 primary debates, citing Mr. Reagan as your guardian angel was as necessary an accessory as a flag pin, pressing audiences to wonder how Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich can all be the one man that, for all their strengths, we knew they weren\u2019t.\n\nToday, MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews fondly remembers an imaginary time when his boss, former Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill, was a gentlemanly comrade to Mr. Reagan \u2014 a revision easily refuted by Mr. O\u2019Neill himself. And even President Barack Obama has gotten in on the game, comparing himself favorably with the 40th president.\n\nWorse yet, some on the right have hijacked Mr. Reagan\u2019s mantle, claiming they represent a continuation of his policies when they simply do not. Some are easy for even casual historians to catch, most are more difficult to pin down conclusively, but when 26 years of Americans have been born since he retired Washington, it\u2019s easy for the truth to be obscured. Which is dangerous. George Orwell\u2019s warning has been repeated so often because it is correct: \u201cWho controls the past, controls the future.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s worth cutting through the fog of time and politics to look at the ideas Mr. Reagan espoused in his 1964 national debut, not simply because they\u2019re interesting, but because they are so timeless, he could speak them today without an alteration.\n\nMr. Reagan could have been eulogizing Jim Foley when he said, \u201cThere can be no real peace while one American is dying someplace in the world for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nMr. Reagan could have been warning against the abuses of the National Security Agency or the Internal Revenue Service when he warned, \u201cThese proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man\u2019s property without a warrant?\u201d\n\nMr. Reagan could have been warning against Obamacare when he said, \u201cThis is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.\u201d\n\nOr when he derided then-Sen. J. William Fulbright for saying the president is \u201chobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document\u201d called the Constitution, he could have been speaking to any one of the mouth-breathers dominating MSNBC\u2019s daily commentary.\n\nOne of the reasons Mr. Reagan\u2019s words speak to us so clearly, and with such moral authority, fifty years later, is because they weren\u2019t merely political, nor were they simply contemporary. In some of his most famous lines from \u201cA Time For Choosing,\u201d he evoked past leaders on both sides of the aisle, and all sides of conservatism.\n\nWhen Mr. Reagan challenged, \u201cYou and I have a rendezvous with destiny,\u201d he evoked his hero, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said, \u201cTo some generations, much is given. Of other generations, much is expected. This generation has a rendezvous with history.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Reagan said, \u201cWe\u2019ll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or we\u2019ll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness,\u201d he paid homage to President Abraham Lincoln, who nine months into the Civil War told Congress, \u201cWe shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of Earth.\u201d\n\nHe drew from heroes in both parties, as well as from libertarianism, anti-communism and Christianity, because while his 30-minute speech contained more facts and figures than we\u2019re used to in our speeches these days, it was mainly about ideas. \u201cIt was always ideas,\u201d Dr. Lee Edwards writes in a primer biography of the man, \u201cthat motivated Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nAt a conference over the weekend at The Reagan Ranch Center, Young America\u2019s Foundation gathered 90 students, and dozens of supporters and Reagan veterans, to explore the themes he espoused on Oct. 27, 1964; and in the series of videos above, inserted some of his more memorable lines into modern-day events.\n\nAnd this is important. Because most of those students gathered in that hall were exactly the young Americans who never lived a day when Mr. Reagan spoke to America. As a figure who has entered history \u2014 like Thomas Jefferson, Mr. Lincoln or FDR \u2013 he is claimed now by all parties and factions, and that is inevitable, but in watching the strident urgency of his speech, it\u2019s impossible to walk away without a clear view of the man\u2019s very-concrete vision for an America rightly understood.\n\nYes, Mr. Reagan has left us here alone, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has become a ghost for politicians to pin on their lapels\u2014 it means that in our still-turning world, young Americans owe it to themselves to study his life, learn of his ideas, and choose where our union is headed.\n\nFollow Bedford on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n\nChristopher Bedford serves as vice chairman on the board of governors of Young Americans for Freedom, a project of the Young America\u2019s Foundation, and spoke at their 50th anniversary conference in Santa Barbara, Calif.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christopher Bedford", "description": "Why ideas still matter", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- Monday marks five decades since 53-year-old actor Ronald Reagan entered the national political consciousness, giving a final, twilight boost to Sen.
