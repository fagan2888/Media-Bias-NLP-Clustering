I was carrying festive balloons since it was celebrate our 67th wedding anniversary. After we were seated for a bit, a complete stranger who was sitting at the bar came down and approached us. After a few words, he insisted on paying for our dinner. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. He said a little prayer with us and then just walked away. We\u2019ve never experienced anything with such an overwhelming feeling of kindness. We\u2019ll surely pass that on to someone else in the near future. Thank you Bob and Ginny wherever you are, we won\u2019t forget your kindness.\n\nBILL AND MARY\n\nOBAMACARE IS GREAT\n\n\u201cConstitutional Courier\u201d is so addicted to Fox News they actually think that Obamacare isn\u2019t working. Well, let me tell you something: You\u2019re absolutely wrong. Even if Republican is elected president 2016 \u2014 I hope not \u2014 Obamacare isn\u2019t going anywhere. Too many people are happy with it.\n\nFREIND RIGHT AGAIN\n\nChris Freind made a great point last week: Americans\u2019 attention span is gone. It\u2019s is not just the toys that people obsessed with, sporting events are the same thing. Every time there is a stoppage of play or between innings of baseball games you are inundated with all this stuff because they\u2019re afraid everybody is going to get bored and can\u2019t pay attention for more than 5 seconds at a time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOBAMA BLAMES FOX\n\nThey had Obama on Fox News last week. He\u2019s always criticizing Fox News for telling the truth, yet he doesn\u2019t criticize any of the other news stations or newspapers. Why is that? Oh, that\u2019s because the government owns them and they\u2019re told not to speak the truth.\n\nCHICKEN LITTLE\n\n\u201cThe End Is Near\u201d sounds like Chicken Little, \u201cThe sky is falling, the sky is falling.\u201d Where I work we\u2019ve been busy for the last two months and we are booked up for next month, so the economy apparently is doing pretty well.\n\nFOX MATHEMATICS\n\nTo The End Is Near,\u201d if 93 million Americans are out of work like you say, the unemployment rate would be close to one-third. You better get your money back on that Fox News math class you took. You were right though about the American economy being in free fall, but it was before 2008, not after.\n\nWHEAT IS FOR THE BIRDS\n\nI threw some wheat bread out for the birds and they turned their nose up at it. It\u2019s weird that they get that they can be choosy about the bread they get for free.\n\nSHUSH\n\nTo my wife: Please stop hollering at the kids so loud when I\u2019m sitting right next to you. It hurts my ears.\n\nGET OFF THE KOOL-AID\n\nTo \u201cOverseas Money\u201d and \u201cNo Jobs,\u201d based on your comments I\u2019m assuming you mean manufacturing jobs when you talk about jobs going overseas. Despite the fact that manufacturing is alive and well in the U.S. (We just don\u2019t pay people $80 an hour to make knickknacks anymore.) Let\u2019s assume all the class warfare nonsense Democratic strategists and union leaders tell you is true and everything is made overseas. So what about the engineers who design the products in the U.S.? What about the people who set up the contracts with the overseas factories? What about the importers who bring the products over here? What about the longshoremen? What about the warehouse crews? The truck drivers and railway workers? What about the ad agencies getting the contracts to market the products? What about the sales representatives getting the products placed in retail stores? Oh, I forgot. Manufacturing is holier than thou when it comes to other jobs, and every economic woe could be solved in we just made more disposable widgets in this country again. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid.\n\nDEAD ANT, DEAD ANT\n\nTo get rid of the ants without the expense of an exterminator or messy sprays, you can buy ant traps at any store. You can get the ones in a four-pack at dollar stores.\n\nWe just had a problem with ants and the traps really do work, but be patient. It takes a couple of days to kill them all.\n\nI see the House approved $612 billion for defense spending, and yet they went to slash money for Amtrak. Where are their priorities? Oh. I know, with the defense lobbyists, that\u2019s where they are.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Primos news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Sound Off for Monday, May 18, 2015", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20150517/NEWS/150519674", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Sound Off for Monday, May 18, 2015"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "THANKS BOB & GINNYOn Friday evening my wife, granddaughter and I went to the Erin Pub for dinner.
