Frank Lucas, Jim Bridenstine Jim BridenstineRepublicans blast Pentagon energy programs Louie Gohmert faces his biggest challenge Rubio surges in Oklahoma: poll MORE, Markwayne Mullin, and Steve Russell. It also calls for Congress to take the American burying beetle off the endangered list.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe defense bill \u2014 which authorizes $612 billion in Pentagon spending and activities \u2014 isn't normally a place where you would find legislation on endangered bird listings, but supporters argue the bird species is interfering with the use of land used by the military.\n\nAlso, the annual defense bill is \"must-pass\" legislation that can be an easy vehicle for passage.\n\nA consortium of Democrats are also planning to take another shot at blocking the greater sage grouse provision, including Reps.

The House Rules Committee is scheduled to announce on Wednesday which out of the more than 300 amendments will be accepted.\n\nDuring the House Armed Services Committee's markup of the bill last month, Democrats argued the greater sage grouse provision had no place in a defense bill and were an attack on preservation efforts, but were defeated 36-26.\n\nThe provision proved to be one of the most hotly debated during the 19-hour session. The term \"greater sage grouse\" even started trending on Twitter in Washington, D.C. during the panel's debate.\n\nRepublicans on the panel argued that the bird population interferes with military land use throughout the country, including military training and testing.\n\n\"This is a perfect example I believe of the abuse of the Endangered Species Act and how it's being used to shut down military installations in the economy,\" said Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.)\n\nHe pointed out that the greater sage grouse is a game bird that is legally hunted in Georgia.\n\n\"We actually have hunting season on greater sage grouse in many states and any of you have hunted our there would recognize that there really is no shortage in most of the areas that I've been to,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The bird issue is one of the most contentious.", "description": "The bird issue is one of the most contentious.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The bird issue is one of the most contentious.", "title": "Defense bill could determine the fate of the lesser prairie chicken", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/241624-defense-bill-could-determine-lesser-prairie-chickens-fate", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/9d0fd64c-27b7-455a-8a82-e356088c75a1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/241624-defense-bill-could-determine-lesser-prairie-chickens-fate", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-11T13:39-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kristina Wong", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T13:39:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "keywords": "greater sage grouse, lesser prairie chicken, Defense bill, NDAA,Jim Bridenstine, Earl Blumenauer, Rick Larsen,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/241624-defense-bill-could-determine-lesser-prairie-chickens-fate", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The bird issue is one of the most contentious.", "card": "summary", "title": "Defense bill could determine the fate of the lesser prairie chicken"}, "dcterms.title": "Defense bill could determine the fate of the lesser prairie chicken"}, "article_summary": "Also, the annual defense bill is \"must-pass\" legislation that can be an easy vehicle for passage.\nThey have proposed a floor amendment that could be taken up during the defense bill debate.\nAfter the House Armed Services Committee adopted a measure in its defense policy bill to block special protections for the greater sage grouse, Republicans want to do the same for the lesser prairie chicken.\nA consortium of Democrats are also planning to take another shot at blocking the greater sage grouse provision, including Reps.
