Should gay couples be allowed to marry nationwide? They will consider cases stemming from four states. The arguments will be heard in April and a decision announced in June.\n\nFor more on the court\u2019s move, NewsHour contributor Marcia Coyle of \u201cThe National Law Journal,\u201d joins us.\n\nMarcia, a big day.\n\nMARCIA COYLE, The National Law Journal: Hi, Judy.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So we know gay marriage is now legal in 36 states. What\u2019s the significance of the court taking up these cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, as you probably remember, last October, the court had seven cases and it declined to review those cases.\n\nThe big difference between October and today is the fact that, in November, a lower federal appellate court broke with the trend across the lower federal appellate courts and upheld state bans on marriage by gay and lesbian couples, as well as bans on the recognition of legal out-of-state same-sex marriages.\n\nSo that created a circuit split, which is one of the key criterion \u2014 criteria for granting review by the Supreme Court.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So that was a couple of months ago. Any sense of what \u2014 I mean, other than the fact it is a split, any sense of why the court would jump on this and say, all right, we\u2019re now ready to look at this?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, I think they were waiting for the right cases to get to them, but I really do think the circuit split was something very important for them, because the Supreme Court wants to ensure uniformity of federal law, uniform application of the federal Constitution.\n\nAnd here you had the Sixth Circuit saying in four states these bans were OK, but you had all these other circuits saying they\u2019re not OK.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So what is the main question they\u2019re going to be wrestling with?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: The justices actually fashioned two questions.\n\nEven though they took four cases, they\u2019re not going to hear four separate arguments. They consolidated those cases, and there will be a decision on two questions that they told the lawyers in the cases to brief and be prepared to argue. First, does the 14th Amendment require states to license marriages by same-sex couples? And, second, does the 14th Amendment require states to recognize same-sex couples who are legally married out of state?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, do previous rulings by this court tell you, tell us very much about how they\u2019re likely to go on this next question?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, it\u2019s hard to say, Judy.\n\nWe know that, in 2013, the court took up the definition of marriage in the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and that definition said marriage was between one man and one woman, and the court, in a 5-4 decision, struck the definition as it is applied to legally married same-sex couples. So the court was divided there.\n\nBut the majority opinion had two very important strands, equal protection and federalism, that marriage had always been the province of the states to regulate. So it\u2019s going to be very interesting. What the court\u2019s dealing with today are state laws, not the federal law, and we will just have to wait and see how they view the role of the states here today in this type of issue.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, I know it\u2019s always dangerous to speculate.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But I was reading today the sense is that it\u2019s clear how some of the justices are going to go one way or another, but it\u2019s not at all clear how some in the middle will go.\n\nWho are you watching more than anyone else?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: OK.\n\nI think I am going to be watching Justice Kennedy, as always, although he wrote the 2013 majority opinion in the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and he\u2019s been very strong in prior cases involving gay rights under the Constitution.\n\nBut I\u2019m also going to watch, I think, the chief justice to see what he does. His dissent in that 2013 case focused on the federalism aspects. But I\u2019m not sure, you know, where he really stands here and what\u2019s going to go through his mind in terms of the fact that this is one of the most important social civil rights issues of our time.\n\nAnd I think he\u2019s going to be very conscious of that, conscious of the fact that 36 states now allow same-sex marriages, and conscious of the court and its standing as an institution in society, as well as that he has a lot of integrity, I believe, in terms of how he views the Constitution.\n\nSo I think he\u2019s going to be a very interesting figure to watch in this. I think Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito are leaning against same-sex marriages, based on what they wrote in that 2013 case.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this one is one we\u2019re all going to be \u2014 I know you are going to be at the court and watching.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: It raises the stakes. And they already had a potentially major case on the docket, the challenge to the Affordable Care Act. So, it\u2019s\u2026\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is the second really big one.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: This is the second really big one, yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: This year.\n\nMarcia Coyle, we thank you. We will see you in April, but certainly before that too.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: You will.
