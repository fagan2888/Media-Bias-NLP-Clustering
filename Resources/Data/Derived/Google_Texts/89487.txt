Two weeks before House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary election, his challenger Dave Brat launched a campaign ad featuring Cantor with his arm around the shoulders of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The text of the ad read as follows:

“There are 20 million Americans who can’t find a full-time job. But Eric Cantor wants to give corporations another 20 million foreign workers to hire instead.”

The purpose of the ad was to link Cantor to immigration reform, a cause that Zuckerberg (and much of Silicon Valley) considers a No. 1 political priority. And while we can’t say for sure whether the issue of immigration reform was the knife in Cantor’s back, the subtext of the ad is intriguing: The Tea Party sees Silicon Valley as toxic. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of the people!

Last November, the Hill reported that Zuckerberg had named immigration reform “one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time.” One has only to look at the comments appended to that article when it was copy-and-pasted to www.teaparty.org to see why Brat’s campaign team figured associating Zuckerberg with Cantor was a knockout punch.

The comments are a typical putrid brew of racism, xenophobia, illiteracy and anti-Semitism — but there’s also a strain of good old American populism, a strong sense of anger at the fact that America’s corporate executives care more about the bottom line than they do the welfare of the American people.

Zuckerberg is a phony sell out who only wants cheap labor. The kind of money these people have can negate millions of your votes and buy Washington. This is no longer a democracy-its a money game, and these people know it. Zuckerberg is an idiot and a betrayer to all us LEGAL BORN AND LEGAL IMMIGRANTS!
