(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nScott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts who Elizabeth Warren defeated in 2012, has decided that he wants his old job back. Well, not exactly his old job. Late last year Brown sold his Massachusetts home, packed up his belongings and inched north across the border to New Hampshire. He\u2019s been making feints toward running for awhile and on Friday made that speculation semi-official, forming an exploratory committee to challenge Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s (D-NH) in 2014. The last time he ran for Senate, Brown agreed to a pact with Warren that largely prevented outside campaign spending but, based on initial comments he made over the weekend, Brown appears ready to embrace the wild world of super PACs and dark money nonprofits in order to reclaim his old post at the Capitol.\n\nWarren and Brown knew their 2012 campaign would be a hotbed of political excitement. She was a favorite of liberal activists, a YouTube sensation adored by the Netroots. Brown was the Republican heartthrob who claimed Ted Kennedy\u2019s old seat and almost squashed Obamacare. Republican commentators immediately began dreaming of him as a future presidential prospect after he won a special election to the Senate in 2010. Their match-up was sure to be a magnet for outside political spending, but neither campaign wanted to lose control of their messaging. The two sides crafted a deal: they would both publicly disavow campaign ads from outside groups and urge those organizations to save their money. Should any group go against their wishes, Brown or Warren would have to donate 50 percent of the money spent on the ad buy to a charity of their opponent\u2019s choice. They called their deal \u201cThe People\u2019s Pledge.\u201d Neither candidate hurt for money in that race \u2014 they collectively spent over $81 million in the most expensive Senate race to-date. But the pledge did the trick; outside spending played a minor role in their campaign.\n\nShaheen sent a letter to Brown on Saturday offering to play by those same rules in 2014. \u201cI believe it limited the influence of outside groups and allowed the people\u2019s voices to be heard,\u201d said her letter urging her new opponent to once again sign \u201cThe People\u2019s Pledge.\u201d But Brown scoffed at the potential for another deal. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to view Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s actions as anything other than hypocritical and self-serving,\u201d Brown responded in a statement. \u201cThe people of New Hampshire can see through the Washington-style game she is playing.\u201d\n\nWhy the change of heart? Perhaps it\u2019s as simple as a sour taste for the pledge after Brown lost in 2012. But more likely his newfound acceptance of outside groups owes to the circumstances of a 2014 campaign. Brown had nothing to gain by embracing dark money in 2012. Anything conservatives directed his way was bound to be matched by liberals who were devoted to getting Warren into office. That likely won\u2019t be the case against Shaheen. Her name carries less cachet among liberals, while Brown can count on the conservative base rallying around the cause. In light of Brown\u2019s announcement, the Karl Rove founded American Crossroads has bought $650,000 in ads attacking Shaheen that are set to run this week. Earlier in the year, the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity poured $700,000 into New Hampshire ads attacking Shaheen for her support of Obamacare. With allies like these, Brown has no reason to make any sort of pledge to rely on funding from the people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brown announced that he's forming an exploratory committee to consider running for Senate in NH and won't say no to dark money groups that want to help out.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Brown announced that he's forming an exploratory committee to consider running for Senate in NH and won't say no to dark money groups that want to help out.", "title": "Scott Brown Ditches \"The People's Pledge\" for Dark Money | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AP285691107671_crop.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2014-07-31T17:22:16-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/03/18/scott-brown-ditches-the-peoples-pledge-for-dark-money/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brown announced that he's forming an exploratory committee to consider running for Senate in NH and won't say no to dark money groups that want to help out.", "title": "Scott Brown Ditches \"The People's Pledge\" for Dark Money | BillMoyers.com", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AP285691107671_crop.jpg", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-03-18T14:23:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-31T17:22:16-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140318}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf581\"", "article_summary": "But the pledge did the trick; outside spending played a minor role in their campaign.\nWith allies like these, Brown has no reason to make any sort of pledge to rely on funding from the people.\nPerhaps it\u2019s as simple as a sour taste for the pledge after Brown lost in 2012.\nScott Brown uses a bull horn at a campaign stop with New Jersey Gov.\nLate last year Brown sold his Massachusetts home, packed up his belongings and inched north across the border to New Hampshire."}
