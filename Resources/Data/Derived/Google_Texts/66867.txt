SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Wondering what’s behind a recent spike in gas prices in California?

Experts say a shortage caused by problems with the state’s refineries is to blame.

AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report put the average nationwide price for a gallon of regular on Saturday at just over $2. That compares to $2.81 in California, where gas prices have risen over the past week or so after falling since Labor Day.

Allison Mac of Gasbuddy.com in Los Angeles tells the San Jose Mercury News (http://bayareane.ws/1NH9j0j) there have been some unplanned maintenance issues at refineries. She said prices in California could rise even more before they fall.

The Mercury News cites ExxonMobil’s Torrance plant among the refineries experiencing problems. The plant hasn’t recovered from an explosion in February.
