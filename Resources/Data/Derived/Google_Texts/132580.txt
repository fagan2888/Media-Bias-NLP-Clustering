The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has exploded, with celebrities taking to YouTube to share videos of themselves being normal kooky people, and even taking it to the next level by promoting other causes they feel passionate about. The latest Ice Bucket Challenge video comes from notoriously opinionated funny man Bill Maher.

In the video, Maher dumps a bucket of ice water on his head rather unceremoniously, before challenging Dick Cheney and launching into a more serious speech.

“ALS is a bad disease, but there are diseases that kill more. Malaria has killed more people than all the wars, famines and natural disasters in history. It demands an even greater response. This is a gallon of gasoline. I’m going to pour it on my head, and I challenge other people to take the Set Yourself on Fire Challenge to wipe out Malaria in our lifetime.”
