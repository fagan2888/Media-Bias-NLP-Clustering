More minutes ticked by, and bystanders wondered whether he would be the final one. Suddenly, the small crowd that had gathered on the street corner shrieked and cheered, spotty at first, then louder.\n\nAround the bend came Bogie Dumitrescu of Boulder, hunched over, sprinting with the kind of gait and fury only someone who has run nearly 100\u00bd miles can.\n\nPHOTOS: 2015 Hardrock 100 Endurance Run\n\nThe crowd grew louder and he touched the Hardrock and fell to the ground in a heap, try to collect his breath. His final time: 47:59:59 \u2014 as close as runners can get before officially being disqualified.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get up the hills without hyperventilating,\u201d said Dumitrescu, who is originally from Romania and waited six years to land a lottery spot in the run. \u201cBut I could run downhill.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Bogie Dumitrescu finishes Hardrock 100 with one second to spare\n\nUphill, he would walk or jog 30 steps, then wait 10 seconds to recover. He didn\u2019t know whether he would miss the cutoff by 10 minutes, an hour or five hours. In the final stretch, his only worry was whether he\u2019d pass out before reaching the finish line at Silverton High School.\n\n\u201cBecause of this problem, I was physically running holding my breath (at the end),\u201d he said.\n\nAfter starting Friday at 6 a.m., runners traversed through snowstorms, rain, thunder, lightning, mud and ice, climbing 33,992 feet, topping out at the 14,048-foot Handies Peak and averaging 11,186 feet of elevation.\n\nOne runner wrote about seeing a mountain lion along the course, while others spoke of seeing bighorn sheep, and still another \u201ca pair of green eyes\u201d that followed him for some two hours.\n\nAnd then the hallucinations \u2014 an inevitable side effect of prolonged physical exertion with little or no sleep. On a poster inside the Silverton High School gym, Tyler Curiel wrote about seeing one of his pacesetters jump into the sky, streaming rainbows from his hands as he floated into the clouds. Another wrote of seeing gnomes in the trees, and boats in Grouse Gulch, the aid station around Mile 40.\n\nMore than 24 hours before Dumitrescu, 27-year-old Spanish endurance athlete Kilian Jornet (Team Salomon) had won, setting a counterclockwise course record in 23:28:10 \u2014 adding to the one he set last year in the opposite direction \u2014 despite having gotten lost in deep snow near Oscar Pass. The previous record was 24:25, set in 2013.\n\nJornet had company from Canadian Adam Campbell \u2014 who finished third for the second consecutive year \u2014 through 36 miles. Jornet finally passed him when summiting Handies Peak and never looked back, adding to his lead throughout Friday night and into Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cI was falling through the snow,\u201d said Jornet, who blamed himself for getting lost because he had a GPS. \u201cThe calves hurt, because the snow was breaking. The ice caught my calves.\u201d\n\nBut he said he wanted to return here \u2014 that this event was more than just the run, but about the community, its people and the wilderness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a nice ambiance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only just the course. It\u2019s the course, it\u2019s the beautiful, the people you see. The people here, it makes it much more special. \u201c\n\nNew Zealand runner Anna Frost (Team Salomon), running just her second 100-miler ever, overcame a difficult middle part of the race, where she lost her lead to Boulder\u2019s Darcy Piceu, before charging ahead and passing her near the 89th mile. She won in 28:22:50 and finished eighth overall.\n\nShe kept insisting to her pacesetters that all she needed was a quick nap. But deep down, she knew if she went to sleep, her race would be finished. She called it the most difficult race of her career.\n\n\u201cWhen I actually thought, \u2018OK, let\u2019s just do this\u2019 and just forget about the pain in your legs, and just go for it,\u201d Frost said. \u201cYou just get overidden by something. I don\u2019t know what it is. But you see it all the time at the end of a race. \u2026 It doesn\u2019t come from your brain. Your brain doesn\u2019t say it. But your body somehow does that. I somehow found that.\u201d\n\nPiceu, who has won this race three times and now finished it six, finished in 28:57, was 10th overall and the second female.\n\n\u201cI think for the most part it was going really well,\u201d Piceu said. \u201cAbove 12,000 feet, my respiration went through the roof and my lungs felt really tight. So I just sort of slowly creeped my way up Grant Swamp Pass, and I just turned around and looked down and there she (Frost) was coming up the pass, and I just thought, \u2018Oh my gosh.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn all, 123 of the 152 entered runners officially finished the race \u2014 three more crossed in the minutes and hours following the cutoff \u2014 for an astounding rate of nearly 79 percent. Historically, about 60 percent of runners finish.\n\nWill either top finisher be back? Jornet has nothing left to accomplish \u2014 he\u2019s won twice and has course records in both directions, but his appreciation for sheer beauty and ruggedness of the terrain is apparent. Frost agrees.\n\n\u201cYesterday I was like, \u2018Absolutely no way,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThis morning I was thinking, \u2018It\u2019s a really bad idea.\u2019 But it\u2019s in my blood.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com, twitter.com/danielpetty\n\nTop 5 Male 2015 Hardrock 100 Finishers\n\nKilian Jornet (Spain), 23:28\n\nMike Foote (USA), 25:45\n\nAdam Campbell (Canada), 26:49\n\nChris Price (USA), 26:52\n\nTroy Howard (USA), 27:03\n\nTop 5 Female 2015 Hardrock 100 Finishers\n\nAnna Frost (New Zealand), 28:22\n\nDarcy Piceu (Boulder), 28:57\n\nDarla Askew (USA), 32:05\n\nMissy Gosney (USA), 33:22\n\nKari Fraser (USA), in 38:23\n\nUpdated July 13 at 5:18 p.m. The following corrected information has been added to this article: Because of an error by a reporter, the fifth place female finisher was incorrect.
