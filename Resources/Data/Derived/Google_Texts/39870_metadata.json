Others will be lucky and see no change at all.\n\nShawn Evenhaim, founder and CEO of Canoga Park-based California Home Builders, has about 25 people on the payroll and he offers them health care through the business. And they will still have it after Jan. 1, Evenhaim said.\n\n\u201cWe have been providing it for many years. I am a true believer that employees need the right health benefits. I think they should have a pension and medical,\u201d said Evenhaim, who started his company in 1994.\n\nHis business uses subcontractors to build single-family and multi-family housing and currently has 10 projects under way and about 1,000 trades people at the job sites. Evenhaim is worried that the new health care law would adversely affect the home building industry, which is in a recovery mode.\n\nGood help may be hard to find, he said.\n\n\u201cI have some vendors that have 40 employees and they say the won\u2019t hire more because of the health care act (requirement),\u201d Evenhaim said. \u201cWe need more and more people to grow. In our industry it\u2019s getting busier and we have a shortage of supplies and a shortage of labor. Obamacare is not the only reason but it\u2019s one of the reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy with how Obamacare went down and the main reason is I don\u2019t think everyone studied it enough,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand it and 99 percent of business owners today don\u2019t understand what it means.\u201d\n\nBut Gary Toebben, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, is optimistic that the new law will have benefits.\n\n\u201cThere will be many small businesses that will find some new opportunities in private health care under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployees will be able to look to the new exchange that is being created and review and study those and determine what is the best option for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusinesses can also take advantage of federal tax credits the law will provide. And he anticipates that there will be a variety of plans offered in the marketplace.\n\nIn August, Covered California, the state\u2019s marketplace exchange, announced health insurance plans for small business owners ready to start shopping around. Blue Shield of California, Chinese Community Health Plan, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, Sharp Health Plan and Western Health Advantage are among the carriers to offer low cost plans.\n\n\u201cFor every family and every company it will be different,\u201d Toebben said of the coverage. \u201cSome of the prices quoted for individual coverage through the exchange have been much lower than you can currently get in the private marketplace, especially if you are older,\u201d Toebben said.\n\nThe chamber has been holding information seminars explaining the health care act and another session will be presented by the California Endowment. It will present an Employee Wellness Conference on Nov. 8 from 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the chamber offices, 350 S. Bixel St., Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us know yet what is going to happen. Sometimes in a new system it\u2019s very difficult to predict consumer behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nSome fallout is already occurring in advance of the Jan. 1 implementation.\n\nMore than 250 businesses across the country have slashed employee hours or implemented other measures to deal with costs associated with the new law, according to the Los Angeles-based Investors Business Daily. The publication has been tracking the number of employers that have cut hours because of the employer mandate, and the number had reached 258 as of Sept. 3.\n\nUPS, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest employer, last month said that in some cases spouses would be dropped from the company\u2019s health care plan if the spouse could obtain care from their employer.\n\nAnd various outlets reported last month that Los Angeles-based Forever 21, the teen fashion retailer with about 30,000 workers nationwide, would cut some employees to 29.5 hours per week, just under the mandate required 30 hours for company-provided care, at some of its stores.\n\nHowever, the company said that few of its workers would be affected and the new law was not a factor in the decision.\n\n\u201cForever 21, like all retailers, staffs its stores based on projected store sales, completely independent of the Affordable Care Act. After a recent evaluation, Forever 21 realigned its staffing needs to better reflect sales expectations. This realignment impacted 196 employees, less than 1 percent of all U.S. store employees,\u201d company spokeswoman Annie Austerlitz said.\n\nStill, there is uncertainty about how the Affordable Care Act will affect businesses.\n\nFor example, 15 percent of Americans don\u2019t know what Obamacare is, according to a report released this month by Bankrate.com. The report also said that 28 percent of Americans are feeling more negative about the Affordable Care Act now than they were 12 months ago \u2014 twice as many as the 14 percent who are feeling more positive.\n\nBusinesses, as well as the public, have a steep learning curve ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just three weeks away from when the new health insurance exchanges will begin accepting applications, and we\u2019re still observing a disturbing lack of consumer education,\u201d Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman said in a statement. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change soon, millions of Americans could miss important deadlines or make uninformed decisions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businesses \u2014 those with 50 or more workers \u2014 scored some additional breathing room this summer in complying with what has become a vexing component of the Affordable Care Act, to offer health care to their employees by Jan. 1.In J", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Reform concerns some business owners", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-reform-concerns-some-business-owners", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20130921/NEWS/130929894/AR/0/AR-130929894.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Reform concerns some business owners"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Businesses \u2014 those with 50 or more workers \u2014 scored some additional breathing room this summer in complying with what has become a vexing component of the Affordable Care Act, to offer health care to their employees by Jan. 1.In J", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Reform concerns some business owners", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-reform-concerns-some-business-owners", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20130921/NEWS/130929894/AR/0/AR-130929894.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc649\"", "article_summary": "\u201cForever 21, like all retailers, staffs its stores based on projected store sales, completely independent of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThere will be many small businesses that will find some new opportunities in private health care under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\nThe chamber has been holding information seminars explaining the health care act and another session will be presented by the California Endowment.\nStill, there is uncertainty about how the Affordable Care Act will affect businesses.\nEvenhaim is worried that the new health care law would adversely affect the home building industry, which is in a recovery mode."}
