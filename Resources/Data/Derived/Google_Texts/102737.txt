NASHVILLE--Make no mistake: Mitt Romney is proud of his sweeping health reforms in Massachusetts during his tenure as governor. But he's not proud to be an example of how it will work for the entire nation.

"I'm proud of what we did, and believe by virtue of what we did we helped save lives," the 2012 Republican presidential candidate told thousands during Thursday's keynote session at the America's Health Insurance Plans Institute 2015. "But it's right for Massachusetts; it's not right for what should be adopted for the entire country."
