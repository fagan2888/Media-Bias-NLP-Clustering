The Affordable Care Act currently recognizes small businesses as those with no more than 50 employees. That will change on Jan. 1, 2016 when that number jumps to 100 employees. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D,. is co-sponsoring a bill that would keep the number where it is.

"This legislation is designed to help small businesses so that they don't see such large premium increases in the future," said Hoeven.

Hoeven says that if the number of employees that officially make up a small business jumps to 100, 150 businesses covering 20,000 North Dakotans would be affected.
