Jordan, MBA, has dealt with a diagnosis of co-occurring mental health issues and substance abuse for the past 30 years of his adult life.\n\nIt may come as a surprise to some that a person with behavioral health issues could be successful as a business and healthcare leader. The stereotype that those with behavioral health problems are violent, unemployable, strange, or erratic still exists.\n\nIn fact, before he received a behavioral health diagnosis, Jordan had a similar image of those dealing with mental illness.\n\n\"Like many people, I probably saw mental illness as a homeless individual with a shopping cart with all their belongings loaded into it, pushing it down the street,\" says Jordan, the vice president of wellness and recovery for Boston-based Beacon Health Options, a behavioral health management company that serves 48 million people in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"When I was given my original diagnosis, it came as a real shock to me because I did not ever feel that I had a mental illness. Life to me was normal.\"\n\nFor many Americans, living with behavioral health issues is the norm. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, in 2014 an estimated 43.6 million\u2014or 18.1% of U.S. adults age 18 or older\u2014experienced any form of mental illness (AMI, which includes mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders, but excludes developmental and substance use disorders).\n\n\"We know behavioral health integration in primary care works. We've had 90 randomized controlled trials that have proven it.\"\n\nThat same year, about 4% of U.S. adults, nearly 10 million, had serious mental illness (SMI, which results in serious functional impairment that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities).\n\nThat's a significant portion of the population, and the challenges surrounding delivery of behavioral healthcare\u2014stigma, access to care, utilization of resources, funding, cost, and reimbursement\u2014are significant as well.\n\nThese issues have dogged behavioral healthcare for decades, but now, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's emphasis on population health, quality outcomes, and value-based payment models, industry leaders are recognizing the integral role that behavioral healthcare must have in patient care, and they are developing solutions.\n\nWhy now?\n\n\"I think CEOs and healthcare leaders across the country are realizing, as they move toward value-based contracting, behavioral health is a unique variable that can help accomplish the Triple Aim,\" says David Deopere, PhD, corporate vice president for behavioral health development at Des Moines, Iowa-based UnityPoint Health, a system with 3,788 licensed beds, 185 physician clinics, and total operating revenue of $3.8 billion in 2014.\n\nIt's hard to deny that behavioral healthcare is a key component to achieving the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim goals of improving the patient experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing the per capita cost of healthcare.\n\n\"When you start to look at value-based contracting, capitated-type contracting, we know that people with behavioral comorbidity go to their primary care doctor more often with depression\u2014comorbid depression\u2014than if they don't have comorbid depression,\" Deopere says. \"They also go to the emergency rooms more frequently. They get readmitted to the hospital more frequently.\"\n\nTo Deopere's point, according to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment Access Commission, total spending for an enrollee with a behavioral health diagnosis was almost four times greater than for an enrollee without a behavioral health diagnosis.\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that mental health issues and substance abuse are the leading cause of disability worldwide, and according to a fact sheet from the National\n\nAlliance on Mental Illness, some $193 billion per year in workplace earnings is lost due to untreated mental illness. Plus, individuals living with serious mental illness face an increased risk of having chronic medical conditions, and adults living with serious mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than other Americans, largely due to treatable medical conditions.\n\n\"The real drive around this, and the real conversation around this starting now is because of population health and accountable care organizations,\" says Martha Whitecotton, MSN, FACHE, senior vice president of behavioral health services at Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, North Carolina, a nonprofit organization with more than 900 locations and 7,395 licensed beds throughout North and South Carolina.\n\n\"If you ever hope to see progress in health outcomes for diabetics or patients with congestive heart failure, you have to address both behavioral and physical health. The way people are going to be paid, placing their payment at risk for overall health and overall cost, it's forcing the conversation around what do we do about mental illness.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the industry turns toward value-based care and population health management, leaders are recognizing that physical healthcare alone is not sufficient.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "healthcare, public health, population health, mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Plus, individuals living with serious mental illness face an increased risk of having chronic medical conditions, and adults living with serious mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than other Americans, largely due to treatable medical conditions.\nThe World Health Organization reports that mental health issues and substance abuse are the leading cause of disability worldwide, and according to a fact sheet from the NationalAlliance on Mental Illness, some $193 billion per year in workplace earnings is lost due to untreated mental illness.\nTo Deopere's point, according to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment Access Commission, total spending for an enrollee with a behavioral health diagnosis was almost four times greater than for an enrollee without a behavioral health diagnosis.\nClarence E.
