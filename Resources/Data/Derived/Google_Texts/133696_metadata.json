(channel3000.com)\n\n\u201cI owe part of my life to the doctors and nurses at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital,\u201d Rothbauer told WSIC-TV. \u201cI was in a coma. I couldn\u2019t very well say, \u2018Hey, take me to the next hospital.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe bill would have only been $1,500, but because of balanced billing through the Affordable Care Act, the 30-year-old owes at least $50,000. Her insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, took care of $156,000 to cover her 16-day hospitalization. St. Mary\u2019s also reduced her bill by $90,000, the TV station reported.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop an onslaught of bills from doctors, the ambulance ride to St. Mary\u2019s and physical therapy.\n\nHer bills are the product of balance billing through the Affordable Care Act that have Megan Rothbauer facing possible bankruptcy over hospital bills. (channel3000.com)\n\nHer soon-to-be fianc\u00e9 chose his words carefully when he described the situation to the Madison TV station before a table stacked with bills.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m pissed off,\u201d Ben Johnsen said.\n\nThe couple is planning to get engaged, but her potential declaration of bankruptcy over the bills would make that impossible for them.\n\n\u201cI think my hardest issue is I had no control and I still have no control over what is my future,\u201d Rothbauer added.\n\nnhensley@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "NICOLE HENSLEY", "twitter": {"description": "The day Megan Rothbauer\u2019s heart stopped beating, she racked up more than $250,000 in hospital bills.", "title": "Wis. woman faces bankruptcy after cardiac arrest at 29", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/wis-woman-faces-bankruptcy-cardiac-arrest-29-article-1.2008741", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2008738.1415828575!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/er13n-3-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Nicole Hensley", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-12T21:46:41", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/wis-woman-faces-bankruptcy-cardiac-arrest-29-article-1.2008741", "parsely-title": "Wis. woman faces bankruptcy after cardiac arrest at 29", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-12T16:46:41-0500", "sailthru.title": "Wis. woman faces bankruptcy after cardiac arrest at 29", "nydn_section": "U.S.", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2008738.1415828575!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/er13n-3-web.jpg", "description": "The day Megan Rothbauer\u2019s heart stopped beating, she racked up more than $250,000 in hospital bills.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "U.S.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The day Megan Rothbauer\u2019s heart stopped beating, she racked up more than $250,000 in hospital bills.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The day Megan Rothbauer\u2019s heart stopped beating, she racked up more than $250,000 in hospital bills.", "title": "Wis. woman faces bankruptcy after cardiac arrest at 29", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/wis-woman-faces-bankruptcy-cardiac-arrest-29-article-1.2008741", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2008738.1415828575!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/er13n-3-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "NICOLE HENSLEY", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2008738.1415828575!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/er13n-3-web.jpg"}, "article_summary": "(channel3000.com)\u201cI owe part of my life to the doctors and nurses at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital,\u201d Rothbauer told WSIC-TV.\nShe spent 10 days at St. Mary\u2019s in a medically-induced coma and then nearly a week in the cardiac unit recovering from her near-death experience.\nHer heart tremored for nearly an hour as paramedics took Rothbauer to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital instead of Meriter, which is only three blocks away.\nThe day Megan Rothbauer\u2019s heart stopped beating, she racked up more than $250,000 in hospital bills.\nHer insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, took care of $156,000 to cover her 16-day hospitalization."}
