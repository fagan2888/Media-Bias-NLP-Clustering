Have you seen Coheed and Cambria‘s video for Funny or Die? The one where they create a song out of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissenting views on the same-sex marriage and Affordable Care act that passed last month? If you haven’t, you really should.

In the meantime, Coheed, Cambria and frontman Claudio Sanchez’ hair headline this week’s installment of Mandatory Music with the lead single from their upcoming album, The Color Before the Sun – which will be the first from the prog-metal outfit outside their fictional “Armory Wars” universe. We’ve also got a new song from Maximum Balloon (the project of TV on the Radio‘s Dave Sitek) featuring the Yeah Yeah Yeahs‘ Karen O; a new song from British post-punks Public Image Ltd.; a collaboration between Sweet Valley (the side-project of Wavves‘ Nathan Williams) and GZA; and a moody track from Destroyer.
