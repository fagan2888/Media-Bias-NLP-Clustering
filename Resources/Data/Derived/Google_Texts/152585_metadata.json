Contrary to the statements made by some, Obamacare interrupts insurance for everyone, not just the Americans who purchase coverage directly in the individual market.\n\nThese sweeping changes are why the President\u2019s proposed actions, and alternative legislative efforts like Chairman Fred Upton\u2019s \u201cKeep Your Health Plan Act\u201d (H.R. 3350), Senator Ron Johnson\u2019s S. 1617, and Senator Mary Landrieu\u2019s S. 1642, while well intentioned, will not solve the problem. The Upton bill, for example, would allow people to enroll in plans that currently exist in the individual market for one more year. All of these efforts are temporary and, most importantly, do not roll back the many onerous Obamacare mandates that disrupt coverage for the 49 percent of Americans with employer-provided coverage.\n\nHow Obamacare Impacts Everyone\u2019s Coverage\n\nEmployer-Provided \u201cGrandfathered\u201d Insurance Plans: Designed for Extinction While the Obamacare bill included \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plan language theoretically allowing Americans to keep plans they have and like, other sections of the legislation undermined this promise. For instance, Section 2301 of the reconciliation legislation included provisions requiring all plans, including \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans, to abide by some of the law\u2019s new benefit mandates\u2014thus making the plans different from pre-Obamacare offerings.\n\nShortly after the law\u2019s enactment, the Obama Administration released regulations further restricting individuals\u2019 ability to keep their pre-Obamacare plans. The regulations stated that an increase in co-payments of more than $5, or an increase in the employee\u2019s share of premiums paid by more than 5 percent, could cause plans to lose \u201cgrandfathered\u201d status.\n\nThe result: the percent of covered workers in \u201cGrandfathered plans\u201d went from 56 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2013. Employer-provided-coverage is impacted by Obamacare in this and many other ways.\n\nIndividual Health Insurance Plans: Upending Coverage for Millions Because individuals who buy their own health insurance receive no employer subsidy for their health coverage, and often receive no taxpayer subsidy, they frequently shop for the most economical plan available. However, most individual plans do not comply with Obamacare\u2019s new mandated benefits.\n\nObamacare includes a list of 10 \u201cessential benefits\u201d that health plans must cover\u2014including coverage of maternity services, habilitative services, and pediatric vision care.\n\nThe law also requires that most health plans cover at least 60 percent of expected medical expenses. A study last year suggested that more than half of individual market insurance policies do not meet these so-called actuarial value requirements.\n\nBecause they do not comply with the law\u2019s new required benefits, one expert has concluded that as many as 85 percent of individual health insurance policies\u2014affecting up to 16 million individuals\u2014will be cancelled due to Obamacare.\n\nSmall Business Insurance Plans: Canceled for Nonconformity Obamacare\u2019s effects will not be felt only in the individual market. The Administration\u2019s own regulations assumed that up to 69 percent of small business plans\u2014covering as many as 41 million Americans\u2014could be lost, because they do not comply with Obamacare\u2019s requirements.\n\nFor instance, Obamacare sets maximum deductibles for small business insurance plans at $2,000 for a single person. However, nearly one-third of covered workers at small firms are in plans that do not meet this requirement\u2014meaning these individuals could face higher costs, or the loss of their current plan, or both.\n\nWhen it comes to both individual and small business insurance policies, losing one\u2019s policy will often come with a big price tag. A Heritage Foundation analysis concluded that Obamacare\u2019s benefit mandates will raise individual insurance premiums in 42 out of 47 states, in many cases causing rates to double.\n\nJust as eliminating pre-Obamacare health plans was one major result of the law, so too are the higher premiums many will face upon losing their plan. It\u2019s why the American people need relief from this unworkable, unfair, and unpopular law.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Heritage Foundation", "title": "Losing Health Insurance Due to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.heritage.org/research/factsheets/2013/11/losing-health-insurance-due-to-obamacare", "image": "http://www.heritage.org/~/media/heritage.ashx", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation"}, "twitter": {"site": "@heritage", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heritage"}, "robots": "NOODP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Losing Health Insurance Due to ObamacareAbout the AuthorMillions of Americans are finding out they will lose their current health plan due to Obamacare.\nIndividual Health Insurance Plans: Upending Coverage for Millions Because individuals who buy their own health insurance receive no employer subsidy for their health coverage, and often receive no taxpayer subsidy, they frequently shop for the most economical plan available.\nHow Obamacare Impacts Everyone\u2019s CoverageEmployer-Provided \u201cGrandfathered\u201d Insurance Plans: Designed for Extinction While the Obamacare bill included \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plan language theoretically allowing Americans to keep plans they have and like, other sections of the legislation undermined this promise.\nThese sweeping changes are why the President\u2019s proposed actions, and alternative legislative efforts like Chairman Fred Upton\u2019s \u201cKeep Your Health Plan Act\u201d (H.R.\nFor instance, Obamacare sets maximum deductibles for small business insurance plans at $2,000 for a single person."}
