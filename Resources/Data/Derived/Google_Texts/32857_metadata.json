Mike Pence wants to increase taxes on poor people, or as he puts it, \u201chave skin in the game\u201d, when it comes to their health and wellness needs. I guess the idea is if you pay a forced tax into a savings account instead of buying food, then you\u2019ll be more inclined to be healthier. And, he\u2019s like to go to Washington to seek permission to do this.\n\nPence wrote a letter requesting to meet with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to go through outstanding issues with Indiana\u2019s health insurance expansion. Pence wants to avoid expanding Medicaid for Hoosiers which pays for all health related expenses. Expanding Medicaid is a requirement under the ACA law for states, but Indiana was granted a one year waiver so we can explore options with Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP). HIP is capped out for the state leaving hundreds of thousands without insurance in Indiana.\n\nThe \u201cskin\u201d Pence is referring to is a health savings account linked with Indiana\u2019s Healthy Indiana Plan which only covers around 40,000 Hoosiers. The \u201cskin in the game\u201d is the same republican concept referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d in the Affordable Care Act which the Supreme Court ruled as \u201ca tax\u201d causing the entire republican party, through the help of their right-wing news media propaganda machine, to go on a year-long assault telling Americans, \u201cObama is taking away your rights and freedom by forcing you to buy insurance\u201d and \u201cObama is forcing a tax on the Middle Class\u201d.\n\nWhat the right-wing conservative media failed to tell viewers was the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d or \u201cskin in the game\u201d came from the right-wing conservative think tank, Heritage Foundation, and was used as the essential part of RomneyCare in Massachusetts, and was also forced upon ObamaCare.\n\nHowever, in Indiana, the republicans and Pence take it one step farther by asking those living in poverty should also be mandated to give toward their health care. What Pence and his counterparts fail to grasp is if working Americans can\u2019t save money, how can you expect those in poverty to save money? Pence is forcing them to choose between health care or food, and since the same republicans keep cutting food stamps, it\u2019s getting even more desperate.\n\nA CNN Money financial survey confirms what most people already know, but Pence and his ideological billionaire supporters don\u2019t seem to get it \u2013 \u201cAfter paying debts and taking care of housing, car and child care-related expenses, the respondents said there just isn\u2019t enough money left over for saving more.\u201d\n\nIn addition, since Pence has refused to expand Medicaid, those making slightly above poverty levels, don\u2019t qualify for federal tax credits so they have to pay full price for health insurance premiums.\n\nHoosier republicans keep denying there is a \u201cWar on the Poor\u201d, but their policy making decisions indicate otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Muncie, IN - Gov.
