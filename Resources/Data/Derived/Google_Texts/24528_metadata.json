Tom Rice (R., S.C.) and constitutional law expert David Rivkin on Wednesday predicted victory in the lawsuit the House is launching against President Barack Obama.\n\nThe House Rules Committee held a hearing on the proposed lawsuit, which is intended to prove the unconstitutionality of Obama\u2019s unilateral delay of the employer mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act. Witnesses at the hearing argued about whether the House has standing to sue the president to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that this lawsuit will succeed,\u201d Rivkin said in an interview. \u201cI certainly expect there to be a propaganda offensive to try to stop it, but I don\u2019t see any fundamental legal problems, with regards to standing or the merits.\u201d\n\nRice said he is \u201cconfident we\u2019ll receive settlement of judgment by September,\u201d though Rivkin anticipates a favorable ruling in a D.C. district court by November.\n\nThe Rules Committee is set to mark up a resolution next week that seeks the authority to sue the president for actions \u201cinconsistent with his duties under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Once passed, the resolution would have to be voted on by the full House. A vote is expected by the end of the month, with the lawsuit to follow in late August.\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) announced last week that the lawsuit would focus on the administration\u2019s decision in 2013 to delay the enforcement of the employer mandate under Obamacare, which requires businesses with over 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance or face a fine.\n\nRice criticized the president\u2019s unilateral actions.\n\n\u201cIn a sense he\u2019s rewriting the tax code,\u201d Rice said. \u201cAnd if a president has that power, then what\u2019s to stop the next president from saying, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like the maximum tax bracket, and therefore I\u2019m not going to enforce it\u2019?\u201d\n\nRivkin said the lawsuit is necessary to keep intact the \u201centire separation of powers architecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you think about the policy merits of these proposals, they are profoundly disruptive over separation of powers, they debase the constitution, and they need to be stopped,\u201d he said.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who supports the Affordable Care Act and voted for Obama, agreed.\n\n\u201cSome of President Obama\u2019s statements come strikingly close to assertions by King James I that he could apply \u2018natural reason\u2019 to the alteration, and even the suspension, of federal laws,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics of the lawsuit have said the House does not have the proper standing to sue the president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no way a court would find that the House of Representatives as an institution has been harmed by President Obama attempting in good faith to implement the ACA,\u201d Catholic University law professor Victor Williams told Politico.\n\nRivkin, who has more than two decades of experience in constitutional law, laughed off the notion.\n\n\u201cThe people who say that this is the biggest hurdle, are either urged to say so by the administration or they don\u2019t know the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House of Representatives has repeatedly gained standing in a footprint of a D.C. circuit to enforce legislative subpoenas spanning series of decades.\u201d\n\nRivkin and Rice said prior lawsuits seeking legislative standing have failed because they did not speak for an entire institution, like the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cYou had small groups of members, and moreover, the things they were challenging were not as clear-cut as the problem of suspending the law that the president is doing now,\u201d Rivkin said of the roughly 45 lawsuits filed in state legislatures and federal court since.\n\nTurley said he believed the lawsuit will face challenges, but it is worth moving forward to return the branches of government to their proper roles.\n\nRivkin and Rice also criticized the president\u2019s assertion that the lawsuit will \u201cwaste taxpayer money,\u201d since the Senate denied to take up a bill authorizing an expedited review of the case, sponsored by Rep. Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of 300-odd bills that the House has sent over to the Senate on various matters that they refuse to take up,\u201d Rice said.\n\n\u201cIf the administration is so concerned about resources involved in litigation, they should have told Sen. [Harry] Reid [D., Nev.] to pass the expedited review provision,\u201d Rivkin said. \u201cIf they think this lawsuit is so likely to fail, why not let it fail quickly?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Rep.
