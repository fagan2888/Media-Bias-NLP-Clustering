We want to encourage people to come out and have a good time, socialize and not worry about their level of experience.\"\n\nThe dance club holds 10 dances a year on Fridays and Saturdays, all at the senior center, rotating among five big bands. The bands include Bob Harris & the Bringers of Swing, Harris & Harris, Kings of Swing, The Matt Pack Band and Swing City-Boulder.\n\n\"We don't necessarily need lessons. We just need a place to dance,\" said Lisa Boesen, publicity and marketing manager of the Goodtimes Dance Club. \"It's a good place to dance to live music. ... If you're taking dance lessons, getting out dancing is the only way to get better.\"\n\nNorm Rehme of Loveland and his wife, Carol, have been going to the dance club since 2001.\n\n\"When you learn and take lessons, you want to practice and do it,\" Rehme said. \"You can use those new skills that you've learned.\"\n\nRehme also likes the fact that he can get exercise and do it in a social environment.\n\n\"It's a social type of event, so you visit with people, you share stories and you go dance,\" Rehme said.\n\nThe dance club had its start after a nightclub in Fort Collins closed in the late 1980s, leaving a few of the dance patrons wanting another place to dance. Those early organizers distributed fliers, ran ads and contacted a mailing list from a local band to drum up interest.\n\nThe club modeled its bylaws after another dance club in Estes Park, worked with six bands in its first 12 years and met at several locations, including the Associated Veterans Club of Loveland and other clubs and event centers.\n\nOver the years, the club had as many as 125 couples participate with an age range from 30s to 90s, with most of the members being on the older end. The club is seeking new membership, particularly younger members.\n\nThe venue works for all ages, not just seniors, even if it is a senior center, Boesen said.\n\n\"It's a lovely venue. The floors have been redone. There's an elevated stage,\" she said.\n\nShelley Widhalm: 970-669-5050, swidhalm@reporter-herald.com, twitter.com/ShelleyWidhalm.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_28762760/loveland-based-goodtimes-dance-club-will-start-its", "modificationDate": "2015-09-05T08:37:00-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0904/20150904__05RHADANCE~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Shelley Widhalm \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Loveland couple Jon and Ellen Thomerson don't like to miss the dances put on by the Goodtimes Dance Club - particularly for the big band music and the ballroom atmosphere.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28762760:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-05T08:34:30-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_28762760/loveland-based-goodtimes-dance-club-will-start-its", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0904/20150904__05RHADANCE~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Loveland couple Jon and Ellen Thomerson don't like to miss the dances put on by the Goodtimes Dance Club - particularly for the big band music and the ballroom atmosphere.", "title": "Loveland-based Goodtimes Dance Club will start its 26th season of ballroom dancing Friday"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Loveland couple Jon and Ellen Thomerson don't like to miss the dances put on by the Goodtimes Dance Club - particularly for the big band music and the ballroom atmosphere.", "title": "Loveland-based Goodtimes Dance Club will start its 26th season of ballroom dancing Friday", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_28762760/loveland-based-goodtimes-dance-club-will-start-its", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0904/20150904__05RHADANCE~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-05T08:34:30-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "sailthru.title": "Loveland-based Goodtimes Dance Club will start its 26th season of ballroom dancing Friday", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Shelley WidhalmReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0904/20150904__05RHADANCE~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-09-05T08:38:05-0600", "news_keywords": "News, News news, Loveland Colorado News news, Loveland Colorado news, News Loveland news, News Colorado news, US News news, world News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1118\"", "article_summary": "We just need a place to dance,\" said Lisa Boesen, publicity and marketing manager of the Goodtimes Dance Club.\n\"The name of our club is Goodtimes Dance Club, and that's what we're about.\n\"Come make it your monthly date night and come have a date with your spouse,\" said Red Busse, president of the Goodtimes Dance Club.\n( Special to the Reporter-Herald )If you go What: Goodtimes Dance Club.\nThe Thomersons are among the 77 couples who are members of Loveland-based Goodtimes Dance Club, which just finished its 25th season in June before taking off the months of July and August, as is usual for the club's dance season."}
