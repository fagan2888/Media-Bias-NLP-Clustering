Now, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee wants Clinton to keep paying for that vote in 2016.\n\nChafee, a Republican turned Independent turned Democrat, is running against Clinton for the Democratic nomination. He hasn\u2019t officially announced yet, he\u2019s still in the exploratory phase, but making it official is something he \u201cplan[s] to do soon.\u201d And when he does, he\u2019s going to make Clinton\u2019s vote for war his central argument against her.\n\n\u201cI always go back to what I call one of the biggest mistakes in American history, the decision to go to war in Iraq,\u201d he told TIME, \u201cand the judgment call made by Senator Clinton.\u201d\n\n\n\nChafee was a Senator at the time too; he served as a Senator from Rhode Island from 1999 to 2007 before he became governor. He voted against the war, and he says that split between him and Clinton highlights a fundamental difference in their common sense.\n\n\u201cThat was a critical time in American history, October of 2002, and I made a different judgment call,\u201d he said, again referring to Clinton\u2019s vote in favor of the war. \u201cI think we should have a debate, not only as the Democratic Party first of all, but also in America about where we\u2019re going on in the world and who can make the correct judgment calls as we go forward.\u201d\n\nEven Clinton has publicly regretted her vote. In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton wrote, \u201cI thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn\u2019t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.\u201d\n\nAlthough this linchpin of Chafee\u2019s burgeoning campaign happened over a decade ago and was already used at the center of the 2008 election, Chafee says the so-called \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d will resonate just as much with voters today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still paying for it,\u201d he said, saying the war will end up costing the country $6 trillion. \u201cWe\u2019re paying for it financially in taking care of our brave veterans \u2026 but we\u2019re also paying for it overseas \u2026 The repair work goes on. It\u2019s relevant to today.\u201d\n\nBut polling data shows that voters may not agree. In 2008, a Gallup poll found that Americans cited Iraq as the second most important issue facing the country, behind the economy. In 2015, Gallup separated economic concerns from non-economic issues, but even in the non-economic poll the situation in Iraq came in 15th, after issues like race relations, immigration and education. (No. 1 was dissatisfaction with government.)\n\nChafee outlined some other policy positions: he supports the Affordable Care Act, he would vote for the Trade Promotion Authority, he supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But he kept coming back to Iraq.\n\nChafee faces a steep uphill battle towards the nomination; so far he\u2019s barely even been included in Democratic primary polling.\n\nHe said his biggest challenge will be \u201cgetting out to every possible potluck supper and gathering in Iowa and New Hampshire and other states.\u201d But, \u201cI look forward to it, meeting the people. I started my career at the local level \u2026 by going door to door \u2026 It\u2019s going to be no different in this campaign.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Rhode Island Gov.
