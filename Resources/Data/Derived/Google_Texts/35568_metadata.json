He is also the most famous health economist in the United States. He has won numerous awards, and written countless papers and academic articles. He has even written a graphic novel about health reform.\n\nGruber was a key designer and analyst of the Massachusetts\u2019 health reform that came to be known as Romneycare. He later performed some of the same analyses for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe chatted last week on Skype about the current status of health reform. It was a pretty upbeat conversation, coming in the wake of the Obama administration\u2019s announcement that more than 7 million Americans have signed up for private coverage on the new marketplaces. We talked about the future of Medicaid, strategies to expand primary care access, lessons from the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, and why he supports the controversial \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on insurance benefits.\n\nI hope you enjoy the conversation.\n\nTranscript of this interview:\n\nHarold: Welcome to Curbside Consult. I\u2019m Harold Pollack at healthinsurance.org and with me I have the great Jonathan Gruber, one of the nation\u2019s leading health reform experts and reputed to be the architect of both RomneyCare and Obamacare among other things. By the way, that\u2019s quite a backdrop you have there, Jon, really.\n\nJon: Yeah. It drives my wife crazy that I do these Skype things in front of my messy office shelves.\n\nHarold: Actually, what you should really do is turn around and pull and reveal that it is actually a poster and \u2026\n\nJon: [laughs] Poster of the messy professor.\n\nReports of ACA demise \u2018exaggerated\u2019\n\nHarold: So how are you feeling about the Affordable Care Act today?\n\nJon: Feeling pretty good. I mean, I think that certainly reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated as Mark Twain would say and it is looking as good as we could hope at this point. But the bottom line is it\u2019s still too early to know for sure. We know it hasn\u2019t failed. We know that we have enough people, so it\u2019s working, but we don\u2019t know really the two critical things. One is, we don\u2019t know how many people have actually gained insurance coverage, and we also don\u2019t know really enough about the health mix of whose in and what\u2019s going to happen to premiums.\n\nHarold: So when will we get some information about that last point?\n\nJon: The information is going to start to come out this summer. What we have to be careful about, it\u2019s going to come out in dribs and drabs. In particular, the states where the numbers are bad might release them first because the states that oppose Obamacare might run to release their rates saying, \u201clook how much rates went up.\u201d\n\nI think we have to be very careful to wait till the rates are in from everywhere, including places where Obamacare went well like California, and then look at aggregate effect and I think the relevant benchmark is 10 percent. Doing some research now, which will be out in a few weeks from the Commonwealth Fund, which shows that if you look at the rate filings in the individual insurance market in the pre-ACA period, the average annual rate of growth was 10 to 11 percent in the individual market. So that should be our benchmark.\n\nI don\u2019t think, given how early we are in the cost control efforts of the ACA, I don\u2019t think we should be that locked into beating it, but I think if we do, if we come in, in single digits, that\u2019s a big win. If we come in 20 percent plus, that\u2019s a problem. I think we are just going to have to see what comes in relative to 10 or 11 percent it was going up beforehand.\n\nHarold: One thing I like about that, what you\u2019re just saying is, with all the political polarization, it\u2019s nice to have a couple of numbers that are basically hard to fudge that would give us some genuine market signal about how at least insurers perceive it\u2019s going.\n\nJon: Exactly. I think the enrollment number was never \u2026 the 7 million \u2013 the elusive 7 million \u2013 that was just a CBO projection. That was never a normative guide to anything. It got a life of its own \u2013 partly the administration\u2019s fault and partly, I\u2019m a bit disappointed with the tally of 7 million, because once again we are giving the CBO numbers a life of their own, when really they can just be saying, look, the exhanges are working; that\u2019s what matters. The first hard numbers we\u2019ll get that matter will be rates and those will start dribbling out this summer.\n\nImproved online experience\n\nHarold: Are there certain website problems basically behind this at this point?\n\nJon: At the national level, yes. Not in a number of states including my own state Massachusetts website problems remain, but the national website \u2026 Actually, it\u2019s amazing how quickly they fixed it. It really was about a six-week problem and really by mid November, things were working pretty well. Actually, it\u2019s well behind us at this point.\n\nHarold: Do you think there were any lessons for future public enterprises of this sort from the difficulty in rolling out this website?\n\nJon: I think there is. I think I\u2019ve lived through this in Massachusetts. I\u2019m on the Connector board here, so I\u2019ve seen our own snafus. I think the lesson is that when you have a major government project like this, you tend to have too many folks trying to run it. And there needs to be one point person who has the final say, who reports directly to the president \u2013 or in our case, directly to the governor \u2013 who has the absolute final say over everything.\n\nIn Massachusetts, and I think in the federal government, they had too many different people giving orders and that led to a lot of the problems. I think the other lesson is that you need to sort of be modularly testing. My understanding, the federal government that we see in Massachusetts, is this promise of these big deliveries and then you are waiting, waiting, it doesn\u2019t come and all of a sudden, you\u2019ve got nothing. We need to sort of focus on smaller, more modular deliveries along the way.\n\nHarold: I must say that I feel as culpable as anyone for not anticipating some of the problem \u2013 not that I had any influence over anything \u2013 but a lot of people like me who were very focused on the policy disputes, really were not necessarily focused on the nuts and bolts public management of doing the thing.\n\nJon: Yeah. I actually got into some trouble here in Massachusetts because when we found out that our website was a real disaster, I sent an email \u2013 sort of a mea culpa email \u2013 around to the board members saying, \u201cLook, you know, we sort of messed this up, and part of the reason we messed this up \u2013 not totally \u2026 we were a very small part of the problem \u2026 but part of the reason we didn\u2019t catch it is because we all like working on the policy stuff.\u201d That\u2019s more fun, and basically the exchange had worked so well in Massachusetts for so many years, we kind of figured it would just run on its own, and we were just focused on the policy issues. So I think a lot of us made that mistake of not realizing how important the IT was.\n\nHarold: We are here at Curbside Consult at healthinsurance.org and I am talking with MIT economist Jonathan Gruber. By the way, now you have a new professorship, I see. By the way, congratulations.\n\nJon: I\u2019m the Ford professor. When I got it, my mom said, \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s not Rob Ford, is it?\u201d\n\nInsured vs uninsured\n\nHarold: Yeah. You two, you guys actually have a lot of similarities. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\n\nYou mentioned that we don\u2019t really know how many people who were actually uninsured would\u2019ve now been covered. It seems to me that a lot of the public conversation about this is a little screwy in terms of the way I was trained. Because first of all, a lot of the conversation concerns people on the exchange who are uninsured. And there were a bunch of people who came into the Medicaid program who are uninsured who tend to be ignored.\n\nBut also, that if we think of health insurance as a sort of dynamic process where you move from, \u201cI\u2019m covered because I have a job and then I lose my job and I might become uninsured.\u201d \u2026 You could imagine we could, almost everyone in the exchange could be coming from previous insurance coverage, but because we are preventing them from becoming uninsured, that over time, we would actually erode the number of uninsured quite substantially, even if at any given moment in time, it doesn\u2019t look like we are reaching that many of the uninsured.\n\nJon: That\u2019s exactly right, Harold. I think that\u2019s why in some sense to know what affect there is on the uninsured, we can\u2019t go by these surveys of guys in exchange. We\u2019ve gotta actually wait till the next population survey of the uninsured comes out, and make the apples-to-apples comparison of this sort of point. We have a point in time measure of the uninsured before the ACA. We have a point in time measure of the uninsured after. That\u2019s going to be very different than what we are seeing from these surveys about who is uninsured who came in the exchange for the reason you say. Also, because insurance is so dynamic.\n\nI just published an editorial in TPM with John Gervais. We went to the numbers on turnover in a typical year. About 7 million people lose health insurance, or last year, I\u2019m sorry, about 7 million people lost health insurance in 2012. Seven million people lost health insurance; 3.6 million of them were because they lost jobs and lost their health insurance. So that\u2019s 3.6 million people that year who, over the course of the year, would be coming to the pool of the uninsured. That\u2019s not accounted for in these numbers. So I think it\u2019s really just too early to say.\n\nHarold: I was trying to explain to reporters that if they just understood that health insurance is a continuous-time Markov chain, it would all basically be very straightforward.\n\nJon: I\u2019m sure that goes over really well.\n\nThe importance of the 7 million\n\nHarold: It did go over really well. I also made a lot of jokes about data versus datums in the same conversation. It went well. Do you think that, as you mentioned, the 7 million number is not particularly a key number in the fundamental issues around health reform, but it is an accomplishment to have hit it and it\u2019s one that many people didn\u2019t think that the administration would be able to hit. Do you think that this will change the politics of ACA in a meaningful way?\n\nJon: I think 7 million was important as a political number, not as a substantive number, and I hope it \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it will change the politics. I mean basically, I think everyone who was opposed will remain opposed, everyone who is for will remain for, but hopefully it will tamp down the abate a little bit. Basically, it\u2019s reminiscent of the people who were saying Romney is going to win for sure when the data clearly showed that he was going to lose. I mean, these un-skewing folks.\n\nBasically, the question is, will folks start to admit, you\u2019re starting to hear people on the right saying, \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got to admit this is the law of the land and we\u2019ve got to fix it.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s great. That conversation \u2013 I\u2019m all for talking about sort of bipartisan efforts to improve this law. I\u2019ve no problem with that, but we\u2019ve got to start with accepting it\u2019s the law and hopefully, hitting these kind of benchmarks will move us closer to that.\n\nHarold: It seems so far the only real bipartisanship is between the Obama administration and some Republican governors and Washington has really no bipartisanship that\u2019s operational at the moment.\n\nJon: I think you\u2019re right. I think you\u2019re right.\n\nHarold: I think that\u2019s because these governors just have responsibilities for hundreds or thousands of people, and if I\u2019m a typical representative in the House, I\u2019m not responsible for anything in any meaningful way.\n\nOne tragedy deserves attention\n\nJon: I think, Harold, the single thing we probably need to keep the most focus on is the tragedy of the lack of Medicaid expansions. I know you\u2019ve written about this. You know about this, but I think we cannot talk enough about the absolute tragedy that\u2019s taken place. Really, a life-costing tragedy has taken place in America as a result of that Supreme Court decision. You know, half the states in America are denying their poorest citizens health insurance paid for by the federal government.\n\nSo to my mind, I\u2019m offended on two levels here. I\u2019m offended because I believe we can help poor people get health insurance, but I\u2019m almost more offended there\u2019s a principle of political economy that basically, if you\u2019d told me, when the Supreme Court decision came down, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. What state would turn down free money from the federal government to cover their poorest citizens?\u201d The fact that half the states are is such a massive rejection of any sensible model of political economy, it\u2019s sort of offensive to me as an academic. And I think it\u2019s nothing short of political malpractice that we are seeing in these states and we\u2019ve got to emphasize that.\n\nHarold: One of the things that\u2019s really striking to me is there\u2019s a politics of impunity towards poor people, particularly non-white poor people that is almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states, not to cover people under Medicaid, even if it\u2019s financially very advantageous to do so. I think there\u2019s a really important principle to defeat this politically, not just because Medicaid is important for people, but because it\u2019s such a toxic political perspective that has to be \u2026 It has to be shown that that approach to politics doesn\u2019t work because otherwise, we will really be stuck with some very unjust policies that will be pursued with complete impunity in some of these places.\n\nJon: That\u2019s a great way to put it. There\u2019s larger principles at stake here. When these states are turning \u2013 not just turning down covering the poor people \u2013 but turning down the federal stimulus that would come with that.\n\nHarold: Yeah.\n\nJon: So the price they are willing \u2026 They are not just not interested in covering poor people, they are willing to sacrifice billions of dollars of injections into their economy in order to punish poor people. It really is just almost awesome in its evilness.\n\nHarold: Yeah.\n\nJon: I agree there, we have to recognize there are larger principles at stake here.\n\nHarold: By the way, one of the real ironies is an awful lot of the institutions that would get the checks from Medicaid are in the public sector. There are also every city and county and correctional system and public hospital desperately wants this.\n\nJon: Yeah.\n\nHarold: From Texas, Harris County and the City of Houston, they desperately need that money. Maybe what becomes a political forcing event will be some public hospital going out of business or something like that that really, that forces them to think differently, or maybe that just we have to wait until President Obama leaves office because it\u2019s the centerpiece of his presidency and it\u2019s just too hard to do while he\u2019s sitting in that chair.\n\nJon: Harold, if we look at the original expansion of Medicaid, it took about five years to get all the states in. Really, we\u2019re sort of proceeding at a similar pace. For the first few years, they didn\u2019t even have half the states. So I think we don\u2019t have to panic at this point. History does suggest that we can overcome this, but it\u2019s just very sad along the way.\n\nWatch Part 2 of this three-part interview.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For this edition of Curbside Consult, I Skyped with Dr. Jonathan Gruber, who is the Ford Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the health care program at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
