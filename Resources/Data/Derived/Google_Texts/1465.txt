Liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign against economic inequality has led her to focus on a new target: student loan giant Sallie Mae.

On Tuesday, Warren sent a letter to Sallie Mae chief executive Jack Remondi, requesting that he provide her office with, according to the Huffington Post, “scripts its customer service representatives follow, an accounting of its borrowers with federal student loans in income-based repayment plans, and the number of its delinquent borrowers who have brought their loan payments up to date.”

In her letter, Warren told Remondi, “I am concerned that Sallie Mae too often takes steps that hurt its student borrowers.” She went on to describe her worry that the company was pushing student borrowers into plans that would temporarily delay required payments while ultimately leaving them with higher payments and more debt than they would have if they enrolled in more generous government programs.

In the past, Warren has expressed concern that the Department of Education wasn’t doing enough to make sure loan servicers like Sallie Mae were operating in student borrowers’ best interest. She reiterated this sentiment in her letter to Remondi, writing, “Current federal contracts give loan servicers like Sallie Mae little incentive to keep borrowers from falling behind on their payments or to help borrowers find solutions that are best for them when they do fall behind.”
