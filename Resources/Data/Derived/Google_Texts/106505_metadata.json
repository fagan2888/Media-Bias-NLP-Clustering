Facebook.com\n\nHunter Boutain is the latest teen to be fatally infected by a brain-eating amoeba. He was 14.\n\nThe New York Daily News reported Boutain went swimming in Lake Minnewaska in his home state of Minnesota two days prior to his death. He was unresponsive shortly after being hospitalized, and his family members took to blogs to say they were \u201cpraying for a miracle for this rascal.\u201d But despite these prayers, Boutain\u2019s doctors declared him brain dead.\n\n\"The Lord didn't want him to stay on Earth,\u201d his older brother Lee Boutain wrote on Facebook. \"As much as I am hurt I know I can't love him as much as GOD. For my little brother will be there waiting for me when I leave this earth.\"\n\nBrain-eating amoebas are formally known as Naegleria fowleri, a parasitic species that thrive in fresh, warm water. They enter the body through the nasal cavity and infect the brain, causing what's known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Since 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has investigated two other cases like Boutain\u2019s, including 12 year old Zachary Reyna who was fatally infected after kneeboarding in a watery ditch.\n\nSome suggest the Earth\u2019s rising temperatures were to blame for the increased amount of amoebas given it\u2019s what the CDC refers to as a \u201cheat-loving\u201d microbe. Either way, it\u2019s common, but should we all be concerned?\n\n\u201cThe deadly amoeba is common, but can only access the brain through the nose,\u201d Dr. Stacene Maroushek, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Hennepin County Medical Center, told the Daily News. \u201cDiving or jumping into the water seems to pose the greatest risk.\u201d\n\nThe CDC affirms \u201cyou cannot get infected from drinking water contaminated with [Naegleria fowleri]. You can only be infected when contaminated water goes up into your nose.\u201d And as common as they are, swimming in their natural environments \u2014 lakes, rivers, and hot springs \u2014 only results in zero to eight infections per year.\n\nThis number is small compared to the number of parasites known to exist in the nation\u2019s waters.\n\n\u201cThe illness itself is devastating, but the fact is that this is a very rare infection. It\u2019s not a new infection, we\u2019ve known about this for decades, and there\u2019s no evidence that the number is increasing,\u201d Dr. Roy Gulick, infection disease expert of the Weill Cornell Medical College, told PBS. \u201cIf you compare it to the odds of having a traffic accident on your way to the lake or drowning in the lake, this is much smaller.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s no data or method to accurately detect risk of infection, avoiding diving as Maroushek mentioned (nose plugs are an option) can reduce risk if swimmers are inclined to swim in lakes. Researchers too believe they\u2019re making headway in terms of treatment.\n\nA more recent study suggested the body\u2019s own immune response is why the parasite is so fatal in the first place. It\u2019s not just that the parasite eats through brain tissue, but it triggers an inflammatory response. Figuring out a way to suppress this inflammation before administering drugs to treat the infection could be huge.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brain, eating, amoeba, infects, and, kills, teen, minnesota, should, you, be, worried", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite three fatal cases since 2010, experts still believe the chances of being fatally infected with a brain-eating amoeba is pretty small.", "title": "Brain-Eating Amoebas Claim Another Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-eating-amoeba-infects-and-kills-teen-minnesota-should-you-be-worried-342594", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/hunter-boutain_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite three fatal cases since 2010, experts still believe the chances of being fatally infected with a brain-eating amoeba is pretty small.", "title": "Brain-Eating Amoebas Claim Another Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-eating-amoeba-infects-and-kills-teen-minnesota-should-you-be-worried-342594", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/hunter-boutain_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/hunter-boutain_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-11T18:01:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T18:01:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite three fatal cases since 2010, experts still believe the chances of being fatally infected with a brain-eating amoeba is pretty small."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1aa4\"", "article_summary": "Facebook.comHunter Boutain is the latest teen to be fatally infected by a brain-eating amoeba.\nDespite three fatal cases since 2010, experts still believe the chances of being fatally infected with a brain-eating amoeba is pretty small.\nSince 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has investigated two other cases like Boutain\u2019s, including 12 year old Zachary Reyna who was fatally infected after kneeboarding in a watery ditch.\nBrain-eating amoebas are formally known as Naegleria fowleri, a parasitic species that thrive in fresh, warm water.\nThe New York Daily News reported Boutain went swimming in Lake Minnewaska in his home state of Minnesota two days prior to his death."}
