Fewer people are coming in without health insurance and more have access to maternity care, laboratory services, prescription drugs, drug treatment and more \u2014\u2014 but many hospitals say they aren\u2019t being reimbursed enough for the millions of new Medi-Cal patients statewide.\n\n\u201cThe goal was expanded coverage, so we\u2019re achieving that,\u201d said Jan Emerson-Shea, a spokeswoman for the California Hospital Association. \u201cBut because of our state reimbursement policies, we are still severely underfunded in the Medi-Cal program.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires the purchase of health insurance, often with the help of a federal subsidy. It also gave states the option of expanding Medicaid-backed health care programs, with 28 states and the District of Columbia, including California, doing so.\n\nOne of the top arguments for the law was that it would cut down on \u201cuncompensated care\u201d costs. Under federal law, hospital emergency rooms are required to provide medical care to people who show up at their door, regardless of whether they have insurance or can pay their bills. If more people had health insurance, what is effectively an internal tax on the U.S. medical system \u2014 one often passed on to commercial patients \u2014 would be reduced.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services released figures Monday projecting uncompensated care declined from $34.7 billion to $27.3 in 2014, down 21 percent. That forecast is based on a model that does not take into account complete data, and most predict uncompensated care was about $50 billion in 2013 before starting to drop.\n\nBut while the amount of free \u201ccharity\u201d care has gone down locally and across the state, the story is more complicated than that.\n\nAt King City\u2019s Mee Memorial Hospital, about four in five patients are on public insurance. Located in the southern part of the Salinas Valley where unemployment is high, the hospital not only sees patients newly eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but also a high number who aren\u2019t eligible because they aren\u2019t U.S. citizens \u2014 a gap in coverage affecting 1 million Californians that the state has yet to patch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween October 2014 and January 2015, the hospital saw a $500,000 decline in uncompensated care spending compared to the same four-month window the previous year, hospital CEO Lex Smith said. But with more patients on low-paying Medi-Cal, the gap between what the hospital spends on care and what gets reimbursed has gone up $3.5 million, a figure that includes all forms of insurance.\n\n\u201cThe overall impact for us is positive,\u201d Smith said, \u201cbut the payment rates for those people that we\u2019re getting payments for is a lot less than our costs.\u201d\n\nAt Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital, uncompensated care costs declined in 2014 but are up overall since 2012, a trend driven by \u201cbad debt,\u201d or a patient\u2019s inability to pay their bills. Between 2012 and 2013, the amount of bad debt written off by the hospital nearly doubled to $16.9 million, which a hospital official said is not due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCharity care, where the hospital has no expectation of payment, dropped from 2013 to 2014, from $10.9 million to $7.7 million.\n\nAt Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, the picture is mostly positive. The hospital\u2019s underlying costs of charity care declined from $14 million in 2013 to $4 million last year. And bad debt dropped from $10 million to $3 million, CHOMP Chief Accounting Officer Matt Morgan said.\n\nFigures for Natividad Medical Center weren\u2019t immediately available.\n\nPending legislation in Sacramento would increase the Medi-Cal reimbursement rates in California, which are consistently among the lowest in the U.S. Emerson-Shea said hospitals typically get back 40 cents of ever dollar spent on a Medi-Cal patient.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is likely to be the subject of discussions on the state budget,\u201d Emerson-Shea said.\n\nThat\u2019s contributed to a situation where those newly-insured under the Affordable Care Act are still showing up at the hospital when they get sick or injured, because they can\u2019t find a primary care doctor willing to take Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of doctors that are actively taking new Medi-Cal patients, so those patients are finding their way into emergency rooms,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMee Memorial\u2019s Smith concurred. The Affordable Care Act will be good for the hospital and the community, he said, particularly when patients get more preventative care through family doctors.\n\n\u201cBut so far we haven\u2019t seen that impact, because our emergency department is reaching record levels,\u201d Smith said.\n\nJason Hoppin can be reached at 726-4363.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monterey >> On the fifth anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law, federal health officials on Monday touted a $7.4 billion decline in the amount of uncovered health care provided by America\u2019s hospita", "title": "For Monterey County hospitals, Obamacare a (complex) positive", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20150323/NEWS/150329885", "image": {"width": "470px", "identifier": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016", "height": "247px"}, "type": "article", "title": "For Monterey County hospitals, Obamacare a (complex) positive"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "Monterey >> On the fifth anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law, federal health officials on Monday touted a $7.4 billion decline in the amount of uncovered health care provided by America\u2019s hospita", "title": "For Monterey County hospitals, Obamacare a (complex) positive", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20150323/NEWS/150329885", "image": {"src": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "news_local, Medicaid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "news_local, Medicaid"}, "article_summary": "Monterey >> On the fifth anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law, federal health officials on Monday touted a $7.4 billion decline in the amount of uncovered health care provided by America\u2019s hospitals.\nOne of the top arguments for the law was that it would cut down on \u201cuncompensated care\u201d costs.\nIt also gave states the option of expanding Medicaid-backed health care programs, with 28 states and the District of Columbia, including California, doing so.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of doctors that are actively taking new Medi-Cal patients, so those patients are finding their way into emergency rooms,\u201d Morgan said.\nThe Affordable Care Act will be good for the hospital and the community, he said, particularly when patients get more preventative care through family doctors."}
