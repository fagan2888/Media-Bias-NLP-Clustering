The recommendations would take effect unless Congress develops an equivalent alternative.\n\nAs with any legislation that seeks to change the ACA, there is no guarantee that President Obama will sign it. However, with Democratic support for this measure, there might be enough votes to override Obama\u2019s veto. The measure currently has 235 bipartisan cosponsors.\n\nAs it stands, IPAB is one of the few bodies that can act to limit Medicare\u2019s spending growth. What other options are out there? This edition of \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d takes a look.\n\nFor more information on IPAB, see today\u2019s news story.\n\nPremium Support\n\nOne idea that has gained traction among members of the GOP is defined contributions, alternatively known as \u201cpremium support\u201d or \u201cvouchers,\u201d depending on your political bent.\n\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, the premium-support model \u201cwould be based on a defined government contribution to a beneficiary\u2019s chosen plan, and it would be characterized by predictable and stable financing,\u201d similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n\nSuch an idea has been featured in several recent GOP budget proposals and most recently was included in a budget proposal unveiled by House Budget Committee Chair Tom Price (R-Ga.) in March. The idea also has long been put forth by Price\u2019s predecessor, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).\n\nThe Heritage Foundation argues that the premium-support model boasts \u201cseveral attractive features,\u201d including:\n\nA wide variety of health plans from which to choose;\n\nConsumer protections equal to or greater than those enjoyed by lawmakers, federal workers and federal retirees;\n\nLittle \u201cbureaucracy and red tape\u201d; and\n\nSignificant \u201cflexibility\u201d in how to administer the program.\n\nHowever, not everyone is on board. For example, Peter Orszag, vice chair of global banking at Citigroup and former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has maligned the idea of premium support. In 2012, after Ryan included the proposal in a GOP budget plan, Orszag called premium support a \u201cfalsely attractive approach that appears to save tons of money fast, even though mostly it\u2019s just by shoving the dirty laundry under the bed than actually putting it through the washer.\u201d\n\nOpponents of premium support argue that it saves money by shifting part of the cost of care onto Medicare beneficiaries. Although supporters say this \u201cskin in the game\u201d will help control costs, opponents say it would lead to higher premiums and make it easier for plans to \u201ccherry pick\u201d the healthiest beneficiaries.\n\n\u2018Doc Fix\u2019 To the Rescue\n\nIronically, one of the other alternatives to control Medicare spending was included in legislation that received the most bipartisan support of any bill in recent memory: HR 2, which permanently replaced Medicare\u2019s sustainable growth rate formula. The measure, called the Medicare Access and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, was approved by a 392-37 vote in the House and a 92-8 vote in the Senate.\n\nJohn O\u2019Shea, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a practicing surgeon, said the SGR legislation includes \u201ca lot of incentives in there to \u2026 move into alternative payment models.\u201d He added, \u201cI think if these models are designed and implemented correctly, they certainly can do a lot to reduce spending in Medicare.\u201d And while \u201cit\u2019s kind of early yet to make any conclusions\u201d on such efforts, O\u2019Shea said he \u201cthink[s] they certainly show some promise.\u201d\n\nFor example, the measure includes provisions that would:\n\nProvide a 0.5% annual raise through 2019 for providers who participate in Medicare before transitioning to an incentive-based payment system; and\n\nEncourage providers to participate in alternative payment models focused on patient outcomes, with providers participating qualifying models receiving a 1% annual rate increase beginning in 2026.\n\nOf course, if those ideas sound familiar, perhaps that\u2019s because many similar initiatives are ensconced within the ACA.\n\nDoes It Really Matter if IPAB Goes Away?\n\nMeanwhile, some have suggested that eliminating IPAB is a matter of semantics. After all, IPAB doesn\u2019t technically exist yet. The panel\u2019s 15 members have not been named. Further, Medicare spending, at least so far, has not grown quickly enough for it to trigger any action from the (as yet non-existent) panel.\n\nEven estimates of IPAB\u2019s sole purpose \u2014 slowing Medicare spending \u2014 show less confidence. In 2009, the Congressional Budget office estimated that IPAB would result in $28 billion in savings by 2019. However, current projections don\u2019t have IPAB garnering any savings until 2022, at the earliest.\n\nDespite that, O\u2019Shea said it is \u201creasonable to think that [IPAB] will be triggered,\u201d noting that recent data have indicated the slowdown in health care spending might be coming to an end. And because of that, O\u2019Shea argues that eliminating IPAB is imperative, for the same reason that the SGR ultimately was dropped. He said, \u201cThe idea of spending targets is a bad idea \u2026 SGR\u2019s proven that. Global spending targets along with the correction being reducing prices just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d adding, \u201cIPAB is \u2026 extremely similar to SGR, even in terms of tying the spending targets to GDP.\u201d\n\nIPAB Has Its Supporters\n\nDespite bipartisan support for eliminating IPAB, not everyone agrees getting rid of the panel is a good idea.\n\nFor example, Orszag recently penned an opinion piece in support of IPAB. In it, he argued that data indicating the possible end of the slowdown in health care spending growth is exactly the reason IPAB should be kept around. And while he writes that \u201cit\u2019s crucial to move more forcefully away from fee-for-service payments and toward payments that reflect the value of care\u201d \u2014 those same ideas that exist in the SGR bill \u2014 he argues that IPAB could help, too. IPAB could make \u201cCongress \u2026 more likely to act if members know that failing to do so means the IPAB will step in,\u201d he writes. Further, he expresses doubt that Congress will \u201cbecome much more adept at complicated payment reform than it has ever been in the past.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, has called repealing IPAB \u201cunwise.\u201d Countering criticism that IPAB is an unaccountable, unelected board of bureaucrats, Van de Water notes that \u201cCongress can modify IPAB\u2019s proposals through legislation.\u201d Further, he calls IPAB an \u201cimportant backstop\u201d to the alternative payment models that seek to control costs, noting that if those methods \u201cfall short,\u201d IPAB can step in.\n\nAround the Nation\n\nMaking mergers. There\u2019s been more attention in recent weeks on mergers between health insurers. This week, both CNBC\u2019s \u201cTrading Nation\u201d and the New York Times\u2018 \u201cDealb%k\u201d have examined the ACA\u2019s role in health insurance consolidation.\n\nLeaving a legacy. The New York Times\u2018 Michael Shear looks at President Obama\u2019s legacy, and how the upcoming King v. Burwell decision could affect it.\n\nTalking prevention. NPR\u2019s \u201cShots\u201d talks to Michael LeFevre, a primary care physician who chaired the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for 10 years, about how the ACA \u201cthrust [its members] into the political hurly-burly\u201d by requiring that anything it scored with an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade must be covered by health plans with no out-of-pocket costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's bipartisan support for legislation that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act's Independent Payment Advisory Board, meaning that one of the few ways to limit Medicare spending growth could soon be gone.
