These documents, many of which are heavily blacked out, withheld for over two years by President Obama, are a road map [to] the Obama administration\u2019s Fast and Furious cover-up and deadly lies.\n\nOne document shows White House and Justice Department officials colluding to silence Attkisson, who while at CBS News exposed many details of the administration\u2019s gun-walking scandal.\n\n>>> Sharyl Attkisson Releases Chilling Video of Mysterious Deletions on Her Computer\n\nIn an Oct. 4, 2011, email exchange, Holder press aide Tracy Schmaler tells White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz of her plan to contact one of Attkisson\u2019s editors and CBS\u2019s chief Washington correspondent in an attempt to silence her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also calling Sharryl\u2019s [sic] editor and reaching out to Scheiffer [sic],\u201d Schmaler wrote. \u201cShe\u2019s out of control.\u201d\n\nSchmaler, though she misspelled his name, was referring to Schieffer, the top CBS reporter and anchor who currently hosts \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and occasionally anchors \u201cThe CBS Evening News.\u201d She also misspelled Attkisson\u2019s first name.\n\nOne day earlier, Attkisson had reported that Holder knew about Fast and Furious and received briefings on the scandal as far back as July 2010. Holder had told Congress that he learned of the operation in late 2011, about 10 months later.\n\nIn a subsequent email, the White House\u2019s Schultz says he supports Schmaler\u2019s plan, writing: \u201cGood. Her piece was really bad for AG [Holder].\u201d\n\nAttkisson, currently a senior independent contributor to The Daily Signal, could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn Fast and Furious, an operation executed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, licensed firearms dealers sold guns illegally to straw buyers. Officials with ATF, part of Holder\u2019s Justice Department, hoped to track the firearms to leaders of Mexican drug cartels and then arrest them.\n\nHowever, the federal law enforcement officials lost track of the weapons. In 2010, two of the guns were found at the scene of the murder of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.\n\nIn the same 2011 email exchange, the two administration press aides go on to discuss working with reporter Susan Davis. At the time, Davis was at National Journal and covering Fast and Furious as well as House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., leader of the congressional investigation into the scandal.\n\n>>> Computer Hacks and Screaming Flacks: 5 Startling Anecdotes from Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s New Book\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s writing on Issa/FandF and I said you could load her up on the leaks, etc.,\u201d Schultz told Schmaler in an email.\n\nThe same day that Schmaler called Attkisson \u201cout of control,\u201d the investigative reporter appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show.\n\nAttkisson told the radio host that she had received phone calls from Justice\u2019s Schmaler and the White House\u2019s Schultz regarding her Fast and Furious reporting.\n\nSchulz called her screaming and cursing, Attkisson said, and Schmaler yelled at her.\n\nAttkisson chronicled this and other instances of the Obama administration interfering in her reporting in her new book, \u201cStonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation, and Harassment in Obama\u2019s Washington.\u201d\n\nAttkisson left CBS News in March, citing an inability to get stories on the air.\n\nIn \u201cStonewalled,\u201d she details multiple instances of top CBS officials pulling the plug on her stories, many relating to the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks as well as Fast and Furious, apparently because they did not reflect well on the Obama administration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Emails show the White House and Justice Department targeted reporter Sharyl Attkisson in hopes of thwarting her CBS coverage of Operation Fast and Furious.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Emails show the White House and Justice Department targeted reporter Sharyl Attkisson in hopes of thwarting her CBS coverage of Operation Fast and Furious.", "title": "Attkisson Targeted for Reporting on Fast and Furious", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141031_AttkissonVideo_Quinn1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-23T15:11:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/11DEaqt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Emails show the White House and Justice Department targeted reporter Sharyl Attkisson in hopes of thwarting her CBS coverage of Operation Fast and Furious.", "title": "Attkisson Targeted for Reporting on Fast and Furious", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141031_AttkissonVideo_Quinn1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach,executive power,media", "published_time": "2014-11-21T16:21:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T15:11:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sharyl Attkisson, Operation Fast and Furious, Judicial Watch, Department of Justice, Tom Fitton, Tracy Schmaler, Eric Schultz, Eric Holder, Bob Schieffer, Darrell Issa"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca3b\"", "article_summary": "Attkisson told the radio host that she had received phone calls from Justice\u2019s Schmaler and the White House\u2019s Schultz regarding her Fast and Furious reporting.\nNewly released documents show the White House and Justice Department targeted investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson in hopes of thwarting her reporting for CBS News on the secretive government operation called Fast and Furious.\nThe group announced yesterday that it received more than 10,000 documents totaling 42,000 pages regarding Operation Fast and Furious.\nOne day earlier, Attkisson had reported that Holder knew about Fast and Furious and received briefings on the scandal as far back as July 2010.\nIn Fast and Furious, an operation executed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, licensed firearms dealers sold guns illegally to straw buyers."}
