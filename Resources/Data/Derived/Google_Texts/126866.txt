M ore than 400 children, adults and dogs showed up to participate in the sunny, yet chilly Hangover Classic 10 Mile/5k Run Thursday morning.

The runners began the Hangover Classic at American Turner's and ran to Eva Bandman Park where they turned around for the 5k portion of the race. The 10 mile runners continued through Waterfront Park and through a very cold downtown River Walk.

"It was fun, it was freezing at the start. The wind was so cold on our faces we couldn't even see," said 10 mile runner Shelley Jennings.

Chris Foster, who recently moved to Louisville from Hawaii, said the cold was beyond his threshold but enjoyed seeing other dedicated runners. "I think you get a more interesting feel if you race on New Years because you get the people who weren't out partying and are kind of a little more serious, it's a more interesting feel than normal," said Foster.
