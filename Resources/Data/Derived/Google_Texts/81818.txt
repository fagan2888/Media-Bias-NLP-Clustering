EVERY TWO YEARS, House and Senate budget writers make educated guesses about the state revenue available to fund the operating budget for the upcoming biennium.Sometimes they overestimate the money the state can spend, but recently they have significantly underestimated what's available to fund state services.And March's revenue number shows how much the revenues have been underestimated for this fiscal year.March produces more money for the state than any other month - April and June are close - due to business tax collections.Business taxes are the single-biggest source of money, producing about one-quarter of all revenue.If you remember, the current budget was vetoed by Gov., and one of the reasons was cuts in business tax rates.Part of the compromise was a target for business taxes, or the second round of cuts would not go into effect. With three-quarters of fiscal year 2016 completed, you can count on the second phase of the cuts.Last summer when the budget wars were raging, no one expected to see the kind of revenues that have materialized.The March revenue report reveals $79 million more than anticipated, granted $19 million of that is from a tax amnesty program, but that is still $60 million to the good and $124 million more that collected the previous year at this time.Good economic times produce almost as many arguments between Democrats and Republicans as a bad economy with shrinking revenues.The money battle has largely been over bills attempting to stem the tide of the growing opioid addiction.When the revenue report was released last week, Hassan called for lawmakers to fund four bills to address the drug epidemic. The bills were supposed to speed through the House and Senate, but instead have bogged down in the laborious legislative process."We must act with a sense of urgency to help save lives and combat the heroin and opioid epidemic that is ravaging families, communities and businesses across the state," Hassan said. "As our economy continues to strengthen and state revenues already outpace projections by approximately $80 million this fiscal year, it is clear that we have the resources to take additional steps to support law enforcement and strengthen prevention, treatment and recovery."The conservative Americans For Prosperity, which wants to see additional business tax cuts, claim the rate reductions are already paying dividends for the state.The group's New Hampshire directornoted business taxes are $49 million ahead of estimates for the biennium."The business tax reductions that AFP-NH activists fought so hard to deliver are working for our economy," said Moore. "As we said last year, having the 3rd highest tax rate on New Hampshire employers was hurting our ability to grow. Now that they have seen relief, our revenues are exploding, and our unemployment rate is the lowest in the country."He called for continuing the effort to reduce business taxes and cited two proposals making their way through the Legislature, one that would change how the state taxes initial public offerings or angel investing in a company and the other would allow businesses to deduct up to either $100,000 or $500,000 for equipment or capital costs in the year the purchase occurs rather than taking the depreciation over a period of time.The Department of Revenue Administration predicts the deduction change could cost the state about $14 million to $15 million a year in lost revenue due to companies going out of business, or moving to another state or changing the percentage of business they do in New Hampshire.The question before the session ends in June is does Hassan agrees more business tax reductions would be good for the state? Last year, she vetoed a similar bill on IPOs and investment, but has yet to say what she thinks about the two proposals now before the Legislature.It is hard to see the governor agreeing to give up $14 million to $15 million after complaining last summer the rate cuts were a backdoor way to shrinking government.The budget wars are likely to continue until lawmakers go home to begin their campaigns for re-election.The recent reauthorization of the New Hampshire Health Protection Plan for two years guarantees it will be a major topic for the governor's race, and Senate and House races as well.My colleaguedid a good job of sorting out the differences between the GOP gubernatorial candidates: first-term Rep.is against it, third-term Sen.was for it but is now against it, while Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas wants to see an alternative but says as governor he would sign the bill so 48,000 people do not lose their health insurance.Three-term executive councilordid not respond in time to make the printed edition of Tuohy's Granite Status column , but he did say he would have liked some changes but lawmakers did a good job."While I certainly wanted the Medicaid expansion bill to include a strong work requirement, this legislation was needed to protect our most vulnerable citizens and help fight the substance abuse crisis," Sununu said. "The Republican leadership in the House and Senate did a good job by bringing forward a plan that did not place the financial burden of this expensive federal program on the taxpayers of New Hampshire."..This is an issue that will be parsed endlessly among the four GOP candidates until the September primary. While the Republican Party Platform calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act as soon as possible, three of the gubernatorial candidates have been around Concord long enough to know you have to be practical about these things.Throwing 48,000 low-income adults off health insurance is not a good path to electability in November and they know it.Sen.will host an informational hearing on the NHHPP Wednesday in Aldermanic Chambers in Manchester City Hall beginning at 7 p.m.Health and Human Services Commissionwill attend to provide information about the legislation and the plan as well as answer questions along with the good Senator from District 20.About 6,000 Manchester residents are on the program while the enrollment for Hillsborough County is about 15,000.If the most important skill for an Executive Councilor is counting to three (the number needed for a majority of the council), state Sen.has a head start. The Kingston Republican announced his campaign for the District 3 seat with the support of the three current Republican councilors,and Sununu.Sununu's decision to run for Governor opened up the district for Prescott, who originally ran for the Council in 2006.There were three GOP candidates in that primary. State Senate Presidentbeat Prescott and seacoast businessman Sean Mahoney in that primary.No hard feelings as Morse was on hand to endorse his former rival at Prescott's campaign launch in Epping Wednesday evening.Until late in the week, there were three candidates for the District 3 seat. Republican Rockingham County Commissionerannounced his candidacy in February. Former Salem Selectmanand Derry Councilorhave announced runs for the Democratic nomination.And late last week, first-term GOP Rep.of Sandown said he will run for the seat.That makes it three plus one, or four, for District 3.District 4 is not likely to have four candidates vying for that seat, unless there are three on the Republican side, because Democratic incumbentis not likely to have a challenger in the primary.Public hearings will be held for two of the four people Hassan recently nominated to be judges.of Albany andof Hopkinton were nominated to the Circuit Court last week. The public hearing begins at 1 p.m. April 20 in Executive Council Chambers in the State House with Greenhalph up first.He is an attorney and director at Cooper Cargill Chant specializing in family law. Greenhalgh graduated from the University of Maine and earned his law degree at Northeastern University School of Law.Luneau is a Marital Master for 10th Circuit Court Brentwood Family Division in Kingston. Luneau graduated from Wellesley College and received her law degree from the University of New Hampshire School of Law.The hearings onof Hopkinton to the Superior Court, andof Sunapee to the circuit Court will be held on another day...
