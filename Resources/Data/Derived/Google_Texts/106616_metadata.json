I answer about one or two a month. Until recently, the last one to which I responded was from SeekingArrangement.com\u2019s in-house publicist about how the high cost of Obamacare premiums was prompting young women to look for sugar daddies to pay their new insurance bills. The quirkier, the better\u2013especially since I read enough news not to be surprised by ordinary pitches.\n\nSo when I received an email promoting a gay romance novel, my interest was naturally (no, not in that way) piqued. Rick R. Reed\u2019s latest offering, Legally Wed, is about a gay man struggling to come to terms with the contradictions of homosexual romance in an era when gay marriage is suddenly becoming legal. I thought it sounded timely as well as interesting as a window onto some of the internal dialogue of the gay community.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe book arrived, and I will admit that it is not an easy read, at least for this straight man. I don\u2019t read too much romance literature anyway, and I\u2019m certain that plenty of straight stuff is equally awkward. Yet it is tough to get through passages such as, \u201cI need to rub myself up against something hard, warm, and furry,\u201d without feeling rather left behind. (Perhaps gay readers have the same trouble with straight romance novels.)\n\nAnyway, the plot involves a gay man who is excited at the legalization of gay marriage in Washington State, but discovers that his boyfriend is not interested in tying the knot. Heartbroken, he decides that gay men simply do not want to commit, and places an ad for a straight woman who will be willing to marry him in traditional style, despite his sexuality (which he does not hide). A woman answers and agrees, and all seems to be going well.\n\nThen\u2013spoiler alert\u2013our protagonist meets the (male) wedding planner, who is also gay, and whom he cannot resist. At the same time, his fianc\u00e9e also meets a man to whom she is attracted\u2013too late, of course, since she is already engaged. Try as he might, our gay hero cannot work up the desire to do more than cuddle his intended. The two of them break it off amicably, and the hero and the wedding planner soon throw a wedding of their own.\n\nIt\u2019s treacly stuff, and the characters are rather familiar cutouts. What remains interesting about the book is its subtle message: namely, that people cannot deny their true desires, try as they might. I suppose that is an old theme in novels: Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina is all about people following their passions to ruin. But in Reed\u2019s gay romance, the context of the political debate over gay marriage makes the theme worth considering anew.\n\nTo his credit, Reed does not confront the reader with partisan stuff. That\u2019s refreshing, especially in an age where Hollywood-backed conformity prevents any real and honest discussion of the issues gay marriage raises. On the other hand, unlike Tolstoy\u2019s characters (tough comparison, I know), Reed\u2019s do not face any real negative consequences for their decisions. Their choices are not really tragic. Maybe that was the intention.\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about the world of gay literature to know whether these themes are explored in greater depth by other authors. When I think about why I don\u2019t know enough, I come up with a few reasons: my own philistinism about literature; the off-putting politics of the literary academy, more concerned about tearing down convention than enjoying good writing, etc. Reed\u2019s novel didn\u2019t change that, but I appreciated the effort.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are You Ready for the Gay Romance Novel?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Are You Ready for the Gay Romance Novel?", "title": "Are You Ready for the Gay Romance Novel? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/02/12/Gay-Romance.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/02/12/are-you-ready-for-the-gay-romance-novel/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Are You Ready for the Gay Romance Novel?", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/02/12/Gay-Romance.png", "title": "Are You Ready for the Gay Romance Novel? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "published_time": "2014-02-12T07:15:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2279\"", "article_summary": "But in Reed\u2019s gay romance, the context of the political debate over gay marriage makes the theme worth considering anew.\nSo when I received an email promoting a gay romance novel, my interest was naturally (no, not in that way) piqued.\nAnyway, the plot involves a gay man who is excited at the legalization of gay marriage in Washington State, but discovers that his boyfriend is not interested in tying the knot.\nRick R.
