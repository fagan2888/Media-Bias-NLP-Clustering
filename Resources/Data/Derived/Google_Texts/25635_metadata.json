They repackaged data from HealthCare.gov into a minimalist website, HealthSherpa, that tells consumers what plans are available in their area, based on their ZIP code, plan preference and some basic personal information.\n\nThe founders \u2014 Michael Wasser, George Kalogeropoulos and Ning Liang \u2014 had each struggled to get information about health care options in the online marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. So they decided to build their own site, intending to offer consumers a simple way to obtain information many had been unable to obtain from federal and some state-run exchanges in their early days.\n\n\u201cWell, this is a cool thing we can get done in two days,\u201d said Mr. Wasser, describing the conversation the founders had before they began. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do.\u201d\n\nUsing data posted on HealthCare.gov, as well as some they requested from state exchanges, the trio programmed a site that allows users to see a list of available plans in their area, which can be sorted according to the level of coverage \u2014 catastrophic through platinum \u2014 the consumer wants. They have not yet obtained data for all of the state exchanges.\n\nUsers submit their ages, the size of their family, and whether or not they smoke to get an adjusted price. The website also has a subsidy calculator. While the site offers instructions on how to sign up for a desired plan, it does not allow users to do so on the site; nor can it authenticate users or verify their incomes, as healthcare.gov is intended to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one little niche of finding plan data,\u201d Mr. Wasser said. He added that the site was by no means intended to replace the federal website. \u201cThe whole HealthCare.gov website does many other things.\u201d\n\nMr. Wasser, of Seattle, said the website was not making money. His partners live in San Francisco.\n\nThe website carries a disclaimer that its results are provided for research purposes only, and that users should verify information with the exchanges or the insurers they are looking at. The creators have acknowledged on social media that there are some issues with the accuracy of the data available on HealthCare.gov. Mr. Wasser said the group had placed requests for more data from HealthCare.gov.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Wasser said, the site has amassed more than 1.4 million page views. \u201cHow to buy\u201d buttons posted next to each plan, which take users to instructions, have been clicked 152,000 times.\n\nEvidently, Angus King, an independent senator from Maine \u2014 a state that did not elect to create its own health exchange \u2014 finds the site useful; on Tuesday, he urged his constituents to use it while HealthCare.gov works out its kinks.\n\n\u201cHealthSherpa offers a user-friendly platform to quickly browse through available health insurance plan options, including monthly premium costs, coverage plans, and possible premium subsidies,\u201d Mr. King said in a statement on his website. \u201cI recommend that Mainers who are having trouble with HealthCare.gov use HealthSherpa as a temporary alternative until the federal website functions properly.\u201d\n\nShelley A. Francis, an independent health care consultant from Atlanta, turned to HealthSherpa after a protracted wrestling match with the federal site. It had taken three weeks just to create an account on healthcare.gov, she said, adding that navigating the plans once she could see them was \u201ccumbersome.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a nightmare. I don\u2019t have time,\u201d said Ms. Francis, who used HealthSherpa to narrow her options down to a few providers, which she plans to call in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWhen you want something done around I.T., get the millennials to do it,\u201d Ms. Francis added.\n\nAnother site, insureks.org, offers plans and prices to Kansas residents. And there are other tools, like the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s subsidy calculator, that offer information on what families can expect to pay for coverage, but do not offer specific plans.\n\nSarah J. Dash, a research fellow at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, cautioned that the alternative sites could cause some confusion for consumers, because they do not present information in the same way as the federal site or facilitate signing up for specific plans, as the federal site does. Users are given a number to call and a plan to request, or they are advised to click a link that takes them to an insurer\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mechanism for directly enrolling in the exchange with that insurer,\u201d said Ms. Dash, who said it could be possible for consumers to accidentally enroll in plans that are not on the exchange, or miss out on tax credits for which they might be eligible.\n\nMs. Dash also warned that there were some alternative sites that appeared to be actively preying on consumers, by pointing consumers to plans that are not part of the federal insurance marketplace (she did not characterize HealthSherpa as one of these sites).\n\n\u201cThere are a bunch of websites, look-alike websites \u2014 sometimes they\u2019re just kind of linking you to a plan that might be on the nonexchange market,\u201d Ms. Dash said. \u201cSomeone might sign up for a plan that\u2019s not on the exchange inadvertently.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131115142855, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "per": "King, Angus Jr", "org": "HealthCare.gov;Kaiser Family Foundation", "keywords": "King Angus Jr,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),HealthCare.gov,Kaiser Family Foundation,Maine,Exchanges", "GBLC": "Exchanges", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jess Bidgood", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jess Bidgood", "byl": "Jess Bidgood", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/11/15/programmers-create-new-way-to-navigate-health-law/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Three people who struggled to use HealthCare.gov have founded HealthSherpa, a minimalist website that tells consumers what plans are available in their area.", "card": "summary", "title": "Programmers Find New Way to Navigate Health Plans"}, "blogpostid": 100000002554635, "description": "Three people who struggled to use HealthCare.gov have founded HealthSherpa, a minimalist website that tells consumers what plans are available in their area.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 15, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1384543735, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/jess_bidgood/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Exchanges", "modified_time": "2013-11-15T19:44:11-05:00"}, "geo": "Maine", "utime": 20131115194411, "PUD": 20131115, "pdate": 20131115, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "Three people who struggled to use HealthCare.gov have founded HealthSherpa, a minimalist website that tells consumers what plans are available in their area.", "title": "Programmers Find New Way to Navigate Health Plans", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/11/15/programmers-create-new-way-to-navigate-health-law/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Programmers Find New Way to Navigate Health Plans", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 15, 2013"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a68\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe whole HealthCare.gov website does many other things.\u201dMr. Wasser, of Seattle, said the website was not making money.\nHe added that the site was by no means intended to replace the federal website.\nIt took three programmers in their twenties a few days last month to offer up an answer.\nThe founders \u2014 Michael Wasser, George Kalogeropoulos and Ning Liang \u2014 had each struggled to get information about health care options in the online marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cHealthSherpa offers a user-friendly platform to quickly browse through available health insurance plan options, including monthly premium costs, coverage plans, and possible premium subsidies,\u201d Mr. King said in a statement on his website."}
