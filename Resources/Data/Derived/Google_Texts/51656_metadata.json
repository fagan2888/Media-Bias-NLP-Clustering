Employees will also get more training.\n\nWalgreen spokesman Phil Caruso said the company has already made many of the required changes.\n\nLast September, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster also accused Walgreen of failing to remove expired price tags.\n\nThree months earlier, it agreed to pay $2.55 million to settle an unrelated New York probe into improper Medicaid billings.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Von Ahn)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Walgreen Co agreed to reform its advertising practices and pay $500,000 to", "title": "Walgreens, Duane Reade settle NY overcharge probe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Walgreens-Duane-Reade-settle-NY-overcharge-probe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/walgreen-duanereade_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/Walgreens-Duane-Reade-settle-NY-overcharge-probe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/walgreen-duanereade_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Walgreen Co agreed to reform its advertising practices and pay $500,000 to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It ends a two-year probe into pricing practices at the 251 Walgreens and 214 Duane Reade stores in New York.\nThree months earlier, it agreed to pay $2.55 million to settle an unrelated New York probe into improper Medicaid billings.\nWalgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Illinois, did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.\nThe settlement with the largest U.S. drugstore chain, a unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, was announced on Thursday by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.\n(Reuters) - Walgreen Co agreed to reform its advertising practices and pay $500,000 to settle allegations its Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in New York overcharged consumers at the register and used price tags that fooled them into thinking they were getting great deals."}
