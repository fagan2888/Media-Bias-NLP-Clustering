Shoppers in Wichita knew it was going to be busy, but many were shocked by the turnout. Some even say Super Saturday put Black Friday to shame.\n\n\"I didn't figure there were this many procrastinators in the world,\" says Austin Kowalsky.\n\nTowne East Square mall was the place to be for thousands of last minute holiday shoppers. It was hard to find an empty parking spot from open to close.\n\n\"I pulled up and thought i was going to park at Von Maur but I looked at it and I was like this is not going to work out,\" says T.J. Huntar.\n\n\"I drove around probably 15, 20 minutes trying to find a spot,\" says Ben Stanfield. \"People were cutting people off, pedestrians were walking in front of cars, it was kind of crazy.\"\n\nFor the first time in a decade, Super Saturday is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year. Inside Towne East Mall showed signs that very well could be true as shoppers were packed from wall to wall.\n\n\"I'm amazed this many people would wait til the last minute to shop,\" says Doris Wing.\n\nStore managers say they had to make sure extra employees were on staff to help more than double the amount of shoppers from normal Saturdays. Kowalsky was surprised by the numbers.\n\n\"We went into Spencer's earlier and we couldn't even walk in the door so it's kind of hectic out here,\" says Kowalsky.\n\nResearchers from Shoppertrak predicted Super Saturday would bring in nearly a billion dollars more than Black Friday. Last minute shoppers are mainly after electronics, clothing, and stocking-stuffers. While some call this environment hectic, others find it fun.\n\n\"I figured it would be,\" says Brenda Gerard. \"It's fun we enjoy getting out. The guys don't, but we do.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Christmas is only five days away meaning the end is near for last minute holiday shoppers!", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Christmas is only five days away meaning the end is near for last minute holiday shoppers!", "title": "Super Saturday shoppers pack Towne East Square", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Super-Saturday-shoppers-pack-Towne-East-Square-286483261.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DF4/0DD/DF40DDB07482470FAD09D2831E0859AF", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/431/D23/431D234108FF49C7BD3DCC396C4C3218.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Christmas is only five days away meaning the end is near for last minute holiday shoppers!", "title": "Super Saturday shoppers pack Towne East Square", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Super-Saturday-shoppers-pack-Towne-East-Square-286483261.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/super+saturday2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Super Saturday shoppers pack Towne East Square", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Super Saturday shoppers pack Towne"}, "article_summary": "Towne East Square mall was the place to be for thousands of last minute holiday shoppers.\nChristmas is only five days away meaning the end is near for last minute holiday shoppers!\nInside Towne East Mall showed signs that very well could be true as shoppers were packed from wall to wall.\nSome even say Super Saturday put Black Friday to shame.\nLast minute shoppers are mainly after electronics, clothing, and stocking-stuffers."}
