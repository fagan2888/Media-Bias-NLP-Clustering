New on the market: The new 2015 Titleist Pro V1 and Pro V1x models.

The scoop: Pro V1 and Pro V1x (which launched in 2003) have been the most played golf balls at every level of competitive golf and the best-selling models around the world ever since. The new 2015 Titleist Pro V1 and Pro V1x models were designed for all golfers seeking to shoot lower scores.

According to Titleis engineers, the 2015 Pro V1 and Pro V1x deliver exceptional distance with consistent flight, more short game control and even softer feel from a new, patented urethane elastomer cover formulation, and long lasting durability.

Pro V1 has a softer feel, slightly more long game spin and a more penetrating trajectory for a shallower angle of descent for more roll than Pro V1x. Pro V1x has a slightly firmer feel and lower long game spin and launches higher with a steeper angle of descent than Pro V1.

The total performance of Pro V1 and Pro V1x tee-through-green — providing a combination of distance, flight, short-game scoring control and feel — makes them a great fit for any golfer.

The 2015 Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls feature a new, patented thermoset urethane elastomer cover that is designed to give more short game spin and control, and softer feel — while maintaining their exceptional distance and flight characteristics. The softer, reformulated cover system improves feel, sound and short game scoring control, providing golfers the confidence to hit it closer to the hole.

Price and availability: The 2015 Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls will be available Friday and carry a suggested price of $47.99.
