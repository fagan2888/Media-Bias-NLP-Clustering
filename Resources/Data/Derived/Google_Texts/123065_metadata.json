One such expert in the field is Tom Lounibos, chief executive for privately held Soasta Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., which has done testing on sites for the 2012 London Olympics as well as the NASA\u2019s Mars Curiosity rover.\n\nShutterstock.com\n\nLounibos says that while any number of things can go wrong for a web site, there are several \u201cbest practices\u201d that HHS seems to have neglected in setting up the web site designed to handle Obamacare applications for 36 states. The sites set up by individual states to process their own applicants seems to be working out their glitches, but HealthCare.gov continues to have the same issues it did a week ago.\n\n\u201cWhat you learn in retail [e-commerce] is the user experience is the whole thing,\u201d Lounibos said. \u201cThey kind of failed on the whole user experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little difficult to swallow how this can be so bad,\u201d he went on to say, later adding: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear they followed best practices.\u201d\n\nThe best practices that HHS apparently is missing include failure to perform continual testing on the site, test across all browsers and environments, as well as load testing. Poor government policies and workmanship can\u2019t be blamed, Lounibos added, because the U.S. has handled complex computing tasks before such as annual tax filings.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown what kind of software and tooling HHS used in order to set up the Web site; HHS officials have yet to respond to inquiries. But the good news is that unless HHS used Reagan-era technology, most of the problems could be fixed in relatively short order, he said. Web sites like Google handle much more volume on any given day, Lounibos added.\n\n\u201cThese are not extraordinary volumes, that I can tell,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-10-10T15:39:25-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Questions are being raised about how the Health and Human Services Obamacare enrollment web site was constructed and whether proper testing was done prior to the site's launch on Oct. 1.", "title": "Persistent Obamacare troubles raise questions about proper online tests", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/10/persistent-obamacare-troubles-raise-questions-about-proper-online-tests/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM264_comput_MG_20131001161054.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Health and Human Services,Obamacare,Obamacare online enrollment,Obamacare online glitches", "article.headline": "Persistent Obamacare troubles raise questions about proper online tests", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Health and Human Services,Obamacare,Obamacare online enrollment,Obamacare online glitches", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Questions are being raised about how the Health and Human Services Obamacare enrollment web site was constructed and whether proper testing was done prior to the site's launch on Oct. 1.", "article.published": "2013-10-10T15:39:25-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/10/persistent-obamacare-troubles-raise-questions-about-proper-online-tests/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Questions are being raised about how the Health and Human Services Obamacare enrollment web site was constructed and whether proper testing was done prior to the site's launch on Oct. 1.", "title": "Persistent Obamacare troubles raise questions about proper online tests", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/10/persistent-obamacare-troubles-raise-questions-about-proper-online-tests/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM264_comput_MG_20131001161054.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1310", "article.updated": "2013-10-10T17:18:29-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0328\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s unknown what kind of software and tooling HHS used in order to set up the Web site; HHS officials have yet to respond to inquiries.\nBut the good news is that unless HHS used Reagan-era technology, most of the problems could be fixed in relatively short order, he said.\nWeb sites like Google handle much more volume on any given day, Lounibos added.\nIt\u2019s now at the point where questions are being raised about how the Health and Human Services web site was constructed and whether proper testing was done prior to the site\u2019s launch on Oct. 1.\nTroubles in signing up for online Obamacare applicants have persisted well into their second week, and the main HealthCare.gov site remains unable to get many seeking coverage into first gear."}
