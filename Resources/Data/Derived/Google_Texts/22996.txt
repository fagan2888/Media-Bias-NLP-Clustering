Police say an armed poll worker was arrested after threatening other workers at a Cleveland polling place around noon Tuesday.

Officers say a 45-year-old man got into a verbal argument with other workers at Louisa May Alcott School on 10308 Baltic Road. The school is serving as a polling station. Police say the man revealed a .380 gun from his backpack. He didn't point the gun at anyone, but verbally threatened them.

Police say the suspect left on foot. He was arrested a short time later at West 107th Street and Detroit Avenue.

The weapon and marijuana were found in his backpack. He was taken to jail.

Voting continues at the location.

"We were assured by the Board of Elections and and safety officials that the incident posed no danger to occupants at our school.

Polling locations at schools are separate and cordoned off from areas occupied by staff and students on election day," according to statement by Cleveland Metropolitan Schools.
