That rule doesn't apply to Congress members.\n\nAccording to the federal Office of Personnel Management, Congress members \"can continue to have Medicare coverage in addition to your employer-sponsored DC Health Link plan. The DC Health Link plan will be your primary coverage and Medicare will be secondary.\"\n\nIn other words, more coverage.\n\nCongress members also enjoy a sweet perk while in office -- access to the Office of the Attending Physician, a Capitol Hill clinic tasked with maintaining the well-being of lawmakers.\n\nFor only about $600 a year, Congress members are able to receive \"routine care\" such as X-rays, lab work and physical therapy, plus any urgent care required. They also have access to military hospitals.\n\nThen there's the congressional pension. Unlike nearly everyone in the private sector -- except many chief executives -- Congress members who have been in office at least five years are eligible for a pension once they turn 62.\n\nThe annual pension can start at 80% of the member's final salary and rise from there with cost-of-living adjustments.\n\nIf you have a consumer question, email me at asklaz@latimes.com or contact me via Twitter @Davidlaz.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Do Congress members get Medicare?
