Editor: I found the Journal’s recent article on city ordinances to be very enlightening. Having been one of the “violators” mentioned, let me tell you how I was treated.

I was sent a notice for debris. I called the office of ordinance control officer Daniel Trelka to have them clarify. He then showed up at my residence, with a smug smile and a demeaning demeanor. I asked him what he had a problem with and why. I was told I couldn’t have anything in my yard, not even garden fence. Everything must be inside.

He had a very cop attitude of “I’m the boss here.” He told me to read the ordinances and if I don’t like it, take it up with the mayor. Then I went to my mailbox, and he left me a present: a $100 bill for his time.

Next, I went to the mayor’s office and received no answers from Mayor Wiza. I did, however, get his assurance that he would look into and get back to me. I’m still waiting.

After about a week, I sent a request to Mr. Wiza and Mr. Trelka for clarification. I still have not heard from either.

It seems from my experience and the experiences of others around town, Trelka’s job is to harass and fine citizens. Our city’s ordinance code is so vague that Mr. Trelka can do as he sees fit, without question.

I, for one, think that is wrong.

I never thought I would say this, but I would rather have Mayor Halverson back in office.
