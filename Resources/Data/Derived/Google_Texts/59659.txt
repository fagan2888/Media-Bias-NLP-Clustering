When Matt Drudge wasn’t writing up ALL-CAPS HEADLINES over the past year about Hillary Clinton, Trayvon Martin, Quentin Tarantino, and the “knockout game,” the notoriously peripatetic ur-blogger began occasionally documenting his whereabouts on Twitter—a bold decision for the famously reclusive Miamian.

Pieced together, Drudge’s emissions reveal his global tour across two continents, three countries, and nearly a dozen American cities (and his unedited thoughts about Obama, Obamacare, Clinton, “demon possession,” and Wal-Mart). Below we’ve collected Drudge’s frequently-deleted* tweets about his travels here and abroad. Who knows where he’ll end up in 2014.
