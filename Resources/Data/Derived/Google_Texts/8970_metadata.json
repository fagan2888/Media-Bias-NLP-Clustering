Before a world record total of more than 10,400 spectators, Canada grabbed gold by winning against the Iroquois Nationals with a final score of 12-8. Meanwhile player Miles Thompson won the inaugural Shot of the Year trophy at the National Lacrosse League (NLL) awards ceremony held on September 29, for a shot he took back in January 2015 as a member of the Minnesota Swarm.\n\nUNSOLVED MURDER: Cherokee elder and urban Indian activist Jess Sixkiller, 78, was murdered at about 3 a.m. on September 25 at his home in Phoenix. Police found him with a fatal gunshot wound after his wife, 79, called 911. She had locked herself in another room in the house upon hearing a disturbance. Police found signs of forced entry. A memorial service was held for Sixkiller at the Heard Museum in Phoenix on October 2. Police are still investigating. The first Native American officer on the Chicago police force, Sixkiller went on to become the first Indian detective in Chicago. The Yale University graduate also founded the National Urban Indian Organization.\n\n\u201cThis man was just a visionary,\u201d said Janell Sixkiller, one of his four children. \u201cThat was my dad.\u201d\n\nBELOVED LEADER WALKS ON: Ta Kola Ota (Darrell Dale Standing Elk), enrolled member of the Sicangu Lakota Oyate and respected leader, passed away on September 20, 2015, at age 81. He was celebrated at a memorial service on September 26.\n\n\u201cEvery now and then, Native DNA produces a Crazy Horse, a Geronimo, a Chief Joseph, or a Darrell Standing Elk,\u201d said American Indian Movement (AIM) founder Dennis Banks in a statement. \u201cThat's how I feel about my old friend Darrell.\u201d\n\nREASSIGNED: Susan Taffe Reed, whose appointment as Native American Program (NAP) director at Dartmouth University was hotly contested due to uncertainty about her Native heritage, has been replaced. NAP Coordinator Kianna Burke, a 2012 Dartmouth graduate with a degree in Native American Studies, and Interim Undergraduate Dean Jeremy Guardiola are taking on her responsibilities, Dartmouth said in an e-mailed statement, while Taffe Reed will continue on in another capacity.\n\nCORRECTED: Republican Presidential Candidate Jeb Bush, while not reassigned, was soundly corrected when he purported to speak for American Indians on the mascot issue regarding the Washington D.C. football team. After Bush told Sirius XM that he didn't find the team name offensive and that \u201cNative American tribes generally don\u2019t find it offensive,\u201d the reaction was immediate. The Oneida Nation\u2019s Change the Mascot campaign issued a statement saying that Bush \u201csomehow believes he speaks for Native Americans and can assert Native American people do not find this slur offensive. He clearly is missing something.\u201d\n\nHISTORY DENIED: Many South Dakota high school students will not be learning about Native Americans next year, thanks to some quietly approved changes in content standards that no longer require students to study early American history. Beginning in the 2016-2017 academic year, high school students in South Dakota may choose one of three courses to satisfy their single U.S. history requirement: Early U.S. History, Modern U.S. History or Comprehensive U.S. History. The changes effectively make it optional to learn about colonialism, the American War for Independence, slavery, Manifest Destiny, the Civil War and women\u2019s suffrage, among other topics.\n\n\u2018ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM\u2019: Tribes opposing a plan to bury 77,000 tons of radioactive nuclear waste in a warren of 40 miles of tunnels underneath sacred Yucca Mountain accused the government of \u201cenvironmental racism.\u201d It\u2019s not about the amount of radioactivity that would permeate the groundwater, the Western Shoshone and Timbisha Shoshone said. The environmental racism lies in the very notion that it would be okay to put any radioactive material there at all.\n\nCALTRANS AGREEMENT SCUTTLED: In California, with construction of the Willits bypass project 80 percent complete, tribes were still struggling to protect their cultural resources in the area. In September the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians withdrew from discussions about the \u201cprogrammatic agreement,\u201d which is meant to establish procedures approved by both the tribe and Caltrans for cultural resource management. In a September 2 letter, Coyote Valley Chairman Michael Hunter said the tribe was withdrawing because of inadequate tribal consultation, not being able to agree on the standards by which sites were identified and protected, conflict over measures to compensate for sites that have already been damaged, and a lack of communication and good faith.\n\nARCTIC DRILLING NIXED: Royal Dutch Shell finally declared its $7 billion, seven-year attempt to figure out how to drill offshore in the Arctic a non-started. The oil giant announced on September 28 that prohibitive cost coupled with disappointing test-well results had led to the decision. Indigenous opponents and environmentalists were jubilant.\n\nHISTORIC SETTLEMENT: The Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes each received a portion of a $186 million settlement with the U.S. Department of the Interior over a 2005 case alleging that the federal government had mishandled lands in trust.\n\nPREVENTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: On October 1, the first day of National Domestic Violence Prevention Month, the federal government awarded $21 million to help tribes prevent violence in the home.\n\n\u2018SAINT OF GENOCIDE\u2019: Tempers were overflowing after the canonization of Junipero Serra last month, and a few days after the September 23 ceremony by Pope Francis, vandals struck at Mission Carmel, where Serra is buried. They scrawled \u201cSaint of Genocide\u201d on a headstone, toppled a Serra statue and splashed green and white paint around the cemetery, police said. The Esselen Nations called the vandalism \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not approve nor condone the recent desecration,\u201d said Louise Miranda Ramirez, Tribal Chairwoman of the Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation (OCEN), whose ancestors are buried at the mission. \u201cWe do not express ourselves in this manner, despite decades of victimization by others. We are a respectful and prayerful group of people.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, some noted the irony that the incident is being investigated as a hate crime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News in Indian country for the week ending October 4, 2015: Jess Sixkiller's murder goes unsolved, Susan Taffe Reed reassigned at Dartmouth, lacrosse.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/10/04/week-was-big-stories-indian-country-october-4-2015-161959", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/week_that_was_10-4-15.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The Week That Was: The Big Stories in Indian Country, October 4, 2015"}, "abstract": "News in Indian country for the week ending October 4, 2015: Jess Sixkiller's murder goes unsolved, Susan Taffe Reed reassigned at Dartmouth, lacrosse.", "keywords": "Darrell Dale Standing Elk, Jess Sixkiller, Crime, Caltrans, Domestic Violence, Susan Taffe Reed, Jeb Bush, Vandalism, Junipero Serra", "dc": {"title": "The Week That Was: The Big Stories in Indian Country, October 4, 2015"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/10/04/week-was-big-stories-indian-country-october-4-2015-161959", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-10-04T18:15-04:00", "dcterms.title": "The Week That Was: The Big Stories in Indian Country, October 4, 2015"}, "article_summary": "The first Native American officer on the Chicago police force, Sixkiller went on to become the first Indian detective in Chicago.\nAfter Bush told Sirius XM that he didn't find the team name offensive and that \u201cNative American tribes generally don\u2019t find it offensive,\u201d the reaction was immediate.\nThere was some tragic news out of Indian country this past week, though between a major lacrosse win and some large federal grants, there were a few things worth celebrating.\nUNSOLVED MURDER: Cherokee elder and urban Indian activist Jess Sixkiller, 78, was murdered at about 3 a.m. on September 25 at his home in Phoenix.\n\u201cEvery now and then, Native DNA produces a Crazy Horse, a Geronimo, a Chief Joseph, or a Darrell Standing Elk,\u201d said American Indian Movement (AIM) founder Dennis Banks in a statement."}
