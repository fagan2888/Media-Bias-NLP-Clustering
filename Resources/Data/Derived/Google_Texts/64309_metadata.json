Rice said she and her family are now fighting for justice.\n\nShe said her boyfriend, 23-year-old Rodney Walker, was shot and killed after their fight was over.\n\nThe officer and witnesses told a much different story.\n\n\u201cIt was a regular day to us,\u201d said Rice. \u201cWe didn't think none of this stuff was going to happen.\u201d\n\nRice admitted she and Walker got into an argument Friday night, but said it never got physical.\n\n1/16/2015 Related Story: Off-Duty Dept. Of Veterans Affairs Officer Involved In Fatal Tulsa Shooting\n\n\u201cAs soon as he got out of his car, he had the gun pointed at Rodney. Rodney was trying to walk away. Our argument was over,\u201d said Rice.\n\nBryiant told police he and his family saw what appeared to be a domestic fight on the sidewalk as they headed to the Garth Brooks concert.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of people around saying there was some sort of disagreement,\u201d said Tulsa homicide detective, Dave Walker.\n\nBryiant quickly got out to help diffuse the situation, and police said he identified himself as law enforcement.\n\nThat apparently started a confrontation between him and Rodney. But Quinteisha claimed that's not how it happened, and Bryiant never identified himself.\n\n\u201cAs Rodney was walking away, the officer fired three shots. He missed. He walked up a little bit closer and he hit Rodney three times,\u201d said Rice.\n\nTulsa police said they have not heard Quinteisha's version of the story.\n\n\u201cThe girlfriend told me she blacked out. She didn't know what happened. So now we're hearing a different story,\u201d said Walker.\n\nPolice said Rodney was carrying a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe officer saw a gun in the waistband. He's already involved in the situation. It rapidly evolves, and it rapidly evolves into a shooting,\u201d said Walker.\n\n\u201cHe was innocent, he didn't do anything wrong,\u201d said Rice.\n\nAuthorities said the investigation is ongoing, and Tulsa investigators told News 9 there is not enough evidence to arrest the Veterans Affairs officer at this point.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The girlfriend of a man shot and killed by an off-duty metro police officer on Friday spoke out.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/27888072/girlfriend-of-man-killed-by-metro-area-officer-speaks-out", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/6484191_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The girlfriend of a man shot and killed by an off-duty metro police officer on Friday spoke out.", "title": "Girlfriend Of Man Killed By Metro-Area Officer Speaks Out"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/6484191_G.jpg", "description": "The girlfriend of a man shot and killed by an off-duty metro police officer on Friday spoke out.", "card": "summary", "title": "Girlfriend Of Man Killed By Metro-Area Officer Speaks Out"}, "wnreadableurl": "girlfriend-of-man-killed-by-metro-area-officer-speaks-out", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/01/19", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc, news9.com ,news 9, kwtv,Officer-Involved Shooting", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS10", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc, news9.com ,news 9, kwtv,Officer-Involved Shooting"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea84\"", "article_summary": "She said her boyfriend, 23-year-old Rodney Walker, was shot and killed after their fight was over.\nAuthorities said the investigation is ongoing, and Tulsa investigators told News 9 there is not enough evidence to arrest the Veterans Affairs officer at this point.\nOf Veterans Affairs Officer Involved In Fatal Tulsa Shooting\u201cAs soon as he got out of his car, he had the gun pointed at Rodney.\n\u201cThe officer saw a gun in the waistband.\nThe girlfriend of a man shot and killed by an off-duty metro police officer on Friday spoke out."}
