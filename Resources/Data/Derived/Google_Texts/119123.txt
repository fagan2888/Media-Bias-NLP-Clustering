Obama assesses the midterms

President Obama on Wednesday assessed his party's resounding defeat in the midterm elections, saying the clear message from voters was that Washington needs to scrap the dysfunction and finally "get stuff done." Obama said he would work with Republicans on issues where there is broad bipartisan agreement, and take executive action when he is compelled to act alone. "Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign," he said. "I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions Congress won't like."
