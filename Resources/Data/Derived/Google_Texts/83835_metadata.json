And does she think President Obama\u2019s policies have effectively addressed income inequality and unemployment?\n\nThere will be her sudden strangeness in her own party \u2014 Democrats no longer hold the same affinity for the banks and corporate America that she once did (and maybe still does). Will progressives Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor de Blasio pull her leftward or cast her out as a \u201990s-era moderate Democrat who\u2019s out of touch with the party\u2019s newly ascendant wing?\n\nAnd there will be the inevitable questions from Republicans about her handling of Benghazi. Of course, as former secretary of state, she will also have to defend Obama\u2019s policies on Syria, drones, the NSA spying program and Iran, in all of which she had direct involvement.\n\nClinton will most certainly want to run away from some of Obama\u2019s missteps and prove she would have done things differently, which will make things difficult for the sitting President and the Democratic narrative. As former John McCain adviser Michael Goldfarb put it: \u201cCutting the Army by 20%? Leaving Syria to the slaughter? Letting Iran go nuclear? . . . I think Hillary will want to show she\u2019s made of sterner stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd now, a new front is brewing that may bring Clinton\u2019s strategic judgment more directly into question: Russia.\n\nThe Russian \u201creset\u201d that she oversaw early in her State Department career was immediately called a bust, thanks partly to a botched translation mission and a mockable prop that overly simplified the situation with the U.S.\u2019 Cold War foe.\n\nAfter both Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin \u2014 two of the voices most readily dismissed by Democrats \u2014 pointed out years ago how seriously the United States needed to take Russia and Vladimir Putin, it seems as though Obama and his secretary of state systematically underestimated our Russian opponent.\n\nSince the \u201creset,\u201d Russia has enjoyed a number of boons that have emboldened a country with otherwise very little leverage, other than natural gas. The UN helped make Russia central in the nuclear negotiations with Iran. The U.S. has made Russia important in brokering a farcical chemical weapons deal with Syria. And the international community has elevated Russia by allowing it to buy \u2014 through corruption \u2014 a successful 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nPutin is on top of the world.\n\nOur failed reset, which Clinton oversaw, and our continued overestimating of Russia\u2019s good faith have put us in the precarious position of having to capitulate to Putin\u2019s every whim.\n\nAnd if Clinton thinks she\u2019s going to get off the hook for it, she\u2019s sadly mistaken. While she might not have to answer for Obama\u2019s actions now, she\u2019ll certainly have to answer for mistakes she and he made earlier.\n\nAs Clinton watcher Maggie Haberman writes in Politico, \u201c. . . the conflict is another instance in which Clinton is tethered to the administration\u2019s decisions heading into 2016.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not only the baggage of two Presidents potentially dragging her down; on the long walk to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., she is carrying plenty of her own.\n\nContact Cupp at www.thesecupp.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "S.E.
