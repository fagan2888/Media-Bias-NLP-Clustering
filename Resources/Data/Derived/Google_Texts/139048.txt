A woman, toddler and teenager were transported to local hospitals after a one-vehicle crash in Longmont that left the children trapped inside a truck and the driver pinned beneath it, officials said.

The incident took place Sunday afternoon at 115th Street and Highway 66, said Cmdr. Jeff Satur, spokesman for the Longmont Police Department.

A woman driving a black 4-door pick-up truck lost control of the vehicle and went off the road, Satur said.

There may have been a vehicle turning onto 115th Street that the woman was trying to avoid that caused her to crash, Satur said.

The woman was ejected from the truck and airlifted to an area hospital.

Longmont Fire Department used extrication equipment to lift the truck off the driver who was pinned underneath it.

A toddler and teenager who were trapped in the vehicle were also taken to a local hospital, Satur said.

The teenager was out walking around after the crash, Satur said, but he did not know the conditions of the woman or the toddler.

Roads in the area will be closed as Colorado State Patrol continues to investigate the scene.
