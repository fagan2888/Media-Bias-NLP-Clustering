He was 73.\n\nGerhardt, who lived in Westminster, began working at the now-defunct News in 1967 and retired in 2007.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of extraordinary grace and integrity \u2014 a fine journalist who not only informed his readers but painted wonderful stories that engaged and entertained,\u201d former News reporter Shelley Gonzales said in an Internet post. \u201cNothing ever ruffled him. Ever. He was zen before it was cool.\u201d\n\nGerhardt grew up in Wheat Ridge and attended Regis University before graduating from Western State College of Colorado \u2014 now Western State Colorado University \u2014 in Gunnison.\n\nHis intimate knowledge of the metro area and the state gave him a rare insight into the issues he covered, said Kevin Flynn, a former News reporter who is now a member of the Denver City Council, representing District 2.\n\n\u201cGary represented something that is really very rare in big-city journalism, and that is a local kid who grows up and covers his hometown,\u201d Flynn said.\n\nFlynn and Gerhardt were members of a reporting team that covered the murder of local radio talk show host Alan Berg, who was gunned down in his Denver driveway in 1984 by members of the white nationalist group The Order.\n\nBerg, who broadcast on 850 KOA radio, was an outspoken and, at times, abrasive personality. He clashed with callers on a wide range of issues, including politics, religion and race.\n\nAfter the slaying, Gerhardt, who was on the police beat at the time, asked a Denver detective whether police had any suspects. The detective \u201creached out and picked up the big Denver white pages book, and said, \u2018Yeah, all of these,\u2019 \u201d Flynn said.\n\nThe pair interviewed members of far-right extremist groups and chronicled the development of The Order in the book \u201cThe Silent Brotherhood: Inside America\u2019s Racist Underground.\u201d\n\nGerhardt was a big man, well over 6 feet tall, a height that gave Flynn some comfort when the two were meeting with the subjects of their book.\n\n\u201cHe towered over me, which always felt good\u201d when confronting extremists, Flynn said.\n\nGerhardt went on to write about the environment, chronicling the reintroduction of lynx to Colorado, the impact of chronic wasting disease on elk and deer, and other issues.\n\nIn 2002, the newspaper was a runner-up for the John B. Oakes Award for Distinguished Environmental Journalism for \u201cKiller in the Herds,\u201d a 20-page special report on chronic wasting disease, reported and written by Gerhardt, Todd Hartman and Lou Kilzer.\n\n\u201cHe loved nature. When he wrote about it, he wrote about it from the perspective of someone who respected the land,\u201d Flynn said.\n\nIt was one of many awards he won during his years in journalism. He was also a recipient of the National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship at the University of Michigan in 1982.\n\nHe was well liked by colleagues, said former News reporter Kevin Vaughan.\n\n\u201cHe was a big guy with a big, barrel chest and a big boomy voice,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cHe could tell these fantastic stories about being a reporter in Denver, and they always ended with everybody roaring with laughter. I am thankful I had the chance to work with him. He was one of those characters who was great to have in a newsroom.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Nancy, sons James and Jerry, his daughters, Barbara DuB\u00e9 and Kim Perigo, and six grandchildren.\n\nServices are 11 a.m. Thursday, Dec. 10, at Spirit of Christ Catholic Community, 7400 W. 80th Ave. in Arvada.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gary Gerhardt, Rocky Mountain News veteran and award winner, dies at 73", "title": "Gary Gerhardt, Rocky Mountain News veteran and award winner, dies at 73", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/06/gary-gerhardt-rocky-mountain-news-veteran-and-award-winner-dies-at-73/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206__Gary_Gerhardtp1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206__Gary_Gerhardtp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T14:16:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:41:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The detective \u201creached out and picked up the big Denver white pages book, and said, \u2018Yeah, all of these,\u2019 \u201d Flynn said.\nGary Gerhardt, a reporter who produced award-winning coverage of the environment and local news and was a mainstay of the Rocky Mountain News for 40 years, died Friday.\n\u201cHe could tell these fantastic stories about being a reporter in Denver, and they always ended with everybody roaring with laughter.\nAfter the slaying, Gerhardt, who was on the police beat at the time, asked a Denver detective whether police had any suspects.\n\u201cHe was a big guy with a big, barrel chest and a big boomy voice,\u201d Vaughan said."}
