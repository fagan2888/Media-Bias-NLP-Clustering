NEW HANOVER COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — A man is behind bars after supposedly robbing a church with a weapon in New Hanover County Sunday.

Lieutenant Jerry Brewer with the New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to a call at Living Waters Ministries around 5:00 am. Deputies approached Joshua Page, 23, but then Brewer said he ran.

That’s when Brewer said they noticed Page had a gun on him, so says he said they tased Page and arrested him.

Page is in jail charged with breaking or entering a place of worship, felony possession of a firearm, carrying a concealed weapon, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia and resisting officers.

He is in jail on a $250,000 bond.
