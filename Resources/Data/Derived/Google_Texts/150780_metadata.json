Some religious conservatives believe that IUDs are forms of \u201cabortifacients,\u201d even though that's at odds with the available science. (Read Jen Gunter\u2019s primer on this, from a few months ago, if you want a fuller treatment of that question.) They'd prefer the devices not be used and they certainly don't want to pay for them indirectly, whether it's through taxes or through insurance premiums.\n\nBut here\u2019s something to consider. Birth control doesn\u2019t simply reduce unwanted pregnancies. It also reduces abortions. In the New England Journal study, the mean abortion rate among participants was less than one-fourth the rate for sexually active 14- to 19-year-old women nationally. That\u2019s a pretty massive difference. Some social conservatives don\u2019t consider that argument relevant, because they think women can and should avoid pregnancy through other methods. To the rest of us, however, those numbers sure look like a powerful case for making birth control free.\n\n\u2014Jonathan Cohn\n\nNews from Wednesday:\n\nEBOLA The Centers for Disease Control released more information about the patient in Texas. The good news is that he's in serious but stable condition, while officials are following the relative people who came into contact with him once he started to show symptoms. The bad news is that doctors had sent him home after his first visit to the hospital, rather than recognizing a possible case of Ebola based on his travel history. Julia Belluz breaks it all down and Jonathan Cohn asks why hospital staff failed to catch Ebola when they first saw the patient. (Vox, QED)\n\nVOTING RIGHTS: A federal appeals court blocked parts of North Carolina\u2019s 2010 law that imposed broad voting restrictions, such as the elimination of same-day voter registration. This isn\u2019t the end of the story, since government officials are sure to appeal the decision.

(Zeke Miller, Time)\n\nDEFENSE: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called on the military to get its hospitals and clinics into shape, giving underperforming facilities between four and six weeks to outline plans for improvement. His directive comes after a report that found that in one-fifth of military hospitals, patients who need acute care can\u2019t receive help within twenty-four hours.

(Pedro Nicolaci Da Costa, Wall Street Journal)\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s Poverty Plan Isn\u2019t So Novel: Beginning in 1997, a program called Building Nebraska Families strived to dig families out of poverty by assigning each a caseworker -- a strategy that is central to Paul Ryan\u2019s plan. Daniel Luzer writes what we can learn from that experiment.

Framing the issue in a way that conservatives can stomach might be key to getting their support.
