The sole candidate for the position of superintendent of the Fort Worth ISD withdrew his candidacy Saturday night.

Sante Fe Public Schools Superintendent Joel D. Boyd said in an email to trustees provided to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that “… the Sante Fe community has helped me to realize that the timing is not right and that we need to continue forward and not lose momentum for the sake of our children.”

The FWISD board voted 7-0, with two absent trustees, to select Boyd as the sole finalist. The search pool was narrowed to three candidates and a backup. The other two candidates withdrew their applications – one took another job and a second dropped out after news leaked to his board that he had interviewed in Fort Worth. Boyd was left as the sole finalist.

The Star-Telegram reported that four trustees were having second thoughts about Boyd being chosen.

Trustee Ann Sutherland issued a statement Friday saying that though Boyd’s performance during his final interview was “outstanding,” a post-interview examination of his tenure in Sante Fe revealed tension between teachers and Boyd.

“There have been many teacher resignations, including one of a nationally recognized teacher, as well as at least one major walk-out by students in protest over his testing regimen,” she said. “Anecdotal comments from the community also report that he has treated teachers with unusual disrespect, including (a) entering classrooms and criticizing teachers in front of students and (b) during meetings with teacher representatives, banging on the table, talking on his cell phone and making other disrespectful gestures.”

Sutherland said she believed Boyd’s management pattern was counter to Fort Worth’s needs and said she would vote “no” on a motion to hire him.
