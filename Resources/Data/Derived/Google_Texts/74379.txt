Faulkton, SD

The board of education in Faulkton is accepting proposals from architects and engineers for a new school.



The school district is looking to build a new facility to replace the main part of the school. Superintendent Joel Price says the three-story high school building opened in 1932 and the elementary wing in 1960.



Price says the existing facility that houses the district's 200 students doesn't comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.



The district hopes to build the new facility in the existing school's parking lot to avoid disrupting classes. The school addition built in 2004 including a gym and community center wouldn't be replaced.



Proposals are due April 10. Officials say it could take up to five years before the new school opens.
