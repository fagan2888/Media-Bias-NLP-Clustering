Virtually everyone in the country is now required to have coverage through an employer or a government program, or by buying individual policies.\n\nThis is the first year fines are being collected from uninsured people the government deems able to afford coverage. Tax preparation company H&R Block says the penalty averages about $170 among its affected customers. It usually is deducted from a person\u2019s tax refund.\n\nThose penalized are mainly the kind of people the law was intended to help: low- and middle-income workers who do not have coverage on the job or are self-employed. Roughly 4 million people are expected to pay fines, according to congressional estimates. Many more will qualify for exemptions.\n\nTravel agent Charles Baxter of Phoenix said his tax refund was reduced by $247 for being uninsured in 2014. He had not heard about the second chance to sign up for 2015 coverage.\n\nBaxter says he will take another look now, but is not sure whether he will opt to buy insurance. Much of his income goes to help take care of his mother, who has health problems.\n\n\u201cI may have to see if any of the health care costs have changed, to where I might be able to squeeze it in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so far, it\u2019s not looking like it.\u201d\n\nLaura Adams, a senior analyst for InsuranceQuotes.com, told TheBlaze last week she too didn\u2019t think that just because those getting hit with the fine this year would necessarily sign up during this special enrollment period.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that every single uninsured American will be in the loop on this information in a year,\u201d Adams said, also talking about how such extended enrollment periods could hurt the taxpaying public in the long run.\n\nBaxter supports the overall goals of the health law, but says the government should also look at someone\u2019s expenses \u2014 not just income \u2014 before assessing the fine.\n\nPenalties for being uninsured are going up this year, to a minimum of $325 for the full 12 months. That\u2019s a significant increase from the $95 minimum in 2014.\n\nThe new sign-up opportunity runs through April 30. To qualify, individuals have to certify to the government that they meet certain conditions, including:\n\nThey did not know or understand that they were legally required to have coverage until after open enrollment officially ended Feb. 15.\n\nThey owed a penalty for being uninsured in 2014.\n\nThose requirements are for the 37 states served by the federal HealthCare.gov website. States running their own insurance exchanges may have different rules and deadlines. Penalties for 2014 are not refundable.\n\nThe Obama administration acted after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns. With open enrollment officially over, someone who was uninsured and filed a tax return after Feb. 15 would not have been able to get coverage for 2015. That person would owe the penalty for 2014 and could get locked into a bigger fine for 2015.\n\n\u201cMost people can assume that whatever they paid this year, next year they will pay twice that much or more,\u201d said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). \u201cWhy pay what is in essence a penalty, when you can be applying those dollars to protect your family?\u201d\n\nThe administration is publicizing the special sign-up period as tax filing season continues. For customers who paid a fine, major tax preparation companies are notifying them about the second chance to get coverage.\n\nTax preparers and some public policy experts have urged the government to move the health care law\u2019s sign-up period so it dovetails with tax-filing season. People expecting a refund might be willing to spend some of it on health insurance.\n\nMark Ciaramitaro, vice president of health care services at H&R Block, said the penalty is definitely getting taxpayers\u2019 attention. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some people, it\u2019s having significant effects.\u201d\n\nCari Gerrits of Atlanta was uninsured for part of last year when she was between jobs, and her penalty ended up being $191. She has coverage now through her job in marketing and business development for an engineering company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supportive of having a baseline of care for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the marrying of a very complicated medical law with an already confusing tax law has probably not made it as popular as it could be.\u201d\n\nJesse Bracewell of Huntsville, Alabama, was uninsured last year because he could not fit premiums into his budget as a college student finishing an engineering degree. He paid a penalty of $95. This year, he signed up to avoid rising fines.\n\n\u201cThat penalty set me back about three weeks\u2019 worth of gas,\u201d Bracewell said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON\u00a0(TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 Though several million people are being hit with new federal fines on their taxes for going without health insurance are getting a second chance to sign up, it is unclear if they will take advantage of the special enrollment period that opened Sunday.
