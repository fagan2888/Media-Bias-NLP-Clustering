A Chattanooga man living on Dee Drive was charged with sexual battery after police say he lured young girls into his home with candy so that he could touch them.

The two girls said they went to the home of 68-year-old Glen Kelly to buy candy, something they said many neighborhood children did.

They said Kelly asked them to come inside his home while he went to get the candy for them.

One child said Kelly began rubbing her back before asking her "to touch his private parts."

According to police, he did the same thing to the other girl.

The girls also reported that Kelly tried to stuff the money they gave him for the candy down their shirt.

At this point, the girls said they ran out and went home.

Kelly was arrested on Monday afternoon. He was charged with one count of aggravated sexual battery and one count of sexual battery.
