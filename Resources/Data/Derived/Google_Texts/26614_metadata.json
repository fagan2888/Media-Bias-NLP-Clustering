The investigators found that 43 percent of the children had experienced face-to-face bullying and 7 percent had been subjected to some form of cyberbullying through text messages, social media and other means.\n\nKids who experienced either in-person or online bullying were more likely to display aggressive behaviors, such as physical fighting, verbal hostility, property damage and peer coercion, the findings showed.\n\nBut the risk of those behaviors was more than twice as high among victims of both types of bullying, the study authors said.\n\nOf the kids who experienced both forms of bullying, 38 percent showed aggressive behavior. This compared with 15 percent of those who were cyberbullied and 4 percent of those who were victims of face-to-face bullying alone.\n\nThe findings were scheduled for presentation Saturday at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting, in Baltimore.\n\nThe results are concerning, but not surprising, study senior investigator Dr. Andrew Adesman said in an American Academy of Pediatrics news release.\n\n\"These behaviors may involve retaliatory measures against their aggressors, acting aggressive in order to fend off future bullying attempts, or worse, learning by example and engaging in bullying of previously uninvolved peers,\" Adesman said. He is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York.\n\nHua also noted that with the high rates of mobile device use by young people, there should be greater focus on cyberbullying and its harm, especially when combined with face-to-face bullying.\n\nResearch presented at meetings should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has more on bullying.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.
