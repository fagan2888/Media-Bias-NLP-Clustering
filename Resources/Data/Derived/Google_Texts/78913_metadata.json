Pueblo Blvd.\n\nLongo\u2019s application is further along in the city\u2019s licensing process. His proposed site has been certified by city planners that it fits within the strict zoning restrictions set by City Council in 2010.\n\nThe other two applications are the initial requests to have their proposed sites checked for zoning conflicts.\n\nThe city has 90 days to give Montoya and Pagano answers. Pagano filed his application on Feb. 19 while Montoya filed his Friday.\n\nIf they are certified, they join Longo in needing to apply for a special-use permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals followed by a city licensing hearing before Municipal Court Judge William Martinez.\n\nAnd all three applicants also would need state licenses to open their doors.\n\nEven so, the three applications prove that people now want to open marijuana stores within the city limits. Council has relied on its tough medical marijuana zoning restrictions to thwart interest in the past but with recreational pot now being sold in the county, the focus on the city has intensified.\n\nRight now, only medical marijuana store operators are being granted state licenses for recreational sales.\n\nThe city\u2019s current moratorium on recreational pot stores expires March 31 and council is beginning to focus on whether to adopt zoning and licensing regulations for those businesses as well.\n\nproper@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/politics/2344627-120/pot-marijuana-medical-zoning", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://forms.chieftain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pueblo-chieftain-1200x630.png", "type": "article", "title": "Pueblo gets 2 more pot shop requests"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "article_summary": "By peter roper The pueblo chieftainThe line to open a medical marijuana store in Pueblo is getting longer.\nTwo more applications for pot stores were filed with the city\u2019s planning office late last month.\nSteven Montoya has applied to open a medical marijuana store at 21 Monarch Lane.\nEven so, the three applications prove that people now want to open marijuana stores within the city limits.\nThe city\u2019s current moratorium on recreational pot stores expires March 31 and council is beginning to focus on whether to adopt zoning and licensing regulations for those businesses as well."}
