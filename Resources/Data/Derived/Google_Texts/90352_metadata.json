In early November, President Obama challenged 20 communities around the country to compete with one another in signing up people who were uninsured. The places were chosen because they had large numbers of uninsured residents or because people lacking coverage accounted for a large share of the population.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA scoreboard prepared by the White House says that Milwaukee \u2014 with a Democratic mayor who strongly supports the health law \u2014 has made the most progress, followed by Detroit, Philadelphia, Chicago, Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. Oakland, Calif., Nashville, Tampa, Fla., and Salt Lake City were also in the top 10.\n\nDallas, Denver, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Phoenix and Great Falls, Mont., did less well, but are \u201cstill in the game,\u201d the Obama administration said Monday.\n\nNot everyone is on board. A news release on Nov. 6 from the Obama administration said that Mayor Michael J. Winters of Great Falls had \u201cembraced the Healthy Communities Challenge.\u201d\n\nMr. Winters, in an interview Monday, was less than enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we want to be involved in,\u201d said the mayor, a Republican completing his third term. \u201cIf the White House wants to push its agenda, they should do it without our participation.\u201d\n\nMr. Winters said White House officials had reached out to him. \u201cThey were rather pushy about it, borderline rude,\u201d he said. \u201cMontanans don\u2019t appreciate people calling us and being rude to us on the phone.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment. Bob Kelly, a city commissioner who is to become mayor of Great Falls in January, said that despite the views of Mr. Winters, \u201cthere is a coalition of health care providers and organizations holding enrollment events and publicizing opportunities for coverage here.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials declined to provide enrollment data for the 20 cities they said were participating in the president\u2019s Healthy Communities Challenge.\n\nMayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, a Democrat who served in the House of Representatives from 1993 to 2003, made sure his city helped people enroll at health insurance fairs and included information about open enrollment in residents\u2019 water bills.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEnrollment is open through Jan. 31. People who go without insurance next year may be subject to tax penalties of $695 a person or more, although some may qualify for exemptions.\n\nPeople can apply for insurance online, at HealthCare.gov, or by calling the federal marketplace at 800-318-2596.\n\nFederal officials have encouraged consumers who have coverage to return to the marketplace and shop for insurance for 2016. People who do not do so will, in many cases, be automatically re-enrolled in the same or similar plans, although the premiums, subsidies and other details of coverage may be different.\n\nAndrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal marketplace, said that HealthCare.gov was handling \u201crecord traffic\u201d on Monday, with 178,000 people using the site at 2:30 p.m., higher than the number of users at any other point this year or last year.\n\nAs of June 30, about 9.9 million people had coverage through the federal and state marketplaces, and more than four out of five of them were receiving subsidies to help pay their premiums.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, has said she expects 10 million people to have coverage through the federal and state marketplaces at the end of 2016.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151214204500, "twitter": {"description":
