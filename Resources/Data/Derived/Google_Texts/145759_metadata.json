Marco Rubio has come out swinging at President Obama\u2019s decision to normalize relations with Cuba. The Florida Republican called it a \u201cconcession to tyranny.\u201d\n\nRubio, a Cuban-American, deemed the move a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d setback for both Americans and Cubans, writing in the Wall Street Journal that it marks a global \u201cvictory\u201d for oppressive regimes.\n\nThe entire policy shift is based on the illusion\u2014in fact, on the lie\u2014that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people. Cuba already enjoys access to commerce, money and goods from other nations, and yet the Cuban people are still not free. They are not free because the regime\u2014just as it does with every aspect of life\u2014manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island. More economic engagement with the U.S. means that the regime\u2019s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come\u2014dashing the Cuban people\u2019s hopes for freedom and democracy.\n\nRubio pointed to previous negotiations with Cuba, saying the possibility of improved relations had always been made clear, but that step would be taken only after a substantial shift in oppressive governing.\n\n>>> U.S. and Cuba Swap Prisoners; Obama Ends Isolation Policy\n\nThis shift, Rubio notes, has not been made, yet Obama has illustrated a plan to normalize relations with little in return for both Cubans and Americans.\n\nObama justified the plan in his announcement yesterday by calling the current Cuban-American relationship an \u201coutdated approach\u201d that has \u201cfailed\u201d to further U.S. interests.\n\n>>> Obama Does Not Have the Authority to Lift Embargo on Cuba\n\nAccording to Rubio, this uneven trade-off further established Obama as the \u201csingle worst negotiator\u201d he has seen in his lifetime.\n\nTo counteract this, Rubio announced he will do everything he can to \u201cunravel\u201d the president\u2019s plan by aligning with congressional Republicans to block the Cuban ambassador nomination and funding for an embassy.\n\nBeyond the political implications, Rubio believes Obama\u2019s move is detrimental to U.S. relations abroad because of the \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d it could set in future negotiations.\n\nThe release of U.S. contractor Alan Gross who had been imprisoned in Cuba for five years was part of a separate deal, but marked similar repercussions to the senator.\n\nPresident Obama made it clear that if you take an American hostage and are willing to hold him long enough, you may not only get your own prisoners released from U.S. jails\u2014as three Cuban spies were\u2014you may actually win lasting policy concessions from the U.S. as well. This precedent places a new price on the head of every American, and it gives rogue leaders around the world more clear-cut evidence of this president\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 and his willingness to abandon fundamental principles in a desperate attempt to burnish his legacy.\n\nThough Rubio lauded Gross\u2019 release, he said the deal as a whole is just another concession to oppression that endangers Americans and Cubans alike.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
