A Chobani yogurt recall framed by the company as a tiny quality control issue caused much backlash this week, as customers accused the brand of not only mishandling the issue, but exposing buyers to illness and deleting comments from Facebook indicating others should be careful.

The Chobani yogurt recall followed increasing reports of yogurt cups that had been compromised — bulging, leaking, fizzing, and “chunking” before the expiration date had passed.

Several customers took to Facebook to report feeling ill, queasy, or simply finding their usually delicious yogurt to be unpalatable, prompting a message from Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya posted on the brand’s page.

Amy Juaristi, director of public relations during the Chobani yogurt recall, explained that the issue was a common one in the dairy industry:

“We recently identified mold in a limited amount of product that came from our Idaho facility. While this type of mold is common in the dairy environment, particularly when using only natural ingredients that are absent of artificial preservatives, it’s still unacceptable to me and all of our yogurt makers.”

Juaristi acknowledged the reports of illness preceding the Chobani yogurt recall, saying:

“We’ve received reports of people not feeling well, so we take a lot of care because it’s important for us to ensure their safety and satisfaction with our product. We’ve identified the issue at hand and are working very hard to make sure it’s addressed moving forward.”

Units affected in the Chobani yogurt recall are marked with the code 16-012 and have expiration dates between Sepember 11 and October 7.

The Chobani yogurt recall was also addressed by the Food Drug Administration Wednesday, and the agency is investigating the issue and whether it warrants heavier oversight or regulatory involvement.
