He got into his SUV, ramped up over a curb, and ran the vehicle into Senior Cpl. Ed Lujan twice, critically injuring the officer, police said.\n\nLujan was \u201cworking off duty at [the] local nightclub to provide for his family\u201d and \u201csustained critical injuries,\u201d according to a statement from the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization.\n\nThe Tyler Morning Telegraph reported thatthe SUV backed into another officer, but he suffered no injuries.\n\nPolice said Sgt. Shannon Browning and Senior Cpl. Antonio Barrientos shot Gonzalez-Rio in the arm outside the Kalua Discotheque.\n\nAfter being treated at a hospital, Gonzalez-Rio was booked and jailed Wednesday on three charges of aggravated assault on a public servant, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHere illegally from Mexico, Gonzalez-Rio reportedly had been deported in 2004, 2005, and 2011. Local TV station WFAA News 8 said the deportations happened twice near Harlingen, Texas, and most recently in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nLujan, a 20-year veteran of the Dallas force, was treated for numerous broken bones and a lacerated scalp. News 8 reported that the officer nearly died Monday morning.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama and Democrats who worked to stop the passage of Kate\u2019s Law are directly responsible for what happened to this cop,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe proposed Kate Steinle Law would slap a five-year mandatory minimum prison term on anyone who returns to the United States after being deported and is convicted of an aggravated felony\u2014or who has three strikes against him for trying to enter the country illegally.\n\nLawmakers proposed the measure after 32-year-old Kate Steinle was shot to death earlier this year on a San Francisco wharf by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. Legislation including the provision was blocked in Congress.\n\n\u201cIllegal aliens who re-enter the country after being deported need to serve time in prison to deter this kind of behavior,\u201d von Spakovsky said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police said the 29-year-old illegal immigrant ran his SUV twice into a police corporal after being ejected from a nightclub.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Police said the 29-year-old illegal immigrant ran his SUV twice into a police corporal after being ejected from a nightclub.", "title": "3-Time Deportee Charged With Running Over Police Officer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151112_IllegalMan_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-16T12:19:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MMqgmr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Police said the 29-year-old illegal immigrant ran his SUV twice into a police corporal after being ejected from a nightclub.", "title": "3-Time Deportee Charged With Running Over Police Officer", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151112_IllegalMan_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-11-12T17:41:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T12:19:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "illegal immigrants, deportations, deported illegal immigrant, immigration, illegal, Dallas police, Kate\u2019s Law"}, "article_summary": "A man deported from the United States three times is accused of running over a Dallas police officer and backing into a second cop.\nThe illegal immigrant, Eduardo Gonzalez-Rio, is being held in the Dallas County Jail, according to The Dallas Morning News.\nThe Tyler Morning Telegraph reported thatthe SUV backed into another officer, but he suffered no injuries.\nEd Lujan twice, critically injuring the officer, police said.\nHe got into his SUV, ramped up over a curb, and ran the vehicle into Senior Cpl."}
