Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate owned by billionaire Warren Buffett, is close to a deal that may be its largest acquisition ever, according to a report in Saturday's Wall Street Journal.

Berkshire has its eyes on Precision Castparts, a maker of aircraft equipment, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. Berkshire already owns 3 percent of the company, and is its largest shareholder. Based on Precision's closing price on Friday, a merger could break $30 billion, the publication added.

A deal could be announced as soon as next week, sources told the WSJ.

Founded in 1949, Portlandâ€“based Precision makes components such as fasteners and turbine blades for aircraft companies including Airbus and Boeing, and has annual sales of $10 billion. It also makes equipment for power stations and the oil-and-gas industry.

Berkshire said on Friday second-quarter profit fell 37 percent, reflecting a significant decline in investment gains and an underwriting loss from insurance.
