The first year price tag: more than $680,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA second charge, the so-called transitional re-insurance fee, is designed to stabilize premiums in the individual insurance policy market as people with pre-existing conditions attain coverage. The cost to the county is $63 per employee. About $98,000 is due the federal government by Jan. 15. This is a 3-year fee that drops in price annually.\n\nA third fee assessed on large employers will go toward a new federal trust fund that will finance research into the relative effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medicare may consider this government research institute\u0092s findings in determining what sorts of therapies it will cover.\n\nThe cost to employers is $2 per worker receiving insurance benefits. For the county, these fees will equate to about $6,000.\n\nAnderson said Macomb\u0092s total cost should fall by about $360,000 next year. The research fee and the re-insurance charge will be phased out by 2019. The 2.5 percent fee on premiums is permanent.\n\n\u0093From the political perspective, with Republicans taking over the majority in Congress, I don\u0092t think any of these fees will (go up),\u0094 he said.\n\nStill, Republican commissioners were not happy with the news.\n\nCommissioner Don Brown, a Washington Township Republican, suggested the county consider gradually reducing some employees below the ACA definition of a full-time employee \u0096 meaning less than 30 hours per week. Some companies are moving in that direction.\n\nAccording to the county Human Resources Department, labor contracts negotiated with unionized workers now allow the county to fill nearly any vacant, full-time position with two part-time employees.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s going to be the natural inclination to avoid paying these taxes. And those (employment) changes can\u0092t be good for the economy,\u0094 Brown said.\n\nGOP Commissioner Jim Carabelli of Shelby Township said the fees will also hit the private sector with some force. Large employers provide health coverage to 59 percent of private sector workers. Estimates of the cost of Obamacare for large employers over the next decade range from $151 billion to $186 billion.\n\n\u0093The cost of doing business just went up,\u0094 Carabelli said, shaking his head.\n\nExperts say some private firms might continue providing coverage to most of their workforce but nudge their sickest, costliest employees onto the Obamacare exchanges by making the company insurance plan unattractive to them.\n\nUnder this scenario, a company could shrink its network of doctors, raise co-payments or deductibles, or even offer a chronically ill employee a raise to opt out of the employer plan.\n\nCommissioner Fred Miller, a Mount Clemens Democrat, reminded his colleagues the ACA so far has provided coverage to 482,000 previously uninsured Michigan residents \u0096- some 36,000 in Macomb County \u0096- which allows them to gain access to doctors and hospitals.\n\n\u0093For those people, those families,\u0094 Miller said, \u0093that is a transformative event.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Government programs, Government programs news, Macomb Government programs news, MI Government programs news, US Government programs news, world Government programs news.", "title": "Macomb County hit with $1.5 million in Obamacare fees", "og": {"url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20141222/NEWS/141229950", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.macombdaily.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/macombdaily.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Macomb County hit with $1.5 million in Obamacare fees"}, "twitter": {"domain": "macombdaily.com", "description": "County officials are starting to feel the pain of Obamacare.", "title": "Macomb County hit with $1.5 million in Obamacare fees", "url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20141222/NEWS/141229950", "image": {"src": "http://local.macombdaily.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/macombdaily.png?052016"}, "site": "@macombdaily", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551763849", "iphone": "id520209090", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.macombdaily"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Government programs, Government programs news, Macomb Government programs news, MI Government programs news, US Government programs news, world Government programs news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "County officials are starting to feel the pain of Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6301\"", "article_summary": "The Board of Commissioners has learned the various fees levied on large employers by the Affordable Care Act will cost the county nearly $1.5 million for 2014.\nEstimates of the cost of Obamacare for large employers over the next decade range from $151 billion to $186 billion.\nThe research fee and the re-insurance charge will be phased out by 2019.\nGOP Commissioner Jim Carabelli of Shelby Township said the fees will also hit the private sector with some force.\nFor the county, these fees will equate to about $6,000."}
