Americans for Constitutional Liberty (formerly The Conservative Caucus) is a grass roots public policy action organization, formed in 1974. It was active in defeating the SALT II Treaty, repealing the Catastrophic Coverage Act, blocking the Clinton health-care takeover, impeaching President Clinton, stopping amnesty for illegal aliens, and persuading the House of Representatives to sue the President regarding ObamaCare.

Peter Thomas is the Chairman of Americans for Constitutional Liberty/The Conservative Caucus. He served in the past three Republican presidential administrations. Charles Orndorff is the Administrative Vice Chairman of Americans for Constitutional Liberty/The Conservative Caucus.
