Neil Abercrombie, predicted at least 100,000 uninsured Hawaii residents, or 8 percent of the population, would sign up for health care through the website.\n\nAs of Nov. 15, just 257 individuals have secured health care through the exchange. Some 113 employers submitted applications though the exchange, but have not yet selected plans.\n\nThe current cost breakdown is about $778,000 in federal funds for each Hawaii individual who successfully signed up for health care.\n\nThat follows a national trend. Just 106,000 people across America selected medical plans through Healthcare.gov in October.\n\nThose familiar with the exchange system\u2019s glitches said the enrollment figures aren\u2019t accurate, in part because information entered into the system doesn\u2019t always transfer correctly to health insurance providers \u2014 it\u2019s scrambled \u2014 so insurance companies cannot process it. Also, applications can be submitted several times because of technical glitches and those just checking out the exchange with no plans to sign up can falsely inflate user figures.\n\nSenate President Donna Mercado Kim said during a recent hearing that she had warned Andrews not to hire CGI Group because the company also had developed the troubled $87 million Hawaii state tax department website, which the state must spend as much as $50 million to fix.\n\nCGI Group is the same company that developed Healthcare.gov, which, according to a congressional inquiry, cost more than $600 million, but hasn\u2019t functioned properly.\n\nIndividuals and small businesses seeking insurance must enroll by Dec. 15 to get coverage that begins Jan. 1.\n\nTom Matsuda, ACA implementation manager with Abercrombie\u2019s office, will serve as interim executive director of Hawaii Health Connector, beginning Dec. 9.\n\nHe takes over the helm as some 30,000 Hawaii residents with individual plans and 140,000 people under small business plans were scheduled to lose their insurance plans as of Jan. 1.\n\nHawaii Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito has asked Hawaii health insurance companies to continue offering plans that were going to be cancelled by the end of the year because they didn\u2019t meet federal coverage requirements under new ACA mandates, but they don\u2019t have to abide by his request. His request comes as President Obama told insurers they can keep customers for another year in plans that would be deemed deficient under ACA.\n\nHawaii Health Connector Board Chair Sherry Menor-McNamara thanked Andrews for her service \u201cduring a critical time and against a very challenging backdrop.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoral played a key role in building the Hawaii Health Connector, securing funding and building a network of public and private stakeholders throughout the state,\u201d she said.\n\nA search for a permanent executive director for the Hawaii Health Exchange is now under way. Matsuda said he will not apply for the permanent position.\n\nReach Malia Zimmerman at Malia@hawaiireporter.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The director of the failing Hawaii Health Connector Obamacare health insurance exchange will step down admist controversy.", "title": "Hawaii Health Connector director steps down after health exchange's failure - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/Screen-shot-2013-10-16-at-8.17.21-AM.png", "updated_time": "2013-11-26T09:52:00+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/117727/hawaii-health-connector-director-steps-health-exchanges-failure/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Hawaii", "tag": "gordon ito health insurance commissioner,Gov.
