A lengthy profile in the Wall Street Journal captures much of that, yet leaves much unsaid. And it adds a couple of things that should have been left out.\n\nThe 1,870-word profile has several strengths. It briskly marches out the basics: 5,500 attending Keller's services, 300 church plants around the world, regular members under 35 years old. It also clearly summarizes Keller's message:\n\n\u201cEveryone has a God, everyone has a way of salvation, we just don\u2019t use the term,\u201d he says. \u201cSt. Augustine would say: What makes you what you really are is what you love the most.\u201d Mr. Keller adds that he likes \u201cto show secular people that they\u2019re not quite as unreligious as they think. They\u2019re putting their hopes in something, and they\u2019re living for it.\u201d For ambitious, driven New Yorkers, it\u2019s often a career, he says. \u201cI try to tell people: The only reason you\u2019re laying yourself out like this is because you\u2019re not really just working. This is very much your religion.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s no God, he says in sermons, then everything you do at work will be forgotten, and nothing you can do in your career will earn lasting significance. But if Christianity is true, then \u201cevery good endeavor,\u201d he likes to say, no matter how small, \u201ccan matter forever.\u201d One tough part for people, he says, is coming under \u201cGod\u2019s authority,\u201d because \u201cyou have to find your identity in Christ, and not in just fulling yourself,\u201d That \u201ccompletely collides with what the culture is telling people.\u201d\n\nIn classic profile fashion, the Journal fills in personal details: Keller's glasses, his 6-foot-plus height and the church\u2019s offices in midtown Manhattan. He \"looks less like a pastor than a professor,\" the writer says.\n\nThe story stocks a rich fund of direct quotes. Some profiles are heavy on paraphrase and commentary, almost shouting, \"This is what he/she is really like.\" The Journal allows us to \"hear\" what Keller is like through his own words.\n\nThe newspaper even does an excellent job of capturing the rhythm of his talk: The quotes closely match Keller's speech in the video above.\n\nI also liked the brutal honesty in this Keller quote:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to win people to Christ, if you\u2019re trying to say this world is not enough and you need faith\u2014I hate to say it, recessions are wonderful times for that message to fall on more open people.\u201d He adds: \u201cI wish the number of conversions and Christian growth would go along with prosperity and giving\u2014but they usually don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe article shows the flavor of Keller's thought also through his socio-cultural references. The writer says Keller \"takes on the likes of Nietzsche, Marx and Freud in a sermon rooted in a specific Biblical text. He\u2019ll sprinkle in references from popular culture\u2014something about contentment he read in the Atlantic, a poignant passage from 'Lord of the Rings.' \"\n\nShe gets him to talk a little about the unfortunate mating of conservative Christianity with conservative politics. And she tells an intriguing anecdote on how he handled a congregant's demand to address recent racial tensions. She doesn't say how she knew the anecdote, though. She may have witnessed it herself; she says upfront that she attends one of the church's campuses. But she should have attributed.\n\nThat's one small problem with this piece. Another is that it doesn't really say what launched Keller into the national evangelical eye: his 2008 book The Reason for God, a polite but vigorous apologia of the faith. The Journal also doesn't mention the Gospel Coalition, which Keller co-founded. Its 52-member council -- multistate, multiracial, multinational -- reaches far beyond New York City. The biggest hint of his global influence is saying that Redeemer has helped plant more than 300 churches in 45 cities, \"from Santiago to Dubai.\"\n\nEven inside Redeemer Church, the Journal didn't mention Hope for New York, its benevolent ministry, or the Center for Faith & Work, the church's \"cultural renewal arm.\" Both projects are linked from Keller's personal website.\n\nSome of this might have come to light had the writer asked others about Keller. Friends? Foes? Influential congregants? City officials? Evangelical colleagues? How do they see the man and his work? This is a basic element of profiles.\n\nThen there are the shopworn phrases. The article says Keller has \"revived Christian orthodoxy in the naked city,\" borrowing a title from an old TV series. Even the headline, \"God Isn\u2019t Dead in Gotham\" (which, of course, the reporter probably didn't write), is lifted from a minor gospel film, God's Not Dead, that whisked through theaters this year.\n\nBut the assertion that Keller has \"revived Christian orthodoxy\" -- in a city otherwise devoid of it -- is an incredible statement, which isn't supported in this story. It's common for devoted members of a thriving church to think that way, but at least one website counts 6,000 churches in New York. Are we to believe that only Keller's church preaches true Christianity? I doubt Keller would say so himself. Nor, of course, would pastors of the other churches.\n\nA little research would have helped here. Pollster George Barna reported in 2011 that \"residents of the New York City media market are more spiritually active today than they were in the late 1990s \u2013 and more so than they were in 2001.\" He broke that down into rises in reported prayer, church attendance and Bible reading. And those who hadn't attended church in the previous six months declined eight points, to 34 percent.\n\nEven more eyebrow raising was the area of beliefs. Barna found that \"born again Christians\" -- those who said they had a life-changing encounter with Jesus -- \"surged\" during the 1990s to 32 percent of New Yorkers. Yet the percentage of evangelicals -- people who accept the accuracy of the Bible, see the need to share their faith, etc. -- decreased over the previous 14 years, from 4 percent to 1 percent. So if there's a revival of Christian orthodoxy in New York, it wasn\u2019t evident in the research.\n\nMaybe those numbers are superseded? Maybe there's later research? If so, the story should have added it. And if not, the Journal should have accounted for Barna's findings. Or, of course, dropped the assertion.\n\nGranted, the profile is already long at 1,870 words. Granted, this is the Wall Street Journal, not The Atlantic or The New Yorker. But other newspapers run profiles with more elements in less space. That's what a full-featured profile needs. There is more to a man than his own voice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pastor Timothy Keller of Redeemer Presbyterian Church blends a good nature, \r\na nimble mind, leadership in evangelical circles, and a pastoral heart \r\ntoward fellow New Yorkers. \u00a0A lengthy profile in the Wall Street Journal \r\ncaptures much of that, yet leaves much unsaid.
