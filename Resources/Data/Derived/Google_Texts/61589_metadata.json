The improvements tend to be organic \u2013 politicians do more interviews, make more appearances, deliver more speeches, and answer more questions, and the process hones their skills. Practice makes perfect.\n\nScott Brown, however, is one of those rare candidates who defies the odds. As the only politician in the country who\u2019s run in three separate U.S. Senate campaigns in four years, one might assume he\u2019d be the sharpest and most pitch-perfect candidate in America.\n\nAnd yet, the Republican is arguably getting worse. Brown has gone from suggesting terrorists will strike by sneaking through Mexico with Ebola to arguing that Mitt Romney could stop Ebola with his amazing Romney-esque talents.\n\nScott Brown told Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade Friday that Ebola wouldn\u2019t be a problem for America if Mitt Romney had won in 2012. \u201cGosh can you imagine if Mitt was the president right now?\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe was right on Russia, he was right on Obamacare, he was right on the economy. And I guarantee you we would not be worrying about Ebola right now and, you know, worrying about our foreign policy screw ups.\u201d\n\nClearly, all of our assumptions about candidates getting better with practice need to be revised. Brown\u2019s on-air comments may position him to lead the Mitt Romney Fan Club in whichever state Brown ends up living in next, but they\u2019re not the words of a sensible political observer.\n\nThe pitch itself defies rational thought. Even putting aside the substantive inanity, Brown isn\u2019t supposed to be running out playing the role of Romney surrogate, making the case for the failed candidate\u2019s alleged greatness; Brown is ostensibly running his own campaign \u2013 in a state Romney lost.\n\nBut even putting that aside, Romney wasn\u2019t right about Russia . It\u2019s hard to say whether Romney was \u201cright on Obamacare\u201d given that Romney created the blueprint for the Affordable Care Act before deciding he no longer liked his successful accomplishment. We know with certainty, however, that Romney wasn\u2019t \u201cright on the economy.\u201d\n\nAs for the notion that Romney could have stopped Ebola, I\u2019d love hear more about the former one-term governor\u2019s expertise in infectious diseases.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Scott Brown is convinced the spread of the Ebola virus could have been stopped by Mitt Romney's presidency.
