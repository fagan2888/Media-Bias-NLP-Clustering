New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said this morning on "This Week" that President Obama should have been more specific when he made his famous promise - which he subsequently backtracked on - that Americans who liked their health care plans could keep them under his signature health care law.

"He should have just been more specific because the point is, if you're being offered a terrible health care plan, that the minute you get sick, you're going to have to go into bankruptcy, those plans should never be offered," Gillibrand told ABC's Martha Raddatz when asked if she felt misled by the president.

When asked a second time if she felt misled by the president, Gillibrand repeated, "He should have just been specific."

"No, we all knew. The whole point of the plan is to cover things people need, like preventive care, birth control, pregnancy. How many women, the minute they get pregnant, might have risked their coverage, how many women paid more because of their gender because they might get pregnant? Those are the reforms that we have to fix," she added.

President Obama this week took responsibility for the botched rollout of Obamacare, and apologized earlier this month to Americans who have lost their health care plans as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

During the interview on "This Week," when asked about her own political future, Gillibrand responded that she was on the Hillary Clinton 2016 bandwagon, saying the former secretary of state would be an "extraordinary president."

"I have personally encouraged her, I think she would be an extraordinary president. She has not only the gravitas, but experience, what she's done as secretary of state has been incredible and I think people really are looking to her for leadership," she said.
