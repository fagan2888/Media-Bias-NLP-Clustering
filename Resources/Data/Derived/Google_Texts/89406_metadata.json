The legislation aims to expand education efforts, increase the availability of a drug, Naloxone, to treat overdoses and bolster programs to monitor prescriptions for painkillers.\n\nThe House will not be taking up this bill, though, instead moving forward with a series of its own bills.

By 2012, consumer spending made up just 18 percent of all spending on painkillers, which had since tripled to about $7.4 billion.\n\nOver the same period, deaths from overdoses in the U.S. nearly quadrupled.

Most of these unnecessary prescriptions were for respiratory conditions caused by viruses, such as a cold or bronchitis, which do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nOverprescribing antibiotics is harmful because it helps make bacteria more resistant to the drugs and more dangerous to public health.
