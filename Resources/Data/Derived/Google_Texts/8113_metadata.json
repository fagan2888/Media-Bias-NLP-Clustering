Medi-Cal is California\u2019s Medicaid program. In addition, a legislative special session on health care spending called by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) could focus more attention on programs for children in the state.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has made some progress toward expanding enrollment, but researchers say state policymakers must do more to build on those advances.\n\nSafety-Net Program Participation Varies \u2018Widely\u2019\n\nMore than 50% of California children participate in at least one nutrition assistance or public health insurance program, such as:\n\nCalFresh;\n\nMedi-Cal;\n\nSchool lunches; and\n\nThe Women, Infants and Children program.\n\nThat rate goes up to 85% among low-income children in the state, according to the PPIC report.\n\nHowever, despite increased enrollment statewide, participation in safety-net programs \u201cdiffers widely\u201d among counties. Enrollment rates ranged from 52% to 100% among the state\u2019s 58 counties.\n\n\u201cDespite the importance of safety-net programs, there is evidence of under enrollment in Medi-Cal and CalFresh relative to the size of California\u2019s eligible population,\u201d the PPIC report noted. The report highlighted several reasons why eligible residents might not sign up for safety-net programs, including:\n\nThe cost of applying for and maintaining eligibility, including taking time off of work, finding child care and other factors;\n\nA lack of familiarity with the programs or their benefits; and\n\nPublic perception of the programs.\n\nThe study found that outreach activities \u201cdo not seem to affect\u201d enrollment.\n\nSuch programs are supervised by the state, but administered by local agencies. Because safety-net programs for low-income California children \u201cserve overlapping populations,\u201d PPIC noted that \u201cintegrating administration across them can increase participation, improve the client experience and lower administrative costs.\u201d\n\nHow the ACA Is Helping\n\n\u201cThe ACA is expanding opportunities to make enrollment in one program a gateway for accessing others,\u201d according to the PPIC report. \u201cThis \u2018horizontal integration\u2019 \u2014 eligibility determination and enrollment across multiple safety-net programs \u2014 can increase participation, improve the client experience and lower administrative costs.\u201d\n\nWhile integration of programs among children already was a priority for the state before the ACA was passed, PPIC found \u201cthere is room for improvement in integrating programs and increasing enrollment, particularly among school-aged children.\u201d\n\nDespite state efforts to disseminate data on crossover enrollment, the PPIC report noted that \u201cdata on multiple program use are not routinely made available or examined\u201d and \u201c[a]dministrative data also lack information on unenrolled family members who may be eligible.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the PPIC report wrote, \u201cTo build on the positive momentum brought about by the ACA and to move toward full enrollment across counties, state policymakers can make use of our findings in several ways,\u201d including by:\n\nAllocating funding for program administration in a way that keeps pace with changes to the state\u2019s low-income population;\n\nConsidering boosting resources to counties with low enrollment in low-income children\u2019s programs; and\n\nUsing ACA funding to invest in information technology to better integrate such programs.\n\nBrief Outlines Strides, Shortfalls in Childhood Health\n\nMeanwhile, a UCLA Center for Health Policy brief released in May outlines gains the state has made in childhood health, as well as shortfalls that stakeholders still need to work on in improving.\n\nUsing data from the California Health Interview Survey, researchers examined trends over a decade for several key indicators, including:\n\nChildren being overweight for their age;\n\nHealth insurance coverage status;\n\nSource of medical care; and\n\nSchool readiness metrics.\n\nThey found \u201cimprovement in health insurance coverage and access to dental services for low-income children over the 10-year period\u201d from 2003 to 2012, but the \u201cpercentage of children who were overweight for their age remained unchanged among those in households with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.\u201d\n\nThe researchers noted that \u201c[c]losing the income gap in the percent of children who had at least one dental visit in the past 12 months was significant,\u201d but increasing the rates for children in all income groups should be the focus moving forward.\n\nMeanwhile, they noted that \u201coverweight rates among young children are now higher in California than the national average, and the rate of overweight-for-age did not improve\u201d during the research period, with low-income and Latino children more likely to be overweight than others. \u201cRenewed efforts are clearly required to reduce these disparities,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers wrote that the findings \u201ccan help guide policy and planning efforts to best meet the health \u2026 needs of young children in California.\u201d\n\nAccording to the brief, \u201c[C]ontinued monitoring of uninsured rates and of disparities within particular communities and income groups will remain important.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, tracking demographic trends in usual sources of care among young children will help in state and local planning and policy efforts.\u201d\n\nDuring a seminar on the policy brief, CHIS Director David Grant said, \u201cPublic coverage has replaced private coverage as the most common type among [California] children,\u201d adding, \u201cThe state has stepped up to the table \u2026 public insurance really saved the day in California.\u201d\n\nHowever, Grant said that progress on children\u2019s health coverage as a whole \u2014 along with rates of being overweight and having usual sources of health care \u2014 has remained flat for California kids up to five years old. Grant noted, \u201cWe can change things like health insurance rates with policy much more quickly than we can change obesity and eating behaviors and physical activity by either legislation, social messaging or other interventions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>More than half the children in California are enrolled in at least one nutrition assistance or public health insurance program, but participation varies significantly across the state, creating disparities, according to a report from the Public Policy Institute of California.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "More than half the children in California are enrolled in at least one nutrition assistance or public health insurance program, but participation varies significantly across the state, creating dis\u2026", "title": "Report Highlights Importance of Calif.\u2019s Social Safety Net for Children\u2019s Health", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/report-highlights-importance-of-califs-social-safety-net-for-childrens-health/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-07-20T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In addition, a legislative special session on health care spending called by Gov.\nWith a budget calling for more coverage for children and a special legislative session on health care spending, the state\u2019s safety net for children is getting new attention this summer.\nThat rate goes up to 85% among low-income children in the state, according to the PPIC report.\nAlthough government assistance is available for so many, wide variations in enrollment from county to county have led to disparities, according to the PPIC report released earlier this year.\n\u201cDespite the importance of safety-net programs, there is evidence of under enrollment in Medi-Cal and CalFresh relative to the size of California\u2019s eligible population,\u201d the PPIC report noted."}
