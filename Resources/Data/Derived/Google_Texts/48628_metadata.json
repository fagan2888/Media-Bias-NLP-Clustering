Lauffer said the new urgent care clinic will be more \u201cpatient-centered\u201d than an ER, and any patient who comes into the clinic with an emergency will be stabilized and transferred to an ER.\n\nLauffer also addressed concerns that there would be other changes to Saint Francis, or that all or part of the hospital might close, saying that the rest of the hospital would be unaffected by the ER change.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we have fluctuations in volume and we adjust our staffing for that, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re closing the place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of recruiting doctors...we wouldn\u2019t be recruiting people, we wouldn\u2019t be investing in a new IT system for both hospitals... we\u2019re talking millions of dollars of investment.\u201d\n\nLauffer said the Saint Francis urgent care aligns with the system\u2019s other plans to address the state\u2019s changing health care landscape.\n\nIn February, Thomas announced a partnership with Stonerise Healthcare to build a $17 million post-acute care facility in South Charleston on the Thomas Memorial Hospital campus. The proposed facility will be approximately 71,000 square feet and will specialize in six post-acute care arenas: pulmonary, cardiac telemetry, joint-replacement rehabilitation, wound care, cancer/palliative care and long-term care.\n\nReach Lydia Nuzum at lydia.nuzum@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5189 or follow @lydianuzum on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports-mitch-vingle/20160524/mitch-vingle-examining-the-states-d-i-baseball-crop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160524/GZ020401/160529757/AR/0/AR-160529757.jpg"}, "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mitch Vingle: Examining the state\u2019s D-I baseball crop"}, "article_summary": "CHRISTIAN TYLER RANDOLPH | Gazette-Mail An exterior view of Saint Francis Hospital on Laidley Street in Charleston.\nSaint Francis Hospital will move forward with its plan to convert its emergency room into an urgent care clinic, and will have completed the transition in a month, hospital officials say.\nThe proposed facility will be approximately 71,000 square feet and will specialize in six post-acute care arenas: pulmonary, cardiac telemetry, joint-replacement rehabilitation, wound care, cancer/palliative care and long-term care.\nDan Lauffer, president and CEO of Thomas Health System, said the downtown hospital\u2019s ER will become the Saint Francis First Health and Wellness Center effective April 25.\nLauffer said the new urgent care clinic will be more \u201cpatient-centered\u201d than an ER, and any patient who comes into the clinic with an emergency will be stabilized and transferred to an ER."}
