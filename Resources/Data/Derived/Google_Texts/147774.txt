× Police: Suspicious man approached child at Pequea Elementary bus stop

PEQUEA TOWNSHIP, Pa. (WPMT)- A recent incident in Lancaster County prompted Penn Manor School District Superintendent Michael G. Leichliter to send a letter to parents warning them of a man who approached a child at a school bus stop in Pequea Township Friday morning.

According to the letter, the man asked a Pequea Elementary student where she lived and asked for help with his cellphone. The student refused and the man drove away. A short time later–the man returned and asked the same student a second time for help. The girl immediately left the bus stop and returned home to tell her parents.

The suspect is described as a thin, white man with reddish-blonde hair and in his late 20s. He was seen driving a dark green, late model SUV.

Penn Manor teachers, staff and bus drivers have been alerted to the suspicious activity, Leichliter wrote. District administrators ask parents to reinforce with your children the lessons about interacting with strangers.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Southern Regional Police Department at 717-872-0352.
