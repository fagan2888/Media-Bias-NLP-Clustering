The nine of them shared a small office and were always hanging out on weekends.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of the new guy.\n\nRumor had it that he had finished med school in two years and had a photographic memory of thousands of journal articles and relevant clinical trials. When the fellows were asked to summarize patients\u2019 records for the senior faculty in the mornings, he always seemed to have the best answers.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Vitale, a 31-year-old who received her medical degree in Italy. \u201cEven if you work all night, it would be impossible to be able to put this much information together like that.\u201d\n\nThe new guy\u2019s name was a mouthful, so many of his colleagues simply called him by his nickname: Watson.\n\nFour years after destroying human competitors on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d to win a suspense-filled tournament watched by millions, the IBM computer brain is everywhere. It\u2019s done stints as a call center operator and hotel concierge. It\u2019s even published its own cookbook, with 231 pages of what the company calls \u201crecipes for innovation.\u201d (The reviews haven\u2019t been flattering \u2014 one foodie declared one of Chef Watson\u2019s creations \u201cthe worst burrito I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d) But these feats were essentially gimmicks.\n\nIBM is now training Watson to be a cancer specialist. The idea is to use Watson\u2019s increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence to find personalized treatments for every cancer patient, by comparing disease and treatment histories, genetic data, scans and symptoms against the vast universe of medical knowledge.\n\nSuch precision targeting is possible to a limited extent, but it can take weeks of dedicated sleuthing by a team of researchers. Watson would be able to make this type of treatment recommendation in mere minutes.\n\nThe IBM program is one of several new aggressive health-care projects that aim to sift through the huge pools of data created by people\u2019s records and daily routines and then identify patterns and connections to predict needs.\n\nLynda Chin, a physician-scientist and associate vice chancellor for the University of Texas System who is overseeing the Watson project at MD Anderson Cancer Center, said these types of programs are key to \u201cdemocratizing\u201d medical treatment and eliminating the disparity between those with access to the best doctors and those without. Instead of having to find specialists in a different city, photocopy and send all the patient\u2019s files to them, and spend countless hours researching the medical literature, a doctor could simply consult Watson, she said.\n\n\u201cI see technology like this as a way to really break free from our current health-care system, which is very much limited by the community providers. If you want expert care you have to go to an expert center,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there are never enough of those to go around.\u201d\n\nThe big data theory\n\nJho Low, the 33-year-old billionaire who is bankrolling MD Anderson\u2019s $50 million Watson project, said the effort grew out of his grandfather\u2019s treatment for leukemia in Malaysia. Low said he felt fortunate to be able to connect his grandfather\u2019s doctors remotely with MD Anderson specialists. He believes everyone, rich or poor, should have the same access to that kind of expertise.\n\n\u201cThis is very personal to my family. It is really something we have gone through and seen what kind of difference it can make,\u201d said Low, a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who runs one of Asia\u2019s most successful investment firms.\n\nLow is part of an influential new movement in scientific research driven by young philanthropists and tech titans who have faith that the chips, software programs, algorithms and big data that powered the information revolution can also be used to understand, upgrade and heal the human body.\n\nBut the Watson project and similar initiatives also have raised speculation \u2014 and alarm \u2014 that companies are seeking to replace the nation\u2019s approximately 900,000 physicians with software that will have access to everyone\u2019s sensitive personal health information.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of folks in medicine, quite frankly, tend to be afraid of technology like this,\u201d said Iltifat Husain, an assistant professor at the Wake Forest School of Medicine.\n\nHusain, who directs the mobile app curriculum at Wake Forest, agrees that computer systems like Watson are likely to vastly improve quality of care. But he is emphatic that computers will never replace human doctors.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things you can deduce by what a patient is not telling you, how they interact with their families, their mood, their mannerisms. They don\u2019t look at the patient as a whole,\u201d Husain said. \u201cThis is where algorithms fail you.\u201d\n\nWatson in residence\n\nNamed after Thomas Watson, IBM\u2019s first chief executive, Watson was designed to be a substantial leap forward from Deep Blue, the supercomputer that beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\nOne of the top priorities was to give Watson power to understand natural language. Much like the human brain, Watson has become smarter over time by learning from its successes and failures. Watson is literally evolving.\n\nRob Merkel, who leads IBM Watson\u2019s health group, said the company estimates that a single person will generate 1 million gigabytes of health-related data across a lifetime. That\u2019s as much data as in 300 million books.\n\n\u201cYou are deep into a realm where no human being could ever make sense of this information,\u201d Merkel said. That\u2019s where Watson comes in to create a \u201ccollective intelligence model between machine and man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not advocating that Watson replace physicians,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe are advocating that Watson does a lot of reading on behalf of physicians and provides them with timely insights.\u201d\n\nIBM has highlighted health care as Watson\u2019s priority and said it will dedicate at least 2,000 medical practitioners, clinicians, developers and researchers to the effort \u2014 partnering with Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic to collect patient information that consumers had consented to share.\n\nAmong the most ambitious projects is a partnership with 14 cancer centers to use Watson to help choose therapies based on a tumor\u2019s genetic fingerprints. Doctors have known for years that some treatments work miraculously on some patients but not at all on others. But the expense and complexity in identifying genetic mutations has made it difficult for more than a handful of patients to benefit from this new approach. The service is scheduled to launch this year.\n\nIn 2011, IBM announced that Watson had learned as much as a second-year medical student. Since then it\u2019s graduated and has been doing residencies at some of the nation\u2019s top cancer centers. In late September, Watson achieved another training milestone: It began its first fellowship in a specialty \u2014 leukemia \u2014 at MD Anderson.\n\nA team from MD Anderson and IBM spent months feeding the computer program the names, ages and genders, and medications, lab tests, imaging results and notes for thousands of leukemia patients. Watson was tripped up by little things at first. It sometimes had trouble telling whether the word \u201ccold\u201d in a doctor\u2019s notes referred to the virus or the temperature. Or whether T2 was referring to a type of MRI scan or a stage of cancer. Moreover, Watson\u2019s recommendations were often a little wacky.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started, he was like a little baby,\u201d said Tapan Kadia, an assistant professor in the leukemia department. \u201cYou would put in a diagnosis, and he would return a random treatment.\u201d\n\nTo teach Watson, the doctors would have to manually type in what they believed the \u201cright\u201d treatments should be and why. They also handpicked journal articles for Watson and started giving it access to newly published material.\n\nKoichi Takahashi, at the top of last year\u2019s class of fellows and recently appointed an assistant professor, said he\u2019s been impressed so far. Watson\u2019s ability to synthesize a patient\u2019s history is \u201camazing,\u201d Takahashi said. \u201cHe beats me.\u201d\n\nVitale, who did her residency in hematology in Italy, said she thought it was \u201ca little bit strange\u201d that a computer program would be in her class of fellows. But now, she said, she regularly tells Watson about journal articles that might be helpful, by inputting a citation and highlighting key passages, and Watson helps her delve into patient records much faster than she could on her own.\n\n\u201cWe are still learning trust,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/07/1003106223-FL_SAR_HFWATSO2-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s where Watson comes in to create a \u201ccollective intelligence model between machine and man.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not advocating that Watson replace physicians,\u201d he explained.\nIn late September, Watson achieved another training milestone: It began its first fellowship in a specialty \u2014 leukemia \u2014 at MD Anderson.\nBy Ariana Eunjung ChaCandida Vitale and the other fellows at MD Anderson\u2019s leukemia treatment center had known each other for only a few months, but they already were very tight.\nIBM is now training Watson to be a cancer specialist.\nAmong the most ambitious projects is a partnership with 14 cancer centers to use Watson to help choose therapies based on a tumor\u2019s genetic fingerprints."}
