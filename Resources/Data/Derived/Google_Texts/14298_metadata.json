The contractors running the troubled federal healthcare.gov website have been under intense scrutiny in the past month, but those businesses aren\u2019t the only ones being paid to roll out Obamacare.\n\nIn the states that are running their own health care exchanges, call center practices vary. Oregon, for instance, set up its own; other states, like Connecticut, farm that business out to companies like Maximus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity and it remains so,\u201d says Rick Howard, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. \u201cThe bottom line is there are millions of millions of folks coming in for insurance coverage. That represents great opportunity for both commercial carriers and for those contractors who are servicing health care.\u201d\n\nHow much is Maximus making in Connecticut? In a press release, the company valued the contract at $15 million over three years, for staffing and operating the call center. But that lump sum is all the information the company provides.\n\nAccess Health CT, the state\u2019s exchange, wouldn\u2019t confirm the $15 million price tag. And while it will say that it is paying a per minute fee per call, it won\u2019t say how that fee is calculated. In fact, its contract with Maximus that it makes available to the public blacks out all language that has to do with pricing.\n\nThat means that taxpayers can\u2019t know how much the state of Connecticut is paying Maximus.\n\nThe question is: Why?\n\n\u201cWell, redactions are things that typically relate to privacy and competitive issues from vendors,\u201d says Kevin Counihan, CEO of Access Health CT, the state\u2019s new insurance marketplace. Counihan says state law allows vendors like Maximus to redact what they think is proprietary information from public documents.\n\nBut should pricing be proprietary in a government contract?\n\n\u201cIs price something that someone should be able to redact? I sure think so. What\u2019s the whole point? If everybody knows what everybody is pricing, everybody\u2019s going to be pricing at the same level. And that doesn\u2019t drive a good deal,\u201d Counihan says.\n\nMaximus refused to comment on its Connecticut pricing. In a statement, the company says call centers are in a \u201chighly competitive industry.\u201d\n\nIn emails to the state, the company justifies its position by saying that releasing its pricing information would \u201cresult in irreparable economic damage to Maximus and significantly weaken its competitive position in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nMaximus also has a contract in Hawaii. But in that state it doesn\u2019t have to disclose its contracts at all because the health insurance marketplace, the Hawaii Health Connector, is exempt from the state\u2019s sunshine laws.\n\nVermont\u2019s exchange handled things differently. It has posted on the Internet a complete, unredacted copy of its contract with Maximus. The document spells out everything from how long a call can be on hold to how quickly it must be answered.\n\nMark Larson, the head of Vermont\u2019s exchange, explains: \u201cWe are spending taxpayer dollars and we understand our responsibility to ensure that there\u2019s transparency in how those dollars are being spent, to whom they\u2019re being given, and what we get in return for them. And we want to make sure that it\u2019s easy for Vermonters or others to find that information.\u201d\n\nAccording to the contract, Vermont pays Maximus 86 cents a minute for calls, and the state estimates a call volume of about 573,300 minutes per month. That comes out to about $500,000 a month.\n\nRick Howard, the Gartner analyst, says that, in an ideal world, none of the call center prices would matter. Everyone would sign up on the Internet.\n\n\u201cThis is just a really complicated, initially, enrollment cycle,\u201d Howard says. \u201cOnce the websites continue to evolve, then I would expect, over time, call center activities to be greatly reduced from what they were here in the first months or year of the marketplace.\u201d\n\nUntil that happens, there\u2019s money to be made. But in Connecticut, the public just can\u2019t know how much.\n\nThis piece is part of a collaboration that includes NPR, WNPR, and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before the Affordable Care Act was even open for enrollment, Viviana Alvarado was already taking calls from people who wanted to know more.
