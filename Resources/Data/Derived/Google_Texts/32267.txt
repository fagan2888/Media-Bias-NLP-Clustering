An investigation by special agents with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has resulted in a Lobelville teenager being indicted on a murder charge.

At the request of 21st District Attorney General Kim Helper, TBI special agents began investigating the fatal shooting of Sgt. 1st Class Michael Braden at the Perry County National Guard Armory on July 9, 2014. During the course of the investigation, agents developed information that led to the arrest of Christopher Clark Farrar, who was 15 at the time. Investigators determined Farrar gained access to the Armory and fired several shots, one of which hit Sgt. Braden, 45, who later died at Perry County Medical Center. Farrar was taken into custody that night and was later charged with one count of Criminal Homicide.

At a June 12 transfer hearing, a Perry County Judge ordered Farrar, 16, to be transferred to adult court. On Monday, the Perry County Grand Jury indicted Farrar on one count of first-degree murder.

On Tuesday, Farrar was served with the indictment at the Williamson County Juvenile Center where he has been housed. He is being transferred to the Perry County Jail.
