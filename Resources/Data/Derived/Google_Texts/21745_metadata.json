Is it the third driving while intoxicated conviction? Fifth?\n\nHow about 16 convictions?\n\nThe case of Denny Lovern, convicted at least 16 times on alcohol-related driving offenses over 31 years, has highlighted Colorado\u2019s unacceptably weak drunk driving laws.\n\nLast month, a grand jury indicted Lovern after the Saab he was driving plowed into a vehicle driven by a woman in Englewood. After briefly checking the damage to the woman\u2019s car, he drove off.\n\nLater, according to the indictment, he told police: \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot to drink. I should not have been driving.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time.\n\nThe indictment said Lovern was first charged with DUI in 1983, a charge that was reduced to driving while ability impaired. He also was ordered by the court to undergo alcohol education, something that was to be repeated many times over the years.\n\nOne of the maddening things about DUI law in Colorado is that no matter how many DUIs a person racks up, it\u2019s still a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail.\n\nThe way Lovern got to felony charges this time is that Arapahoe District Attorney George Brauchler is arguing that Lovern was so reckless in driving drunk that he committed attempted manslaughter and attempted assault, both felonies. This is an aggressive approach by the prosecutor, to say the least, and it shouldn\u2019t be necessary.\n\nIf Colorado had a law that made drunk driving a felony at some point \u2014 whether it\u2019s the third in five years or the fourth in a lifetime \u2014 then those people who obviously don\u2019t care about the lives they are putting in peril could be put in prison upon conviction.\n\nDon\u2019t believe for a minute that these folks haven\u2019t had access to treatment. In fact they have.\n\nSure, we can debate what treatment is most effective or how to make it more affordable, but there is no reason that treatment and punishment should be mutually exclusive.\n\nSo if lawmakers are concerned about the efficacy of treatment, by all means, they can address it. But let\u2019s not turn away from the reality that there is a hard core of drunk drivers who just don\u2019t care about who gets hurt.\n\n\u201cThis guy is not a stand-alone in terms of DUIs,\u201d Brauchler told us. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at how many people are out there with multiple DUIs.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers last year failed to pass a felony DUI bill despite it having bipartisan support. The concerns centered on cost of incarceration and a preferred focus on treatment.\n\nThis year\u2019s effort, which is reportedly coming, deserves a better fate. Colorado must have a felony DUI law, as most states do, so dangerous drunks can spend time in prison getting sober.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Why is the 16th DUI not a felony in Colorado?", "title": "Why is the 16th DUI not a felony in Colorado?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/05/why-is-the-16th-dui-not-a-felony-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__DUI-coloradop1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__DUI-coloradop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T16:18:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:49:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab50\"", "article_summary": "Colorado must have a felony DUI law, as most states do, so dangerous drunks can spend time in prison getting sober.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at how many people are out there with multiple DUIs.\u201dState lawmakers last year failed to pass a felony DUI bill despite it having bipartisan support.\nOne of the maddening things about DUI law in Colorado is that no matter how many DUIs a person racks up, it\u2019s still a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail.\nThe case of Denny Lovern, convicted at least 16 times on alcohol-related driving offenses over 31 years, has highlighted Colorado\u2019s unacceptably weak drunk driving laws.\nThe indictment said Lovern was first charged with DUI in 1983, a charge that was reduced to driving while ability impaired."}
