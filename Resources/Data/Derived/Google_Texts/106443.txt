INCHEON, South Korea (AP) — North Korea’s athletes at the Asian Games, reportedly feeling homesick while competing in South Korea, have held a special “longing for the leader” gathering to express how much they miss their homeland.

The gathering Saturday featured songs and poems praising leader Kim Jong Un, according to the North’s Korean Central News Agency.

The report said that at the gathering, called an “Evening longing for respected Marshal Kim Jong Un Kim,” Sports Minister Kim Yong Hun said that while they have only been away from the leader for about a week, “the minds of all members of the delegation and players are running to him, whom they long to see, awake or asleep.”
