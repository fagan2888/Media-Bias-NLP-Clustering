Are you ready for the rest of the story?\n\nDoctors told Jahi\u2019s mom, Nailah Winkfield, that her child\u2019s organs would \u201cshut down\u201d and her brain would \u201cliquefy\u201d if kept on life support. Hostile hospital administrators in Oakland moved to pull the plug on Jahi. Medical officials callously referred to her as \u201cdead, dead, dead\u201d and dismissed the child as a \u201cbody.\u201d Smug critics mocked and hounded the family to give up and let go. Jahi\u2019s life, they concluded, was worthless.\n\nBut the experts and naysayers were wrong.\n\nAs Winkfield recently described in an open letter to supporters, \u201c\u200bJahi is physically stable. All of her organs are fully functional (and) her skin is flawless.\u201d After inspecting her latest medical records, two respected neurologists testified in sworn declarations that she is not brain dead. Video released by her family shows her moving her arm and foot on command. A recent MRI showed severe brain damage, \u201cbut it also shows brain structure and blood flow,\u201d\u200b Winkfield noted.\n\n\u201cI was told previously that it would be liquefied or have holes in it because it had been without blood flow and oxygen for nine months,\u201d she recounted. \u201cThat is not the case with my daughter. Every person is different, and every person heals differently.\u201d\n\nOne year after callous and overconfident members of the medical and media establishments wrote off Jahi\u2019s life, the now 14-year-old girl is surrounded by the love and care of her mom, dedicated medical professionals and vigilant advocates for life.\n\nLawyer Christopher Dolan continues to battle the State of California to reverse the \u201cbrain death\u201d designation in court. Volunteers maintain a Facebook page to share updates on Jahi\u2019s progress. And with the help of the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network, Life Legal Defense, Angela Clemente & Associates, the Wrongful Death & Injury Institute, New Beginnings and others who helped transfer her away from death-wish docs in California, Jahi marked Christmas this year at a long-term care facility in New Jersey.\n\nBobby Schindler, head of Terri\u2019s Network, told me last week that Jahi\u2019s family \u201chas been blessed with countless numbers of well-wishers, letting the family know they are constantly praying for Jahi.\u201d The detractors and haters are still out there. But as Schindler observes, \u201cUnfortunately, this is nothing new \u2014 my family experienced the same with (sister) Terri. In fact, it\u2019s been almost 10 years since Terri\u2019s death, and we continue to receive similar types of mean-spirited comments.\u201d\n\nThankfully for society\u2019s most vulnerable members who are medically dependent, disabled, incapacitated or potentially facing life-threatening situations, Bobby Schindler and Nailah Winkfield are keeping the faith. \u201c\u200bJahi\u2019s life is worth the fight,\u201d her mom insists. And that noble fight deserves far more support from those who\u2019ve been sloganeering recently about how Lives Matter.\n\n\u201cThe Bible tells us of Mary\u2019s great joy at Christ\u2019s conception and birth,\u201d Schindler reflects. \u201cIt also tells us of her great sadness at his unnatural suffering and death. This Christmas let us pray that God\u2019s will be done in 2015 for all his children \u2014 those in the womb and those judged not worthy of end of life care and protection.\u201d\n\nIn an age where suicide advocate Brittany Maynard earned widespread praise and admiration for giving up on life, Terri and Jahi\u2019s families stand as powerful seasonal reminders about my true heroes: those who fight tirelessly for the sanctity of life, no matter how hard the journey.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Malkin is author of Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks & Cronies.
