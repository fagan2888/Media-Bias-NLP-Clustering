They waited for six hours, in and out of interviews, for the committee to deliberate.\n\nWhen the Newton native found out about her selection, she \u201csat there in disbelief, and then just started texting everyone.\u201d\n\nRhodes Scholarships fund two to four years of study at the University of Oxford in England and are awarded to students who demonstrate outstanding intellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service, according to the Rhodes Trust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMIT senior Anisha Gururaj, 21, of Chesterfield, Mo., works on developing medical devices. She and three other students designed a low-cost blood warmer that can be used in the military to prevent soldiers from dying of hypothermia.\n\nShe said she is particularly interested in devices that are user-friendly and often implemented in low-income and low-resource areas.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that come from low-resource contexts are just incredible, but there are also incredible social challenges,\u201d Gururaj said in a phone interview Sunday.\n\nGururaj said she is eager to work in a Oxford\u2019s collaborative setting to learn about other factors in global health, like public policy, economics, and cultural differences.\n\nThe scholars\u2019 areas of study are numerous and varied.\n\nBenjamin Sprung-Keyser, 21, a senior economics major at Harvard, said his academic focuses were forming in his later high school and early college years, as the Great Recession was being felt across the country.\n\nSprung-Keyser, of Los Angeles, said he is interested in labor economics, specifically regarding unemployment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to look around and see the problems around you \u2014 how they affect you, your family, and people you\u2019ve never met,\u201d he said.\n\nRhodes Scholars are selected after two phases. The students apply and are first endorsed by their colleges and universities, then interviewed by selection committees. This year, schools endorsed 877 American students.\n\nIn a January notice, Rhodes Trust officials said many students were receiving too much outside help on their essays, and mandated that applicants for the 2015 Rhodes Scholarship be fully responsible for their own essays.\n\nWhile this posed a challenge, Nussenbaum, who is majoring in cognitive neuroscience with a second concentration in science and society, said it was also a relief.\n\n\u201cI was getting so much advice from everyone on everything else,\u201d she said.\n\nThe American scholars will join an international group of students chosen from 14 other global jurisdictions, according to the Rhodes Trust.\n\nIncluding this year\u2019s recipients, 3,356 Americans from 316 colleges and universities have won Rhodes Scholarships.\n\nOther New England scholars include Harvard senior Ruth C. Fong of Somerset, N.J.; MIT senior Elliot H. Akama-Garren of Palo Alto, Calif.; Yale seniors Matthew J. Townsend of Chappaqua, N.Y., Jordan R. Konell of Philadelphia, and Jane Darby Menton of Tallahassee, Fla.; Yale graduate Gabriel M. Zucker of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Brown senior Abishek K. Kulshreshtha of Grapevine, Texas; Brown graduate David R.K. Adler of Encino, Calif.; and Dartmouth senior Ridwan Y. Hassen of Marietta, Ga.\n\nFong, a 21-year-old computer science major, said she is interested in how neurobiological studies can be applied to help machines learn like humans do.\n\nSpeaking by telephone from her family\u2019s New Jersey home, Fong said she never would have applied for the scholarship if not for her mother talking about how much she liked George Stephanopoulos, who was a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nRecipients credited support from teachers, family, friends, and faith communities in their success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cliche, but this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen without a lot of luck and a lot of help,\u201d Sprung-Keyser said.\n\nAngrist was in London\u2019s Heathrow Airport on Sunday afternoon, waiting for his next flight. The 23-year-old MIT graduate grew up in Brookline, and did economic research for the World Bank, the White House, and on the Affordable Care Act while at MIT.\n\nAs a Fulbright Scholar in Botswana, Angrist leverages his economics and mathematics degrees to fight global poverty by providing education on factors like HIV.\n\nThe Rhodes Scholarship, he said, is a stamp of confidence, through which students are given \u201can opportunity at such a young age to have so much invested in you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.450239765", "eomportal-id": 605376, "description": "Of the 32 American students named 2015 Rhodes Scholars, at least 13 have New England ties, including two from Harvard University, three from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, four from Yale University, two from Brown University, and one from Dartmouth College.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Of the 32 American students named 2015 Rhodes Scholars, at least 13 have New England ties, including two from Harvard University, three from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, four from Yale University, two from Brown University, and one from Dartmouth College.", "title": "13 New England students named Rhodes Scholars - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2014/11/23/new-england-students-named-rhodes-scholars/XpB4r1zN0tiYU5mayjzBwI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Rhodes,Scholar,award,new England,harvard,Yale,Brown,Dartmouth,MIT, Cecil Rhodes", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 01:49:43 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Rhodes,Scholar,award,new England,harvard,Yale,Brown,Dartmouth,MIT, Cecil Rhodes, George  Stephanopoulos,Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown University, Yale University, Dartmouth College, Heathrow Airport (London), World Bank", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "e77b0fe2-7333-11e4-b8d1-be58117b3d54"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a0f\"", "article_summary": "Angrist is one of at least 13 Rhodes Scholars of 2015 who have New England ties, the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.\nRhodes Scholars are selected after two phases.\nBrown University senior Kate Nussenbaum, 21, sat with other applicants in a Philadelphia interview room.\nThirty-two Rhodes Scholars selected from the United States this year include two from Harvard University, three from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, four from Yale University, three from Brown University, and one from Dartmouth College.\nThe American scholars will join an international group of students chosen from 14 other global jurisdictions, according to the Rhodes Trust."}
