He is concerned about the danger of Obamacare, excessive regulatory burdens and an intrusive federal government that unfairly affects Texas families and business owners. When Brandon Creighton decided to not seek re-election, I knew that it was time to stop watching from the sidelines and that I must step up and bring my proven real-world experience in building businesses, creating jobs, defending our freedoms and fighting for less government to the Texas House of Representatives on behalf of my friends and neighbors\n\nExperience: Duane Ham is a successful entrepreneur and businessman. He is qualified to take his brand of conservative leadership to Austin, with the back-to-basics thinking and the concerns of the voters of Montgomery County. Family values, sound business values and experience will drive his leadership.\n\nCommunity Service: Duane has been an active and trusted community leader always willing to step up and lend a hand whether to a neighbor in need or supporting our schools and vocational agriculture programs. He is a member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a Life member of the Montgomery County Fair Association and a member of the Montgomery Performing Arts Society.\n\nFamily: Duane Ham and his wife Jena have three children. His children all attended public schools. Duane grew up in Killeen, where his mother and father instilled the values of family, hard work and education. Duane\u2019s father was superintendent of the Killeen Independent School District. A turning point in Duane\u2019s life was when he attended high school at the South Texas Children\u2019s Home Ministry (STCHM) where his life was changed and a future leader was born.
