The third member, Judge Judith Rogers, was appointed by President Clinton in 1994.\n\nPillard and Wilkins were appointed over Republican objections last year after Senate Democrats used the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to repeal filibuster rules that allowed the GOP minority to block judicial nominations.\n\nAt a Democracy Alliance meeting in Chicago last spring, a progressive activist group called the American Constitution Society took credit for helping secure filibuster reform in the Senate.\n\nIn a private presentation to the donor network, the ACS said it had met its \u201cperformance goals,\u201d including \u201cadvanc[ing] filibuster reform\u201d by \u201chighlighting [the] issue in national media\u201d and \u201csuccessfully leveraging attention to create outcry for confirmation of long-stalled D.C. circuit nominees,\u201d according to documents obtained by the Free Beacon.\n\nIt also noted that three of the judges confirmed to the D.C. circuit court were ACS members.\n\nThe ACS is one of dozens of left-leaning activist groups affiliated with the Democracy Alliance, which connects top Democratic donors to liberal organizations. The Alliance does not publicly disclose its members or the recipients of their donations.\n\nThe D.C. circuit court came under fire in September, after it announced it would rehear en banc a challenge to an Obamacare provision that would issue taxpayer-funded subsidies for individuals in states that had set up health care exchanges.\n\nA D.C. circuit panel of judges had already ruled against the Obama administration on the Halbig v. Burwell case, contradicting another ruling by the 4th circuit court of appeals that backed the administration. The split between the circuits made it likely the issue would be taken up by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the D.C. circuit\u2019s decision to hold a new hearing before the entire court\u2014which now has a majority of Democrat-appointed judges after filibuster reform\u2014was seen by many conservatives as a way to prevent the Obamacare challenge from reaching the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d no longer have a circuit split, and therefore you\u2019d have a less of a chance the Supreme Court will review,\u201d Cause of Action executive director Daniel Epstein told the Free Beacon in August.\n\nDespite the D.C. circuit\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court announced earlier this month that it would hear the Obamacare challenge anyway. The news prompted the D.C. circuit to postpone its rehearing until the Supreme Court issues a ruling.\n\nReligious groups opposed to the D.C. circuit\u2019s ruling on the contraception challenge last Friday said they would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court as well.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "An appeals court packed with progressive judges ruled last Friday in favor of a contraception opt-out clause opposed by some religious groups, handing a victory to the Obama administration.
