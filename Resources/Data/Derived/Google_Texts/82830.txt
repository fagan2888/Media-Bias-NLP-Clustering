A health advisory because of wildfire smoke has been issued for the northern half of Colorado.

“It’s risen to the point that public health is a concern and we want people to take action to protect themselves,” said Christopher Dann, spokesman for the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division.

The advisory went into effect at 8 a.m. and will extend at least until 9 a.m. Saturday, Dann said.

He recommended that vulnerable residents such as the young, elderly, and those with heart or respiratory conditions stay indoors if possible.

Dann also said that if people can avoid exercising outdoors they should do so.

Denver skies will be hazy through the weekend as air carrying smoke from wildfires in the Northwest settle over Colorado, forecasters say.

“We’re going to be dealing with this through the weekend,” said Todd Dankers, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.

A shift in air currents brought thick smoky air loaded with particulates from wildfires burning in eastern Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, Dankers said.

The milky sky likely won’t clear until Tuesday or Wednesday when monsoonal air from Arizona and California push back into the state, he said.

People who remain outdoors for a lengthy period of time can expect to get a scratchy, tingly sensation in the back of their throat from the smoky air, he said.
