The general rule of thumb from healthcare providers appears to be the earlier, the better.\n\nThe general manner in which a billing office operates determines revenue results.\n\nProactive management may be more efficient than a reactive approach to billing management.\n\nThe reduction of reimbursement as the healthcare industry moves into a value-based payment realm means often going back to the drawing board to reconsider new financial priorities.\n\nAnd making sure patients are clear about how much is owed and when is imperative. A little confusion may go a long way.\n\nEnsuring accurate and timely payment demands the execution of several strategies.\n\nHere are a few to consider:\n\nIncrease up-front cash collection\n\nThe elimination of bad debt is directly tied to point-of-service.\n\nNinety percent of physician practices consider collecting from a patient before he or she walks away as critical to revenue cycle success, according to a study from Availity.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for us is to move conversations (with prospective patients) as far up in the process as possible,\u201d Andy Scianimanico, Vice President for Revenue Cycle at Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, told Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about strong-arming patients to pay. It\u2019s about getting information into the hands of patients so they can make better-informed decisions.\u201d\n\nKeeping healthcare consumers financially engaged is especially important as high deductibles grow higher and out-of-pocket costs increase.\n\nOut-of-pocket copayments, coinsurance costs, and deductible expenses approach $345 billion, estimated PwC\u2019s Health Research Institute.\n\nAim for coding compliance and accuracy\n\nA standard billing office operates reactively, instead of proactively, said Monte Sandler, Executive Vice President of NextGen RCM Services, to RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\nThis has to change, he asserted.\n\n\u201cProviders are providing care, documenting their services, and coding. A billing office is getting charges entered and bills out the door. Then, they basically wait until they get responses from clearinghouses or payers in the form of rejections and denials. Then, they react to those.\u201d\n\nThis inefficient process delays the payment cycle and makes receiving payment more difficult, he stated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of flipping that whole cycle upside down to build a much more proactive revenue cycle,\u201d he explained. \u201cEvery practice should know if a patient is eligible before the doctor sees the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty of tools allow you to check eligibility two or three days prior to a patient even coming in. It\u2019s solvable if the right checks and balances are in place.\u201d\n\nConnect the supply chain dots\n\nEnsure accurate reimbursement by keeping track of high-cost items as they migrate through the healthcare supply chain.\n\n\"This is an exciting time for healthcare supply chain management,\u201d stated Tony Vahedian, Cardinal Health\u2019s General Manager of Medical Services and Solutions, within a press release.\n\n\"We're seeing executives take action to improve and demand more value from their supply chain,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThey recognize that maintaining status quo in their systems is no longer sufficient due to the ever-increasing cost pressures in the industry.\"\n\n\u201cWith reimbursement being reduced and going to fee-for-value, supply chain is becoming more of an important arena for the C-suite because there's so much cost in the supply chain,\u201d Vahedian told RevCycleIntelligence.com.\n\nSupply chain management is becoming a much greater strategic asset for healthcare providers, he said.\n\n\u201cWhether it's to take cost out, whether it's improved quality of care, whether it's to support the expansion of many of these large IDMs, whether it's standardized products or workflows, supply chain is becoming more relevant.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will continue to become more relevant as the entire healthcare system goes through the reimbursement changes and then the pressure on the cost side.\u201d\n\nPromote public pricing transparency\n\nClearly informing patients about out-of-pocket costs before services are received ensures more accurate and timely payments, according to research from TransUnion Healthcare.\n\nThree-quarters of over 700 surveyed patients confirmed they can more easily pay their bill with a front-end estimate.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, it is critical that providers capture all reimbursements owed to them, given the impending changes to reimbursement structures under the Affordable Care Act and the introduction of healthcare exchanges,\u201d explained John Woody, Transunion\u2019s Vice President of Product Development.\n\n\u201cThe fact that patients are not always well-positioned to understand the trade-offs and costs of every medical decisions is precisely why it is so important for the clinicians who decide what goes on the bill to know how they are impacting the patient\u2019s wallet,\u201d stated Neel Shah, MD, Executive Director of Costs of Care.\n\n\u201cAfter all, if you bankrupt your patient \u2014 particularly with tests that are not needed \u2014 you are not helping them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The life cycle of a medical claim involves many non-linear steps.
