(AP) - Indians outfielder Michael Brantley will not be in the lineup on opening day despite making major progress following offseason shoulder surgery.\n\nBrantley had targeted the April 4 opener against Boston as his return date. However, manager Terry Francona said Sunday that Cleveland\u2019s best all-around player is not quite ready and will not be in left field on opening day.\n\n\u201cWe will let this thing calm down a little bit, then ramp him back up,\u201d Francona said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to start the season with us as our starting left fielder. He will certainly travel with us. So if that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s give him a chance to be healthy for the whole year.\u201d\n\nBrantley, who underwent surgery in November, reported some soreness in his right shoulder after playing in only two exhibition games. He will continue to rest without baseball activities for the time being.\n\nThere was no timetable for when Brantley will be able to start.\n\nThe Indians also released outfielder Will Venable and reliever Joe Thatcher.\n\nThe 28-year-old Brantley had been expected to be out six months following surgery but he made a quicker-than-expected recovery, and he and the Indians were hopeful he might be ready for the start of the season.\n\nFrancona said outfielders Marlon Byrd, Collin Cowgill and Robbie Grossman have been told they are still in the running for a roster spot.\n\n\u201cWe know there is anxiety but we just can\u2019t tell them until we know,\u201d Francona said. \u201cByrd told us he was ready to play when he signed, and he was.\u201d\n\nByrd signed a minor league contract on March 17. He\u2019s hitting .467 with five doubles in 15 at-bats in five games.\n\nRajai Davis signed a major league contract in December. Indians rookie Tyler Naquin was told on Friday that he made the opening-day roster.\n\nThe Indians plan to carry five outfielders.\n\nVenable signed a minor league contract with the Indians on Feb. 26, right after Major League Baseball suspended outfielder Abraham Almonte for 80 games after he tested positive for a banned substance.\n\nVenable hit .133 this spring in 13 games.\n\n\u201cWe try to gauge where guys are by history, resume and health,\u201d Francona said. \u201cWe just told him there are guys ahead of him. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t think he can play. He called his agent and would like to explore some things.\u201d\n\nThatcher signed a minor league contract in December. The 34-year-old lefty pitched seven games this spring, giving up one earned run in 6 2/3 innings.\n\n\u201cJoe did exactly what he was supposed to do. We don\u2019t have the ability to carry a situational lefty,\u201d Francona said.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Ross Detwiler, who was signed to a minor league contract in December, was told he made the team.\n\n\u201cFor now he will be in the bullpen,\u201d Francona said. \u201cHe committed early. It seems like every outing he\u2019s gotten better. I told him that he would be a starter sometime in the future.\u201d\n\nDetwiler has appeared in seven games this spring, allowing three earned runs in seven innings. Danny Otero and Kyle Crockett were told they are still in the mix for bullpen jobs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indians outfielder Michael Brantley will not be in the lineup on opening day despite making major progress following offseason shoulder surgery.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Indians outfielder Michael Brantley will not be in the lineup on opening day despite making major progress following offseason shoulder surgery.", "title": "Indians OF Brantley won\u2019t be ready to start on opening day", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/brantley-sits-opening-day-venable-thatcher-release/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/indians-brantley_baseball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/27/indians-brantley_baseball.jpeg", "description": "Indians outfielder Michael Brantley will not be in the lineup on opening day despite making major progress following offseason shoulder surgery.", "card": "summary", "title": "Indians OF Brantley won\u2019t be ready to start on opening day"}, "Author": "GARY SCHATZ", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cByrd told us he was ready to play when he signed, and he was.\u201dByrd signed a minor league contract on March 17.\nHe called his agent and would like to explore some things.\u201dThatcher signed a minor league contract in December.\nGOODYEAR, Ariz.
