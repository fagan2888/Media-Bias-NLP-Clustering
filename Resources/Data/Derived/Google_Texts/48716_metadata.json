Yet Walsh claims to be able to read between the lines. Referencing a now infamous interview Republican strategist Lee Atwater gave in 1981, in which he claimed that language like \u201ccutting taxes\u201d and \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d are \u201cabstract\u201d terms for the word n****r, Walsh cross-applies Atwater\u2019s decades old quote to the current political climate.\n\n\u201cAnd then you say \u201cDefund Obamacare,\u201d and everyone knows why,\u201d she states.\n\nOther racist dog whistles according to Walsh: \u201cfood stamp President\u201d and dependency on government.\n\nThe journalist goes on to admit that most Republicans probably aren\u2019t racists in the traditional sense, they are just \u2018pandering\u2019 to those who are, like \u201cTed Cruz and the House suicide caucus,\u201d for political and electoral gain.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for Republicans to do the right thing and repudiate their party\u2019s lunatic fringe, particularly its racist fringe,\u201d she writes. \u201cI assume I\u2019ll be waiting a while longer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Leave it to Salon Editor and MSNBC analyst Joan Walsh to turn the government shutdown over funding for Obamacare into a racial issue.", "title": "MSNBC analyst claims \"Defund Obamacare\" is code for N-word - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 486, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/10/Joan-Walsh-486x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/01/msnbc-analyst-claims-defund-obamacare-is-code-for-n-word/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "shutdown", "published_time": "2013-10-01T16:25:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-02T10:02:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbccd\"", "article_summary": "In her piece, which claims to tell \u201cthe real story of the shutdown,\u201d Walsh claims that the GOP is purposefully trying to \u201cdestroy the first black president,\u201d and the phrase \u201cdefund Obamcare\u201d is really code for the N-word.\nLeave it to Salon Editor and MSNBC analyst Joan Walsh to turn the government shutdown over funding for Obamacare into a racial issue.\nYet Walsh claims to be able to read between the lines.\nTuesday afternoon Walsh penned an eye-popping column for Slate that claims the GOP\u2019s plan to defund Obamcare stems from members of the party\u2019s inherent racism.\n\u201cAnd then you say \u201cDefund Obamacare,\u201d and everyone knows why,\u201d she states."}
