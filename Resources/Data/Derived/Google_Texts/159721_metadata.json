H&R Block has launched Billion Back Records, a new \u201clabel\u201d that will feature music videos from ten different YouTube creators.\n\nThe ten participating YouTube channels represent an eclectic group ranging from rockers to vloggers. The honey-voiced Clara Chung leads things off, with Pomplamoose, Dia Frampton, Julia Sheer, iJustine, Joey Graceffa, Jason Chen, Jimmy Wong, Meghan Camarena, and Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers right behind her. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be working with H&R Block on a video celebrating how good it feels to get money back,\u201d said Chung, \u201cshowing how taxes can actually be fun!\u201d\n\nThe individual videos are housed on each creator\u2019s individual channel, though they are funded by H&R Block and aggregated together on the Billion Back Records homepage, which is also offering prizes to anyone who tweets about \u201cwhat makes you a rock star.\u201d Prizes include a gold-plated iPad and a guitar with a money design on its head.\n\nTaxes, unfortunately for H&R Block, will never be super cool, but H&R Block\u2019s campaign may at least make them tolerable for some. The company\u2019s plan to turn its dull, red tape-filled process into something Millennials can get worked up about is reminiscent of the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to use YouTube to excite young people about the Affordable Care Act. When compared to that campaign, Billion Back Records\u2019s branding seems much more retrained. New music videos for it will be released over the next couple weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "H&R Block has launched Billion Back Records, which uses music videos from ten YouTube creators to get young people excited about taxes.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Tubefilter", "description": "H&R Block has launched Billion Back Records, which uses music videos from ten YouTube creators to get young people excited about taxes.", "title": "H&R Block Uses YouTube Stars To Get Young People Excited About Taxes", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/billion-back-records-hr-block.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://www.tubefilter.com/2014/03/11/hr-block-billion-back-records-music-videos/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "H&R Block has launched Billion Back Records, which uses music videos from ten YouTube creators to get young people excited about taxes.", "title": "H&R Block Uses YouTube Stars To Get Young People Excited About Taxes", "image": "http://www.tubefilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/billion-back-records-hr-block.jpg", "creator": "@tubefilter", "site": "@tubefilter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Tubefilter", "section": "Articles", "tag": "Taxes", "published_time": "2014-03-11T06:49:25-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "billion back records, branded, clara chung, h&r block, homepage feature, music video, taxes, online video, youtube, web series, social media, influencer"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe596b\"", "article_summary": "Taxes, unfortunately for H&R Block, will never be super cool, but H&R Block\u2019s campaign may at least make them tolerable for some.\nH&R Block has launched Billion Back Records, a new \u201clabel\u201d that will feature music videos from ten different YouTube creators.\nNew music videos for it will be released over the next couple weeks.\nIt\u2019s tax season, and the US\u2019 largest tax prep company is using a YouTube-based strategy to get young people jazzed up about the prospect of filing their returns.\nThe ten participating YouTube channels represent an eclectic group ranging from rockers to vloggers."}
