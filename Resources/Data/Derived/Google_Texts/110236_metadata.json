John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion.\n\nAs of June 30, only 188,223 Ohioans had selected and paid for a health insurance plan through HealthCare.gov. Enrollment in Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion was 609,373 in June.\n\nObamacare expansion put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid \u2014 a welfare program meant for children, impoverished families, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nIf Kasich had opted out of Medicaid expansion, taxpayers would be stuck with the tab for fewer than 200,000 subsidized Obamacare insurance policies. Instead, Ohio\u2019s total Obamacare enrollment is nearly 800,000.\n\nIn June, Medicaid expansion accounted for 76.4 percent of Ohio\u2019s Obamacare enrollment and plans purchased through the federal HealthCare.gov exchange accounted for just 23.6 percent.\n\nOhio\u2019s Obamacare enrollment has grown increasingly tilted over time. In February, 68 percent of Ohio Obamacare enrollees were on Medicaid.\n\nRELATED: Ohio\u2019s dependence on Medicaid is the worst in the Midwest\n\nCampaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, Kasich says he would repeal Obamacare. But he claims Medicaid expansion is separate from the rest of the law, and his vague health policy plans would keep most of Obamacare in place.\n\nIn its first 18 months, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion enrolled 243,373 more people than projected and ran $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nMatt Mayer, president of free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio, was among the critics who said Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion would cost more than expected and would be nearly impossible to roll back.\n\n\u201cDoes John Kasich expect anyone to believe given his constant religious lecturing that he will toss 800,000 Ohioans to the curb? Kasichcare will be Obamacare lite,\u201d Mayer said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\nKasich insists Ohio would undo Medicaid expansion if Congress cut federal funding below the 90 percent promised in Obamacare, but he often suggests the Bible calls for a bigger welfare state. He has credited Obamacare expansion with saving lives.\n\nMayer told Ohio Watchdog increasing federal welfare spending is a bad idea, whether through the Obamacare exchange or Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cEither way, Obamacare is nearing 1,000,000 enrollees in Ohio with an enormous debt load being put on our kids and grandkids to pay for it,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cNothing about that is conservative no matter how you define it.\u201d\n\nOhio Watchdog contacted the governor\u2019s office with questions about the latest Obamacare enrollment figures. Kasich\u2019s press secretary did not respond.\n\nKasich\u2019s presidential campaign touts Medicaid expansion enrollment as proof of his compassionate conservatism \u2014 a strategy that will backfire if primary voters realize Medicaid expansion is a central pillar of Obamacare.\n\nAn August poll commissioned by free-market nonprofit FGA Action found that between 74 and 82 percent of Republican likely voters in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and Florida oppose Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe poll\u2019s results were bad news for Kasich, whose prospects have been buoyed by $5 million in uncontested super PAC advertising: 64 percent of Republican voters in South Carolina are less likely to vote for a candidate who implemented Obamacare expansion. Those numbers were 61 percent in Iowa, 59 percent in Florida and 56 percent in New Hampshire.\n\nIn all four of the early primary states, an even greater number of respondents said they were less likely to vote for a Republican who promoted Obamacare expansion in other states.\n\nAfter unilaterally expanding Medicaid over Ohio lawmakers\u2019 opposition in 2013, Kasich toured the country imploring lawmakers in other states to embrace Obamacare expansion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For every Ohioan who has paid an Obamacare exchange premium, three have been added to Medicaid under Gov.
