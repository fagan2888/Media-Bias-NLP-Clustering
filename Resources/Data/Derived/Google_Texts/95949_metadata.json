Virginia\u2019s tourism board appeals to romantic inclinations in all human beings and claim the state is for lovers. However, over the past couple of years it is becoming abundantly clear that the state is rampant with haters; especially in the Republican Party. Whether it is the outgoing governor\u2019s hatred of disclosure laws, or the soon-to-be former attorney general\u2019s hatred of gays and women, Virginia\u2019s Republican leaders belie the state\u2019s slogan and it starts with the leadership of the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV). It is no secret that Virginia Republicans hate Americans for twice electing an African American man as President, but their hatred for the democratic process pales in comparison to their hatred for the President.\n\nLast year, a Virginia county Republican Committee issued a warning that if President Obama won re-election in November there would be an armed rebellion that revealed their hatred of voters and the electoral process. The letter from the Republican county party chairman calling for armed rebellion is replete with a Christian bible verse on its logo that reads, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one\u201d (Luke 22:36), and it said Republicans need candidates who were \u201cintelligent and courageous and cut from the same cloth as (revolutionary hero) Patrick Henry and our attorney general and soon to be governor Ken Cuccinelli.\u201d Fortunately for Virginians, the \u201csoon to be governor Ken Cuccinelli\u201d lost his bid to be governor, and when about 450 members of the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) met to lick their collective wounds at a former Confederate War hospital, the party chairman took the warning of \u201carmed rebellion\u201d a step farther.\n\nThe annual Virginia Republican retreat, \u201cAdvance,\u201d was supposed to be a time for introspection to assess why Democrats swept three statewide elections and won the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general\u2019s offices, but instead the state party chairman accused the media for the losses. He also took aim at governor-elect Terry McCauliffe and President Obama and said, \u201cObama\u2019s so close to death that Terry McAuliffe is about to buy a life insurance on him, I\u2019m looking forward to taking the gloves off!\u201d The head Republican in Virginia, RPV Chairman Pat Mullins, is yet another in a long string of extremist conservatives to incite an assassination attempt against the President of the United States. However, Mullins is not just another rabid teabagger inciting or threatening violence against the President; he is, like the letter calling for armed rebellion against the government, a high-ranking representative of the Republican Party.\n\nPrior to \u201cpredicting\u201d President Obama\u2019s imminent death, Mullins made excuses for the first big Republican electoral defeat in 24 years blaming the media for focusing on Cuccinelli\u2019s anti-women, anti-gay, anti-sexual freedom positions than the Affordable Care Act. He claimed there was too much attention on Cuccinelli\u2019s \u201cwar on women\u201d and said \u201cour message couldn\u2019t break through and we paid a price. This is false narrative by false prophets\u2026 Republicans do not win when we are mini-Democrats or Democrat Lite.\u201d Clearly, Mullins assessment of Cuccinelli\u2019s war on women as \u201cmini-Democrats or Democrat lite\u201d is a signal that he is not in the same political universe as the rest of the nation, and portends a lurch farther to the extreme right many conservatives assert is the key to a sweeping victory in the next election. Two Virginia state democratic senators, Mamie Locke and Donald McEachin, called for RPV chairman Mullins to step down; not because he said Republicans had become mini-Democrats, but over his comments predicting President Obama is close to death by assassination.\n\nIn a conference call, state Senator McEachin said \u201cSadly, this isn\u2019t the first time Virginia Republicans have used offensive, violent rhetoric against President Obama. Saying that President Obama is close to death is unacceptable in our political discourse, and the chairman really should be ashamed of himself. He\u2019s decried this type of rhetoric before\u2026 and yet somehow it keeps appearing in his speeches, in his public comments.\u201d McEachin continued that, \u201cTo my mind, this is yet another example of just how unwilling to change and how unbridled in their opposition to President Obama the Republicans are. Instead of making insulting, incendiary comments about the President, intended to fire up the same Tea Party base that drove Virginia Republicans to statewide losses in 2013, Chairman Mullins would be better suited to look in the mirror and examine how out of touch Virginia Republicans have become with people across the Commonwealth.\u201d Senator Locke agreed with McEachin and said instead of learning from their mistakes and taking a more moderate approach to governance and politicking, Republicans are bound and determined that \u201cgoing forward will be to continue kowtowing to the tea party.\u201d\n\nLocke\u2019s assessment certainly has a grain of truth to it, but she makes the same errant conclusion as Democrats and pundits across the nation. Republicans are not kowtowing to the teabaggers; they are the teabaggers. As McEachin noted, it \u201cisn\u2019t the first time Virginia Republicans have used violent rhetoric against President Obama\u201d and it will not be the last. The calls for revolution, rebellion, and violent rhetoric against the government with an African American man as President began during teabagger protests against healthcare insurance reform when they carried signs warning that \u201cwe came unarmed this time,\u201d and continued with Republicans threatening \u201c2nd amendment remedies\u201d and calling for supporters to be \u201carmed and dangerous\u201d as a strategy against legally elected members of Congress who fail to support teabagger anti-American agendas.\n\nWhat is telling is that no Virginia Republicans, including governor McDonnell, attorney general Cuccinelli, or congressional Republicans such as Eric Cantor (who attended and spoke at Advance) have condemned the violent rhetoric from Virginia\u2019s state Republican Party or any other anti-American teabagger extremist for that matter. However, they are very vocal in decrying the President as un-American, a socialist, and dangerous for America, and coupled with their silence makes them as guilty as extremists calling for armed rebellion, revolution, and assassination. That the chairman of the Virginia Republican party said the President is \u201cclose to death\u201d should lead the FBI, Secret Service, and Justice Department to pay Mullins a visit and ask exactly why, what, and how he knows about an assassination plot.\n\nThe threats against this President have become so frequent that statements such as Mullins must be taken seriously and investigated with extreme prejudice. His remarks are more than Republican losers bemoaning an electoral defeat and inform a desperate political party sending a literal call to arms against the President of the United States. Coupled with his claim Republicans have to lurch farther to the extreme fringes of the right wing because they are unhappy with healthcare insurance reform, it is a just a matter of time before violent rhetoric is embraced by national Republicans. Frankly, national or state Republicans\u2019 unwillingness to condemn the preponderance of hate speech and violent rhetoric against this President is tantamount to their unconditional endorsement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the Virginia Republican retreat, party chairman Pat Mullins tried to incite an assassination attempt against the President of the United States.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "At the Virginia Republican retreat, party chairman Pat Mullins tried to incite an assassination attempt against the President of the United States.", "title": "Virginia Republican Leader Tries to Incite Assassination Attempt On President Obama", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/12/11/virginia-republican-party-incite-assassination-attempt-president-obama.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Obama-frown1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-11T21:02:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,assassination threat,Confederate War hospital,Death threat against President Obama,Eric Cantor,healthcare insurance reform,Ken Cuccinelli,McDonnell,president of the united states,Republican Party,Republican Party of Virginia,RPV Chairman Pat Mullins,Secret Service,Tea Party,Terry McAuliffe,Virginia,Virginia Republican Party,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-12-11T20:21:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-11T21:02:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "assassination threat, Confederate War hospital, Death threat against President Obama, Eric Cantor, healthcare insurance reform, Ken Cuccinelli, McDonnell, president of the united states, Republican Party, Republican Party of Virginia, RPV Chairman Pat Mullins, Secret Service, Tea Party, Terry McAuliffe, Virginia, Virginia Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd107c\"", "article_summary": "As McEachin noted, it \u201cisn\u2019t the first time Virginia Republicans have used violent rhetoric against President Obama\u201d and it will not be the last.\nIn a conference call, state Senator McEachin said \u201cSadly, this isn\u2019t the first time Virginia Republicans have used offensive, violent rhetoric against President Obama.\nSaying that President Obama is close to death is unacceptable in our political discourse, and the chairman really should be ashamed of himself.\nHowever, over the past couple of years it is becoming abundantly clear that the state is rampant with haters; especially in the Republican Party.\nIt is no secret that Virginia Republicans hate Americans for twice electing an African American man as President, but their hatred for the democratic process pales in comparison to their hatred for the President."}
