This is an increase of six percentage points from April.\n\nThe fine for non-compliance is initially fairly low: just $95 per person or one percent of yearly household income (whichever is higher). The penalty, however, increases every year until it climaxes at either 2.5 percent of a person\u2019s income or $695 per person.\n\nIt is little wonder only 39 percent support Obama\u2019s individual mandate. The Internal Revenue Service tactfully described the mandate as the \u201cindividual shared responsibility provision.\u201d\n\nThe individual shared responsibility provision requires you and each member of your family to either: Have minimum essential coverage, or\n\nHave an exemption from the responsibility to have minimum essential coverage, or\n\nMake a shared responsibility payment when you file your 2014 federal income tax return in 2015.\n\nThe report noted that only 23 percent believe Obamacare is working and more than 80 percent wish Congress would either change the law or repeal it all together.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rasmussen Report survey published Monday.
