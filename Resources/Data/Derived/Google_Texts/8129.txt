While the age-old, “Where do babies come from?” is difficult for any parent to explain once their child’s curiosity is piqued, it’s especially difficult for gay and lesbian parents. Or at least it was before The Next Family — an online resource for modern families — created this simple, adorable explainer.

Brandy Black founded the modern lifestyle site, and about six to eight months ago, she asked her daughter Sophia, 7, if anyone had asked about her having two moms, BuzzFeed News reported. When Sophia answered they had, explaining she replies “every family is different,” Black asked if she understood why other kids were asking at all. And when Sophia made it clear she didn’t, Black “explained the light answer of how you need to have a sperm and an egg.”

This conversation inspired a video on how two moms can make a baby. Black told BuzzFeed she had no idea what Sophia would say. But as evidenced in the video, Sophia totally surprised and impressed her mother with her explanation.

“Say you have Mom, and she was in love with this other girl, and then they married, and then they wanted to have a baby — but they needed a boy to have sperm!” Sophia explained. "A baby needs an egg and sperm to grow; a girl has an egg and a boy has sperm."

The video is worth watching for Sophia's illustrated idea of sperm alone.
