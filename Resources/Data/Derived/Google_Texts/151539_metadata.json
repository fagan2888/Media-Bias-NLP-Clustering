Also, Debbie Reynolds is selling off her last batch of Hollywood memorabilia.\n\nDr. Dre is on the field before the Boston Red Sox take on the the New York Yankees on April 4, 2010, during Opening Night at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park. Elsa/Getty Images\n\nY\u2019all know that Dr. Dre hasn\u2019t exactly been low key in his business venture Beats Electronics LLC, but the rapper\u2019s been involved in something a little closer to Broke\u2019s purview lately. According to Bankruptcy Beat, a judge recently said Dre\u2019s request for priority payment of a $3 million claim against Death Row Records and founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight was just a bunch of gibberish. Dre\u2019s lawyer in the case, who declined comment Wednesday, had said he was owed $1.8 million in royalties and $1.2 million in sales proceeds from allegedly unauthorized digital sales of music he wrote, produced or performed. But even though Dre will have to forget about the $3 million, at least he\u2019s got something to say for Beats Electronics, which Apple Inc. has proposed buying for $3.2 billion. (Guess we\u2019ll have to listen up closely to see how that pans out.)\n\nTeresa, left, and Joe Giudice leave federal court in Newark, N.J. on March 4. Rich Schultz/Associated Press\n\nWe noted last week that \u201cReal Housewives of New Jersey\u201d star Teresa Giudice was cleared in a mortgage fraud lawsuit against her and husband Joe. According to RadarOnline, the lawsuit, which said Joe Giudice forged his ex-business partner\u2019s name on mortgage-related documents, has now been thrown out entirely. \u201cThis is a HUGE victory for the Giudice family and for their ongoing criminal case that is taking new turns by the day,\u201d Wendy Feldman, the Giudices\u2019 legal coach and crisis manager, told RadarOnline. Not all is well for the couple, though. Let\u2019s not forget about those multiple counts of fraud to which they\u2019ve pleaded guilty.\n\nDebbie Reynolds in May 2013. Chris Pizzello/Invision/Associated Press\n\nDebbie Reynolds has been selling off Hollywood memorabilia since her planned museum entered bankruptcy in 2009, but the actress\u2019s last batch of goods is about to hit the block. As Bankruptcy Beat reported, Profiles in History is holding an \u201cauction finale\u201d this weekend. In addition to myriad film posters and photos of stars, the auction will feature some more memorable goods, such as Orson Welles\u2019s mink coat from \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Charlie Chaplin\u2019s signature bowler and a hat made for Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O\u2019Hara in the movie \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d The auction will also feature some vintage cameras, including a camera used to film the \u201cDracula,\u201d \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and \u201cPinocchio\u201d movies.\n\nCurt Schilling is seen during a baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves on Aug. 2. Michael Perez/Associated Press\n\nCurt Schilling and his collapsed videogame company may be entrenched in never-ending drama, but the ex-baseball player will at least be raking in some money soon. The Boston Globe reported that Mr. Schilling and wife Shonda sold their Medfield, Mass., home for $2.5 million, a $500,000 price drop from its listing in August 2013. The seven-bedroom, 7,981-square-foot home sits on a 26-acre lot and includes a three-room \u201cmaster sanctuary.\u201d The home also has a \u201cmulti-seasonal sports court,\u201d a game room, a movie theater, a wet bar and a wine room.\n\nWrite to Melanie Cohen at melanie.cohen@wsj.com.
