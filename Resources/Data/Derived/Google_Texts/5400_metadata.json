It came to $63 per covered person in 2014 and $44 for each person in 2015. The money is used primarily to fund a temporary financial pool that protects insurance companies issuing individual policies in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, marketplace. Insurers can tap into the reinsurance fund when they have to pay out particularly high medical claims. This is one of several fees or taxes that Democrats in Congress built into the new health insurance system in an effort to start the new market \u2014 targeted to individuals and families that lacked workplace coverage \u2014 on sound financial footing. The reinsurance fee was designed to get the system started and to phase out after 2016. But state employers, cities and public universities had to pay the fee too if they insured their employees under group plans. DeWine, filing the lawsuit last January in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, called it \u201can unprecedented attempt to destroy the balance of authority between the federal government and the states.\u201d\n\nGood God, Mike, take some beta blockers and calm the fk down. Now we know how abominable the idea of helping your fellow citizens may be to you, how horrifying it must be to contemplate that millions of Americans may be assured of medical access that doesn\u2019t crush their bank accounts. But in the big scheme of things, is this really something to launch your soup bowl across the room over?\n\nThe fee amounted to $5.389 million for state in 2014. State universities paid hundreds of thousands of dollars each.\n\nHoly Moly, Mike, $5.4 million? To the fainting couch, post haste!\n\nBut it appears that the judge in this matter has DeWine\u2019s number, and it\u2019s not 867-Jenny.\n\nIn issuing the opinion, released Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley suggested that DeWine\u2019s intent was more than protecting Ohio fiscally. Marbley was appointed to the bench in 1997 by President Bill Clinton. The state of Ohio \u201cis no stranger to Affordable Care Act challenges,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cTo the contrary, the State\u2019s Attorney General proudly trumpets that his first act in office was joining a twenty-five state lawsuit challenging the Act in its entirety.\u201d That effort, challenging the federal government\u2019s right to charge a penalty for people who refuse to get insurance, largely failed when it reached the U.S. Supreme Court. But DeWine wasn\u2019t done. \u201cIn 2014, Ohio redoubled its efforts against the Affordable Care Act by leading nineteen states in filing a friend-of-the-court brief in support of a challenge to the contraception-coverage mandate,\u201d Marbley noted in this week\u2019s opinion. In that challenge, known as the Hobby Lobby case because of the name of the chain of stores that did not wish to provide contraception coverage to workers, DeWine and the other litigants \u201cnotched a partial victory.\u201d There was still another multi-state case with DeWine\u2019s involvement, this one concerning faith-based objections to birth control from nonprofit religious colleges and hospitals. The Supreme Court could resolve the case this year.\n\nY\u2019know, Mike, I might not have your decades of experience in lawyerin\u2019, but when the judge is writing opinions basically stating that it\u2019s crushingly obvious you\u2019re playing out a personal political vendetta, maybe it\u2019s time to hang it up, brother.
