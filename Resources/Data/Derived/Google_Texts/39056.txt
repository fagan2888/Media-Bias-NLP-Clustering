Two people were wounded in a suspected drive-by shooting at the Citadel Mall in Colorado Springs on Saturday night, officials said.

A male and a female were taken to a local hospital with non-life threatening gunshot wounds, according to a news release by the Colorado Springs Police Department.

The investigation revealed that a disturbance happened between two groups followed by a suspected drive-by shooting outside the mall, police said.

The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that the situation took place near a Hooters restaurant.

The possible suspect vehicle is a white, newer model, 4-door sedan with dark, tinted windows.

The mall decided to go on a shelter in place status after the shooting was reported. Tactical units from the Colorado Springs police and El Paso County Sheriff’s Office then cleared the mall and escorted people out of businesses, the release said.

While investigating the scene at the mall, officers received word about a potential third victim who had received a graze injury. Police responded to the male victim’s home, and he did not require medical attention.

“This is an active investigation,” the news release said. “Suspects have been identified at this time.”

Anyone with information on potential suspects or anyone who witnessed the crime is asked to contact the police department at 719-444-7000. People who prefer to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 719-634-7867.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
