The first was ObamaCare, with its employer mandate to offer affordable health coverage or pay a fine.\n\nTogether, they could raise the cost of employing a full-time minimum-wage worker by as much as $5.06 an hour \u2014 a 65% jump vs. base compensation in states aligned with the $7.25 federal minimum. That includes:\n\nThe proposed minimum-wage bump of $2.85 an hour, plus another 22 cents in employer payroll taxes.\n\nThe ObamaCare mandate penalty in 2015 of $2,080 per worker for large employers who don\u2019t offer coverage. The fine is nondeductible, so it equates to about $3,420 in wages for a profit-making employer paying a combined 39.2% state and federal tax rate. That comes to $1.69 an hour for a 40-hour worker.\n\nUp to seven days of paid sick leave, adding 30 cents per hour to compensation (assuming a worker takes that time off).\n\nHeaping on mandate after mandate without paying heed to the growing demands that government is putting on low-wage employers comes with a risk that workers will be priced out of some of those jobs.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office expects that \u201cemployers will probably pass along the cost of (ObamaCare employer mandate) penalties to their workers in the form of reduced wages.\u201d\n\nWhen CBO estimated that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could cost a half million jobs, it noted that combining such a hike with ObamaCare fines would put more jobs at risk.\n\nThe combination \u201cfurther boosts the likelihood that employers\u2019 savings from reducing the size of their workforces would exceed their adjustment costs,\u201d such as the cost of shifting to labor-saving technology.\n\nAdding a sick-leave mandate would further tip the scale against low-wage jobs.\n\nThe idea of sick pay isn\u2019t without logic: Everyone would be bet ter off \u2014 including restaurant diners who don\u2019t want waiters to sneeze in their soup \u2014 if people who were really sick stayed at home, which they could afford to do if it didn\u2019t mean losing a day\u2019s pay. Parents would also be able to take care of sick children.\n\nYet prospects for a GOP-led Congress considering this proposal seem slim while the costs of other more exacting mandates strain low-margin businesses that rely on low-cost labor.\n\nSeveral states have adopted paid sick-leave mandates. California provides three days and Connecticut five. The Healthy Families Act embraced by Obama would expand that to as much as seven days, with 1 hour off earned for every 30 hours of work, capped at 56 hours.\n\nMany employers who voluntarily provide sick pay roll a portion of unused time into paychecks at the start of the next year. But workers given mandated paid sick days would use them or lose them. Employers wouldn\u2019t have to let earned sick time accumulate beyond seven days, nor pay workers for unused sick time.\n\nThat could result in employees taking more time off than they would otherwise, leaving employers a choice of getting by with fewer work hours, paying overtime or adding additional workers. But paying workers for unused sick time has a downside too. Under the ObamaCare employer mandate, the IRS treats any paid leave earned as time at work. Thus, the law\u2019s full-time threshold would be lowered by an hour, to 29 hours, for employers who pay one hour of sick leave per week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his sixth State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama plans to propose his third costly mandate for low-wage employers \u2014 up to seven days of", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "In his sixth State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama plans to propose his third costly mandate for low-wage employers \u2014 up to seven days of paid sick leave per year.
