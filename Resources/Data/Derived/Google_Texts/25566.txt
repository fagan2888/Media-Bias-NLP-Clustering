Hosting “Saturday Night Live” for the third time, comedian and actor Seth Rogen wanted to use his opening monologue to share his memories of working with the cast throughout the week — but famous buddies Zooey Deschanel, James Franco and Taylor Swift kept stealing the spotlight for themselves instead.

Rogen kicked-off his most recent stint on one of comedy’s biggest stages by introducing everyone to his “family” (a group of nice-seeming people who just so happen to also share Rogen’s signature grunting laugh) and reading from his SNL “journal,” which he used so as not to forget a single moment of his latest SNL experience.
