The fetus wasn\u2019t viable, and the pregnancy \u2014 Means\u2019 third \u2014 was doomed.\n\nBut doctors at the hospital, part of the Catholic healthcare network known as Mercy Health Partners, didn\u2019t tell her that, Means\u2019 lawyers say. Instead of the normal course of treatment \u2014 inducing labor and terminating the pregnancy to stave off potentially risky complications \u2014 Means was allegedly kept in the dark about her condition, given painkillers, and sent home.\n\nBleeding and wracked with pain, she returned to Mercy twice over the next day or so and received more or less the same response, her lawyers claim. Just as she was about to be sent home a third time, by now feverish from a severe infection, she began to deliver. The baby died.\n\nThe case has received an enormous amount of attention because of who Means\u2019 attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union chose to sue last November: not her doctors or the hospital but the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).\n\nMeans\u2019 lawyers claim that she was subjected to dangerously substandard treatment, that her own health was placed in peril, and that she was deprived of information about her condition because of rules issued by the bishops conference that govern all Catholic health care in the U.S. The rules \u2014 which Mercy and its staff are required to follow \u2014 prohibit abortion, and as a result, according to Means\u2019 lawyers, doctors would not give up on the pregnancy.\n\nThe move to sue the bishops was unprecedented, and everyone from the New York Times to the National Catholic Register heralded the case as a new front in the culture war over religious liberty, gender equality and reproductive care \u2014 a version of the same raging conflict that will play out before the Supreme Court next week when it hears arguments in the Hobby Lobby/Conestoga Industries contraception cases. Those cases challenge the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules requiring employers to provide birth-control benefits to their workers, even if the employers have religious objections.\n\nWhen the Means suit was filed, the bishops called the allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmisguided\u201d and defended Catholic health care\u2019s \u201cstellar history of caring for mothers and infants.\u201d Otherwise, though, they were silent.\n\nNow, the bishops and their attorneys have followed up with a motion to dismiss the case, and ProPublica has taken the first sustained look at their arguments.\n\nThe bishops, for the most part, have chosen to avoid sweeping language about constitutional rights and freedoms, instead focusing on the nitty-gritty procedural issues that are basic to high-stakes civil litigation. They argue, essentially, that the ACLU has chosen the wrong venue \u2014 federal court in Detroit \u2014 to sue (the USCCB is based in Washington D.C.) and is mistaken in blaming the USCCB for decisions made by individual bishops in their own dioceses.\n\nThe arguments echo what some legal scholars have been saying for some time: that the lawsuit is at best a long-shot. A hearing is scheduled for May on the motion to dismiss.\n\nFirst some background: The ACLU and women\u2019s groups have been voicing concern since the 1990s about the growing role of Catholic health care operations around the country and what they see as the resulting threats posed to women\u2019s reproductive rights. Those complaints have grown louder in recent years as Catholic facilities have moved aggressively to merge with secular hospitals and reports have surfaced about the challenges \u2013 some say contortions \u2014 that doctors and nurses have sometimes had to face to comply with church teachings on abortion, birth control, and end-of-life care while fulfilling their duty to patients.\n\nCatholic hospitals now account for about 16 percent of hospital beds in the U.S. And in eight states \u2014 including Washington, Oregon, Iowa, and Missouri \u2014 they control more than 30 percent of beds. Ten of the 25 largest health-care networks in the country are Catholic-sponsored.\n\nThe Means case touched a nerve because it seemed to bring together many of the issues that have worried women\u2019s advocates the most. Indeed, if the allegations are true, what happened at Mercy Health Partners was even worse than has been reported at the time of the initial filing of the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the suit, Means\u2019 alleged mistreatment came to light in late 2012 or early 2013 when an unidentified researcher working on a federally funded project at Mercy uncovered what she said were not one, but five instances in which doctors there failed to terminate the pregnancies of women who were clearly miscarrying.\n\nWhen the researcher asked hospital officials to explain, they allegedly told her that they were following the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care, or ERDs \u2014 guidelines that govern medical treatment at every Catholic hospital and health system in the United States.\n\nThe ERDS \u2014 which are issued and regularly updated by the bishops council \u2014 ban abortion and limit many other medical options, including sterilization and birth control, and apply to patients and medical staff no matter what their religion.\n\nTheir impact, the advocates say, is greatest in places like Muskegon, where the only hospitals in the county are Catholic. Doctors who fail to comply with the ERDs risk losing their admitting privileges; other employees who similarly fail to abide by the ERDs face losing their jobs. (In Colorado recently, a cardiologist at a Catholic facility was reprimanded for merely mentioning abortion as a treatment option for a woman for whom pregnancy could have been deadly.)\n\n\u201cThe bishops aren\u2019t doctors, and yet they issue rules that tie doctors\u2019 hands, preventing them from giving their patients full information about their health care options and, in some cases, preventing them from providing medically appropriate care,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s deputy legal director, Louise Melling, blogged on the organization\u2019s website in December. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nBut in motions filed over the past two months, the bishops and their co-defendants \u2014 three officials at an entity called Catholic Health Ministries created to \u201coversee the healing ministry and Catholic identity\u201d of Mercy and other hospitals in its network \u2014 have argued that the ACLU lawsuit has a series of potentially fatal flaws.\n\nPerhaps the most basic involves the statute of limitations. The defense lawyers point out that Means had her miscarriage in December 2010, almost exactly three years before filing suit. The Michigan deadline for medical malpractice claims is two years.\n\nThe statute of limitations for negligence, on the other hand, is three years. Negligence is the cause of action that forms the basis of the ACLU\u2019s complaint \u2014 something the attorneys for the bishops have signaled they plan to challenge. They describe the lawsuit as \u201ca poorly disguised medical malpractice action\u201d and \u201ca frivolous and totally fabricated cause of action.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers also question the ACLU\u2019s choice of venue. Instead of bringing the case in federal court in Western Michigan, where Means lives and Mercy Health Partners is located, the organization filed suit in the Eastern District, where Mercy\u2019s owner, Trinity Health, is based. But Trinity isn\u2019t a defendant. (Though the court filings don\u2019t say so, the judges in the Western District are mainly Republicans, while the Eastern District \u2014 based in Detroit \u2014 is dominated by Clinton and Obama appointees.)\n\nIn their filings, the bishops conference doesn\u2019t address whether Means\u2019 allegations are true. Instead, they argue that the ACLU has fundamentally misread the ERDs. Despite the ban on abortion, the directives do not \u201cpreclude anyone from being given appropriate medical care,\u201d Linda Hunt, a USCCB executive, said in an affidavit. She noted that the ERDs \u201cspecifically require \u2018free and informed consent\u2026. for medical treatments and procedures\u2019\u201d including \u201crisks, side-effects, consequences and costs; and any reasonable and morally legitimate alternatives.\u201d\n\nHunt reiterated, \u201cThere is no directive that requires or allows a pregnant woman to be harmed in any way.\u201d\n\nThe bishops and their lawyers, to date, have not specially addressed the care Means received.\n\nMeans, in an interview in January, described her version of events.\n\n\u201cThey sent me home with no answers. I was begging, \u2018You guys have to help me. I am in a lot of pain. I can\u2019t keep going home like this. Please help me.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter we were sent home the second time, I knew the baby wasn\u2019t going to make it. I felt alone. I can\u2019t even put into words. I felt confused, in pain and devastated.\u201d\n\nThe arguments made so far by the bishops track what some legal scholars have been saying about the case since it was filed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that if [Means] sued the hospital or the doctor, this would be plain, vanilla medical malpractice,\u201d Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois, told the American Prospect in December. \u201cBut they\u2019re not suing the doctor, the hospital, the local bishops, the board of trustees \u2014 you\u2019re many layers removed from the person who really should owe this woman a remedy if everything in the complaint is taken as accurate.\u201d\n\nRichmond School of Law professor Kevin Walsh first noted the statute of limitations problem in a post on the Catholic legal blog Mirror of Justice. \u201cIf one assumes for purposes of analysis that medical malpractice was committed, then why not sue for medical malpractice? Why repackage a potentially winning claim of medical malpractice into a seemingly losing claim of theological malpractice?\u201d\n\nAnother explanation, Walsh wrote, \u201cmay be that the ACLU's goal in the case is not to obtain personal redress for their client but instead to place a dark cloud over Catholic healthcare more generally. That is not only plausible but probable.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview last December, the ACLU\u2019s Melling disputed that.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost we care about Tamesha Means,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are filing this suit on behalf of a woman who was wronged. She wasn\u2019t provided adequate care and as a result, she suffered unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nMelling, though, also was clear that her organization was trying to make a larger point.\n\n\u201cWe know Tamesha Means wasn\u2019t the only person in the country who was denied prompt and appropriate care. The bishops set the standards for health care in Catholic hospitals, and those standards can\u2019t be putting patients at risk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"premium": "true", "description": "The ACLU\u2019s case against the U.S. Bishops Conference \u2013 heralded by some as a bold legal stroke \u2013 could be thwarted on procedural grounds.", "author": "Nina Martin", "og": {"site_name": "ProPublica", "description": "The ACLU\u2019s case against the U.S. Bishops Conference \u2013 heralded by some as a bold legal stroke \u2013 could be thwarted on procedural grounds.", "title": "In Healthcare Suit Against Catholic Bishops, the Specter of an Early Defeat", "url": "http://www.propublica.org/article/in-healthcare-suit-against-catholic-bishops-the-specter-of-an-early-defeat", "image": "http://www.propublica.org/images/ngen/gypsy_big_image/gt_MI_catholic_630x420.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ACLU\u2019s case against the U.S. Bishops Conference \u2013 heralded by some as a bold legal stroke \u2013 could be thwarted on procedural grounds.", "title": "In Healthcare Suit Against Catholic Bishops, the Specter of an Early Defeat", "url": "http://www.propublica.org/article/in-healthcare-suit-against-catholic-bishops-the-specter-of-an-early-defeat", "image": {"src": "http://www.propublica.org/images/ngen/gypsy_big_image/gt_MI_catholic_630x420.jpg"}, "creator": "@byninamartin", "site": "@ProPublica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "project": "Sex and Gender", "fb": {"app_id": 229862657130557}, "google-site-verification": "R7yl3d-Z-qHW6xTItWhBYggGROoZNgEVh2z6dVneuIM", "article": {"section": "Sex and Gender", "published_time": "2014-03-20T15:25:53-0500", "modified_time": "2014-03-24T08:38:04-0500", "author": "http://www.propublica.org/site/author/nina_martin/"}, "type": "article", "scope": "Medium", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06e9\"", "article_summary": "The bishops set the standards for health care in Catholic hospitals, and those standards can\u2019t be putting patients at risk.\u201d\nBut doctors at the hospital, part of the Catholic healthcare network known as Mercy Health Partners, didn\u2019t tell her that, Means\u2019 lawyers say.\nThe rules \u2014 which Mercy and its staff are required to follow \u2014 prohibit abortion, and as a result, according to Means\u2019 lawyers, doctors would not give up on the pregnancy.\nThe Means case touched a nerve because it seemed to bring together many of the issues that have worried women\u2019s advocates the most.\nDespite the ban on abortion, the directives do not \u201cpreclude anyone from being given appropriate medical care,\u201d Linda Hunt, a USCCB executive, said in an affidavit."}
