Many states are loosening restrictions on telemedicine, and requiring insurers to pay for it, citing doctor shortages and pressure to increase convenient access to medical care, partly because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTexas, however, is moving in the opposite direction. The Texas board already required doctors to establish a relationship with patients before giving a diagnosis or prescribing drugs.\n\nBut Friday, it changed its rules to state that \u201cquestions and answers exchanged through email, electronic text, or chat or telephonic evaluation of or consultation with a patient\u201d are inadequate to establish a doctor-patient relationship. The move significantly tightens rules that already preclude video consultations except under a narrow set of circumstances.\n\nThe Texas Medical Association and other groups representing doctors in the state strongly supported the new restrictions, citing concerns about patient safety. In a letter to the board, the association said it \u201csupports the use of telemedicine that can provide safe, high-quality, timely care,\u201d but that safeguards must be in place \u201cto protect patients and ensure telemedicine complements the efforts of local health care providers.\u201d\n\nJason Gorevic, chief executive and founder of Teladoc, said the new restrictions were \u201ca huge step backward for Texas,\u201d eliminating \u201ca safe, affordable and convenient health-care option that many have depended on for more than a decade.\u201d\n\nThe new restrictions do not outright ban telemedicine. Doctors will still be able to treat patients by phone or video from another location under certain circumstances. For example, patients will have to be at a hospital or clinic, with a second health-care provider there to \u201cassist.\u201d The new restrictions do not apply to mental-health visits, most likely because of a continuing shortage of psychiatrists.\n\nTelemedicine companies either directly charge consumers a flat fee, typically about $40 per consultation, or contract with employers or insurers to provide the consultations as a covered benefit. But they emphasize that they cannot treat serious problems or medical emergencies, and that they are meant to complement, not replace, people\u2019s relationships with their doctors.\n\n\u201cThis is going to quickly emerge as one way to relieve the demand pressures that are being put on the system,\u201d said Ceci Connolly, managing director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\nTexas is among a handful of states that still require an in-person exam before a telemedicine consult can take place, according to the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group in Washington, D.C. Other states have vaguely worded policies that are not clear on whether an in-person visit is needed first.\n\nIn a recent interview, Gorevic said Teladoc\u2019s national network of 700 board-certified physicians receive special training in how to conduct telemedicine consultations and follow clinical guidelines that are \u201cspecific to telehealth.\u201d The company, which operates in every state except Arkansas and Idaho, has seen rapid growth in demand for its services, he said, with almost 300,000 consultations last year, double the number in 2013. It has more customers in Texas than in any other state.\n\nThe company says its doctors are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Its doctors do not prescribe narcotics, other controlled substances, or what it refers to as \u201clifestyle drugs,\u201d such as Viagra.\n\nTeladoc\u2019s conflict with the medical board started in 2011, when the board threatened to discipline the company\u2019s doctors for prescribing drugs to patients they had not seen in person. Teladoc sued, accusing the board of changing its rules without going through the proper process. Late last year, a state appeals court sided with Teladoc, which led the medical board to issue an emergency rule in January. Teladoc won a temporary injunction while the board went through its formal rule-making process over the past few months.\n\nThe new restrictions are to take effect in June. Before voting on them, Frank Denton, an investment executive from the Houston area who was the only board member to oppose them, said telemedicine was the \u201cleast desirable\u201d way to deliver health care but \u201cthe public should have the right to use that option.\u201d\n\nAnother board member, Dr. George Willeford of Austin, expressed the opinion of the majority when he said he worried that telemedicine, unless properly regulated, could weaken doctor accountability to patients. \u201cI\u2019m terribly, terribly worried about the absence of responsibility and accountability,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The vote comes as telemedicine companies like Teladoc, helped by enthusiastic investors and rapid advances in technology, are seeking to expand nationwide.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "The vote comes as telemedicine companies like Teladoc, helped by enthusiastic investors and rapid advances in technology, are seeking to expand nationwide.", "title": "Medical care by phone, Web gets restricted in Texas", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/medical-care-by-phone-web-gets-restricted-in-texas/", "image": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8f1a8a70-e099-11e4-a595-e9419f13fefa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Medical care by phone, Web gets restricted in Texas", "description": "The vote comes as telemedicine companies like Teladoc, helped by enthusiastic investors and rapid advances in technology, are seeking to expand nationwide.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "site": "@seattletimes"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2015-04-11 15:09:03", "modified_time": "2015-04-11 17:31:15"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nation & World, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11bc\"", "article_summary": "The Texas Medical Association and other groups representing doctors in the state strongly supported the new restrictions, citing concerns about patient safety.\nThe Texas board already required doctors to establish a relationship with patients before giving a diagnosis or prescribing drugs.\nMany states are loosening restrictions on telemedicine, and requiring insurers to pay for it, citing doctor shortages and pressure to increase convenient access to medical care, partly because of the Affordable Care Act.\nLate last year, a state appeals court sided with Teladoc, which led the medical board to issue an emergency rule in January.\nTeladoc\u2019s conflict with the medical board started in 2011, when the board threatened to discipline the company\u2019s doctors for prescribing drugs to patients they had not seen in person."}
