Socialist Kshama Sawant, who was elected this year to the Seattle City Council, said Tuesday she does not count President Barack Obama as a comrade in socialism.

In an interview with HuffPost Live, Sawant said it was difficult for her to label the president as a socialist when, she said, advocates for single-payer health insurance were ignored during negotiations around the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

"Everybody who was an advocate for that kind of a system was shut out," Sawant said. "The people who he invited were insurance company and pharmaceutical company executives."

Sawant also said if Obama were a socialist, he would have met with Boeing employees during a fundraising trip to Washington instead of raising money for the Democratic Party. Boeing employees in Seattle recently rejected a contract from the airplane manufacturer.

"If an elected official was truly committed to the interests of working people as a genuine socialist would be, then, if I were him, I would prioritize meeting Boeing workers and trying to ensure that I gave them my support and solidarity," she said. "I wouldnâ€™t be going to raise millions of dollars from wealthy backers."
