Her experience took her to New York City, Chicago and Capitol Hill, where she learned the importance of words and communities in creating safe havens for survivors.\n\n\u201cI cannot (and would dare not) tell a survivor that I can completely relate to what she has been through,\u201d said Moore. \u201cHowever, I do have an unquenchable passion for justice. And now, thanks to this Plastino Scholars opportunity, I have a wealth of other types of experience from which I can draw in order to supplement, and even validate, this passion. I am beyond grateful for this privilege of research.\u201d\n\n2015 Plastino Scholars\n\nGeorgina Class-Peters and Gerti Wilson, will work together to produce a documentary titled The Beauty Project: Ghana , examining the perceptions of beauty and the effect they have on young women in power. Class-Peters is a junior political science major from Delaware, and she is also the student representative on the selection committee for UD\u2019s next president. Wilson is a junior political science major with minors in legal studies and women\u2019s studies from Delaware.\n\n, examining the perceptions of beauty and the effect they have on young women in power.

Lael Houston, a public policy major from Delaware, will use her Plastino experience to study health care disparities in the aboriginal Australian population, with a special focus on those in remote areas. She is interested in understanding the social factors that influence health and exacerbate disparity.\n\nAs Plastino Scholars, Sean Krazit and Kevin Mascitelli will combine their love of dance and interest in education to better understand how to start and run a successful swing dance organization \u0097 taking what they learn from successful operations in Austin, Seattle and Denver and applying it to UD\u2019s swing dance club, as well as other swing dance organizations in the area. Krazit, a senior English education major from New Jersey, and Mascitelli, an international relations major from Pennsylvania, are members of UD\u2019s Swing Dance Club.\n\nSophiana Leto, a junior anthropology major with minors in art history, Latin American studies and material culture studies, will travel across the country \u0097 to New York, Illinois, Arizona and California \u0097 to study how museums implement successful outreach programs for their communities. She is particularly interested in determining whether museums are able to provide their residents something that other social service providers cannot.\n\nAustin Roadarmel, a sophomore biological sciences major from Delaware, will use his Plastino experience to conduct a global health care study, interviewing physicians across the world. As a pre-med student and health policy enthusiast, he is interested in investigating the effects of the Affordable Care Act. Roadarmel wants to study other countries to ensure he can play a role in enhancing the American health care system.\n\nDunia Tonob, a junior anthropology major from Delaware with minors in Asian studies, biological sciences and medical humanities, will also explore health care systems, shadowing doctors and patients in America and China to better understand differences in doctor-patient relationships and patient satisfaction. She, too, is interested in the effects of the Affordable Care Act, and as an anthropology and medical humanities student, she wants to learn about culture to better impact the lives of others.\n\nPhoto by Kathy F.
