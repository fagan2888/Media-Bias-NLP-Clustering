It captures the unmistakable image of Pirates legend Bill Mazeroski, helmet held high, rounding the bases after hitting a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the heavily favored New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series.\n\nIt was a Steel City miracle, ranking right next to Franco Harris\u2019 \u201cImmaculate Reception\u201d in the Steelers\u2019 playoff victory over the Oakland Raiders in 1972.\n\nBut what Hurdle\u2019s Pirates are doing is no miracle. Rather, it is the payoff for years of planning, building, acquiring talent and keeping the faith.\n\n\u201cThere is an incredible foundation of trust that has been built up here,\u201d said Hurdle, in his fifth season as Pittsburgh\u2019s manager. \u201cI think it was in development when I got here. You see the signs on the road, \u2018under construction.\u2019 That was us.\n\n\u201cOur minor-league farm system was fertile and trending upward in a big way. I thought the scouting department was doing excellent work. The seeds were planted.\u201d\n\nThe Pirates come to Coors Field on Monday to begin a four-game series with a playoff slot secure, with the second-best record (87-60) in baseball entering Saturday. The Rockies, headed to their fifth consecutive losing season, have taken notice.\n\n\u201cWe are not so blind and dumb that we don\u2019t understand that there are a lot of people in this industry, and outside this industry, that have taken on challenges and reversed the fortunes of franchises before,\u201d said first-year Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich. \u201cThere are so many lessons to be learned there, in Pittsburgh, and also Kansas City.\u201d\n\nThe Royals were the darlings of baseball last year after making it to the playoffs for the first time since 1985, then advancing to the World Series. This year they are the runaway leaders in the American League\u2019s Central division.\n\nBridich cautions, however, that Pittsburgh and Kansas City went through long dry spells before finding success, and there\u2019s no one common denominator to reversing a team\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cTo turn around that losing at this level \u2014 whether it\u2019s the Pirates after 20 years of losing, or the Royals after all that time, or us after five years \u2014 is not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIn hindsight, things can get lost in the story. It\u2019s not all easy, it\u2019s not all Pollyanna and rosy stories. What adjustments were made? What worked and what didn\u2019t? Coming to the truth of those turnarounds takes work.\u201d\n\nFresh off 105-loss season\n\nWhen Hurdle interviewed for the Pirates\u2019 managerial job in November 2010, he spent two days talking with, among others, team owner Bob Nutting, president Frank Coonelly and general manager Neal Huntington. To outsiders, it certainly didn\u2019t seem like a plum job. The Pirates were fresh off a 105-loss season. They hadn\u2019t had a winning season since 1992, when a slim Barry Bonds wore Pirates black and gold.\n\nAnd yet Hurdle \u2014 the man who managed the Rockies from 2002 until he was fired in late May 2009, and led the club to its only World Series berth in 2007 \u2014 saw Pittsburgh as the opportunity of a baseball lifetime.\n\n\u201cI actually used these words to my wife (Karla) and my father,\u201d Hurdle recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018This is the greatest coaching opportunity in all of sports at this time.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what I told them.\u201d\n\nWhat excited Hurdle was a group of young players, including budding star center fielder Andrew McCutchen, first baseman Pedro Alvarez and second baseman Neil Walker, whom he believed could form a valuable core, and promising minor-league prospects on the way. He also saw a franchise that had changed its philosophy, one that was willing to follow a blueprint, be patient and not panic if things weren\u2019t going well.\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2013, deep into Hurdle\u2019s third season, the Pirates beat the Texas Rangers 1-0, with 2011 first-round draft pick and current ace Gerrit Cole getting the victory. It was Pittsburgh\u2019s 82nd victory, ensuring a winning season for the first time in 21 years. During that wretched losing era, the Pirates had moved into PNC Park, changed owners twice, employed seven managers and five general managers and lost 1,857 games.\n\nHuntington, who came on board at the tail end of the 2007 season, had plenty of early failures, and there were plenty of critics who wanted him to be fired when he failed to field a winner after five years. Few general managers are given a sixth season to build a winner, but he got it.\n\nAfter a series of missteps, Huntington and his staff have proved adept at building a roster with young players and affordable acquisitions at the big-league level.\n\nFarm system bears fruit\n\nFor this year\u2019s team, Huntington signed key free agents, most notably re-signing starting pitcher Francisco Liriano to a three-year, $39 million contract. That was important, because, for many years free agents shunned Pittsburgh. Huntington made a terrific move by signing versatile infielder Jung Ho Kang from the Korean Baseball Organization. Huntington traded for catcher Francisco Cervelli, utility player Sean Rodriguez and reliever Antonio Bastardo.\n\nThe bulk of Pittsburgh\u2019s talented lineup, though, came through the farm system: shortstop Jordy Mercer (third round, 2008), Alvarez (first round, 2008), Walker (first round, 2004) and McCutchen (first round, 2005).\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint when we turned things around,\u201d said McCutchen, a five-time all-star who was named the 2013 National League MVP. \u201cMostly, I think it\u2019s the draft. We got the players we needed, and that helped us build this team. It created unity.\u201d\n\nBridich, who traded all-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto in a bold move just before this summer\u2019s trade deadline for pitching prospects and veteran shortstop Jose Reyes, still considers the Rockies a draft-and-develop franchise. Bridich hints, however, that the Rockies are open to changing their philosophy on acquiring pitching.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we are going to go off all willy-nilly in one direction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still going to be invested in player development and extremely invested in drafting and signing out of Latin America. So it\u2019s not a huge change in philosophy, but how we evaluate, collectively, the available pitching in the industry, might shift a little bit.\u201d\n\nBut Bridich said the Rockies are not going to do a 180-degree turn and start throwing money around.\n\n\u201cIf you are asking if there is going to be massive monetary or financial shifting with us, I would be very surprised if that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Pirates didn\u2019t do it that way and neither did the Royals. The Royals tried spending big money, and it didn\u2019t work. It took Neal (Huntington) a long time.\n\n\u201cObviously, we aspire to have it be a shorter window than (the Pirates) before we win, but in terms of money, and salary, some of the things we might do in free agency, or in the trade market, I think we are looking to grow those things intelligently.\u201d\n\n\u201cClint has our back\u201d\n\nHang around the Pirates for a few days and camaraderie is evident in the clubhouse and the dugout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a tight team,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cClint has our back, and we have his. He loves us and we love him right back. That\u2019s pretty special.\u201d\n\nThe button-downed Bridich doesn\u2019t usually talk about building a baseball team in a tight-knit manner, but he said he understands the importance of chemistry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that there are significant stakeholders who believe in that \u2018stuff,\u2019 for lack of a better term,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at the Cardinals and what they have going and you know that they have significant stakeholders in that clubhouse, guys who believe that is important. It sounds like the Pirates do as well.\u201d\n\nIn star third baseman Nolan Arenado, just 24, the Rockies have a player to build around, but Bridich said leadership can\u2019t be heaped on Arenado\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cDoes it have to be the, quote-unquote, superstar or the best player? No,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cDoes it help when it is that player, because of the private and public weight that person carries? Yes. But it\u2019s unrealistic in this day and age for that to be one player. At the very least, it takes a group.\u201d\n\nHurdle said grinding through years of losing created a toughness that now serves the Pirates well.\n\n\u201cThe closeness of this team started a while ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of that was planted during our hardest times here, in 2011 and 2012, when we started well and then collapsed. We got beat up, and we got kicked off the playground.\n\n\u201cI told the players, \u2018For a lot of you, this might be the first time you have tasted your own blood. You have to go home and tell your dad you got bloodied. But then you get bigger, stronger and faster and you go back because that\u2019s the only playground there is.\u2019 \u201c\n\nDeath of McGregor\n\nMuch of what he learned about team building in Colorado and Pittsburgh came from the late Keli McGregor, the Rockies\u2019 team president who died April 20, 2010, at age 47 of a rare virus that infected his heart muscle.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, when I talk about love on this team, that\u2019s just Keli dripping all over me,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cIn Colorado, Keli reminded me every day that my job is to make everybody else\u2019s job easier.\u201d\n\nHurdle doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s his place to speak about the current struggles of the Rockies, but he does say the void left by McGregor\u2019s death still lingers.\n\n\u201cThere was so much depth to that man, and he reached so many people and so many places so incredibly well,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cThere was a definite void created upon his loss. That being said, that creates an opportunity in Colorado.\n\n\u201cWho learned what when he was there? Who can impart some of that? He\u2019s gone and he\u2019s not coming back. He was a tremendous leader.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies never filled McGregor\u2019s position after his death and team owner Dick Monfort essentially took over McGregor\u2019s responsibilities. Since 2010, the Rockies have averaged over 90 losses per season.\n\nBridich insists that his first year on the job has been about evaluation and patiently setting the framework for the long term.\n\n\u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been a rush through anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI very much did not want to make impulsive or rash conclusions or decisions on much of anything. I think that\u2019s a good thing for the future.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\n2007 ROCKIES\n\nManager Clint Hurdle led Colorado to a 90-72 record and a World Series berth.\n\n2014 ROCKIES\n\nThey finished a dismal 66-96, and are faring only slightly better in 2015.\n\n2010 PIRATES\n\nThe franchise struggled to its 18th consecutive losing season (57-105).\n\n2014 PIRATES\n\nHurdle led Pittsburgh to an 88-74 record and an NL wild-card playoff slot.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "How the success of the Pittsburgh Pirates can be a model for the Rockies", "title": "How the success of the Pittsburgh Pirates can be a model for the Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/19/how-the-success-of-the-pittsburgh-pirates-can-be-a-model-for-the-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__PIttsburghp1.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__PIttsburghp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19T21:52:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T19:27:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda9b3\"", "article_summary": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Clint Hurdle sits at his desk, talking about the evolution of the Pittsburgh Pirates from perennial big-league losers into World Series contenders.\nThe Rockies, headed to their fifth consecutive losing season, have taken notice.\n2010 PIRATESThe franchise struggled to its 18th consecutive losing season (57-105).\nFarm system bears fruitFor this year\u2019s team, Huntington signed key free agents, most notably re-signing starting pitcher Francisco Liriano to a three-year, $39 million contract.\nThey hadn\u2019t had a winning season since 1992, when a slim Barry Bonds wore Pirates black and gold."}
