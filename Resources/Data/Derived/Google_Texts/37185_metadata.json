It\u2019s a claim that many would dispute as incoherent on its face.\n\nUkraine is not a member of NATO, though it does have an ambassador to the alliance, Igor Dolgov. On Monday, Dolgov announced Ukraine would be seeking additional non-lethal aid from the alliance, which has supported the Ukrainian army with financing and equipment other than weaponry.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a press conference on Monday, \u201cThe statement that there is a NATO legion in Ukraine is nonsense. There is no NATO legion. The foreign forces in Ukraine are Russian. So I think that is in a way the problem. That there are Russian forces in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Slap at Putin Provokes Angry Response\n\nThe situation in Ukraine has deteriorated rapidly in recent days. In addition to stepped-up fighting in the area around Donetsk, a civilian area of the port city of Mariupol was subject to a rocket attack over the weekend, which came from the area controlled by rebels, international observers determined.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nWhile all parties claim not to want another Cold War, the rhetoric coming out of Moscow seems intended to push public opinion in that direction.\n\nIn response to that attack, the international community condemned the rebels and the Russian support of their efforts. President Obama and his counterparts in Europe said that they would now begin to consider strengthening an already-punishing regime of sanctions on the Russian economy.\n\nThe markets responded Monday to the potential of more sanctions by driving the value of the Russian ruble even lower. The troubled ruble has lost nearly half its value in the last several months, and in combination with high inflation and reduced income due to low oil process has helped push the Russian economy into what is expected to be a severe recession.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s press secretary, on Monday called the threat of increased sanctions \u201ceconomic blackmail\u201d that would not be effective, according to TASS. \u201cRussia never agreed with threats like that and moreover, these threats and blackmail have never led and will never lead to Russia changing its consistent and well-known position under pressure.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As fighting intensifies in Eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed rebels are attempting", "title": "Putin Accuses NATO of Making Ukraine a Political Puppet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/26/Putin-Accuses-NATO-Making-Ukraine-Political-Puppet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/26/Putin-Accuses-NATO-Making-Ukraine-Political-Puppet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As fighting intensifies in Eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed rebels are attempting", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab82\"", "article_summary": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a press conference on Monday, \u201cThe statement that there is a NATO legion in Ukraine is nonsense.\nThere is no NATO legion.\nUkraine is not a member of NATO, though it does have an ambassador to the alliance, Igor Dolgov.\nPutin claimed that the effort to displace rebels who have taken over part of Ukraine \u201cdoes not pursue the goal of defending Ukraine\u2019s national interests,\u201d TASS reported.\nThat there are Russian forces in Ukraine.\u201dRelated: Obama\u2019s Slap at Putin Provokes Angry ResponseThe situation in Ukraine has deteriorated rapidly in recent days."}
