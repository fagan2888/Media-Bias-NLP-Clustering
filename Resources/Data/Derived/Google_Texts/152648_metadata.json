We need to make certain we do something drastic to change that dynamic for generations to come.\u201d\n\nIn low-income neighborhoods, it is vital to focus on prevention, said Sebelius, who stressed that efforts must be made to keep kids from smoking and eating unhealthy food.\n\nWilliams lamented the lack of healthy, affordable food options in Northern Manhattan, saying that many people from the community have complained to him about the difficulty in purchasing nutritious things to eat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got Associated in Washington Heights under attack, Pathmark up the street has closed,\u201d remarked Williams.\n\nWhile Singh acknowledged that healthy food is scarce, he said positive changes were on the way.\n\n\u201cWe see Pathmark closing,\u201d noted Singh. \u201cBut a Whole Foods is about to open in Harlem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe need to come up with ways to bring health services to people who need it,\u201d stated Williams.\nSingh said that better preventative care and population health would be an increased focus for physicians in the community.\nThose are the kinds of changes some advocates are claiming are needed to better the health outcomes of uptown residents.\nThe group discussed President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and how it impacts urban communities.\nSebelius told attendees that she was delighted to be back in the neighborhood, as the nearby Boriken Neighborhood Health Center was one of the first clinics she visited as Health Secretary."}
