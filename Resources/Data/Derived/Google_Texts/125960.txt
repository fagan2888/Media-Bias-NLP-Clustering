Hospital staff broke the news to a Tacoma, Wash. woman that her operation to remove a tumor from her breast would not be happening.

Medical benefits tied to her retired husband’s U.S. Army service had expired just 12 hours before, a detail on the 41-year-old woman’s benefits card that no one noticed until she was already prepped for surgery at Madigan Army Medical Center, according to a KING-TV report.

Patricia Zuniga described the bearers of bad news as “upfront” about the awkward discovery.

“You’re not having your surgery today. You do not have health care. You do not have benefits,” Zuniga was told during her Jan. 27 appointment at the hospital.

She had been led to believe her health care expired on Jan. 30, six months after her husband’s injuries discharged him from service.

She organized the appointment in December after learning a mammogram and needle biopsy found a tumor. Doctors at the time said it was not malignant.

Zuniga still doesn’t know how bad her medical condition, but she fears cancer is overtaking her body especially after she found another lump over her thyroid gland, she told KING-TV.

Unable to have the either tumor removed on her own dime, she’s waiting for new benefits with the Affordable Care Act to kick in.

“I feel scared. I’ve got two daughters. I’m a young woman and I want to live. That’s all I think, every day when I take a shower, when I see it,” Zuniga added.
