I\u2019m hurt,\u201d Huff cries in response.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best time to say health insurance,\u201d he replies.\n\nA Message from Step Brothers\u2019 Adam Scott from Funny Or Die\n\nThe skit plays on a popular theme the president and first lady have emphasized while pitching the law to younger Americans \u2013 that despite feeling \u201cinvincible,\u201d even young people face unexpected health issues that can be costly for those who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nThe last Funny or Die video to promote the ACA, Obama\u2019s \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d interview with Zach Galifianakis, has been viewed more than 20 million times since it went live two weeks ago. The healthcare.gov website saw a 40% increase in traffic the day after the video aired, according to a White House official.\n\nSome conservatives criticized the president for shooting the comedic interview, arguing the behavior was beneath the office of the president. When asked about that criticism, including the assertion that past presidents like Lincoln would never have participated in comedic campaigning, Obama insisted otherwise.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you read back on Lincoln, he loved telling the occasional bawdy joke, and being out among regular folks,\u201d Obama said on ESPN Radio last Thursday. \u201cOne of the hardest things about being president is being in this bubble that is artificial and unless you make a conscious effort you start sounding like some Washington stiff so you got to consciously try to get out of that if you want to remind yourself of the wonderful people that you\u2019re supposed to be serving who have a sense of humor and aren\u2019t thinking every day about position papers.\u201d\n\nOfficials behind the site said Monday that healthcare.gov saw more than a million visitors over the weekend, and tweeted this morning that another million people visited the site on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Funnyordie.com joined the Affordable Care Act campaign yet again with a new video starring comedian Adam Scott.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamacare-adam-scott-comedy-video", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Funnyordie.com joined the Affordable Care Act campaign yet again with a new video starring comedian Adam Scott.", "title": "'Parks and Recreation' star pitches Obamacare in new comedy video", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamacare-adam-scott-comedy-video", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/476528231.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamacare-adam-scott-comedy-video", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/476528231.jpg?itok=fXazTs1e", "title": "'Parks and Recreation' star pitches Obamacare in new comedy video", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Funnyordie.com joined the Affordable Care Act campaign yet again with a new video starring comedian Adam Scott."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-03-25T13:23:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "morganwhitaker", "tags": "affordable-care-act,media,society,the-cycle", "title": "'Parks and Recreation' star pitches Obamacare in new comedy video", "published": 1, "date": "03/25/2014 13:23:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamacare-adam-scott-comedy-video"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Funnyordie.com joined the Affordable Care Act campaign yet again with a new video starring comedian Adam Scott.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Society, Media, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd640\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you had health insurance this would be so straightforward,\u201d a crew member on set quips.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even say the word health insurance right now.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best time to say health insurance,\u201d he replies.\nThe healthcare.gov website saw a 40% increase in traffic the day after the video aired, according to a White House official.\nSome conservatives criticized the president for shooting the comedic interview, arguing the behavior was beneath the office of the president."}
