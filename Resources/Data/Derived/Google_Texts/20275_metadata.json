The study said that group\u2019s financial security dropped 8%, on average, since 2000. Security for those aged 35-54 fell 7% over the same period, and was down 4% for those aged 55-64.\n\nOnly those age 65 or older have seen their financial security hold steady or rise modestly, on average, since 2000. Greater prevalence of traditional pensions in that group may help explain the stability.\n\nThe study looked at nine aspects of financial health, clustered in three groups: cash flow determinants (income, debt, emergency savings), assets (investments, retirement accounts, homeownership), and insurance (health, disability, life). Researchers compared data for each age group in 2000 and again in 2014. They found security had fallen in every category other than health insurance\u2014and credited the Affordable Care Act for this one bright spot.\n\nOverwhelming Debt\n\nDebt was a key factor undercutting financial security for young Americans, the researchers found. About a quarter of Americans under 35 have debts in excess of 30% of their household income \u2014 a share that\u2019s risen 136% in two decades, the study found. Among college graduates aged 25-34, student debt has risen five-fold since 1995 to about $24,000.\n\nMany college graduates can handle the payments, and their degree puts them in a better position to earn more in the long term. But this debt forces them to delay savings and homeownership, in turn diminishing their long-term financial security.\n\nThe study also found that in every group under age 65, more Americans are living near or below the poverty line than in 2000.\n\nAnd fewer Americans have an IRA or workplace savings plan. That last point is critical because 70% of folks who aren\u2019t eligible for a workplace plan have no retirement plan of any kind. Even among those approaching retirement age and participating in a work-based plan, savings rates are slipping: Just 58% are contributing 10% of their pay, compared to 69% doing so in 2001.\n\nCrisis Ahead?\n\nTaken as a whole the study illustrates woeful retirement readiness, especially among the younger generation. And it emerges as Americans are giving scant attention to other retirement issues \u2014 including health and diet \u2014 even though they expect to live to 90 or longer.\n\nRemarkably, the vital issue of financial security is getting almost no airtime in the presidential debates. Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders has said he wants to make college free, and a number of candidates have plans to help students with their debts \u2014 which, ultimately, will improve the financial security of younger generations.\n\nBut there has been little discussion of Social Security, nor of how to get Americans to save more and secure enough lifetime income to sustain them through two or more decades after work.\n\nEvidently, that\u2019s much tougher than rhetorical bombast and empty promises.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "For every age group under 65, prospects for a financially sound retirement have diminished, a Stanford Center on Longevity study shows.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Debt is one big problem.", "title": "Retiring Rich Is Looking Less Likely for These Americans", "url": "http://time.com/money/4226396/retirement-crisis-millennials-gen-x-boomers/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/160218_ret_under65ret.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/160218_ret_under65ret.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Retiring Rich Is Looking Less Likely for These Americans", "description": "Debt is one big problem.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "MONEY"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "keywords": ", retirement", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "retirement, financial security, retirement plan, retirement planning, stanford, generations, millennials, boomers, gen x"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca90d\"", "article_summary": "That last point is critical because 70% of folks who aren\u2019t eligible for a workplace plan have no retirement plan of any kind.\nFor every age group under 65, the prospects for a financially sound retirement have diminished over the past 15 years, new research shows.\nOnly those age 65 or older have seen their financial security hold steady or rise modestly, on average, since 2000.\nRemarkably, the vital issue of financial security is getting almost no airtime in the presidential debates.\nResearchers compared data for each age group in 2000 and again in 2014."}
