Merisotis said, \u201cCollege degrees and other credentials are more important than ever, but times have changed, and the vast majority of employers in America put acquired skills far ahead of alma mater or major when it comes to hiring.\u201d\n\nThe poll findings are based on interviews with 623 United States business leaders conducted in November and December of 2013. The survey also includes information from interviews with 1,012 U.S. adult citizens.\n\nIn the news release, the Lumina Foundation presents five key findings:\n\nThe amount of knowledge a job candidate has is very important to the hiring decision, according to 84% of business leader respondents. On the other hand, only 9% said where a candidate attended school is an important factor in making the hiring decision. Also, only 28% said a person\u2019s major is very important.\n\nThere is a significant gap between what higher education officials think of themselves and what business leaders think of how they educate students. A recent Gallup poll found 96% of higher education officials said they are extremely or somewhat confident in how they prepare students. But this survey found only 11% of business leaders strongly agree that college students have the skills and competencies their business needs.\n\nAsked for their opinion on attaining a college degree, 74% of Americans agreed that a college degree is important to attaining a higher quality of life \u2013 and 90% at least somewhat agreed with that statement. Clearly, Americans still believe a postsecondary degree is the path to a better life.\n\nAmong the business leaders surveyed, 41% said they are somewhat likely to hire a person who attained a degree online over a person who attained the same degree at a traditional school.\n\nWhen asked what knowledge and skills schools should develop in business students, the most often mentioned area was internships and on the job, practical experience (14%); English and writing skills (12%); basic life skills and common sense (9%).\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Business leaders are looking for know-how and skills with their new employees rather than a degree from a prestigious school, a new Gallup poll has found.", "og": {"site_name": "Business Administration Information", "description": "Business leaders are looking for know-how and skills with their new employees rather than a degree from a prestigious school, a new Gallup poll has found.", "title": "What You Know Is More Important Than Where You Go to College, Survey Says - Business Administration Information", "url": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/news/what-you-know-is-more-important-than-where-you-go-to-college-survey-says", "image": "http://www.businessadministrationinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lumina-300x300.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1478982362392941}, "msvalidate.01": "E97402E8C75E1396BEAE2A02AE1A06E8", "google-site-verification": "-7d0XhlweD9ac6X0iGygOuxos-tqbyEAEVk9SXNyc-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "education, business, college degree, lumina foundation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5c2\"", "article_summary": "But this survey found only 11% of business leaders strongly agree that college students have the skills and competencies their business needs.\nAsked for their opinion on attaining a college degree, 74% of Americans agreed that a college degree is important to attaining a higher quality of life \u2013 and 90% at least somewhat agreed with that statement.\nThere is a significant gap between what higher education officials think of themselves and what business leaders think of how they educate students.\nOn the other hand, only 9% said where a candidate attended school is an important factor in making the hiring decision.\nBusiness leaders are looking for know-how and skills with their new employees rather than a degree from a prestigious school, a new Gallup poll has found."}
