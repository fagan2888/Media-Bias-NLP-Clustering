They were told the other gate was going in Three Mile Slough.\n\n\u0093At first they called it the \u0093Frank\u0092s Tract Project.\u0094 Then somewhere in 2008 or 2009 the temporary entry permits I was receiving had a new name on it called BDCP. These fellows at that time called them pipes. They didn\u0092t call them tunnels or a canal. They told us big pipes were going to come down from somewhere up north on the west side of the Delta and they were going under Bradford Island, then straight do the pumps.\n\n\u0093You can see that route if you go out there by looking at the transmission lines of PG&E and eyeballing it. If you go down to Orwood and Discovery bay you can see that coming across Twitchell Island and all the islands the state already owns. So the West False River barrier is not for the emergency drought,\u0094 she said.\n\nThe state has said the massive rock wall will block saltier water from getting deeper into the Delta during the drought when insufficient fresh water flows fail to force back the salt water.\n\n\u0093In 2009 we had gone to all the public and private meetings with land owners,\u0094 Mrs. Cunningham continued. \u0093We were told \u0091the Three Mile Slough barrier is a definite go but you\u0092re off the hook for now. But it is guaranteed that we will be back.\u0092\n\n\u0093And here they are \u0097 they figured the drought was a good opportunity to slam in the West False River barrier and get the permanent part in with the two metal abutments on each side of the rock barrier. The barrier is 750\u0092 wide and 150\u0092 of that on each side is the permanent abutment. It\u0092s in the exact spot they talked about in 2008.\u0094\n\nMrs. Cunningham said she asked back then, \u0093Why do you need these gates? Why does there need to be a gate in Three Mile Slough and a gate in False River?\u0094\n\n\u0093Because these big pipes are going in and they will take so much fresh water that the salt will come up,\u0094 she said the DWR representatives told the them. \u0093These gates have to be in place first.\u0094\n\n\u0093So these gates are not a gate?\u0094 asked Phyllis Dutra, a North Delta CARES member in the audience.\n\n\u0093When they pull this barrier out, within a couple of years, it will morph into a permanent gate,\u0094 said Mrs. Cunningham.\n\n\u0093That is the permanent part,\u0094 added Anna Swenson, a North Delta CARES advocate who had just visited the barrier earlier the same day. \u0093This is what they will hang the gate on.\u0094\n\n\u0093But weren\u0092t these supposed to be just three times in 10 years?\u0094 asked Clarksburg resident Mary McTaggart, referring to a one time DWR proposal.\n\n\u0093No, no \u0097 at our reclamation meeting the engineers said, \u0091We\u0092re not going to do that 10 year thing anymore.\u0092 They\u0092ve got this part in so why do they have to keep pulling it out and putting it back in?\u0094\n\nThe cost of putting in the barrier and them clawing it out adds up -- about $40 million with $10 million to just take out the rocks and store them in Rio Vista.\n\n\u0093This was a huge water right in the Delta,\u0094 continued Mrs. Cunningham, with the 150\u0092 taken from both sides. \u0093It is the biggest barrier ever put in the Delta. It is a major, major waterway for boaters. Why wouldn\u0092t they put boat passage in?\u0094\n\n\u0093What will be the benefit of the Three Mile Slough gate then?\u0094 asked Mrs. McTaggart.\n\n\u0093It is a diversion,\u0094 said Mrs. Cunningham, adding, \u0093It will only be effective with the West False River gate with two gates. The DWR representatives told us when they get the pipes in and suck out the fresh water, it (the two barriers) will stop the salt intrusion.\n\n\u0093I went to the Bradford Reclamation District meeting when the state was purchasing the easement from the district on the Bradford Island side,\u0094 said Mrs. Swenson. \u0093At that point Jacob L. McQuirk, an engineer for DWR, made the assertion that he had spoken to the farmers of the North Delta and gotten verbal permission to have easements on any property that they needed to put in the barriers.\n\n\u0093I told them that was not true. He cited one farmer he had met with was a Mr. Wilson. So I called Mark Wilson and asked him if he had met with DWR and we figured out Mr. McQuirk had met with Daniel Wilson. That afternoon was the first contact Mr. McQuirk had ever made with the North Delta farmers about the barrier.\n\nMr. McQuirk added, \u0093I guess we\u0092ve got to ID who the landowners are, then pressured the Bradford Reclamation district into doing this easement right, making them think the North Delta had already signed on. But that wasn\u0092t true.\u0094\n\nMrs. Swenson said the DWR negotiator Mr. McQuirk walked into the meeting thinking that the land was owned by a landowner who had signed a use permit in 2009 but it expired in 2011. \u0093That guy no longer even owned the land anymore,\u0094 she said.\n\n\u0093They were using an old Temporary Entry Permit that this guy signed,\u0094 Mrs. Cunningham said. \u0093There were a few who signed it for about $500 for permission to get on their land to survey it.\u0094\n\n\u0093The DWR started the bizarre negotiation on the encroachment for $1,600,\u0094 said Mrs. Swenson. \u0093The reclamation district said we want our own evaluation of how much for the easement. Then the DWR said the state would offer $5,000 to go get their own easement and told them to take five grand plus $1,600 and it\u0092s a deal right now. The reclamation district felt they didn\u0092t have a choice. It was an agreement with their arms tied behind their back.\u0094\n\n\u0093I think that\u0092s exactly right,\u0094 added Rogene Reynolds, a South Delta advocate in the audience.\n\nThen why did the reclamation district sign any document to give DWR the needed right of way encroachment?\n\n\u0093It\u0092s not that there wasn\u0092t a choice,\u0094 Cate Kuhne, president of Bradford Island Reclamation District #2059, said by phone from her home on June 6. \u0093When you\u0092re looking at a situation like the barrier, after the governor made the emergency proclamation, is the District going to fight the proclamation?\n\n\u0093It was a matter of dealing with the encroachment and the state wanted a natural easement,\u0094 continued Mrs. Kuhne. \u0093We required them to purchase an easement.\u0094\n\nMore history of \u0093The Plan\u0094 from Mrs. Kuhne\n\n\u0093There were three scenarios proposed,\u0094 she continued.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Kuhne:\n\n\u0095 They wanted to put in gates in West False River and Three Mile Slough but that was put on hold in 2007.\n\n\u0095 Their report came out with fully closed barriers on the first one.\n\n\u0095 The second one would be 20 percent closed on both sides.\n\n\u0095 The third alternative would be a tide-operated barrier closed 12 hours a day but would still allow boats to go through.\n\n\u0095 With the 20 percent barrier, the velocity was so much it wasn\u0092t safe for boats. With the fully closed barrier, the velocity increased 10 times.\n\nThen the DWR focused on two other projects that were named the Two Gates Model near Discovery Bay that got scrapped. The Army Corps of Engineers also had a project using Little Frank\u0092s Tract that got put back on the table and last June the Delta Stewardship Council began to rework it.\n\n\u0093The West False River barrier is using funds that were originally allocated for the original Frank\u0092s Tract Project,\u0094 said Mrs. Kuhne. \u0093Now the state is in a bad position.\u0094\n\nShe said the state is currently out of compliance on their original agreement and cited the negative impact on the Victoria II ferryboat that serves the Bradford Island to Jersey Island areas. The non-cable ferryboat has had great difficulty navigating their normal route between the islands since the barrier was installed, she said.\n\nOn the DWR\u0092s website, here\u0092s what it says about Frank\u0092s Tract Project:\n\n\u0093The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) propose to implement the Franks Tract Project to improve water quality and fisheries conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). DWR and Reclamation are evaluating installing operable gates to control the flow of water at key locations (Three mile Slough and/or West False River) to reduce seawater intrusion, and to positively influence movement of fish species of concern to areas that provide favorable habitat conditions. By protecting fish resources, this project also would improve operational reliability of the State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) because curtailments in water exports (pumping restrictions) are likely to be less frequent.\n\n\u0093The project gates would be operated seasonally and during certain hours of the day, depending on fisheries and tidal conditions. Boat passage facilities would be included to allow for passing of watercraft when the gates are in operation. The Franks Tract Project is consistent with ongoing planning efforts for the Delta to help balance competing uses and create a more sustainable system for the future. Preparation of a joint environmental impact report/environmental impact statement (EIR/EIS) for the project is underway, and public input is strongly encouraged.\u0094\n\nAt the very bottom, it says,\n\nAnticipated Project Schedule\n\n\u0093The Franks Tract Project has been delayed.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California, Central Valley, business, San Joaquin Valley, Great Central Valley, news, urban sprawl, rural, real estate, housing, farming, dairy, agribusiness, cotton, oil, gasoline, ethanol, biodiesel, alternative fuels, prices, Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Stockton, Modesto, Merced, Visalia, Portervile, Bakersfield, Schwarzenegger", "distribution": "global", "description": "Central Valley Business Times.
