Definition of person and child

What it asks: "Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado Constitution protecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining 'person' and 'child' in the Colorado Criminal Code and the Colorado Wrongful Death Act to include unborn human beings?"

What it means: Passage of the measure would mean the inclusion of unborn human beings in the Colorado Criminal Code and the state's Wrongful Death Act.

What supporters say: Personhood Colorado has said that this measure differs from past ballot measures that failed in in 2008 and 2010, in that it focuses only on including fetuses in the Colorado Criminal Code and Colorado Wrongful Death Act â€” instead of changing the definition of personhood in all areas of law. They claim the measure only seeks to protect pregnant women from violent assault and is similar to laws already on the books in more than 30 states across the country.

What opponents say: The measure is seen by opponents as a way to stop all abortions and imperil the storage or destruction of eggs for in vitro fertilization. They claim that it portends more government intrusion into personal lives, dictating the kinds of birth control people can use, and interfering with medical decisions made by women with their doctors in treating fertility problems. Any pregnancy not ending in a live birth opponents fear, could trigger a criminal investigation.
