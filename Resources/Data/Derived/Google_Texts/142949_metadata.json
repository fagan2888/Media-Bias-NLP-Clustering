In 2011, Colorado\u2019s uninsured rate reached a high of 15.8 percent, or 829,000 peole without insurance.\n\nIn Region 12 \u2014 which includes Summit, Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield and Grand counties \u2014 the uninsured rate is now 11.7 percent, down from 19.4 percent in 2013.\n\nThe region\u2019s new rate is the second-highest in the state, behind Region 11, which includes Jackson, Routt, Moffat and Rio Blanco.\n\nFunded by The Colorado Trust and administered by the Colorado Health Institute, the survey provides the first in-depth look at the record-breaking impact of the Affordable Care Act. The new findings track the full implementation of the health reform law in the state.\n\nThe law has affected populations unequally. Only 2.5 percent of children under 19 remain uninsured, down from 7 percent in 2013, and the uninsured rate for those earning at or below 300 percent of the federal poverty level fell to 8.3 percent from 20.5 percent.\n\nHispanics continue to be the most disproportionately uninsured, and the Western Slope, especially northwestern Colorado, still struggles with the highest uninsured rates.\n\nHealth care is still unaffordable for many, the study notes. The percentage of residents who didn\u2019t see a doctor because it cost too much declined only slightly.\n\nFor more information, visit coloradohealthinstitute.org.\n\nSmall business owners invited to Frisco health-insurance workshop\n\nElevate CoSpace will host a free workshop on Monday, Sept. 14, on small business health-insurance solutions.\n\nAttendees will be provided information on the Connect for Health Colorado SHOP program, IRS tax credits, fall open-enrollment options and solutions for business owners with discontinued plans or insurers that have terminated coverage.\n\nSpeakers will include Patti Meyer, Connect For Health Colorado\u2019s small business market manager, Beth Casey, with InTandem Human Resources, and Stacey Gilbert, Denver Tech Insurance employee benefits consultant.\n\nThe limited-space, educational event is for qualified small businesses with two or more W-2 employees.
