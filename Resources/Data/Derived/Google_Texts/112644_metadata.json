Jonathan Blum, a top Medicare official, cited the \u201chistorically low growth in Medicare per capita spending\u201d as a reason for the proposal.\n\nBut Republicans said beneficiaries would suffer as a result of the cuts, which they traced to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s seniors are feeling the brunt of Obamacare\u2019s tax increases and cuts to Medicare,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, \u201cMillions of seniors who rely on the Medicare Advantage program will lose the plans, benefits, doctors and financial protection they currently have.\u201d\n\nFederal payments to managed-care organizations, known as Medicare Advantage plans, are based on a complicated formula that reflects how much it costs to care for Medicare beneficiaries, and those costs have been growing much more slowly than in the past. Experts often focus on the benchmarks used to calculate changes in Medicare payments to private plans. The administration proposed to reduce these benchmarks by 1.9 percent in 2015. Other factors in the formula will deepen the cuts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawmakers from both parties had urged the White House to avoid any cuts, even though the reductions in payment were explicitly authorized by the 2010 health care law.\n\nThe announcement late Friday is likely to reverberate on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill, where insurers, employers and beneficiaries plan to lobby against the cuts. That effort was so intense last year that the Obama administration reversed itself, scrapped plans for a cut and increased rates instead.\n\nKaren M. Ignagni, the president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said, \u201cThe proposed Medicare Advantage cuts would cause seniors in the program to lose benefits and choices\u201d and could lead to higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries \u2014 arguments rejected by the administration.\n\nEnrollment in private Medicare Advantage plans, offered by companies like UnitedHealth, Humana and Kaiser Permanente, has more than doubled since 2006. About 15 million people \u2014 29 percent of the 52 million Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 are now in such plans.\n\nA bipartisan group of 19 Democrats and 21 Republicans in the Senate sent a letter last week urging the administration to keep payments at current levels.\n\nPeople in the private plans \u201cenjoy better health outcomes and receive higher quality care than their counterparts\u201d in traditional Medicare, said the letter, drafted by Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, and Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho.\n\nThe campaign committee for House Republicans unleashed an attack on Friday that is likely to be echoed in many of this year\u2019s congressional races. Older Americans, it said, will feel the pain because President Obama and his allies in Congress are \u201craiding Medicare Advantage to pay for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBefore Congress passed the health care law, independent experts said the government was spending more for patients in the Medicare Advantage program than it was for similar patients enrolled in traditional Medicare. Mr. Obama said private insurers were \u201covercharging massively\u201d for the care they provided to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn issuing its proposal on Friday, the administration said it was continuing its effort to \u201creduce overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans.\u201d\n\nThe federal health care law squeezed substantial savings out of Medicare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and the money will help offset the cost of subsidizing coverage for people who were uninsured.\n\nDemocrats say the Republican attacks are potentially powerful, but disingenuous.\n\n\u201cRepublicans\u2019 false attacks on Medicare aren\u2019t surprising, since they have sought from Day 1 to dismantle it,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nBudget blueprints developed in recent years by House Republicans, including Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, retained Medicare savings enacted as part of the health care law. In addition, Democrats say, Republicans have proposed changes in Medicare that could put older Americans at even greater risk, giving each beneficiary a fixed amount of federal money to spend on either private insurance or traditional Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140221220908, "twitter": {"description": "An Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare payment rates for managed care plans was met with resistance by Republicans, who said beneficiaries would suffer.", "title": "U.S. Proposes Cuts to Rates in Medicare Payments", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/politics/us-proposes-cuts-to-rates-in-medicare-payments.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002728122"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/politics/us-proposes-cuts-to-rates-in-medicare-payments.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002728122", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/politics/us-proposes-cuts-to-rates-in-medicare-payments.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "U.S. Proposes Cuts to Rates in Payments for Medicare", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 21, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Medicare,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Republican Party,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),House of Representatives,Senate", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "An Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare payment rates for managed care plans was met with resistance by Republicans, who said beneficiaries would suffer.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "An Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare payment rates for managed care plans was met with resistance by Republicans, who said beneficiaries would suffer.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-03-31", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Senate", "published": "2014-02-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "22medicare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140331154603, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/politics/us-proposes-cuts-to-rates-in-medicare-payments.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "An Obama administration proposal to reduce Medicare payment rates for managed care plans was met with resistance by Republicans, who said beneficiaries would suffer.", "title": "U.S. Proposes Cuts to Rates in Medicare Payments"}, "pdate": 20140221, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000002728122, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "U.S. Proposes Cuts to Rates in Medicare Payments", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ce7\"", "article_summary": "Enrollment in private Medicare Advantage plans, offered by companies like UnitedHealth, Humana and Kaiser Permanente, has more than doubled since 2006.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s seniors are feeling the brunt of Obamacare\u2019s tax increases and cuts to Medicare,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.\nAbout 15 million people \u2014 29 percent of the 52 million Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 are now in such plans.\nMr. Obama said private insurers were \u201covercharging massively\u201d for the care they provided to Medicare beneficiaries.\nJonathan Blum, a top Medicare official, cited the \u201chistorically low growth in Medicare per capita spending\u201d as a reason for the proposal."}
