John Cornyn is the solo guest on this week's \"Houston Newsmakers with Khambrel Marshall\" and weighs in on a number of topics, including what should be done in the wake of nine church members being slain during Bible study in their South Carolina church.\n\nCornyn said it is important for the country not to be incited by the actions of a disturbed young man. He also said tighter gun restrictions is not the answer to help keep these types of incidents from happening.\n\n\"Passing an additional law or restriction I don't think would have prevented this,\" he said. \"But I think we need to operate on the basis of the facts and not on the basis of ideology.\"\n\nCornyn says identifying people with mental illness is a better avenue.\n\nThe Supreme Court will soon decide if gay marriage will be legal in the United States. Cornyn makes clear that he believes marriage is between a man and a woman and says while the Supreme Court is deciding this question he believes it is wrong for them to do so.\n\n\"I think it should be decided at the state level by the voters in those states and not by unelected judges who mandate it for us,\" he said.\n\nAlso discussed this week with Cornyn:\n\nThe upcoming Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Republican roster running for president\n\nThe human trafficking law he helped pass\n\nThe biggest issues facing Congress\n\nAnd much more on \"Houston Newsmakers\" this Sunday and every Sunday Morning at 10 a.m. right after \"Meet the Press\" on KPRC Channel 2.\n\nMore Information:\n\nU.S. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, 713-572-3337, www.cornyn.senate.gov\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 by Click2Houston.com.
