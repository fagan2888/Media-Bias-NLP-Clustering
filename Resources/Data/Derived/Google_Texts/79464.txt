Denver residents can expect chilly but not extremely cold temperatures as the year ends and 2016 begins.

“We’re not going to warm up any time soon,” said Kyle Fredin, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder. “The cold air came in and there’s nothing to push it out.”

The low temperature so far Monday morning was 4 degrees at Denver International Airport.

Taking into account wind chill, it felt like zero degrees.

Although that’s cold, it won’t be threatening the record low of -12 degrees, Fredin said.

The temperature will warm up to the high 20s Monday, which is pretty much what can be expected every day through New Year’s Day, he said.

The normal high temperature for this time of the year is 43 degrees, Fredin said.

The high temperature for the Front Range will hover just below freezing in the high 20s and low 30s until Saturday and Sunday, when temperatures could climb to the high 30s, Fredin said.

A storm on Wednesday will bring a chance of snow in the mountains. But little snow is expected in the high country.
