The new plan increases that to those living at 110 percent below the poverty rate.\n\nCommissioners also approved a second recommendation to begin including mental health services for outpatients in the system, which served 13,000 people in fiscal year 2015.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very conservative time for 25 years, and we think our time is now,\u201dsaid Dr. John Curran, chairman of the county\u2019s health care advisory board.\n\nThe changes would add another 6,000 people to the rolls over time, officials said.\n\nCommissioner Victor Crist applauded the proposal to increase access for mental health care, saying it will lead to indirect savings to the county on a number of fronts.\n\n\u201cOther communities have successfully found reduction in crime, reduction in domestic violence, improvement in workforce and productivity, job retention, and the list goes on,\u201d Crist said.\n\n\u201cThis is a real safety net for the working poor,\u201d said Commissioner Sandy Murman, who introduced the measure to the board. \u201cWe thought when the Affordable Care Act was established by the president that it would take care of all the heath care needs in this category. Well, guess what? It didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe added that the state of Florida\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid in recent years is another factor in its increased relevance. The federal poverty rate for a family of four in 2016 is $24,250, a figure that Murman says \u201cjust doesn\u2019t make it.\u201d She said ideally the program could expand to serve people at 138 percent below the federal poverty rate, but officials say that would be too costly for the program. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Gene Earley, Health Care Services Director for the county. \u201cIt would bankrupt the plan.\u201d\n\nMurman said that she\u2019d ultimately like to rename the plan after the late Phyllis Busansky. She was the former county commissioner who spearheaded the creation of county\u2019s health care program for the poor. Busansky passed away while serving as Supervisor of Elections in 2009.\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "john curran, phyllis busansky, sandy murman, victor crist", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.1.6 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "SaintPetersBlog", "description": "Hillsborough County Commissioners voted on Wednesday to expand the pool of citizens who can be eligible for their indigent health \u2026", "title": "Hillsborough County to expand eligibility for its health care program - SaintPetersBlog", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1698, "identifier": "http://saintpetersblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/your-medical-team.jpg", "height": 1131}, "updated_time": "2016-03-23T14:20:47-04:00", "url": "http://saintpetersblog.com/hillsborough-county-expand-pool-people-get/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 2500, "app_id": 593344034036788}, "theme-color": "#081341", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SaintPetersblog", "section": "The Bay and the 'Burg", "tag": "Victor Crist", "published_time": "2016-03-23T14:12:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T14:20:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She was the former county commissioner who spearheaded the creation of county\u2019s health care program for the poor.\nHillsborough County Commissioners voted on Wednesday to expand the pool of citizens who can be eligible for their indigent health care plan.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Gene Earley, Health Care Services Director for the county.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very conservative time for 25 years, and we think our time is now,\u201dsaid Dr. John Curran, chairman of the county\u2019s health care advisory board.\nSince it\u2019s in existence in 1991, the program has served uninsured adults living at 100 percent below the federal poverty rate."}
