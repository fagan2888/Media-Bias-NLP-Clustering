Paying for it is another. (Flickr/CC)\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably heard that 7.1 million people have signed up for coverage in Obamacare\u2019s health insurance marketplaces. That doesn\u2019t tell us the actual enrollment number, though, because people need to pay their premium to officially get coverage.\n\nThere are a few numbers out there about how many have actually paid their premium. It\u2019s generally either 80 percent, 85 percent or 90 percent of those signing up.\n\nThe question matters for us to truly know how many people enrolled, whether it\u2019s actually 7 million or more like 5-6 million. As I wrote the other day, the total enrollment number doesn\u2019t hold that much meaning for the future success of the Obamacare exchanges. Enrollment in the marketplaces was already expected to start slow and then ramp up in the program\u2019s first few years. The mix of enrollees \u2013 how healthy they are \u2013 matters much more.\n\nBut the question remains: Why go through all the trouble of signing up for Obamacare coverage, only to decide otherwise?\n\nKaiser Family Foundation insurance expert Larry Levitt offered some ideas on Twitter this afternoon (h/t to Huffington Post health reporter Jeffrey Young for compiling):\n\nSomeone might have also pursued off-exchange coverage\n\nAn offer of employment insurance after signing up\n\nDecided it wasn\u2019t affordable\n\nNo browsing function for health plans in HealthCare.gov\u2019s early days\n\nThe way the process is divided between the exchange and the insurer\n\nPeople may still eventually pay the premium\n\nA report out of California on Wednesday suggested people might sign up and then not finish enrollment because they got coverage elsewhere. Twenty percent are expected to leave the California exchange because they got new insurance through their job, while another 20 percent in the exchange will become eligible for the state's Medicaid program because their income drops, according to U.C. Berkeley Labor Center researchers.\n\nAnother thing worth noting: The numbers out there now about who paid don't account for the late enrollment surge just before the March 31 deadline, or those who are still trying to sign up after experiencing technical problems. Are these late-comers more likely to pay their premiums?\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s a guessing game. The head of Minnesota\u2019s exchange, Scott Leitz, told a Congressional oversight panel today that 95 percent of exchange signups have paid, and he expects that number to grow higher. The 95 percent rate is for people who had coverage starting Jan. 1 and Feb. 1, Minnesota exchange spokesman Joe Campbell told me.\n\nSo why does Leitz think that number will grow higher?\n\n\u201cPast experience has shown us \u2013 by having one of the lowest uninsured rates in the nation prior to the enactment of the ACA \u2013 people in Minnesota want to be insured,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt was an opinion, not a prediction.\u201d\n\nKaiser\u2019s Levitt said it\u2019s hard to predict whether those signing up close to the deadline are more motivated to pay their premium.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, you would expect the last-minute enrollees to be highly likely to pay. They made a conscious decision to sign up and in some cases had to overcome barriers like long lines at community assistance centers to enroll,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, these late enrollers include procrastinators and people who were less motivated than the early adopters, so one could imagine that some would be less likely to pay.\u201d\n\nInsurance industry consultant Bob Laszewski said he thinks those signing up during the late surge are less likely to pay.\n\n\u201cThese are people less likely to need coverage \u2013 that\u2019s why they waited,\u201d he said. \u201cSome were people that outreach \u2018sold\u2019 and more likely to not pay a bill that comes three weeks later.\u201d\n\nJoel Ario, the original director of the Obama administration\u2019s exchange office, is more optimistic that the rate of those paying for coverage will increase. For one, \u201cNever underestimate people\u2019s ability to procrastinate on anything,\u201d Ario said.\n\nOne thing that could encourage more people to complete their enrollment, he said, is better coordinating the hand-off between the exchanges and the insurers selling on them. Right now, the process is split \u2013 people sign up through the exchange, their information is delivered to the insurer, and then the insurer deals with the customer separately.\n\n\u201cThe carriers are going to improve,\u201d he said. \u201cThe exchanges are going to improve.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated with the correct name of the U.C.
