The Gilardis are Roman Catholic and said that complying with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate would require them to violate deeply held religious beliefs.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington in March 2013 ruled against the Gilardis, saying that he couldn\u2019t allow a corporation to assert the religious beliefs of individuals. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed part of Sullivan\u2019s decision, and the ruling was put on hold pending the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nIn addition to carving a hole in the law, the Hobby Lobby ruling marked an expansion of corporate rights, allowing companies, like people, to claim religious freedom under federal law.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, the D.C. Circuit is the first court of appeals to apply Hobby Lobby in a remanded HHS mandate case,\u201d said Adele Keim, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington-based, nonprofit religion advocacy group which represented Hobby Lobby in its legal challenge.\n\nToday\u2019s order sends the Freshway case back to Sullivan with instructions to issue an order granting an exemption and to consider whether to extend it to the Gilardis.\n\nThe case is Gilardi v. HHS, 13-cv-00104, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n\nCopyright 2016 Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Fresh Unlimited Inc. won't have to provide contraceptive coverage for its employees under the Obama administration's healthcare reform law, in what may be", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "Fresh Unlimited Inc. won't have to provide contraceptive coverage for its employees under the Obama administration's healthcare reform law, in what may be", "title": "Food Company Wins Religious Exemption from Contraception Benefit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2014-08-11T06:37:14-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/08/11/337211.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fresh Unlimited Inc. won't have to provide contraceptive coverage for its employees under the Obama administration's healthcare reform law, in what may be", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "title": "Food Company Wins Religious Exemption from Contraception Benefit", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2014-08-11", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "Supreme Court birth control", "published_time": "2014-08-11T06:30:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-11T06:37:14-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "The case is Gilardi v.
