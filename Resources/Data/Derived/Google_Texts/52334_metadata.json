Clinically known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder, a disorder found primarily in women. Doctors. and researchers are trying to help better relationships by allowing women to take part in a new progressive test drug. The drug is meant to help with the failing libido plaguing the female population. HSDD may be zapping sexual desires out of relationships, but researchers are doing everything they can to zap it right back in!\n\nStudies elude that hypoactive sexual desire disorder, better known as HSDD, is more chemical, mental, and/or emotional for women, unlike male impotency that is (more often than not) simply physical. HSDD can affect women at any age at any point in their life. PubMed says that the sexual disorder affects one-third of women in the United States, while the Society of Women\u2019s Health Research states that the condition will affect one in every 10 women throughout their lifetime.\n\nAside from causing the obviously tense situation with one\u2019s partner in the bedroom, other effects that may occur are allegedly similar to the effects caused by depression. Researchers state that women who suffer from HSDD tend to take on an emotional irregularity that is directly linked to the joy, or lack thereof, of a relationship, causing severe contentions between the couple. The diminishing of sexual desire as a result of hypoactive sexual desire disorder cause for women to take on a personal distress. This known fact is key in the consideration of one actually having the disorder. Although a woman\u2019s sex drive is known to fluctuate throughout her lifetime, especially if she is pregnant or experiencing menopause, it is the personal distress that may be an indicator for HSDD.\n\nWomen whose sex drives are low and whose attitudes do not seem to be bothered in any particular way are not considered women who have to be concerned with being diagnosed. In any case, these gradually increasing contentions among couples may very well be a result of HSDD zapping the desire for sex out of relationships and bedrooms, however, they are not to be considered the end of the world and certainly not the end of a relationship or one\u2019s sanity.\n\nWith an alarming number of women suffering the disorder, Reconnect Study has put into place an experimental drug that can possibly curb the disorder\u2019s effects. Currently seeking out participants, the drug, unnamed, is being promoted on their landing page as a \u201ctake as needed\u201d type of medication. According to the site\u2019s questions and information, there are two levels of qualification for the study. A pre-qualification survey following an interview process. The survey portion asks all the predictable questions about recent health, medical history, and gender (which is questionable considering the study is supposedly for women). Other questions include whether or not the candidate is currently in a relationship, whether they would be open to being on birth control, and also if said candidate would be willing to have sexual interaction with their partner at least once a month. With a question such as that, it is understandable how HSDD can put a damper on a partnership. More specifically, any bedroom action.\n\nResearchers are making it exponentially clear that HSDD, though stressful to deal with, is not a life-threatening or untreatable condition. As long as women can discover the causation of their HSDD, doctors say there are ways (quite possibly with this new-found experimental drug) for women to deal with the disorder. With this test medication for women to sort out sexual desires being zapped out of relationships due to HSDD, many women are probably wondering, \u201cNow, when are they going to create a pill that makes men put the toilet seat down?\u201d\n\nBy Danyol Jaye\n\nSources:\n\nReconnect Study- Missing Your Desire?\n\nSex Health Matters- Overview- HSDD\n\nPubMed- Female Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment\n\nFeature Photo Courtesy of Vic- Vic\u2019s Flickr Page- Creative Commons License\n\nInline Photo Courtesy of Skedonk- Skedonk\u2019s Flickr Page- Creative Commons License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "HSDD has, in recent years, become the silent killer to a plethora of relationships.
