The Farnborough Air Show in England alternates with Paris each year to host the biggest names in the world of aerospace.\n\nOver the course of this week, more than 200,000 people are expected to attend the show, about half of them industry professionals. About 1,500 companies will exhibit their wares, and they\u2019re expecting business. At the last show in 2012, $72 billion worth of orders were announced.\n\nFlanagan Industries in Glastonbury, a 68-year-old family owned business, will be there. It makes cases for aerospace turbines. Kevin Flanagan said that having a presence is invaluable. \"As Pratt and GE, for instance, develop new engines, they take on partners all around the world \u2014 risk and revenue sharing partners \u2014 because of the billion-dollar-plus cost to develop new engines,\" he told WNPR. \"So it\u2019s up to companies such as ours to, you know, you can complain about work going overseas or you can get off your butt and go across the pond and chase it back.\u201d\n\nFlanagan Industries is small: just 100 employees, but this is its ninth time at the European air shows. It\u2019s one of ten smaller companies that are able to attend the show this year as part of the Connecticut pavilion, organized by the Department of Economic and Community Development and by the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology.\n\n\"From a machining side, a company that produces parts for the engine makers,\" said Flanagan, \"it\u2019s a way for us to have a presence at these shows and meet our European customers \u2014 within a one-week time to meet all of our current and potential customers without having to travel all over the world to meet with them.\"\n\nFor one big Connecticut company, some questions remain. Pratt and Whitney is still hoping that the F35 Joint Strike Fighter can be one of the principal attractions at the show. It's waiting to hear if the Department of Defense will lift a grounding order on the aircraft imposed in the wake of an engine fire last month.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "description": "Connecticut aerospace companies are front and center at the world\u2019s largest air show on Monday.
