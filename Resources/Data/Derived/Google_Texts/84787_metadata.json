Bobby Jindal isn\u2019t leading in the polls like Scott Walker. He hasn\u2019t raised as much money as Jeb Bush. He isn\u2019t as celebrated a speaker as Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. He doesn\u2019t have a loyal libertarian following like Rand Paul or an evangelical base like Mike Huckabee.\n\nIf Jindal plays his cards right, however, he could wind up getting the Republican Party to think more seriously about Obamacare.\n\nYes, Jindal\u2019s lines about radical Islam and assimilation tend to get the most media coverage. But Jindal is at the center of an ongoing internal GOP struggle over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEvery Republican politician says they want to get rid of Obamcare. Some are even willing to risk a government shutdown to try to defund it. But the GOP\u2019s whole message has long been \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are deeply divided on the question of how to replace Obamacare, and the truth is some don\u2019t really care to repeal it. (RELATED: The Blueprint For Ending Obamacare)\n\nJindal brought this debate to the stage of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a D.C.-area event billed as the nation\u2019s largest gathering of conservative activists.\n\n\u201cWe must repeal every single word of Obamacare,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cAll of it. It was built on broken promises.\u201d\n\nPretty standard stuff \u2014 until you get to his criticism of fellow Republicans. \u201cRepublicans are about to wave the white flag of surrender on Obamacare, and I\u2019m here to tell them, we won\u2019t stand for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time for them to govern the way they campaigned and get rid of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t remember during those campaign ads last November, I don\u2019t remember them saying we\u2019re just going to repeal the easy parts of Obamacare,\u201d Jindal said, continuing to twist the knife. \u201cThis election wasn\u2019t about getting a nicer office for Sen. Mitch McConnell, it wasn\u2019t about keeping a bigger office for Speaker John Boehner, this election was about taking our country back and it starts by repealing Obamacare.\u201d\n\nJindal has a point. Many times, Republicans will say they want to repeal Obamacare but keep the ban on denying applicants with preexisting conditions. Or the part where you can stay on your parents\u2019 health insurance until you are 26. Or the Medicaid expansion. Or maybe even the Obamacare premium subsidies.\n\nWhen Mitch McConnell debated his Democratic challenger last year, he implied that Kentucky should keep its health care exchange after Obamacare is repealed.\n\n\u201c[C]onservatives need to focus on truly conservative health reforms \u2014 and not merely a slightly-less-liberal plan,\u201d Jindal wrote in a letter to Congress earlier this month.\n\nSo what\u2019s Jindal\u2019s plan? He would fully repeal Obamacare, including popular provisions like the preexisting conditions ban. Instead he\u2019d give the states $100 billion to try to design health care programs that will cover riskier patients.\n\nJindal would scrap the employer tax preference and allow individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars. He would cap Medicaid spending, move toward Paul Ryan\u2019s premium support model for Medicare and allow the sale of health insurance across state lines.\n\nThe goal would be to build a genuine free market in health care, focused on cutting costs first. Jindal and his supporters argue that this is better than getting in a bidding war with the Democrats over how many people will be covered, a contest in which the Republicans can always be outspent.\n\nJindal\u2019s plan has an obvious drawback: it would be disruptive to existing health care arrangements, failing the \u201cif you like your plan/doctor, you can keep your plan/doctor\u201d test responsible for much of the backlash against Obamacare. (Jindal argues that this is not the case, but there are good reasons to think otherwise.)\n\nIf Jindal\u2019s Obamacare alternative doesn\u2019t cover as many people and doesn\u2019t offer deductions big enough to replace the lost subsidies, that could create powerful obstacles to the health care law ever actually being repealed.\n\nHow competitive should Republican replacement plans be with Obamacare on coverage? That\u2019s a key question in the conservative health care debate.\n\nThe upcoming Supreme Court case that has could cost millions their subsidies has finally gotten Republicans thinking about these questions. Jindal is taking the next step and representing the party\u2019s right flank.\n\nW.
