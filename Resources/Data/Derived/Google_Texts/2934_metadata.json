When Republicans say they can\u2019t do immigration reform because they don\u2019t trust Obama, what\u2019s that about? \u2014 Blake Hounshell (@blakehounshell) February 7, 2014\n\nThe short answer \u2014 this week \u2014 is this, from the Washington Post:\n\nThe Obama administration is considering an extension of the president\u2019s decision to let people keep their individual insurance policies even if they are not compliant with the health care overhaul, industry and government officials said Thursday. Avalere Health CEO Dan Mendelson said Thursday that the administration may let policyholders keep that coverage for as long as an additional three years, stressing that no decision has been made.

And make no mistake: that is what the Obama administration is considering doing once again \u2013 usurping the power of Congress and rewriting the rules on its own.

That is because it does not change the law on the books. Rather, the feds are simply signaling that they will not enforce certain provisions for some time. But many parts of Obamacare do have to be applied by states, the traditional front lines of insurance regulation. States, however, lack \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d when it comes to ignoring federal law, even when the president thinks it would be a good idea. As the president has often reminded us, the ACA is \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d and remains so after the fix. The Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause makes federal law\u2014not presidential policies\u2014 binding on the states. So what\u2019s a state insurance commissioner to do? Federal law requires health plans to have a mandatory level of \u201cminimum coverage.\u201d Thus it is not clear how a state insurance commissioner can authorize a plan that violates federal law.
