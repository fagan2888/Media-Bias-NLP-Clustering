I love my job.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichaud outlined the main points of his platform to a crowd of about 30 people gathered outside town hall.\n\n\n\nThese include increasing small businesses, especially family farms, reducing reliance on fuel for energy, expanding access to MaineCare for citizens denied insurance by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nGranting health insurance to the 70,000 Mainers who don\u2019t qualify under the ACA is a \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d move that will save $600 million over 10 years, based on \u201cenhanced reimbursables\u201d available under the ACA, Michaud said. He noted that 3,000 Maine veterans are among those who fall within the gap between qualifying for MaineCare and for insurance under the ACA. This spring, Governor Paul LePage vetoed legislation to expand MaineCare.\n\n\n\nMichaud pointed to farming as one way of expanding small businesses in Maine.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmall business is the backbone of Maine\u2019s economy,\u201d he said, and Maine has the highest number of young farmers, per capita, in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why Maine could not be the food basket for New England,\u201d he said, through increasing farming and processing facilities throughout the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cGreen\u201d energy, whether from wind, solar and offshore tidal power, can reduce Maine\u2019s dependence on heating oil by 50 percent over the next 15 years. Maine is a leader in wind and tidal energy, Michaud said, and was the \u201cfirst state in the country to be hooked up to the [tidal energy] grid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPart of my vision is to focus on Maine\u2019s strengths.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Blue Hill Democratic Party hosted Michaud\u2019s appearance. Chairman Jim Fisher, who brought the Brooklin Community Band with him to perform before Michaud spoke, welcomed the crowd to \u201can old-fashioned town festival,\u201d noting that the band itself was not affiliated with any political party.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Weekly Packet", "description": "United States Congressman Mike Michaud declared his candidacy for governor out of \u201clove for Maine,\u201d he said, during an appearance in Blue Hill on June 6. \u201cIt was hard to decide.
