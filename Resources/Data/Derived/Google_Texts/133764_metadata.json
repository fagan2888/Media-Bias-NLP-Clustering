Premera received approval for a similarly large increase of 38.7 percent for 2016, citing losses from the policies sold in the state.\n\nIn 2014, Premera lost $9 million serving the individual Alaska policyholders, and a similar loss of $9 million was projected for 2015 based on claims cost data in the first three months.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we see another year of significant losses,\u201d Premera spokeswoman Melanie Coon told the Journal last August. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting any better.\u201d\n\nInsurers across the country are warning they will consider pulling out of the insurance exchanges next year if the situation does not improve. The nation\u2019s largest, UnitedHealth Group, is among those, and Aetna recently reported that it lost $100 million last year from its exchange business.\n\nHerbert Stein\u2019s Law states: \u201cThat which cannot continue, won\u2019t.\u201d Insurers are not going to sit back and continue to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, which should be of grave concern in a state with one company that is currently losing money in the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here?\n\nIt starts with the way the Obama administration got insurance companies to buy in to the law in the first place. The ACA created a \u201crisk corridor\u201d by which the companies agreed to pay the government for profits in excess of their estimates for the year and if they lost money, the government would bail them out.\n\nRemember, Obamacare was sold as deficit-neutral at worst, and a deficit-reducer at best. Over and over we heard the pitch that it was going to save the country money (part of those \u201csavings\u201d came from the government taking over the student loan business, but that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother column).\n\nWell, Republicans in Congress led by presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio inserted language into the 2015 and 2016 spending bills that prohibited the Department of Health and Human Services from using discretionary funds to bail out insurance company losses from the exchanges.\n\nIn other words, they held the Obama administration to its pledge that the ACA would not add to the deficit.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Fiscal Times reported the results in December: \u201cLast year, the insurance companies paid just $362 million into risk corridor program while submitting $2.87 billion in claims for reimbursement \u2026 The fiscal 2015 budget package approved last year specified that payments made to insurers under the risk corridors could not exceed collections. That is why the (DHHS\u2019s) payouts this year were equivalent to just 12.6 percent of the claims.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed every bill with these spending restrictions, so while he may have vetoed the bill to repeal his namesake law, he did sign the bills that may have started its death spiral.\n\nModa entered the Oregon market with the lowest premiums in 2014, betting on getting its losses covered by the federal government and gaining 100,000 customers in the process. It even signed a 10-year, $40 million naming rights deal for the basketball arena in Portland just a couple years after only clearing $10.4 million in net income.\n\nBarely two years later its bet went bust.\n\nModa may be one of the biggest losers so far to gamble on Obamacare, but it will surely not be the last.\n\nAndrew Jensen can be reached at andrew.jensen@alaskajournal.com.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Moda Health went all in on Obamacare, and it is now short-stacked and heading for the rail.
