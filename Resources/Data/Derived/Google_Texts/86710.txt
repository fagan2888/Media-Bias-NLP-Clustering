A Texas congressman angered by the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold tax subsidies to Americans who purchase their health coverage on the federal exchange instead of state-run marketplaces wants to require the Supreme Court and its employees to participate in Obamacare, according to The Hill "As the Supreme Court continues to ignore the letter of the law, it’s important that these six individuals understand the full impact of their decisions on the American people," Republican Rep. Brian Babin posted on his Facebook page Thursday."That’s why I introduced the SCOTUScare Act to require the Supreme Court and all of its employees to sign up for Obamacare," Babin's tweet continues. "By eliminating their exemption from Obamacare, they will see firsthand what the American people are forced to live with!"The SCOTUScare Act calls to only offer Supreme Court justices and their staffs Obamacare plans.The freshman congressman, who is a dentist, represents East Texas.His proposed legislation has gone viral and he is receiving support from both constituents and colleagues."Pass this bill right away and please be sure to hand deliver a personalized SCOTUS-care policy to John Roberts and by all means ask him from We, the People, we'd like him to place his policy where the sun doesn't shine!" Joyce Rubrecht Myers posted on Facebook."All elected persons should be required to have the same thing they are imposing on us. NO EXEMPTION," read another, by Faye Morris VanDevender.The name of Babin’s proposed bill — the SCOTUScare Act of 2015 — is a play on Justice Antonin Scalia’s scathing dissenting opinion which suggested that Obamacare be renamed SCOTUScare, a reference to his position that the six justices who voted in favor of upholding the law essentially rewrote it, according to Politico Congress is already required to purchase their health insurance through the exchanges.
