Matt Bevin announced Wednesday he has begun work to transform Kentucky's Medicaid program by 2017. But in the meantime he envisions no major changes in the government health plan. (Full press conference)\n\nBuy Photo Gov. Matt Bevin (Photo: C-J Photo)Buy Photo\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin was referenced in an editorial in Monday's New York Times entitled \"Governors get smarter on Medicaid.\"\n\nIt notes that several governors from the 20 states that so far have refused to expand Medicaid are now looking into it because of federal funds it offers to provide health care for poor citizens under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRegarding Bevin, the editorial mentioned him by title though not by name, saying:\n\n\"In Kentucky, a new Republican governor who vowed to roll back the big expansion ordered by his Democratic predecessor is having second thoughts now that he is responsible for the health of his constituents.\"\n\nBevin recently announced he plans to ask federal authorities for permission to restructure Kentucky's Medicaid expansion that has added about 425,000 low-income Kentuckians to the program but doesn't anticipate any major changes until 2017.\n\nThe editorial also singles out for praise Ohio's Republican Gov. John Kasich, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, for deciding to accept the Medicaid expansion in his state, bypassing the Republican-controlled legislature to do so.\n\n\"He calls this the right thing to do, fiscally and morally, as it surely is,\" the editorial said. \"No governors should deny health coverage for people just because they are ideologically opposed to federal entitlement programs.\"\n\nContact reporter Deborah Yetter at (502)582-4228 or at dyetter@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Ri8QFR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Kentucky Gov.
