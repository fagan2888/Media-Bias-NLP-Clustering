(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nLAKEWOOD \u2014 It wasn't the high note Matthew Miller wanted to end his magical state track meet on.\n\nEver the optimist, though, Miller was still smiling after taking ninth place in the 300-meter hurdles on Saturday at the Class 3A State Track & Field Championships at Jeffco Stadium.\n\n\"Choked,\" he said. \"It's one of those where you know what you've got to do and you just can't do it.\n\n\"I stuttered on the hurdles, but I felt like it was mental,\" the Florence Huskies senior added. \"Physically, I could've done it. Mentally, I wasn't ready.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Miller placed fourth in the 110-meter hurdles, much higher than what he was seeded at entering the state meet (11th).\n\nHe entered the meet in the 300-meter hurdles tied with the eighth fastest qualifying time. In the preliminaries, he ran the third fastest time.\n\nLast year, Miller entered the meet seeded 13th in the 300s and 14th in the 110s, but he made the finals in both.\n\nAlso for Florence in the meet, Makenna Green capped her prep career with a 10th-place finish in the shot put Friday.\n\nGreen finished 13th as a freshman, 11th as a sophomore and seventh last year.\n\nTaylor Holand didn't clear any of her three jumps in the high jump Thursday.\n\nWhen Holand was a freshman, she tied for second in the high jump and tied for third last season. She entered Thursday's competition tied for seventh, but wasn't optimistic heading in. Earlier this season, the junior suffered a sprained ankle on her jumping leg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandon Hopper: 719-276-7644, hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_28131128/senior-matthew-miller-claims-3rd-9th-hurdles-florence", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  The Daily Record", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28131128:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-16T16:12:41-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "LAKEWOOD \u2014 It wasn't the high note Matthew Miller wanted to end his magical state track meet on.", "title": "Senior Matthew Miller claims 3rd, 9th in hurdles for Florence Huskies", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_28131128/senior-matthew-miller-claims-3rd-9th-hurdles-florence", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0516/20150516__18drFTRw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "modificationDate": "2015-05-16T17:23:55-0600", "endDate": "2025-05-16T16:08:11-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record", "byline": "By Brandon HopperThe", "pubDate": "2015-05-16T16:14:18-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-16T16:12:41-0600", "sailthru.title": "Senior Matthew Miller claims 3rd, 9th in hurdles for Florence Huskies", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0516/20150516__18drFTRw~1_300.jpg", "description": "LAKEWOOD \u2014 It wasn't the high note Matthew Miller wanted to end his magical state track meet on.", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.tags": "Matthew Miller, Florence Huskies", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_28131128/senior-matthew-miller-claims-3rd-9th-hurdles-florence", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0516/20150516__18drFTRw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "LAKEWOOD \u2014 It wasn't the high note Matthew Miller wanted to end his magical state track meet on.", "title": "Senior Matthew Miller claims 3rd, 9th in hurdles for Florence Huskies"}, "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0516/20150516__18drFTRw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f24\"", "article_summary": "Huskies senior happy with result at state meetHuskies senior Matthew Miller during the Class 3A State Track & Field Championships on Saturday at Jeffco Stadium in Lakewood.\n(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)LAKEWOOD \u2014 It wasn't the high note Matthew Miller wanted to end his magical state track meet on.\nLast year, Miller entered the meet seeded 13th in the 300s and 14th in the 110s, but he made the finals in both.\n\"I stuttered on the hurdles, but I felt like it was mental,\" the Florence Huskies senior added.\nEarlier in the day, Miller placed fourth in the 110-meter hurdles, much higher than what he was seeded at entering the state meet (11th)."}
