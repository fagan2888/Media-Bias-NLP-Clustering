Although scores on specific factors such as cleanliness and privacy improved for patients treated in the tower, they were virtually unchanged on aspects of their care itself, such as doctors' and nurses' communication skills.\n\n\"Despite the widespread belief among healthcare leadership that facility renovation or expansion is a vital strategy for improving patient satisfaction, our study shows that this may not be a dominant factor,\" Siddiqui and his fellow authors wrote.\n\nThese findings would seem to contradict long-held beliefs about the benefits of new construction, according to Kaiser Health News, as well as specific examples such as NYU Langone Medical Center's improved patient experience scores after relocating its cardiology unit to a renovated floor.\n\nMany healthcare leaders have looked to renovations and design elements in response to increased patient volumes and an aging population, but critics of hotel-like amenities in hospital settings have pointed out that such renovations often only improve patient experience, not necessarily outcomes, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nAlthough architectural upgrades can improve patient experience and safety in some ways, such as improving patient privacy and helping to better organize nursing stations, Siddiqui and his team said, the study results demonstrate that outdated facilities alone are not an excuse for poor patient satisfaction scores.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the KHN article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAging, growing population spurs hospital redesigns\n\nHospitals use design to improve population health\n\nTo improve satisfaction scores, hospitals seek patient input on design\n\nFlorida Hospital to build apartments for employees\n\nAirports, shopping malls inspire revamped hospital designs\n\nNew hospital design keeps patient in mind, improves safety\n\nGood design may revolutionize healthcare industry, improve outcomes\n\nDo hotel-like hospitals deliver patient-centered care?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study in the Journal of American Medicine challenges the conventional wisdom about the benefits of costly hospital renovation and expansion.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new study in the Journal of American Medicine challenges the conventional wisdom about the benefits of costly hospital renovation and expansion.", "title": "Expensive new facilities don't improve patient scores on care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/expensive-new-facilities-dont-improve-patient-scores-care/2015-02-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "construction,design,hospital renovations,Operations & Business Management,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction,patient satisfaction scores", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "Although architectural upgrades can improve patient experience and safety in some ways, such as improving patient privacy and helping to better organize nursing stations, Siddiqui and his team said, the study results demonstrate that outdated facilities alone are not an excuse for poor patient satisfaction scores.\nZishan Siddiqui, M.D., of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, analyzed the effect of doctors practicing in the university's recently-constructed Sheikh Zayed Tower--which, along with a new children's hospital, cost $1.1 billion--on patient satisfaction scores.\nA study in the Journal of Hospital Medicine challenges the conventional wisdom about the benefits of costly hospital renovation and expansion.\nTo learn more:- here's the study abstract- read the KHN articleRelated Articles:Aging, growing population spurs hospital redesignsHospitals use design to improve population healthTo improve satisfaction scores, hospitals seek patient input on designFlorida Hospital to build apartments for employeesAirports, shopping malls inspire revamped hospital designsNew hospital design keeps patient in mind, improves safetyGood design may revolutionize healthcare industry, improve outcomesDo hotel-like hospitals deliver patient-centered care?\n\"Despite the widespread belief among healthcare leadership that facility renovation or expansion is a vital strategy for improving patient satisfaction, our study shows that this may not be a dominant factor,\" Siddiqui and his fellow authors wrote."}
