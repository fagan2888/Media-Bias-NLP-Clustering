The Crawley family matriarch soon makes it clear she is more concerned about the development of an all-encompassing government.\n\nThe dowager countess, played by Maggie Smith, says:\n\nFor years, I\u2019ve watched governments take control of our lives, and their argument is always the same: \u2018Fewer costs, greater efficiency.\u2019 But the result is the same, too. Less control by the people, more control by the State, until the individual\u2019s anguishes count for nothing. That is what I consider my duty to resist.\n\nThe episode, entitled \u201cThe Engine Purrs,\u201d debuted in the U.S. Jan. 24.\n\n\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is an internationally popular period drama that follows the lives of the English aristocratic Crawley family as they adapt to rapid social change, including the first World War. The sixth and final season is currently being broadcast in the United States on PBS.\n\nCiting the creation of the famous Magna Carta, the countess argues that the aristocracy plays an important role in checking government power.\n\n\u201cYou see, the point of a so-called great family is to protect our freedoms. That is why the barons made King John sign the Magna Carta,\u201d she says.\n\nThe British Library describes the Magna Carta, issued by King John in 1215, as an \u201cancient defence against arbitrary and tyrannical rulers, and as a guarantor of individual liberties.\u201d\n\nWhen the countess\u2019 daughter responds that the Crawleys are \u201cnot living in 1215, and the strengths of great families like ours is going,\u201d the family matriarch appeals to the judgment of future generations.\n\n\u201cYour great-grandchildren won\u2019t thank you when the state is all-powerful because we didn\u2019t fight,\u201d she says.\n\nThe structure of the English health care system has changed since the time of the fictitious Crawley matriarch. The country has had taxpayer-funded health care for every citizen since 1948, according to the National Health Service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cYour great-grandchildren won't thank you when the state is all-powerful because we didn't fight.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cYour great-grandchildren won't thank you when the state is all-powerful because we didn't fight.\"", "title": "'Downton Abbey' Character Gives Speech Defending Smaller Government", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160127_downton.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-27T23:08:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1nPz9qF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cYour great-grandchildren won't thank you when the state is all-powerful because we didn't fight.\"", "title": "'Downton Abbey' Character Gives Speech Defending Smaller Government", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160127_downton.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-01-27T15:01:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T23:08:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Crawley family matriarch soon makes it clear she is more concerned about the development of an all-encompassing government.\n\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is an internationally popular period drama that follows the lives of the English aristocratic Crawley family as they adapt to rapid social change, including the first World War.\nCiting the creation of the famous Magna Carta, the countess argues that the aristocracy plays an important role in checking government power.\nThat is why the barons made King John sign the Magna Carta,\u201d she says.\nThe structure of the English health care system has changed since the time of the fictitious Crawley matriarch."}
