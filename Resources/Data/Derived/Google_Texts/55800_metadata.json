Wrote PP Keystone employee \u201cCC\u201d (combining excerpts from two comments):\n\nI think what is really unfortunate is the employees of PPKEY work under paid and not paid market rate for there positions. then on top of it work in the unsanitary conditions, like robots, in humane ways to treat humans. Most of the employees working here are on welfare themselves that\u2019s pretty sad\u2026. We should try to start a union! Admin would crap there pants if we all did that, because than we would have rights!\n\nEmployee \u201cSickOfKeystone\u201d wrote:\n\nPPKEY spent thousands for a Employee Appreciation at the Country Club so they could all blow they own horns. How bout instead u get me a gift card for groceries. I would appreciate that. How bout Im full time and get food stamps and cant afford insurance for my husband.\n\nIndeed, since writing that post I have received more intel on wages and insurance premiums for PP Keystone employees.\n\nI\u2019m told that PP Keystone workers other than clinic managers and clinicians make only $10-11/hour and are limited to a 35-hour work week. These people include receptionists, medical assistants and \u201cfront end and back end staff,\u201d according to my source.\n\nAs CC and SickOfKeystone indicated, this pittance of a salary qualifies PP Keystone employees with families for welfare and food stamps.\n\nBut it gets worse. It\u2019s no wonder SickOfKeystone can\u2019t afford insurance for her husband. Take a look at PP Keystone\u2019s employee insurance premiums. Take note these are bi-weekly rates:\n\n\n\nI verified that these rates were sent to all staff by PP Keystone Director of HR and Security Erin Vellela (pictured right) in an email dated October 25, to take effect November 1, 2013, through October 31, 2014.\n\nHow a PP employee making $11/hour, or $1,540 a month, could afford insurance for his or her family is beyond me. It doesn\u2019t seem possible. It is even less likely that any part-time employee could pull it off without paying PP money.\n\nMeanwhile PP Keystone CEO Kim Custer, pictured right, made $133,165 in salary and compensation in 2012.\n\nSo while Planned Parenthood Federation of America CEO Cecile Richards cheerleads for Obamacare, because \u201cevery person in this country deserves a basic standard of health care coverage,\u201d her own corporation has been a prime culprit, forcing employees already making slave wages to purchase astronomically high health insurance, or go without.\n\nThe Washington Times reported on November 4 that PPFA \u201cemploys 25,000 staff and volunteers at its 750 health clinics.\u201d\n\nHello, where is the Service Employees International Union? I\u2019m sure PP Keystone employee CC is not alone in wanting to unionize.\n\nAnd shouldn\u2019t feminists support decent wages and health insurance for workers providing healthcare to mostly women?\n\nI\u2019ve seen SEIU in action when it was trying to strong-arm my employer to unionize hospital workers. SEIU is a master at shakedowns. SEIU is always on the lookout for more healthcare workers to bring into its fold.\n\nBut could it be that Cecile Richards\u2019 husband Kirk Adams, International Executive Vice President of SEIU, is keeping his friends away from PP? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a safe bet.\n\nBut is it good for either SEIU or PP workers? Absolutely not.\n\nPlanned Parenthood employees who may be reading this blog for the first time should check out the salaries your affiliate CEOs and PPFA corporate heads are making. You should also know PPFA has topped $1 billion in assets since 2009-2010. There\u2019s money to pay you. Management is just keeping it for themselves.\n\n*Pseudonym", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Pushes Obamcare, Makes Its Employees Go Without Insurance", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Last week I wrote about unsanitary conditions at a Pennsylvania Planned Parenthood\u00a0clinic that is part of the Planned Parenthood Keystone\u00a0affiliate.
