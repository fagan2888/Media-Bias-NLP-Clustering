If the court had ruled to strip the subsidies, the enrollees could have been priced out of the health coverage market.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and Gov. Rick Scott, however, did not have a plan in place to cope with the newly uninsured. They preferred to wait for the court\u2019s decision and deferred to Congress to craft a solution if the subsidies had been eliminated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m especially happy with the court\u2019s ruling because, if the outcome would have been different, Republican leadership in Florida \u2013 particularly Gov. Rick Scott \u2013 had done nothing to prepare for such an outcome. Even though that negligence is fact, I\u2019m glad it won\u2019t harm anyone,\u201d said House Democratic Leader pro tem Mia Jones, D-Jacksonville.\n\n\"It\u2019s a bad law,'' Scott said at an event in St. Augustine. \"It makes promise after promise. It was supposed to reduce health care costs, and costs have gone up. I hope the next president repeals it.''\n\nSenate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, applauded the decision as well, but bemoaned the 800,000 Floridians that remain without health care because House Republicans rejected his push to expand Medicaid eligibility using state-run exchanges. He also signaled the fight over health care, which blew up the regular session and led to a special session that ended last week, isn\u2019t quite over.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, more than 800,000 of our friends and neighbors still fall into the coverage gap, making too much to enroll in traditional Medicaid and too little to qualify for a subsidy on the federal exchange. The Senate remains committed to addressing this serious health care problem through a free-market Florida solution that maximizes consumer choice and personal responsibility, while protecting state sovereignty,\u201d Gardiner said.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s ruling behind us, it is my hope we can continue to work with our colleagues in the House and with Governor Scott to craft a compromise plan to expand access to health care coverage and services for low-income working Floridians across our state,\u201d Gardiner added.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Florida Dems laud Obamacare decision, blast Gov.
