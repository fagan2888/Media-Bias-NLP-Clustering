A private, California-based investment firm will reopen Colorado-Fayette Medical Center in Weimar, which closed in 2012, according to the Colorado County Citizen.

Colorado-Fayette—a private, nonprofit, 38-bed hospital—filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2012, then shut down a month later. Anaheim, Calif.-based Price Family Capital Partners will reopen the hospital under an operating company, Weimar Medical Holdings. The hospital will be renamed Weimar Medical Center, and hopes to be open within four months.

The purchase of the hospital by a private investment firm is just the latest step in the increased consolidation and purchase rate of hospital systems. The Affordable Care Act—and its assorted regulations–is driving hospitals to sell or seek partners, experts say, and the trend isn’t just in the United States; private investment in Chinese hospitals is peaking toward $2 billion annually, according to Forbes.
