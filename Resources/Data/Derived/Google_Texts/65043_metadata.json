(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n4252901\n\nThe largest newspaper in Nevada is taking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to task, saying that the Democrat\u2019s recent comments about Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas highlight a pattern of race card rhetoric.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid is the da Vinci of distraction,\u201d reads the editorial from the Las Vegas Review-Journal, which was posted online Friday.\n\n\u201cThe moment any scandal, policy failure or political defeat crashes down on him \u2014 and there have been plenty the past few years \u2014 the Senate majority leader unleashes outrageous rhetoric,\u201d the editorial continues, adding that Reid \u201chas become especially fond of slinging race cards just to crank up the outrage.\u201d\n\nThe trigger for the Review-Journal was a comment Reid made earlier this week after the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision.\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Court sided with Hobby Lobby, allowing it and other \u201cclosely-held\u201d corporations to skirt the Obamacare mandate that requires companies to provide health insurance plans to their employees that contain coverage for certain contraceptives. Companies like Hobby Lobby can now cite their religious principles in deciding to not provide coverage for those contraceptives.\n\nAn angry Reid criticized the decision, saying, \u201cThe one thing we are going to do during this work period, sooner rather than later, is to ensure that women\u2019s lives are not determined by the virtues of five white men.\u201d\n\nThe issue there is that only four of the justices that sided with Hobby Lobby are white. The fifth justice was Clarence Thomas, who is black.\n\n\u201cSen. Reid\u2019s slip was no accident,\u201d reads the Review-Journal editorial. \u201cHe believes racial and ethnic minorities are ideologically monolithic constituencies who are incapable of independent or \u2014 gasp! \u2014 right-of-center thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the majority leader\u2019s mind, Mr. Thomas is not an African-American because the justice doesn\u2019t blindly subscribe to liberal orthodoxy,\u201d the paper wrote, before pointing out other examples of Reid compartmentalizing minorities.\n\nDuring his 2010 re-election campaign, Reid said of Latino voters, \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone of Hispanic heritage could be a Republican, OK? Do I need to say more?\u201d\n\nAs the editorial points out, Nevada\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, is Hispanic.\n\n\u201cNever mind that Sen. Reid himself, like the entire Senate Democratic leadership, is as white as an Irishman in a snowstorm,\u201d the editorial continues, arguing that after more than five years of Democrats controlling the White House and Senate, unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics \u201cremains scandalously high.\u201d (RELATED: Harry Reid Apparently Thinks Clarence Thomas Is White)\n\nReid\u2019s proposed solution to the problem, a higher minimum wage, will make the problem worse, according to the paper.\n\n\u201cQuit the race-baiting already, Sen. Reid,\u201d the editorial continues. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly colorblind \u2014 in all the wrong ways.\u201d\n\nDespite the brutality of its take-down, the Review-Journal left out one prominent example of Reid\u2019s awkward race-based remarks. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Reid said that then-Sen. Barack Obama would be electable because he is \u201clight-skinned\u201d and speaks with \u201cno Negro dialect.\u201d\n\nReid apologized in 2010 for those comments.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "'Sen.
