But talk of a 15-year-old affair won\u2019t convince women who oppose his libertarian policies.\n\nWhat on earth is Rand Paul thinking, bringing up Monica Lewinsky? On cable TV, they shake their talking heads: ancient history, irrelevant, etc. Quite true, it\u2019s all those things. But in terms of intra-GOP presidential-positioning politics, I think it\u2019s actually quite shrewd, and another sign that he is not to be underestimated in terms of possibly nabbing the GOP nomination. Unfortunately for Paul\u2014although fortunately for America\u2014it\u2019s only shrewd in terms of intra-GOP politics. Among the rest of the electorate, responses will range from indifference to hostility, and the \u201cGOP War on Women\u201d narrative won\u2019t suffer a scratch.\n\nHere\u2019s what Paul is doing. First, he\u2019s getting right with the base. As a devolutionist-libertarian, he takes some unorthodox positions from the conservative point of view\u2014his neo-isolationist, anti-neocon foreign policy views, his comparatively soft-line views on same-sex marriage (he\u2019s not for it, but he\u2019d leave it to the states). There are reasons, in other words, for hard-shell conservatives to give him the gimlet eye.\n\nGiven that, what are some ways to make conservatives think you\u2019re \u201cone of us\u201d without having to alter those positions, which he surely knows would be a disaster for him, destroying the very basis of his appeal as principled and so on? Find something conservatives hate and say you hate it too. What bigger something than the Clintons? Well, there\u2019s Obama, but hating on him is old hat. Dredging up Lewinsky, on the other hand, shows that some care was taken to cultivate conservatives. As Paul knows, Clinton-hatred is still mother\u2019s milk for that crowd.\n\nHe is also, as Peter Beinart noted, aiming specifically at the Christian Right. He\u2019s been doing this for some time now, talking, for example, of the persecution of Christian minorities around the world. His father never bothered much with evangelicals, an error the son, recognizing their importance in the Iowa GOP caucuses, clearly hopes not to make.\n\nI think there\u2019s a final reason, which emotionally is the most important of all. When Muhammad Ali was Cassius Clay, when he was still months away from a title shot against champ Sonny Liston, he\u2019d knock out the latest second-rater in three rounds and then, when they stepped into the ring to interview him, carry on about how all he wanted was a fight with Liston: \u201cI want that big brown bear!\u201d The more he talked, the more promoters and fans were able to visualize a Clay-Liston fight.\n\nThe more Paul talks about the Clintons, the more he sets up the mental picture in the brains of Republican primary voters of him being the logical guy to step into the ring with them. After all, they\u2019ll think, he\u2019s sure not afraid of them!\n\nIt\u2019s very smart (all this assumes of course that Hillary Clinton runs and is the Democratic nominee). All the other Republican candidates laying into the Clintons will look like Johnny-come-latelys. Paul spoke up first.\n\nBut the good it does him ends there. Here we return to the age-old Republican blind spot on issues relating to groups that don\u2019t vote for them. Republicans think they can make everything better with words and symbolism. Just get our candidates to stop saying these stupid things like Todd Akin did. Speak respectfully. Sensitively. Appoint more women to high-profile thingies. It\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThat isn\u2019t how politics works. How politics works is that people actually care about substance to a surprising degree, and they know which party is representing their interests and which party is not. And women, by 12 percentage points at last count, know that Republicans are not. All right, it\u2019s slightly more complicated than that\u2014married women vote Republican, as do white women. But last I checked, African American women and Latina women and single women are women, too, and each of them has the same one vote that a married white woman has.\n\nAnd overall\u2014don\u2019t take it from me, take it from the numbers\u2014the women of America have decided that the GOP isn\u2019t on their side. And it\u2019s not because of the offal that flows out of the mouths of Todd Akin and company, really. It\u2019s because of policies. And Rand Paul supports every one of those party policies.\n\nFunny, but his libertarianism does not extend to giving a woman the right to decide whether to have an abortion. It did, however, in March 2012, extend to the \u201cfreedom\u201d of religious institutions that were fighting the expanded requirement for contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. You may remember the Blunt Amendment, which sought vast conscience exemptions from the coverage requirement. Paul voted for it.\n\nI could keep going and going. Just last month, Paul floated the idea of a federal cap on welfare benefits for women who have more children. It is true that 16 states have such caps, and it\u2019s not necessarily an ill-intentioned thought that saying \u201cno more money for another child\u201d might produce the desired effect of women not having those children. The problem is that in real life there seems to be no correlation. So the net effect is really just to increase the number of women and children living in poverty.\n\nThen there\u2019s little gem of a quote: \u201cThe whole thing with the War on Women, I sort of laughingly say, \u2018yeah there might have been,\u2019 but the women are winning it.\u201d He said this two weeks ago.
