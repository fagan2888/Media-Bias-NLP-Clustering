While President Obama celebrates the success of his strategy to secure enough votes to put the Iran nuclear agreement in place, the head of the Republican National Committee was seemingly engaging in some strategy of his own, calling for all 17 candidates to make a promise meant to ease concerns about one candidate\u2019s intentions.\n\nAt 2 p.m. Thursday, the Trump show will resume its regularly scheduled programming, with a special guest star: Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, at Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nAccording to Donald J. Trump\u2018s official schedule, he is holding a news conference at that time. The advisory makes no mention of Mr. Priebus, but a spokesman for Mr. Trump confirmed that a meeting between them is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nAll of this togetherness, on Mr. Trump\u2019s terms, at his office tower, with his name on the front in gold, comes after Mr. Priebus abruptly asked all 17 presidential candidates in the Republican nominating contest to sign a loyalty pledge against running as a third-party candidate.\n\nThe pledge seems to be aimed directly at Mr. Trump, since no other candidate has left open, at least in previous comments, the possibility of such a run. And that threat, by a rich candidate, has sent a jolt of fear through the Republican establishment over splitting votes and potentially tipping the election to Democrats. Mr. Priebus has been under enormous pressure to try to rein in Mr. Trump.\n\nBut reining him in is more easy in theory than in fact. And the fact that whatever announcement will take place on Thursday is being done on Mr. Trump\u2019s turf merely emphasizes how much he is dictating the terms of the primary.\n\n\u2014 Maggie Haberman\n\nStay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates.\n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is on a trip to Florida that further raises speculation about a potential presidential run, will meet with Jewish community leaders on Thursday to discuss the Iran nuclear deal. He will return to Washington and then fly to Atlanta where he will speak to other Jewish groups.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Senator Ted Cruz will make appearances in his home state of Texas; New Hampshire will host several candidates, including Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democrat, will be in Iowa.\n\nMr. Obama has secured enough votes to make sure he can put the Iran nuclear deal in place, but opponents of the agreement are not about to stop trying to run up the vote count against it.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a leader of the drive against the deal, is hosting an event in New Jersey on Thursday evening to urge Senator Cory Booker, one of about 10 remaining undeclared Democrats, to oppose the deal. It will feature former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the onetime Connecticut Democrat turned independent who now leads United Against Nuclear Iran, and other Jewish community leaders.\n\nWhile a veto of the deal cannot be overridden if the current support holds, opponents of the agreement are eager to enlarge any majority against it. And the addition of a Democrat like Mr. Booker would also give more credibility to the portrayal of the opposition as bipartisan. Critics of the deal would still like to force a final vote in the Senate, and they need at least four more Democrats to join them to have sufficient support to break a filibuster.\n\n\u201cWe are in this until the end,\u201d said Patrick Dorton, who has been overseeing a $20 million media campaign against the deal for Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran. \u201cWe think that every vote matters,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view is that proponents of the deal should support an up-or-down vote and not hide behind a filibuster.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nOften in her political career, Mrs. Clinton has found cover amid some of her stumbles in Republicans who have troubles of their own.\n\nA once-sunny Mr. Bush seems irked to be in Mr. Trump\u2018s shadow and stuck in a race that embodies what he likes least about politics.Perhaps as a case in point, on Wednesday Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Bush was setting a bad example by speaking Spanish, and Mr. Bush criticized Mr. Trump for, among other things, being \u201ca germaphobe.\u201d\n\nIn a speech aimed at raising her national profile amid talk of a potential vice-presidential pick, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina sharply criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, saying it was imperiling black lives and property.\n\nAnd on the third day of his visit to Alaska, Mr. Obama delivered promises of new aid for Arctic communities whose shorelines and infrastructure are crumbling because of rising temperatures.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida said the government should respect the beliefs of the Kentucky county clerk who has denied marriage licenses to same-sex couples, saying society needs to accommodate public officials who object to carrying out duties they say violate their religious beliefs.\n\nMrs. Clinton proposed a $10 billion plan to combat the escalating drug epidemic in rural America.\n\nAnd Mr. Sanders is on the verge of signing a joint fund-raising agreement with the Democratic National Committee, his aides said, a week after Mrs. Clinton entered such an arrangement.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren touched on some of her signature issues \u2014 like student loans, big banks and the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Wednesday evening in an appearance with a Boston Globe reporter at Suffolk University.\n\nBut it was her potential role in next year\u2019s presidential election, including her meeting late last month with Mr. Biden, that drew the evening\u2019s most eager attention.\n\n\u201cActually, he called me twice,\u201d Ms. Warren said, explaining how the lunch meeting was set up.\n\nMs. Warren and Mr. Biden met over some sort of chopped salad \u2014 \u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely sure what it was,\u201d she said \u2014 for a \u201cgood, long, rambling policy conversation,\u201d Ms. Warren said.\n\nThe reporter, Joshua Miller, asked if the two had discussed the idea of a joint ticket, even jokingly.\n\nMs. Warren paused.\n\n\u201cIt was a long conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Warren then sidestepped Mr. Miller\u2019s repeated questions about whether she intended to serve out her six-year Senate term, which began in 2013.\n\n\u201cI love my job,\u201d Ms. Warren said, emphasizing each word. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller reminded Ms. Warren that, in 2013, she had pledged to serve out the term.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has changed my thinking on this,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cI\u2019m working hard.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren also said that she expected to endorse a Democratic presidential candidate, but that she was not ready to do so.\n\n\u2014 Jess Bidgood\n\nPolitico reports that the Clinton campaign is looking to make a push in New Hampshire in an effort to keep pace with Mr. Sanders, who has been drawing big crowds there and is polling well in the state.\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley, the former Maryland governor who has harshly criticized the Democratic National Committee for scheduling six debates, a number he sees as too few and as benefiting Mrs. Clinton, has called for protests at the committee\u2019s headquarters, The Hill writes.\n\nAnd, The New Yorker writes, \u201cIn contemporary campaigns, which rely so much on artifice and the huge gobs of money that manufacture more artifice, it\u2019s often hard to figure out who these striving people are apart from who they say they are.\u201d\n\nNewsweek composed a poem made of lines from emails sent by Mrs. Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150903070800, "BN": "first-draft",
