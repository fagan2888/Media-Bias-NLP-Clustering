Relying on the legal concept of standing, the Obama administration said it couldn\u2019t envision a situation in which a chamber of Congress should be able to sue the president for failing to execute a law.\n\n\u201cThe House . . . does not have standing to bring suit to assert that the Executive Branch is improperly administering federal law,\u201d the brief says. \u201cThis result does not change even if the House frames the Executive\u2019s supposedly illegal action as a \u2018usurpation\u2019 of its legislative authority, including its appropriations authority.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, the brief says, the House hasn\u2019t suffered a \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cparticularized\u201d harm\u2014 a condition for establishing standing.\n\n\u201cBecause Congress plays no direct role in the execution of federal law and has no continuing or distinct interest or stake in a bill once it becomes a law, Congress suffers no legally cognizable injury if that law (in Congress\u2019s view) is improperly administered,\u201d the document states.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who represents the House in the litigation, emailed Law Blog a response:\n\nThe effort by the Administration to seek the dismissal of the action was anticipated and we will be filing an opposition memorandum clearly laying out the right of the House of Representatives to be heard in federal court. We do not believe that the Administration will be successful in its effort to avoid consideration of the merits of this constitutional challenge.\n\nJustice Department lawyers say that even if the House had standing to pursue it claims, the court should still toss the lawsuit because it\u2019s a radical departure from \u201cthe settled understanding of the separation of powers.\u201d\n\nInstead of suing, the brief says, the House has a \u201cwide range of non-judicial measures\u201d it could wield against the president, such as refusing to confirm presidential appointees, stripping out money from the budget or repealing a law.\n\nHouse Republicans, at least, don\u2019t appear to be persuaded. House Speaker John Boehner told Republicans Tuesday that he\u2019s planning to take legal action against the White House over Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, WSJ reported Tuesday.\n\nHe told GOP lawmakers in a closed-door meeting that he\u2019s completing a plan to authorize litigation on the issue, according to a person who attended the meeting.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Lawyers for the White House are urging a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives that alleges President Barack Obama illegally rewrote the new health law.", "title": "Obama Lawyers: House Has No Right to Sue the President", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/01/28/obama-lawyers-house-has-no-right-to-sue-president/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR254_pinto_G_20150128150208.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Obama Lawyers: House Has No Right to Sue the President", "description": "Lawyers for the White House are urging a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives that alleges President Barack Obama illegally rewrote the new health law.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jacob Gershman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "Lawyers for the White House are urging a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives that alleges President Barack Obama illegally rewrote the new health law.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-01-28T22:59:25-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/01/28/obama-lawyers-house-has-no-right-to-sue-president/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-50470", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Lawyers for the White House are urging a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives that alleges President Barack Obama illegally rewrote the new health law.", "title": "Obama Lawyers: House Has No Right to Sue the President", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/01/28/obama-lawyers-house-has-no-right-to-sue-president/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GR254_pinto_G_20150128150208.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-50470", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-29T15:37:31-05:00"}, "article_summary": "House Speaker John Boehner told Republicans Tuesday that he\u2019s planning to take legal action against the White House over Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, WSJ reported Tuesday.\nAFP/Getty ImagesLawyers for the White House are urging a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Republican-led House of Representatives that alleges President Barack Obama illegally rewrote the new health law.\ndoes not have standing to bring suit to assert that the Executive Branch is improperly administering federal law,\u201d the brief says.\nIn the document submitted to Washington, D.C.-based U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer on Monday, the White House said the lawsuit was a political dispute that has no business in federal court.\nThe president in public comments has attacked the lawsuit as a stunt, but a court brief drafted by a team of Department of Justice lawyers marks the first time the White House has articulated to a judge why the case shouldn\u2019t be heard."}
