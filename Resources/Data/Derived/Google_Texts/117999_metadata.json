On Wednesday, bowing to public pressure, the department store chain became the latest high-profile corporation to sever ties with Trump after he called immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Bump Continues, but Support for The Donald May Be Limited\n\nTrump, who made the remarks in the announcement of his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, doubled down on them in the interview with Tapper. This was apparently too much for the retail chain that has carried his clothing line for more than a decade.\n\nA statement released by Macy\u2019s on Wednesday morning said:\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed and distressed by recent remarks about immigrants from Mexico. We do not believe the disparaging characterizations portray an accurate picture of the many Mexicans, Mexican Americans and Latinos who have made so many valuable contributions to the success of our nation.\n\n\u201cIn light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy\u2019s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump and will phase-out the Trump menswear collection, which has been sold at Macy\u2019s since 2004.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Trouble with Christie\u2019s Tough-Guy Pitch\n\nMacy\u2019s becomes the third major corporation to cut ties with Trump over his remarks. The Spanish-language television network Univision last week announced that it would no longer carry the Miss Universe pageant, which is partly owned by Trump. This prompted a string of nasty tweets from The Donald suggesting the U.S.-based station is actually controlled by the Mexican government, as well as a decree barring Univision employees from using one of his golf resorts in Miami. On Wednesday, Trump announced that he had filed a $500 million lawsuit against the broadcaster.\n\nNBC, the network that hosted Trump\u2019s successful reality show The Apprentice, this week announced that it too would sever its ties with Trump\u2019s beauty pageants. The mogul, somewhat incoherently, took to Instagram to try to spin the separation as his decision. \u201cIf NBC is so weak and so foolish to not understand the serious problem in the United States, coupled with the horrendous and unfair trade deals we are making with Mexico, then their contract violating closure of Miss Universe/Miss USA will be determined in court.\u201d\n\nPredictably, the Macy\u2019s announcement on Wednesday produced another Instagram rant from Trump, claiming that it was Trump \u2013 not Macy\u2019s \u2013 that had terminated the relationship. And not only that, Trump did it as a favor to the department store chain.\n\nRelated: Trump Doubles Down on Hispanic Insults \u2013 Now They\u2019re All Rapists\n\n\u201cI have decided to terminate my relationship with Macy\u2019s because of the pressure being put on them by outside sources,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBesides, he didn\u2019t need them anyway.\n\n\u201cWhile selling Trump ties and shirts at Macy\u2019s is a small business in terms of dollar volume, my principles are far more important and therefore much more valuable.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Real estate mogul Donald Trump tried to spin the end of his relationship with department store chain Macy\u2019s on Wednesday as a decision of his own making.
