TUCSON, Ariz., Nov. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- DermSpectra announced today the release of the DermSpectra™ Total Body Digital Skin Imaging System, a solution enabling physicians to monitor critical skin changes (skin cancers, eczema, lesions, psoriasis, and rashes) over time. The DermSpectra advanced medical technology modernizes the way physicians digitally capture and compare skin irregularities by rapidly delivering patented high-resolution imaging, HIPPA-compliant secure storage, and immediate viewing capabilities.

For use by patients, dermatology and primary care practices, telemedicine centers, cosmetic and plastic surgeons, and the medical community, DermSpectra fills a critical gap in the digital skin imaging (DSI) market. Despite more than 4.9 million skin cancer cases treated each year in the U.S. and the Affordable Care Act's focus on preventative care, there are few tools for standardized screening to aid in early detection of skin cancer at the total body level.

With DermSpectra, patients experience an in-office private, convenient, and short imaging session (8-10 minutes) while their physician views the latest digital images (on desktop or iPad), annotates directly to the image, and securely stores them on a HIPPA-compliant server database. DermSpectra Total Body Digital Skin Imaging enables physicians to complete the physical exam, assessment, and care plan during one office visit, alleviating post-appointment documentation. The Apple® Store recently approved the DermSpectra Viewing Application which is now available by physicians to view stored images.

Digital images captured through DermSpectra can be marked using simple touch screen features that allow physicians to zoom in on lesions, add notes, circle abnormalities or changes, annotate directly on the image, and attach a report to the patient's Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Ultimately this will move the field of dermatological assessment into an "image centric" based practice.

The DermSpectra Total Body Digital Skin Imaging System is competitively priced and can be purchased directly, leased monthly, or offered through a price-per-scan model.

According to Dr. Richard Carmona, 17th U.S. Surgeon General and DermSpectra board member, "DermSpectra is setting the industry standard for how future dermatology, primary care, and medical practices will capture image data to assist early detection of melanoma and other skin diseases. With skin cancer incidence and treatment costs on the rise, DermSpectra is filling an imaging gap to aid in preventative skin screening."

"DermSpectra Total Body Digital Skin Imaging has been in beta testing since September 2013, most recently at Southwest Skin Specialists in Scottsdale, Arizona and University of Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson, Arizona and is scheduled for installation at Mayo Clinic," states Karleen Seybold, co-founder and chief executive officer of DermSpectra. "Successful beta tests showed that 86% of participants reported being very satisfied with their DermSpectra experience and 88% said total body imaging is very important to the quality of medical care. DermSpectra is changing the way the industry and public thinks about preventative skin imaging and will standardize the way skin changes are tracked and monitored over time."
