But their doctors aren\u2019t asking them. Typically, primary care doctors simply ask their female patients whether or not they\u2019re currently using birth control, and that\u2019s the beginning and end of the conversation.\n\nMichele Stranger Hunter, the executive director of the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health, thinks that nuance matters. In an interview with ThinkProgress, Hunter pointed out that if a doctor simply asked their female patient what she wants for her reproductive future, that could open up a larger conversation about how to best achieve that. For instance, if she doesn\u2019t want to become pregnant, they could discuss her range of contraceptive options and make sure she\u2019s using the best method for her lifestyle \u2014 as well as make sure she knows how to use it effectively. If she is thinking about having a baby within the next year, they could discuss how to prepare for that and come up with a plan for her pre-natal care.\n\n\u201cWomen are going to doctors, but doctors aren\u2019t talking to them about birth control,\u201d Hunter told ThinkProgress. \u201cNo matter how many family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics we have, we\u2019re still not talking about this in primary care, and it\u2019s a huge missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nHunter has been working in reproductive health for over 40 years. She remembers what it was like to be in this field before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion, and she\u2019s watched women\u2019s health care slowly drift away from the rest of the medical community over the past several decades. Politicized fights over access to contraception and abortion \u2014 and, particularly, whenever those services collide with taxpayer dollars \u2014 have ensured that reproductive health isn\u2019t integrated into the rest of medical practice. Now, primary care doctors aren\u2019t necessarily required to provide the full range of women\u2019s health services in their offices, so many of them don\u2019t.\n\nSo perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that those doctors aren\u2019t necessarily initiating the right conversations with women about contraception. One recent study found that the vast majority of women are misinformed about their different birth control options, yet don\u2019t receive counseling on the subject from their health care professional. One out of ten women say they have questions about contraception that they don\u2019t feel comfortable asking their doctor.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in partnership with a primary care provider, Hunter developed the \u201cOne Key Question\u201d program. Essentially, she simply wants to encourage general practitioners to start asking women this question \u2014 whether or not they want to become pregnant during the next year \u2014 during each annual check-up. The initiative was first piloted at a community health center in Oregon, and it\u2019s since spread to several public health county clinics in the state. The Oregon Medical Association now endorses it.\n\nAnd the goal is to spread it even further. Hunter\u2019s group has received a grant from the Ms. Foundation for Women to keep working on One Key Question. The project is funded under the Ms. Foundation\u2019s current initiative to integrate women\u2019s reproductive health into basic health care. Especially over the past several years, as federally-funded family planning clinics and abortion providers have been under attack from anti-choice Republicans across the country, there\u2019s been a renewed push to protect women\u2019s health care by incorporating it back into general practice.\n\n\u201cOur current project is trying to make sure women\u2019s health isn\u2019t left out in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ellen Liu, the director of the Ms. Foundation\u2019s women\u2019s health program, told ThinkProgress. Liu pointed out that contraceptive counseling is an important part of a holistic approach to women\u2019s health. \u201cWe chose Oregon because we want to fund innovative pilot programs that can be replicated across the country. One Key Question is so simple, and it\u2019s just brilliant.\u201d\n\nHunter is quick to note that although One Key Question is an incredibly effective method of helping prevent unintended pregnancy, it\u2019s not just for women who don\u2019t want to have a baby. It\u2019s not necessarily framed around abortion rights, and it doesn\u2019t have to be in conflict with abortion opponents (at least, as long as they aren\u2019t also opposed to birth control).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to support women whether she wants to be pregnant or whether she doesn\u2019t want to be pregnant,\u201d Hunter explained. She pointed out that the United States still has high rates of pre-term births and infant mortality rates, and some of those issues could be improved if women more effectively spaced their pregnancies and received better pre-natal care.\n\nWhen ThinkProgress asked her if One Key Question could be implemented in a red state \u2014 somewhere that\u2019s quite a different environment from Oregon, the only state left in the entire country that hasn\u2019t imposed a single restriction on abortion \u2014 Hunter replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so rooted in common sense. Our goal is to have a great proportion of pregnancies that are planned, wanted, and as healthy as possible. Who\u2019s going to fight that?\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI don\u2019t care how red your state is. If you\u2019re really talking about health pregnancies, healthy women, healthy babies \u2014 it\u2019s very hard for people to be against that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Doctors could be doing a better job of helping women avert unintended pregnancies.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Doctors could be doing a better job of helping women avert unintended pregnancies.", "title": "One Simple Question That Could Change The Future Of Reproductive Health Care", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/01/2876481/key-question-contraception/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_109017986-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors could be doing a better job of helping women avert unintended pregnancies.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_109017986-1-321x214.jpg", "title": "One Simple Question That Could Change The Future Of Reproductive Health Care", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_109017986-1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shutterstock_109017986-1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-01T14:54:44+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The project is funded under the Ms. Foundation\u2019s current initiative to integrate women\u2019s reproductive health into basic health care.\nHealth One Simple Question That Could Change The Future Of Reproductive Health Care CREDIT: Shutterstock\u201cWould you like to become pregnant in the next year?\u201dIt\u2019s a simple enough question, and most women probably know exactly how to answer it.\nMichele Stranger Hunter, the executive director of the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health, thinks that nuance matters.\n\u201cOur current project is trying to make sure women\u2019s health isn\u2019t left out in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ellen Liu, the director of the Ms. Foundation\u2019s women\u2019s health program, told ThinkProgress.\nNow, primary care doctors aren\u2019t necessarily required to provide the full range of women\u2019s health services in their offices, so many of them don\u2019t."}
