A major rate dispute has put local CBS and Cox Communications in locked-horn battle, and the biggest losers right now are Sin City viewers.\n\nMeanwhile, Las Vegas sports books are gearing up for their busiest weekend of the year, as Super Bowl 50 goes down this Sunday. More than 300,000 tourists are expected to descend on the gambling capital of America to place their bets on football\u2019s biggest game of the year.\n\nOver $115 million is expected to be wagered legally in Las Vegas for the big game, but that money might substantially increase thanks to that contract dispute between cable TV provider Cox Communications and local CBS affiliate KLAS-TV Channel 8.\n\nAt 11:59 PM local time on January 29, CBS went off the air to Cox subscribers in LV, and was replaced with a static screen accusing Channel 8 of \u201cdemanding a significant fee increase\u201d that resulted in the station being pulled.\n\nCBS has the broadcast rights for Super Bowl 50 between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers, of course. The iconic American event kicks off at 6:30 PM EST on February 7th.\n\nSuper Impact\n\nThe significance in Cox failing to come to terms with the CBS affiliate owned by Nexstar Broadcasting Group is monumental with the Super Bowl less than a week out. Cox is the largest cable television supplier for Las Vegas\u2019 nearly two million residents.\n\nThe blackout could lead to locals venturing to the Strip or to downtown casinos to watch Super Bowl 50 in sports books lounges among both bettors and tourists. Instead of Las Vegans gathering in their homes for NFL parties and casual betting, they might venture into casino sports book to watch Peyton Manning try and win his second NFL championship ring.\n\nAnd theoretically, at least, more casino patrons would lead to more total wagers.\n\nPower Struggle\n\nThe CBS dispute concerns how much Cox should pay Nexstar to obtain the rights to broadcast KLAS-TV. Cox alleges that Nexstar is looking to boost its own bottom line by ramping up retransmission fees.\n\n\u201cNexstar has not changed their offer in two weeks and is still demanding three times more for its free over-the-air stations for Cox customers.\u201d\n\nNexstar portrays a different story, naturally, claiming \u201cCox\u2019s ill-advised action\u201d deprives viewers of \u201clocal news and programming produced specifically for these local communities.\u201d\n\nThe two sides are arguing over pennies, but those cents quickly add up.\n\nCox and other cable service providers pay on average less than $1 a month per household to distribute local network affiliates. By comparison, ESPN receives around $8 from Cox each month per subscriber, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nNexstar is looking to enhance revenues by increasing its retransmission fees, but Cox says the surcharge would impair its own goal of providing \u201cfree\u201d TV to its customers while \u201cmeeting our responsibilities to provide \u2026 the most value.\u201d\n\n\u201cFree\u201d is a bit of a misnomer, of course, as Cox, like all cable providers, charges customers its own monthly fees, based on packages that can include movie channels, DVRs, and other add-ons. Even a basic channel lineup still costs with the cable company.\n\nCox and Nexstar are continuing their negotiations, but as of now, the only thing the two agree on is that they hope to reach an agreement before Super Bowl 50 kicks off on Sunday.\n\nThe Cox/Nexstar holdout is just the latest development in Las Vegas that has locals in an uproar. Two weeks ago, MGM Resorts announced it\u2019s doing away with free parking at 11 of its properties along the Strip, tacking on a $10 surcharge per day for even self-parking privileges.\n\nThat move has caused so much outrage among local residents that MGM CEO Jim Murren, who said he\u2019d predicted some ire from the Las Vegas populace, was taken aback by the vitriol.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Las Vegas sports books stand to see a significant increase in traffic for this Sunday's Super Bowl 50 should Cox Communications and CBS fail to reach a deal by that time.", "og": {"site_name": "Casino.org", "description": "Las Vegas sports books stand to see a significant increase in traffic for this Sunday's Super Bowl 50 should Cox Communications and CBS fail to reach a deal by that time.", "title": "Las Vegas Sports Books Might Profit Off CBS Dispute with Cox, No Superbowl Likely for Sin City Cable Users", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1813, "identifier": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed.jpg", "height": 1209}, "updated_time": "2016-02-01T21:08:34-07:00", "url": "https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-sports-books-might-profit-off-cbs-dispute-with-cox-no-superbowl-likely-for-sin-city-cable-users", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Las Vegas sports books stand to see a significant increase in traffic for this Sunday's Super Bowl 50 should Cox Communications and CBS fail to reach a deal by that time.", "title": "Las Vegas Sports Books Might Profit Off CBS Dispute with Cox, No Superbowl Likely for Sin City Cable Users", "image": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/unnamed.jpg", "creator": "@Casino_Org", "site": "@Casino_Org", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-01T16:58:47-07:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/corg_favicon.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/Casino.org", "section": "Rumors", "published_time": "2016-02-01T16:58:47-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T21:08:34-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Las Vegas sports books are gearing up for their busiest weekend of the year, as Super Bowl 50 goes down this Sunday.\nA major rate dispute has put local CBS and Cox Communications in locked-horn battle, and the biggest losers right now are Sin City viewers.\nThe Cox/Nexstar holdout is just the latest development in Las Vegas that has locals in an uproar.\nCBS has the broadcast rights for Super Bowl 50 between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers, of course.\nBy comparison, ESPN receives around $8 from Cox each month per subscriber, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal."}
