(AP) \u2014 A second man has pleaded guilty to his role in the theft of more than $400 from a group of Girl Scouts selling cookies at a Massachusetts store.\n\nCassidy Michalski, of Deerfield, was sentenced to three years of probation after pleading guilty Wednesday to theft, assault and battery with a deadly weapon and shoplifting. The Daily Hampshire Gazette (http://bit.ly/1TQx63c ) reports that the first charge was downgraded from unarmed robbery in a plea deal.\n\nAuthorities say Michalski served as the getaway driver after Nicholas Taverna stole a cash box from the 11- and 12-year-old scouts selling cookies at a Walmart in January 2013.\n\nProsecutors say the men had planned to steal cellphones from the store to sell for heroin money.\n\nTaverna received the same sentence earlier this week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Getaway driver in $400 Girl Scout cookie heist pleads guilty - AP News: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.
