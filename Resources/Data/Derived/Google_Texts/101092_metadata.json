That is not going to be good long term for America\u2019s security,\u201d he said.\n\nCongressional Republicans like DeSantis are enraged by comments made in last week\u2019s New York Times Magazine by Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security advisor for strategic communications for U.S. In the piece, Rhodes is quoted as boasting about creating an \u201cecho chamber\u201d of experts and journalists supportive of the deal.\n\nThe story depicts Rhodes as leading an effort to create a false narrative about the nuclear deal \u2014 that it would empower Iran\u2019s moderates at the expense of Supreme Leader Ali Khamanei and other hardliners.\n\nThe deal sets limits on Iran\u2019s ability to build a nuclear weapon, while freeing the Middle Eastern nation of international sanctions.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote,\u201d Rhodes said in the piece. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\nDeSantis says that the warning lights should have been flickering when Rhodes called the Iran nuclear deal the \u201cObamacare of the second term.\u201d\n\nNoting how several promises made by Obama regarding the Affordable Care Act crumbled when enacted, DeSantis said the same thing was happening with the Iran deal.\n\n\u201cThe myth of the moderate and the opening and the ability to change the world for the better. They knew that wasn\u2019t the case, they knew exactly who they were going to be empowering,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers of the House Oversight Committee want Rhodes to testify early next week to elaborate on his comments in the Times. So far, he reportedly has resisted the request.\n\nDeSantis also blasted Hillary Clinton regarding her email issues while serving as secretary of state. He says that as somebody who dealt with classified material while serving in Iraq for the Navy as a JAG officer, he would be in serious trouble if he did what Clinton is accused of doing.\n\nHaving said that, he told the group of Republicans they shouldn\u2019t \u201chold your breath\u201d regarding the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nReferring to how President Obama recently said that while the White House doesn\u2019t get involved in such cases, he\u2019s sure that Clinton didn\u2019t betray national security, DeSantis says it\u2019s obvious what will happen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sending a signal to (Attorney General) Loretta Lynch to say, \u201chey, no go on this, go ahead and pass on the prosecution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Ron DeSantis says that while he always opposed the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran last year, he thought at worst they were\u00a0simply\u00a0naive about the Iranian regime.
