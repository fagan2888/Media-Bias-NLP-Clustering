But Richardson\u2019s letter today forming the committee initially left out the words \u201cmanaged care,\u201d and originally appeared to show Richardson forming a Task Force for the purposes of Democrat-backed Medicaid expansion. A corrected version of Richardson\u2019s letter dubs it the \u201cTask Force for Examining Statewide Medicaid Delivery Models.\u201d\n\nRichardson appointed 5 lawmakers to the 13-member task force. The members are: Representatives Marsha Haefner, who is chairing the task force, Sue Allen, Justin Alferman, Deb Lavender, the sole Democrat, and Jim Neely.\n\nAlso appointed to the task force: Eric Rassmusssen with BJC Accountable Care, Brent McGinty, executive director for Missouri Community Mental Health Centers Association, Janet Grant, Regional Director for Aetna, Melissa Robinson, executive director of Black Health Care Coalition, Leslie Anders, public policy and advocacy director for Services for Independent Living, Dr. Rolfe McCoy, Missouri Dental Association and Chuck Hollister, Missouri Psychological Association.\n\nHummel\u2019s statement notes the mistake with glee.\n\n\u201cHouse Speaker Todd Richardson\u2019s action today creating the Task Force for Expanding Medicaid Statewide is a welcome, though unexpected, turn of events,\u201d said House Minority Jake Hummel in a statement. \u201cIt is encouraging majority Republicans have finally recognized that their failure to embrace Medicaid expansion and the economic and public health benefits it would bring to Missouri has just been a big mistake.
