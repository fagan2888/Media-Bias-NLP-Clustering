(AP) \u2014 An Army officer stripped of a medal for heroism under fire and his right to call himself a Green Beret is fighting for his military career after accusations he tracked down and killed a suspected bomb-maker in Afghanistan.\n\nThough a criminal investigation failed to find remains of his alleged victim and didn\u2019t result in charges against Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, he\u2019s been targeted for possible dismissal from the Army and the consequent loss of veteran\u2019s benefits with a less-than-honorable discharge.\n\nA Fort Bragg hearing before three, higher-ranked Special Forces officers could meet later this month to weigh arguments from Golsteyn\u2019s attorney why he should remain on active duty.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that Golsteyn will receive a fair and impartial hearing. Based on the Army\u2019s actions and decisions thus far, I regret to say this won\u2019t be the case,\u201d one of the soldier\u2019s defenders, U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., wrote Wednesday to Army Secretary John McHugh. Army brass have kept Hunter updated on the case.\n\nOthers believe the Army is obligated to act because the Geneva Conventions governing warfare forbid arbitrary killings by troops, said Jeffrey K. Walker, a St. John\u2019s University criminal law professor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a minimum protection anybody gets at any time, no matter how you categorize them or how you categorize the conflict. That is the basic floor below which nobody can drop as far as protections go,\u201d said Walker, a retired Air Force officer and former military lawyer. \u201cArbitrary deprivation of life is at the top of the list of things you cannot do.\u201d\n\nGolsteyn\u2019s roller-coaster military career from battlefield hero to whispers of a war crime is rooted in the deadly month of February 2010, when American-led allied forces seized the Taliban stronghold of Marjah in Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand province.\n\nInsurgent snipers unleashed fire on Forward Operating Base McQueary. A patrol of about 80 troops headed out across muddy poppy fields to find the gunmen. Over a four-hour firefight, Golsteyn repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire as he helped evacuate a wounded Afghan soldier and directed repeated airstrikes onto the enemy, according to the Army\u2019s narrative of why he was awarded a Silver Star medal.\n\nThen, about two months before being promoted from captain to major in November 2011, he had an interview with the CIA. He talked about something he\u2019d done during the 2010 deployment before the battle near Marjah.\n\nGolsteyn \u201cclaimed to have captured and shot and buried a suspected IED bomb maker. He further went to comment that he went back out with two others to cremate the body and dispose of the remains,\u201d according to a memo summarizing the Golsteyn case. \u201cCapt. Golsteyn stated that he knew it was illegal but was not remorseful as he had solid intelligence and his actions protected the safety of his fellow teammates.\u201d\n\nThe Army\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division, acting on the CIA\u2019s tip, could find no one who corroborated Golsteyn\u2019s claim to have hunted the bomb-maker after an attack that killed two Marines. Nor could they find any cremated remains of the Afghan. Despite that, investigators said \u201cGolsteyn committed the offenses of murder and conspiracy based on the interview provided by the CIA,\u201d according to the Sept. 29 memo first published by the web site The Intercept. Lt. Col. Christopher Kasker, a spokesman for McHugh, confirmed the memo is authentic.\n\nBut the American legal system requires witnesses, a body or some evidence that a crime occurred, Walker said, so Golsteyn\u2019s statement isn\u2019t enough to prosecute him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have something in addition to somebody\u2019s confession to convict him of a crime,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat\u2019s a safeguard against official misconduct and abuse. If all you need is a confession, well let\u2019s just beat a confession out of the guy and we\u2019re all done.\u201d\n\nLast fall, McHugh revoked Golsteyn\u2019s Silver Star presented three years earlier. The Army head also rejected a recommendation to upgrade Golsteyn\u2019s honor to the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest military decoration a soldier can receive for extraordinary heroism.\n\nIn February, the Army initiated the process to kick Golsteyn out of the active-duty military. He was taken out of action and assigned to a headquarters unit.\n\nArmy regulations for discharging officers list potential reasons as substandard performance, national security interests, misconduct, moral or professional dereliction, or \u201cderogatory information contained in the officer\u2019s records combined with other known deficiencies.\u201d Army Special Forces Command spokeswoman Maj. Allison Aguilar said she was barred from describing which reasons were given in Golsteyn\u2019s case.\n\nAn inquiry board is scheduled to decide whether Golsteyn can stay in the Army or be discharged, and whether a discharge would be honorable or something less.\n\n\u201cThe discharge normally will be based on a pattern of behavior and duty performance, rather than an isolated incident,\u201d Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria, a spokesman for U.S. Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, wrote in an email describing the process.\n\nGolsteyn\u2019s Colorado-based lawyer, Phillip Stackhouse, said the soldier is simultaneously being evaluated for medical retirement due to combat-related spine and \u201cmental health issues.\u201d But the inquiry board\u2019s decision and potential discharge \u201ccould eviscerate the retirement,\u201d Stackhouse said.\n\nGolsteyn\u2019s collected an online army of supporters in and out of the military, many of whom argue an exemplary soldier\u2019s career is being sacrificed on thin evidence of going too far in the field.\n\n\u201cOur Special Forces are trained to do things to bad people to help keep us safe,\u201d said Joe Kasper, Hunter\u2019s spokesman. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to do it within the letter of the law, we get that. But they are trained to do a very dangerous mission and a lot of time you, I, and everybody else in this country don\u2019t exactly always know what that entails. But they do a lot of things to keep us safe.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEmery P. Dalesio can be reached at http://twitter.com/emerydalesio\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
