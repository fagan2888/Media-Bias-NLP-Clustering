Over the last decade, more than half of the visits to San Diego emergency departments have been for non-emergencies.

That's the word from local health officials, who recommend that San Diegans go to an emergency room only if they're suffering an urgent crisis.

Alexiou said coverage expansion through the Affordable Care Act and Medi-Cal may be behind the problem.
