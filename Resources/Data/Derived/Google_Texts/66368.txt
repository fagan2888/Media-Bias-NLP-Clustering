On this week’s “Saturday Night Live,” Cecily Strong played Brooke Baldwin of CNN Newsroom. During the sketch, she consults with correspondents who explain current events including the Germanwings crash, US-Iran nuclear weapons negotiations and Indiana’s “religious freedom” law with a variety of increasingly unhelpful “reenactments.”

“You’re watching the loose collection of daytime nonsense that we call the CNN Newsroom,” Strong says. “That means you’re either sitting in an airport, or you’re at home flipping through the channels and you’ve had a small stroke.”

While the news network doesn’t always get footage of a newsworthy event, as Bobby Moynihan explains, “CNN has the next best thing.” That means re-enactments using very basic computerized graphics, a group of enthusiastic puppets and an avant-garde dance troupe.
