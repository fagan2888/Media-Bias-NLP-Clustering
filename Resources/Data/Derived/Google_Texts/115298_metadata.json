They were returning to their posts for the Christmas holiday. Talking with them afterwards, I was struck by the fact that in that far-off continent Moslems, Hindus, Buddhists, as well as Christians, pause from their labors on the twenty-fifth of December to celebrate the birthday of the Prince of Peace.\n\nThere could be no more striking proof that Christmas is truly the universal holiday of all men. It is the day when all of us dedicate our thoughts to others, when all are reminded that mercy and compassion are the enduring virtues, when all show by small deed and set that, verily, it is more blessed to give than to receive. It is the day when we remind ourselves that men can live in peace with his neighbors, and that it is the peace-makers who are truly blessed.\n\nIn this year of 1962 we greet each other at Christmas with some special sense of the blessings of peace. This has been a year of peril, a year when peace was threatened. But, it has been a year when peril was faced and when reason ruled. As a result, we may talk at this Christmas just a little more confidently of peace on earth and good will among men. As a result your hopes are a little more higher than before; so are mine. We have much yet to do. We still have need with Tiny Tim to ask that God bless us every one. But yet I think we can enter this season of good-will with more than usual joy in our hearts. I wish you all a Merry Christmas.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/24/president-kennedys-1962-christmas-address/", "article_author_name": "John F.
