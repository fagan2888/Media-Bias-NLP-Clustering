Before checking that box off, there are just a few important things you should be aware of.\n\nI spoke with Dr. Tim Taber, who gave me the ins and outs of organ donation. Dr. Taber is a transplant nephrologist, the medical director at Indiana University Health, and serves as the chief medical officer for the Indiana Organ Procurement Organization. IU Health is one of the largest transplant centers in the country and performs nearly 500 solid-organ transplants each year. Here\u2019s a few of the most common organ donation myths debunked:\n\nMyth #1: My license says I\u2019m an organ donor, so my organs are automatically going to be donated.\n\nFalse: In many hospitals, if your next of kin says \u2018no,\u2019 then your organs will not be donated. However, Dr. Taber mentioned how in states, like Indiana, there are stiff laws, therefore if you say you want to be a donor, then doctors are bound by state law to follow through with that.\n\nBecause some states rely on your next of kin, it is very important to talk to your family if you would like to donate your organs. \u201cSay I want to be a donor and this is why because when somebody dies, it\u2019s the worst day for their family ever. That day for the rest of their lives will be the day that their loved one died and the last thing they want to think about is donation, but if they\u2019ve already had that conversation with that loved one and they know that the loved one wants it and why they want it, then it\u2019s much easier for them in that situation,\u201d Dr. Taber said in a phone interview.\n\nMyth #2: If you are a registered donor, a doctor might declare you dead before it\u2019s appropriate.\n\nFalse: \u201cOur physicians are not out there to create donation possibilities. They\u2019re not out there to declare someone brain dead that\u2019s not brain dead. That\u2019s not a mistake that anybody ever wants to make. You know, I think that\u2019s the biggest concern that people have is that they hear stories about so and so was declared brain dead and then a week later he went home and now he's fully functional,\u201d Dr. Taber said.\n\nMyth #3: If I check off the \u2018organ donor box\u2019 on my license and I get in a near-death car accident, doctors are less likely to save my life.\n\nFalse: \u201cPhysicians hate for people to die, and they don\u2019t want them to die,\u201d Dr. Taber said. It is important to note that the people who declare a person brain dead are not the same people who approach the family for organ donation.\n\nMyth #4: If you are rich or famous, you can get moved to the top of the waiting list.\n\nFalse: There are few ways to move to the top of the waiting list, but being rich is not one of those ways. United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) maintains a database of all patients waiting for organ transplants. \u201cIt\u2019s not done locally, it\u2019s done on a national basis by a national computer, it\u2019s taken out of the hands of everybody else, so there\u2019s no opportunity for it to be fixed, people worry about that too. People worry it will only go to somebody like Mark Cuban, which you can\u2019t do that, it won\u2019t impact that,\u201d Dr. Taber said.\n\nOne way to get to the top of the list is if you donate a kidney and experience life-threatening problems down the road. It is completely safe to donate a kidney because you only need one kidney to survive, not two; however, \u201cThere is a small percentage of people who then develop kidney failure, usually 20 or 30 years later or longer. If that happens, then they go to the top of the list when they have issues,\u201d Dr. Taber said.\n\nMyth #5: If I donate my organs, I can\u2019t have an open-casket funeral.\n\nFalse: \u201cYou can certainly have an open-casket funeral after donation,\u201d Dr. Taber said. Donors\u2019 bodies are clothed for burial, so you won\u2019t see any sign of donation.\n\nOrgan donation is a vital part of the world\u2019s medical system. Each day an average of 79 people receive organ transplants, but an average of 18 people die each day waiting for transplants that can\u2019t take place because of the shortage of donated organs, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. One organ donor can save up to eight lives.\n\nIf you would like to sign up to become an organ donor, you can do so here. After you sign up, it is very important to discuss your decision with your family because it makes it a lot easier down the road.\n\n\u201cThese people whether they\u2019re living or deceased donors, they\u2019re heroes and they save lives. We cannot take care of these patients and we can\u2019t transplant these patients without frankly, the kindness of strangers. It is a wonderful thing. It is maybe the best thing I think you can do for somebody. There is nothing good that comes out of death, except for transplantation,\u201d Dr. Taber said.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Indiana University Health Photo courtesy of Indiana University Health", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "organ donation myths", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Before deciding you don\u2019t want to be an organ donor, learn the truths about the donation process and have your myths debunked because the things you may have heard from your friends, family, or around the web are most likely false.", "title": "The Truth About Saving Lives: 5 Myths About Organ Donation", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/5-organ-donation-myths-my-license-says-im-donor-why-werent-my-organs-donated-289144", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/organ-donation-saves-lives.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before deciding you don\u2019t want to be an organ donor, learn the truths about the donation process and have your myths debunked because the things you may have heard from your friends, family, or around the web are most likely false.", "title": "The Truth About Saving Lives: 5 Myths About Organ Donation", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/5-organ-donation-myths-my-license-says-im-donor-why-werent-my-organs-donated-289144", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/organ-donation-saves-lives.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/organ-donation-saves-lives.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-20T16:45:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-20T16:45:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Before deciding you don\u2019t want to be an organ donor, learn the truths about the donation process and have your myths debunked because the things you may have heard from your friends, family, or around the web are most likely false."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0981\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a few of the most common organ donation myths debunked:Myth #1: My license says I\u2019m an organ donor, so my organs are automatically going to be donated.\nSome people might be hesitant to check off the \u2018organ donor box\u2019 when applying for or renewing their license, but they shouldn\u2019t be.\nIf you would like to sign up to become an organ donor, you can do so here.\nMyth #3: If I check off the \u2018organ donor box\u2019 on my license and I get in a near-death car accident, doctors are less likely to save my life.\nIf that happens, then they go to the top of the list when they have issues,\u201d Dr. Taber said."}
