John Kasich from boasting about slowing the program\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the best growth rate in the country,\u201d Kasich said during a Fox News appearance the day he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nOhio\u2019s Medicaid program is growing at \u201cless than 4 percent,\u201d Kasich assured Fox News viewers. He used an even more impressive number at Wednesday\u2019s Republican debate on CNBC.\n\n\u201cIn my state, we took Medicaid \u2014 the hardest program to control \u2014 and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2 1/2 percent,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cCan you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2 1/2 percent?\u201d\n\nRegardless of what voters can imagine, Ohio\u2019s Medicaid enrollment and spending have grown at a much faster clip than 2 1/2 percent annually since Kasich became governor in 2011.\n\nUsing Kasich\u2019s first year in office as a baseline, Ohio Medicaid spending increased by an annual average of 8.2 percent from 2011-15; enrollment increased by an average of 9.1 percent per year.\n\nMedicaid has grown rapidly in Ohio because Kasich added working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities to the welfare program to bring billions in new Obamacare spending to the state.\n\nOhio Medicaid enrollment rocketed from 2.2 million when Kasich took office in 2011 to three million when Kasich\u2019s first term ended in January \u2014 an increase of 800,000 welfare recipients in four years.\n\nWith the state slowly rebounding from the 2007-09 recession, Ohio spent $17.7 billion on its Medicaid program for the aged, blind, disabled, children, pregnant women and impoverished families in fiscal 2011.\n\nAs a result of Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, Ohio Medicaid spending ballooned to $23.5 billion in fiscal year 2015 \u2014 a $5.8 billion bigger price tag than just four years earlier.\n\nOhio Medicaid spending is expected to total $28.2 billion in 2017, a 59 percent increase from when Kasich took office and an average annual increase of 9.8 percent during Kasich\u2019s first six years as governor.\n\nBut Kasich, a Republican, continues to insist he dramatically reduced Medicaid growth compared to his spendthrift predecessor, Democrat Ted Strickland.\n\nOhio Department of Medicaid data on total Medicaid spending go back only as far as 2008, Strickland\u2019s second year in office. Medicaid spending increased by an average of 9.6 percent from 2008-11.\n\nRELATED: Ohio\u2019s dependence on Medicaid is the worst in the Midwest\n\nEager to distance himself from his big-spending record, Kasich has kept repeating his Medicaid growth talking point since the CNBC debate.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is a program for the poor, and I took the growth of it from 10 percent down to 2 1/2 percent,\u201d Kasich said when Fox News host Eric Bolling asked about Obamacare expansion on Friday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d\n\nAt an Iowa town hall Tuesday and in an Iowa Public Television interview set to air later in the week, Kasich claimed he reduced Ohio\u2019s Medicaid growth from 10 percent to 2 1/2 percent.\n\nHow does Kasich explain the gulf between his rhetoric and actual Ohio Medicaid growth? The governor\u2019s office failed to respond to questions from Ohio Watchdog about Medicaid spending and enrollment.\n\nNicole Kaeding, a budget analyst who has reviewed Kasich\u2019s record for the libertarian Cato Institute, says Kasich is able to claim fiscal responsibility in state spending because \u201che has shifted much of the burden to federal taxpayers.\u201d\n\nAll Obamacare expansion benefit costs \u2014 which have exceeded $5 billion in Ohio \u2014 are covered by federal taxpayers through 2016. Because Kasich expanded Medicaid unilaterally, Obamacare expansion was initially separate from the state\u2019s General Revenue Fund budget.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kasich continues to selectively choose Ohio fiscal data when discussing his record as governor,\u201d Kaeding said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cThe truth is spending continues to increase each year in Ohio.\u201d\n\nKaeding noted state taxpayers will be on the hook for a share of Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion costs starting in 2017, with the state share increasing to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nCosts are likely to begin crowding out other state government priorities in the near future. In September, Obamacare expansion cost nearly as much as the state\u2019s public safety and K-12 education programs combined.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whiplash-inducing Ohio Medicaid costs and enrollment haven't stopped Ohio Gov.
