Sony's online PlayStation store and Microsoft's Xbox site experienced disruptions to users on Christmas Day in the latest possible cyberattack on the electronics and entertainment companies.

The PlayStation Store Twitter feed says some users were having trouble logging into its network. It says engineers are investigating.

A notice on the Xbox website said, "We're aware of this issue, and we're working to find a fix ASAP!"

Earlier this month the PlayStation store also experienced spells of inaccessibility. That followed a cyberattack on computer systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment that led to the release of confidential information on the Internet.

A group calling itself Lizard Squad appeared to take responsibility for the disruptions on its Twitter account.
