Chris Christie\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nTom Moran, editorial page editor for The Star-Ledger, criticized the coveted endorsement from the influential newspaper in a signed column, writing that he called the publication\u2019s editorial page editor, Grant Bosse, to discuss the editorial.\n\n\u201cThe paper knows almost nothing about his record as governor,\u201d Moran wrote. \u201cThe paper has been paying close attention to Christie's speeches in New Hampshire and his visit to the editorial board. And that's a dangerous game when it comes to a slick character like our governor.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMoran reprimanded the New Hampshire paper for neglecting to mention Christie's controversial pension reform plan or the Bridgegate scandal, in which a top Christie aide was fired following politically motivated lane closures on the busy George Washington Bridge.\n\nDuring the call with Moran, Bosse said the lane closures had \u201cnothing to do with the governor\u201d and that \u201cI don\u2019t know if we went into the weeds on pension reform.\u201d\n\nMoran also panned the editorial for not focusing on the New Jersey governor\u2019s jobs record. Bosse said during the call with Moran that \"politicians don't create jobs, so we didn't want to give that any credibility,\u201d according to Moran.\n\n\u201cAnd this editorial confirms my worse fears about this presidential race,\u201d Moran wrote. \u201cIt's all about performance, not substance.
