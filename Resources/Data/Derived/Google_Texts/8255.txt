Memorial Day is traditionally celebrated on the last Monday in May. Originally known as Decoration Day, the Department of Veterans Affairs notes that it began after the Civil War to commemorate the soldiers who died in the conflict. By the 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who died while serving in the military.

Throughout New Jersey, veterans groups, municipalities and civic organizations hold services honoring those who gave their lives for their country.

But the holiday also is celebrated with parades, picnics and music. And that’s as it should be. For on Memorial Day, we not only respect the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom but also celebrate that freedom.

Coming soon: Bars and taverns. If you have photos of patrons enjoying the ambiance of some of the state’s classic imbiberies from 1984 and before, we’d love to see them and possibly use them in a gallery or Glimpse of History column. Attach your jpg images and email them to ghatala@starledger.com
