John Kasich a steady presence on NH airwaves

Ohioans will get their turn soon enough. But for now, it’s New Hampshire residents who are being bombarded with political ads on TV.

And since we’re not in New Hampshire, most Ohioans aren’t aware just how familiar the Granite State is becoming with our governor, John Kasich. As of Sunday afternoon, New Hampshire broadcast TV has aired an ad mentioning Kasich no fewer than 18 times a day since mid-November.

Many of those ads were paid for by the Kasich campaign and New Day for America, a pro-Kasich super political action committee, or super PAC. But others are ads attacking Kasich, who is staking his presidential campaign on success in New Hampshire, that were paid for by super PACs aligned with other so-called establishment candidates.

Thanks to the Political TV Ad Archive, which also provided the data used in this story, here are all 14 Kasich ads — pro and con — that have aired in New Hampshire in the build-up to the state’s Feb. 9 primary. (This does not include a 15th ad attacking Sen. Marco Rubio, financed by New Day for America, that never aired after the Kasich campaign disavowed it.)
