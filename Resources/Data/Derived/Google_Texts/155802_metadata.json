After ten years in elected office, political scion and Congress Party vice president Rahul Gandhi sat down for his first formal prime-time grilling, delivered by TimesNow\u2019s editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami. In the hour and twenty minutes that followed, Gandhi was at turns confident and worryingly vague, expressing some broad political goals like empowering women and opening the political system while coming up short on what, exactly, another term for Congress would look like as India gets ready to vote this spring.\n\nGoswami did not spare his high-profile guest, and rightly so. Congress recently announced Gandhi would lead the party in its campaign ahead of national elections scheduled for May, but stopped short of naming him as a prime ministerial candidate, ending speculation over whether he would go head to head with opposition candidate Narendra Modi in the coming months. The move was interpreted by many as a play on Congress\u2019 part to shield Gandhi, 43, from a potential trouncing by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in May\u2019s polls \u2014 or even worse, given the fates of his grandmother and father, both of whom were assassinated.\n\nBut the announcement still left India\u2019s ruling party with a frontman who has not exactly been front and center. Though Gandhi\u2019s public appearances have increased since Congress\u2019 drubbing in key state polls last month, Indian voters have not had much of a chance to hear Gandhi riff on his ideas for the country or on the controversies facing the sitting government.\n\n(MORE: Gandhi Scion Declines Chance to Be India\u2019s Next Leader)\n\nLast night, they did. In course of the long interview, certain things were clear. Gandhi\u2019s sincerity on his pet issues like getting India\u2019s youth involved in politics, for instance, came through. So did his conflicted attitude toward his own role in India\u2019s dynastic political system and the expectations swirling around him, most obvious when he started referring to himself in the third person. When asked if he was avoiding a direct face-off with Modi, Gandhi gave this reply: \u201cTo understand that question you have to understand who Rahul Gandhi is and what Rahul Gandhi\u2019s circumstances have been and if you delve into that you will get an answer to the question of what Rahul Gandhi is scared of what he is not scared of.\u201d (The answer: \u201cabsolutely nothing,\u201d he said.)\n\nWhat also seems clear now is that anybody still waiting for a Modi-Gandhi showdown is likely to be disappointed. Gandhi skirted the question of whether he would debate Modi, and refused to take Goswami\u2019s bait to directly attack the polarizing and popular candidate. \u201cThe BJP has a PM candidate, the BJP believes in concentration of power in the hands of one person,\u201d he said. \u201cI fundamentally disagree with that.\u201d When asked about Modi\u2019s involvement in Gujarat\u2019s 2002 communal riots \u2014 which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently characterized as presiding over the \u201cmassacre of innocent citizens of the streets\u201d\u2014 Gandhi said that Modi\u2019s government was complicit in \u201cabetting and pushing the riots further,\u201d but offered no specifics. He also dodged giving an apology on behalf of Congress for lives lost during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.\n\nGoswami\u2019s audience no doubt appreciated that he did not let Gandhi off the hook on these important issues and others, including the allegations of corruption that continue to dog the current government. But drilling down into a few specific topics so deeply did sort of suck the air out conversation, and left little room for voters to hear about what a third Congress led government would look like next year. A few moments contained more focused information, such as Gandhi saying he wanted to increasing manufacturing jobs and was open to further debate on whether political parties should be subject to India\u2019s Right to Information (RTI) law. But as much as it was a window for Goswami to grill, it was a moment for Gandhi to use his generous airtime to directly communicate with voters. Showing up under the glare of the camera lights signals Gandhi may finally be embracing his new role at this crucial moment for his party. But to lead it to victory, he\u2019s going to need more than 80 minutes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mixed performance from the political scion who will head his party's next election campaign", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "A mixed performance from the political scion who will head his party's next election campaign", "title": "Rahul on Rahul: Indian Voters Get a Prime-Time Look at Congress' Main Man", "url": "http://time.com/2234/rahul-on-rahul-indian-voters-get-a-prime-time-look-at-congress-main-man/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/rahul_gandhi_0128.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/rahul_gandhi_0128.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "A mixed performance from the political scion who will head his party's next election campaign", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rahul on Rahul: Indian Voters Get a Prime-Time Look at Congress' Main Man"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "bharatiya janata party, congress party vice president rahul gandhi, india, narendra modi, political system, prime minister manmohan singh", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bharatiya janata party, congress party vice president rahul gandhi, india, narendra modi, political system, prime minister manmohan singh"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dcc\"", "article_summary": "After ten years in elected office, political scion and Congress Party vice president Rahul Gandhi sat down for his first formal prime-time grilling, delivered by TimesNow\u2019s editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami.\nWhen asked if he was avoiding a direct face-off with Modi, Gandhi gave this reply: \u201cTo understand that question you have to understand who Rahul Gandhi is and what Rahul Gandhi\u2019s circumstances have been and if you delve into that you will get an answer to the question of what Rahul Gandhi is scared of what he is not scared of.\u201d (The answer: \u201cabsolutely nothing,\u201d he said.)\nBut the announcement still left India\u2019s ruling party with a frontman who has not exactly been front and center.\nBut as much as it was a window for Goswami to grill, it was a moment for Gandhi to use his generous airtime to directly communicate with voters.\nGandhi skirted the question of whether he would debate Modi, and refused to take Goswami\u2019s bait to directly attack the polarizing and popular candidate."}
