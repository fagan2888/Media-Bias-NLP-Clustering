Lake Lanier Islands is increasing its gate fees from $10 to $15 effective Oct. 1.

The measure is in response to $15 million in additional amenities at the resort, as well as facilities upgrades, new programs and other investments over the past four years, according to Bill Donohue, executive director of the Lake Lanier Islands Development Authority.

The development authority unanimously approved Lake Lanier Islandsâ€™ request during a meeting earlier this week.

The Lake Lanier Islands Development Authority meets every other month to discuss, among other things, capital investment and infrastructure at Lake Lanier Islands.
