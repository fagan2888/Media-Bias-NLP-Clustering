Wade should be treated as unassailable settled law, and seeks:\n\nto encourage the academic community to broaden the narrow focus of scholarship in reproductive rights and justice from the questions of whether Roe was correctly decided, to an examination of different factors that are necessary for justice in area of reproductive health policies.\n\nNot that I expected it anyway, but I don't think we'll be getting much objective reporting on court proceedings relating to the HHS contraception mandate from Ms. Carmon this year. So I resolve this year not to believe a word she writes on those matters.\n\nCross-posted at BizzyBlog.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Apparently, \"I will think before I tweet\" should be on Irin Carmon's New Year's resolution list.
