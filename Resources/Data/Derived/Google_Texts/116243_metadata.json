Netflix owns the exclusive rights to the film, according to The New York Times, which also reported last year that the company is pushing for more cause-related documentaries.In 2015, Netflix will triple the hours of original programming it released in 2014 and will spend a projected $3 billion on content licensing.\u201cWe have been trying to increase our access to new films,\u201d said Netflix Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Friedland. \u201cOur belief is that the whole system is incredibly antiquated and we should be focusing on getting movies to people as quickly as possible.\u201dAt Sundance in January, Netflix premiered its first original documentary, \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone,\u201d which details the life of legendary singer and civil rights activist Nina Simone.While the Internet streaming company has purchased the distribution rights to other documentaries like \u201cMitt,\u201d about Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential aspirations, and \u201cThe Square,\u201d about the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d is the first originally produced documentary Netflix has been involved with since its inception in 1997.Netflix does not release information about what its viewers are watching or the cost-efficiency of documentaries and indies, but the company has said it is committed to maintaining a large portfolio of content that appeals to diverse subscriber tastes.\u201cWe have long supported indie film and docs dating back to when we were mainly in the DVD business,\u201d Friedland said. \u201cPeople who love documentaries really love docs and they tend to be very loyal to places that program effectively to them.\u201dThe company financed \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d in its entirety after seeing an eight-minute teaser, leaving the creative decisions up to the documentary\u2019s director, Liz Garbus.\u201cThey weren\u2019t really intrusive at all,\u201d said first-time producer Jayson Jackson, who previously produced theater on Broadway and worked in the music business. \u201cThey wrote the check and they let Liz do her thing.\u201dJackson said that on the business side of film, Netflix functions more like a studio. Because it is so difficult to find funding for documentaries, regardless of the subject or topic, Jackson was thrilled by Netflix\u2019s interest, he said. He considers the company \u201ca vanguard in this space.\u201d\u201cJudging the early success we\u2019ve had, particularly at Sundance, with opening the festival, I think they\u2019ll be encouraged to move forward and do more documentary,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a real boon to creativity and content makers.\u201d\u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d will premiere on Netflix globally in June of this year. Since the Sundance premiere, it has received positive reviews; The Hollywood Reporter compared the bio-doc to a \u201cwell-mastered greatest hits album,\u201d and other reviews highlighted the electrifying quality to Nina Simone\u2019s complex story.Deadline, a Hollywood and media news site, reported in January that Netflix has closed a four-film deal with Mark and Jay Duplass, a prolific team of brothers famous in the independent film circuit and who had their hands in four major Sundance 2015 premieres.In an interview with Variety at Sundance last year, Mark Duplass said: \u201cThe most important part of making a movie is making sure that film streams on Netflix.\u201d\u201cMy first movie made a grand total of $220,000 in theaters but about 5 million people have seen it on Netflix because they can click on it and they can try it out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I really recommend to get your \u2026 movie on Netflix. It made my career.\u201dOther young filmmakers feel similarly. For 22-year-old Lucas Benitez, a filmmaker who attended Sundance this January, Netflix offers a compelling opportunity for indies.\u201cIf independents can\u2019t get wide screen distribution,\u201d he said, \u201cNetflix is a good alternative option.\u201dDillon Kinkead, 23, a cinematographer and director based in Los Angeles who also attended Sundance, paid his first bill as a young adult to Netflix.\u201cThe first thing I got when I got a job was a Netflix account,\u201d he said. \u201cI was 18, I didn\u2019t have a car, I didn\u2019t have to pay rent or anything so Netflix really made more sense.\u201dWhile some welcome Netflix and other Internet streaming companies like Amazon for ushering in a new age of filmmaking, Kinkead was also quick to note the downside.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a double-edged sword,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps by getting more indie films out there, but that means there are a lot more indie films out there, and you won\u2019t get as noticed. It\u2019s a bigger pond.\u201dWhile filmmakers and festival-goers hailed Internet streaming companies as a force in independent film, traditional distributors left the festival with the highest profile titles in their portfolios.The only film Netflix acquired was documentary \u201cHot Girls Wanted,\u201d which focuses on the young women who make their careers in the porn industry. While Netflix bid $5 million for comedy \u201cThe Bronze,\u201d the distribution rights went to Relativity Media, which can offer the wide theatrical release that Netflix can\u2019t.In a video interview with Deadline, Netflix\u2019s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said that Netflix\u2019s role is as a new type of distributor, even though the company will release at least one feature-length film in theaters this year. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about any of my positions or any of my thinking that is anti-theaters at all \u2014 it\u2019s just pro-movies,\u201d he said.Sarandos said he is worried that television is supplanting film within American culture.\u201cThe reason I think television has taken hold is the distribution model for television is fantastic. The day it\u2019s on television \u2014 if you missed it, you have all these different ways that you can jump in,\u201d he said. \u201cVersus if you missed a run in a theater, or worse, if you don\u2019t live anywhere near a theater showing that movie, now you\u2019re going to have to wait a year, two years, three years to see the movie.\u201dSarandos mentioned that a third of all content watched on Netflix is film, which makes it a high priority for the company.Netflix films have done well on the award circuit, garnering 45 Emmy, 10 Golden Globe and two Academy Award nominations since the company first launched original programming in 2012.Homepage photo and logo courtesy of Netflix.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Internet streaming media companies are shaking things up in Hollywood and among the leaders is Netflix, who is pushing into original independent and documentary films.", "title": "Netflix continues push into documentary and independent film - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Yard_Double_Picninc_shot1-0017_V_FINAL.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-13T10:55:25+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/03/13/netflix-push-into-documentary-and-independent-film/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "technology", "published_time": "2015-03-13T10:53:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T10:55:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Internet streaming media companies are shaking things up in Hollywood and among the leaders is Netflix, who is pushing into original independent and documentary films.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Yard_Double_Picninc_shot1-0017_V_FINAL.jpg", "title": "Netflix continues push into documentary and independent film - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebd4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey wrote the check and they let Liz do her thing.\u201dJackson said that on the business side of film, Netflix functions more like a studio.\nNetflix is continuing its push into original programming with independent and documentary films \u2014 like \u201cVirunga,\u201d which was up for an Oscar on Feb. 22 \u2014 and is receiving accolades alongside original television series like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been a real boon to creativity and content makers.\u201d\u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d will premiere on Netflix globally in June of this year.\nIt\u2019s a bigger pond.\u201dWhile filmmakers and festival-goers hailed Internet streaming companies as a force in independent film, traditional distributors left the festival with the highest profile titles in their portfolios.The only film Netflix acquired was documentary \u201cHot Girls Wanted,\u201d which focuses on the young women who make their careers in the porn industry.\nThe day it\u2019s on television \u2014 if you missed it, you have all these different ways that you can jump in,\u201d he said."}
