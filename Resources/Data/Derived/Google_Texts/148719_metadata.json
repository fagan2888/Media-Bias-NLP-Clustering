Dennis Daugaard (R) could still expand Medicaid under Obamacare\n\nSouth Dakota doctors are urging Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, warning that a failure to do so will hurt hospitals financially and raise health care costs for people with private insurance.\n\nCurrent Medicaid eligibility thresholds in most states \u2014 including South Dakota \u2014 are so demanding that they disqualify even the poorest working adults from receiving coverage through the program. In South Dakota, 15 percent of the adult population lives at or below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which works out to be about $11,500 per year for an individual. But just eight percent of adults are covered by Medicaid.\n\nUnder Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, any adult making up to 138 percent FPL would be able enroll in the public health insurance program. That would end up cutting South Dakota\u2019s uninsurance rate by more than half. Without the expansion, on the other hand, South Dakota\u2019s poorest will have to continue relying on the emergency room for their medical services.\n\nDoctors argue that the state\u2019s uninsured won\u2019t be able to afford those procedures, forcing hospitals to swallow a financial loss that they would then pass on to privately-insured consumers by charging them higher prices. \u201cThe citizens of South Dakota are going to continue to get care, but it\u2019s going to be more expensive and it\u2019s not going to have the same kind of outcomes,\u201d said South Dakota State Medical Association President Dr. Daniel Heinemann in an interview with the Rapid City Journal.\n\nDaugaard is reticent to expand Medicaid, echoing other GOP governors\u2019 concerns that the federal government will renege on its commitment to fund the vast majority of expansion\u2019s costs. But Heinemann and other doctors argue that all South Dakota residents would see their medical care costs go up without the Medicaid expansion.\n\nThey also say that giving basic health benefits to the poorest is prudent in the long-term, since low-income residents would then be able to seek out preventative care, improve their personal health, and consequently lower overall health care spending.\n\n\u201cWe know that people who are uninsured are more likely to live longer and have healthier lives,\u201d Heinemann told the Associated Press.\n\nA recent study by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that states refusing to expand Medicaid under Obamacare will leave over 5 million of the poorest Americans without basic health benefits.
