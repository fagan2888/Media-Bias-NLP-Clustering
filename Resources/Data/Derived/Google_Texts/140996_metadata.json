Marco Rubio said what none of his rivals are willing to admit: \u201cLet\u2019s dispel [sic] with the fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He is trying to change this country\u201d \u2014 with astonishing success.\n\nWithout this frame of reference, it\u2019s impossible to understand what happened in the past seven years. The president of the United States is a man of the left \u2014 a hardcore ideologue with a soft facade who wants to make America poorer and weaker, grow government and increase dependence.\n\nIn the incompetent-ideologue debate, the other side is represented by Donald Trump, who responded to Mr. Rubio: \u201cI think we have a president who as a president is totally incompetent. He has no idea of what he is doing and the country is going to hell.\u201d\n\nThe president had no idea that Obamacare would be costly and coercive? He didn\u2019t have an inkling of the impact of a $19 trillion national debt on the economy (almost half accumulated on his watch)? He couldn\u2019t imagine that leaving four Americans to die in Benghazi would show terrorists we have the resolve of the French Army in 1940?\n\nIncompetence is when the outcome is the opposite of what\u2019s intended. Lyndon Johnson intended to win the war on poverty. Instead, it was poverty that won in the inner cities. He intended to defeat communism in Southeast Asia. The outcome was helicopters evacuating our personnel from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in what would soon be Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nLike a guided missile that doesn\u2019t waver from its trajectory, President Obama is right on course. His worldview is that of Saul Alinsky, Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright. When he told us before the 2008 election, \u201cWe\u2019re just five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America,\u201d he was not speaking of a return to constitutional government and fiscal responsibility.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was always intended to be a way station on the road to a medical gulag. The president gave the game away in a 2003 speech to the Illinois AFL-CIO, when he declared: \u201cI happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program.\u201d\n\nThomas Sowell, dean of free-market commentators, says that whether Obamacare is a success or a failure depends on whether the president\u2019s goal was \u201cto improve medical treatment of Americans or leave as his permanent legacy a system of income redistribution through Obamacare and tight government control of the medical profession.\u201d\n\nDid the president believe that executive amnesties would result in improved border security? From Central America alone, 240,000 new illegal immigrants have entered the country since 2012, as Border Patrol agents were ordered to stand down. Illegal immigration is the perfect solvent to erode the national identity the left abhors.\n\nIn Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, food stamp rolls grew 75 times as fast as jobs \u2014 14.7 million new recipients versus 194,000 new jobs. More than 60 percent of the jobs created under this president are low-income employment in food services, home health care and temp work. In January, the labor participation rate was 62.7 percent. More than 90 million Americans are no longer looking for jobs. That\u2019s exactly what the president wants. Every American out of work or in a low-paying job is another vote for more welfare and higher taxes on the rich.\n\nWhen he came to office, the 44th president of the United States told us that America was overbearing, arrogant and a danger to world peace. He apologized for our alleged sins against Islam (from the crusades onward), bowed to the king of Saudi Arabia, created as much distance as politically possible between U.S. policy and Israel, and helped to oust friendly regimes in Egypt and Libya. The former was replaced with the Muslim Brotherhood. The latter descended into chaos.\n\nAfter the president ditched Iraq, the Islamic State became the prom date from Hell. Weeks after we negotiated a deal to lift sanctions on Iran and release $150 billion in frozen assets \u2014 providing a big boost to its nuclear weapons program \u2014 North Korea tested a new ballistic missile.\n\nMr. Obama will leave America in global retreat with our enemies advancing on every front. The Islamic State now has chemical weapons.\n\nAnd still most Republican candidates pretend that Barack Obama is Jerry Lewis in \u201cThe Disorderly Orderly,\u201d instead of Jason Robards as Al Capone in \u201cThe St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Don Feder, a former columnist for the Boston Herald, is a freelance writer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While he was mocked for his performance in the last debate and had a disappointing showing in New Hampshire, Florida Sen.
