At least he knows how to be political!

On Sunday, Donald Trump sat down for an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's State of the Union and addressed quite a few topics from abortion to the Affordable Care Act.

The one we were probably most interested in though — particularly since it's still fresh on everyone's mind after Friday's AH-Mazing decision by the Supreme Court – is where Trump stands on same sex marriage!

The tagline that Mr. Trump seems he will be sticking with for his view on the topic is:

"I'm [for] traditional marriage."

When Tapper pointed out that someone might present Trump with the idea that being married three times isn't necessarily "traditional," Trump first admits these people have a very good point. In true Trump fashion though, he then of course took the opportunity to slyly appeal and compare himself to his interviewer as well as talk up how successful he's been by saying:

"I've been a very hardworking person…I was working, maybe like you, 22 hours a day…I blame myself because my business was so powerful for me. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing…"

We get it Trump. You're successful, let's stick to the questions LOLz!

Seriously though, Trump had some interesting insight and did his best to do some damage control regarding his comments towards Mexico as well.

Ch-ch-check out all he had to say in the video (below)!
