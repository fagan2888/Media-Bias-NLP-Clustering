Hobby Lobby, the challenge to the HHS mandate brought by a Christian-owned family business based in Oklahoma.\n\nIt has also agreed to hear a related case, Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius, which involves the issue of whether a business, as well as its owners, has a right to religious freedom under the First Amendment.\n\nWhile most commentators have treated the news as part of the larger story about the legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the far more important story is the battle for religious freedom.\n\nTwo thousand and fourteen is shaping up to be a momentous, perhaps even defining, year when it comes to religious freedom in the United States. What\u2019s at stake in these cases goes far beyond healthcare\u2014it\u2019s about what we mean when we say \u201cfreedom of religion.\u201d\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe trend over the past decade has been to equate \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d with \u201cfreedom of worship,\u201d that people are free to believe\u2014or not believe\u2014whatever they want. And with a few exceptions, they may also practice with other like-minded people whatever rituals they think their belief requires of them, provided these rituals remain private.\n\nOnce they cross the threshold of the church or their home, however, the ability to put their beliefs into action is increasingly circumscribed.\n\nAs a New Mexico Supreme Court justice wrote this past summer, for religious believers, compromising \u201cthe very religious beliefs that inspire their lives\u201d and \u201c[channeling] their conduct, not their beliefs, so as to leave space for other Americans who believe something different\u201d is the \u201cprice of citizenship.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that the requirement to \u201cleave space\u201d and \u201cchannel conduct\u201d only flows in one direction: non-believers are under no similar obligation.\n\nAnd so, we\u2019ve arrived at a point where what once was considered the \u201cfirst freedom\u201d is now, at best, a second-class right that can be set aside at the behest of the currently-favored interest group.\n\nThat\u2019s why the upcoming Supreme Court cases are so important. The Court can either solidify religious freedom\u2019s second-tier status or, hopefully, arrest its slide. It can either sign on to the fallacious distinction between belief and conduct or insist that the First Amendment requires reasonable accommodation to \u201cthe very religious beliefs that inspire [people\u2019s] lives.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, we must be in prayer about this momentous issue, not only concerning the cases, but more importantly, our response to this challenge. As Chuck Colson said concerning another important Supreme Court case, \u201cthe Supreme Court justices don't live in a sheltered cocoon. They read newspapers, editorials, and letters-to-the-editor. So Christians ought to be talking publicly about what's really at stake.\u201d\n\nFolks, nearly all of us grew up in a society where there was little, if any, conflict between the requirements of faith and the requirements of citizenship.\n\nWe didn\u2019t need television networks and activists of various stripes to teach us about tolerance. We fully knew that people disagreed with us on some, if not most, issues and yet we\u2014and they\u2014could treat each other with respect.\n\nThis kind of tolerance has been replaced by a relentless scrubbing of an ever-growing public square of any dissent from the reigning secularist orthodoxy. \u201cSecularist,\u201d in this case doesn\u2019t mean \u201cnon-sectarian,\u201d as it does, for example, in India. It means hostility to religion itself, especially when it escapes the confines of worship services.\n\nThis is the landscape in which the battle for religious freedom will be fought this year. It\u2019s a battle we didn\u2019t choose, but it\u2019s one that we have no choice but to wage. So may God be with us.\n\nReprinted with permission from Breakpoint.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "It\u2019s a battle we didn\u2019t choose, but it\u2019s one that we have no choice but to wage.
