The rules help determine whether their jobs will reach the 30 hours a week necessary to qualify for US employer-paid health insurance.\n\nThe guidelines established by the US government will make it easier for college administrators to calculate adjunct hours, but tougher for professors who spend extra time to tutor or help their students.\n\nAs universities struggle to keep pace with demand for degrees and keep costs in check, they have relied on adjuncts to teach all manner of classes, from anthropology to economics. At community colleges across Virginia, for example, adjuncts account for three-quarters of the faculty\u2014and their numbers are growing three times as fast as full-time faculty over the last 15 years.\n\nIn the last year or so, many colleges and universities have limited adjunct hours\u2014specifically to avoid having to give them health insurance coverage. The Obama rules further force a decision on just how dependent higher education remains on adjunct. \u201cSo if I am in the middle of a lecture, exam or finals, and my adjunct clock strikes 29 hours, do I pick up all the exams, stop lecturing mid-sentence and tell students, \u2018sorry, I\u2019m over the hourly limit imposed by the government and this institution, so if you completed the exam fine, if not too bad, take it up with the IRS, Obama and the ACA?'\u201d one person wrote on the Chronicle of Higher Education\u2019s website.\n\nUnlike full professors who earn a salary plus benefit, adjuncts are paid by the class, based on the number of hours for the courses they are assigned. Pay varies widely from state to state and university to university, as little as a few hundred dollars per class to more than $10,000. Many educators barely eke out a living, despite their PhD\u2019s and other credentials. \u201cThose are poverty wages,\u201d Kip Lornell, a George Washington University professor of ethnomusicology, told NBC News of his $23,000 a year pay. (That compares to a median US pay of $68,970.)\n\nA growing number of adjuncts have turned to unions to improve their lot and raise their pay. Some hope they can earn enough so they no longer must teach at multiple universities to pay all their bills.\n\nEven adjuncts who love to teach see the irony and the complexity in their stitched together careers. Writes adjunct Emily Van Duyne in a moving essay called \u201cWhy Buy the Cow?An Open Letter to Full-Time Faculty\u201d:\n\nAs an instructor at three separate colleges, I maintain three separate emails, which I have to check at least twice a day, even on the weekends. I won\u2019t go into the amount of hours I spend grading essays\u2026. They are graded after my son falls asleep; they are graded before he wakes up; they are graded while I eat lunch; they are graded, in bits and pieces, while my students do a freewrite; they are graded in the single adjunct lounge with its single, barely working, computer, at a community college whose adjunct coordinator freely admits that the ratio of adjunct to full-time faculty is 5:1, a lounge that has contained, since I began working there almost two years ago, a sign that reads, \u201cAdjuncts\u2014please be sparing with your use of supplies. They must serve everyone. Thank you.\n\nAfter hearing various proposals and formulas for time spent outside the classroom, the US government decided to provide \u201cease of administration,\u201d with a guideline that an adjunct professor ought to earn 2.25 hours of service for each hour of teaching time. The Federal Register\u2018s math: For every hour in the classroom, the university counts 1.25 hours for tasks such as grading papers and preparing notes. Hours in faculty meetings or required offices hours are extra.\n\nThe number of hours outside the classroom clearly varies depending on the class, the instructor and homework assigned and such things as whether the person cares enough to respond to student emails and requests.\n\nCounting the hours of part-time instructors was a time-consuming task for college officials and faculty for the last year and a half. Many universities are paring back their adjunct hours below that threshold so they are not responsible for health insurance premiums starting in 2015.\n\nAdjuncts, who along with non-tenured faculty account for around 70% of the teaching force in US higher education, often do not have offices on campus for office hours or to prepare lessons. Yet they show up next to full-time professors in course catalogs and student rating sites.\n\n\u201cHow about the endless hours of advising? Hell, I\u2019m still advising and writing letters for students I had two and three years ago. It\u2019s hard to say \u2018no,\u2019 but there\u2019s no way to be compensated,\u201d wrote one adjunct in response to the news reported by Inside Higher Ed.\n\nThe question of how many hours an adjunct works outside the classroom was left open to interpretation by universities, as long as it is reasonable. \u201cEmployers may credit more hours of service than would result\u201d under the guidelines, the US government said\u2014just as a college student could ask extra questions or turn in extra credit assignments.\n\nThe question remains whether the instructor has time to review them\u2014as she\u2019s juggling multiple adjunct gigs, a side job, or a combination of them all.\n\nFollow Vickie on Twitter @WorkingKind.
