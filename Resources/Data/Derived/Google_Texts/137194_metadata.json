How do I maintain a good relationship with my boss if we never see each other?\n\nA: Getting your job done and done well is the foundation of a good relationship with your manager. But if your boss doesn\u2019t see you every day, you may be missing out on opportunities to advance, says Ellie Eckhoff, a vice president at ClearRock, a leadership development and executive coaching firm.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re out of sight, you\u2019re not going to be top of top of mind when it comes to landing important assignments or even promotions,\u201d she says. If you can\u2019t stop by your manager\u2019s office for an impromptu chat, you have to work harder to connect on a personal level and build up trust, and it\u2019s up to you to find ways to foster that connection.\n\n\n\nCheck in with your boss regularly, and don\u2019t do it all by email or instant message. Research into how we communicate finds that about half of comes from non-verbal cues; 38% is the tone of your voice. Set up a regular time to talk by phone to give updates on projects and plan out future assignments.\n\nObviously going to headquarters regularly helps. \u201cGet as much face time with your boss as you can,\u201d says Eckhoff. But you may have to be creative about coming up with excuses to show up, especially if your company\u2019s travel budget is tight.\n\nAttend important meetings in person, sign up for on-site training classes, or volunteer for a team project that requires you to visit the main office. Another tactic is to attend conferences that your boss is going to and catch up at the event\u2019s social functions. If your travel budget is limited, make trips that will give you the most interaction with your boss the priority.\n\nYour manager shouldn\u2019t be the only one you know at headquarters. Build relationships with colleagues who can help you navigate office politics and keep you informed about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. Recruit a mentor who works closely with your boss and can talk you up. Check in with these co-workers regularly and make lunch or drink plans ahead of your visits.\n\nAs for connecting on a more personal level, you don\u2019t have to be a cyber-stalker to find out more about your boss\u2019 life. \u201cSimply reading his LinkedIn profile may help you find common ground if you know where he went to school and companies where he used to work,\u201d says Eckhoff. Following him or her on Twitter may spark topic of conversations too.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to go the extra mile to get to know your boss \u2014 and, more importantly, have him or her know you. For your career\u2019s sake, do it.\n\nHave a workplace etiquette question?
