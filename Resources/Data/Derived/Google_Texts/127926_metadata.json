To guarantee space at the festival, register in advance by clicking here.\n\nThe Thousand Oaks location is the ninth in the chain founded in 2005 by Mario Del Pero and Ellen Chen. The menu created by chef and partner Judy Han \"promotes a farm-to-table philosophy by using local, seasonal ingredients in its sandwiches, salads and soups,\" according to a media release.\n\nSpecialties include a Kurobuta pork belly banh mi with housemade pickled daikon and carrots and chili aioli on panini grilled ciabatta ($10.45) and the \"Not So Fried Chicken\" made with shaved roasted chicken rolled in krispies and served with herb aioli and mustard pickle slaw on toasted ciabatta with chipotle barbecue sauce ($9.65).\n\nVegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options are available.\n\nHours are 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily at 966 S.
