Alexander was the first baby born this new year in Loveland at Medical Center of the Rockies. ( Jenny Sparks )\n\nCarpenter's due date was initially Dec. 29. She was told a couple of hours after his birth that her baby had been the first born in Loveland.\n\n\"It was a big surprise,\" she said.\n\nMCR volunteers organized a basket of goodies for the family, which included gender-neutral yellow blankets, clothes, pacifiers and toys for the family.\n\nAlexander's sister, Cielo, cuddled with her new baby brother on Wednesday and slyly told her aunt Maria, \"He's mine.\"\n\n\"When I was little, I always asked for a baby brother,\" said 10-year-old Cielo.\n\nShe can't wait to play with, and get in trouble with, her new brother. She plans to teach him to play basketball since that is her favorite sport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarpenter is excited to take Alexander home and get a room ready for him. She hopes he grows up to be a good student and play basketball.\n\nThe family lives in Greeley and Carpenter's mother, Isabel Gonzalez, will watch the baby while his mother is at work.\n\nAccording to marketing strategist Jill Clark with University of Colorado Health, Medical Center of the Rockies had 842 deliveries in 2013.
