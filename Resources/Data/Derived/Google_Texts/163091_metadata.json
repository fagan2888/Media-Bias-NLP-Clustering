In his more than six years in the White House, Obama has to an unusual degree \u2014 for a serving president \u2014 offered strong opinions on how the court\u2019s justices should decide cases central to his legacy. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nPresident Obama seemed to relish the chance to take yet another swipe at the Supreme Court justices who were deliberating a case that could determine the fate of his landmark health-care law.\n\n\u201cThis should be an easy case,\u201d he said earlier this month regarding the latest legal showdown over the Affordable Care Act. \u201cFrankly, it probably shouldn\u2019t even have been taken up.\u201d\n\nThis time the president was taking questions from reporters at a recent summit of world leaders in Germany. The case before the court would decide whether millions of Americans who receive tax subsidies to buy health insurance on federal exchanges are doing so illegally.\n\nIn his more than six years in the White House, Obama has to an unusual degree \u2014 for a serving president \u2014 offered strong opinions on how the court\u2019s justices should decide cases central to his legacy. In a few instances, those pointed opinions have sounded a lot like outright criticism.\n\nObama\u2019s willingness to plunge into the court\u2019s business reflects his background as a constitutional law lecturer, his irritation with the legal and political wrangling surrounding the landmark health-care law and his view of the court\u2019s role in American society.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a view that liberals love the courts as the last bastion\u201d for defending the rights of the powerless and underprivileged, said David Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cHe\u2019s never bought into that stuff. He believes that the courts are fine, but that politics should run the country.\u201d\n\nThat view was especially clear in 2012 when the justices were reviewing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s constitutionality. At the time Obama argued that the court hadn\u2019t overturned a law on a major economic issue, such as health care, since its battles with President Franklin D. Roosevelt over the New Deal. \u201cLet me be very specific,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have not seen a court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on an economic issue, like health-care\u201d for decades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the \u201830s , pre-New Deal,\u201d he said in making the case for judicial restraint.\n\nCompared with today\u2019s fights, Roosevelt\u2019s battles with the Supreme Court were far more poisonous. The former president was furious with the court for overturning sweeping pieces of legislation designed to pull the country out of the Great Depression, and responded by trying to pack the court with six additional justices.\n\n\u201cWhat has people reaching for the smelling salts today is by historical standards pretty mild,\u201d Strauss said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Obama\u2019s legal philosophizing has had any impact for good or ill on the justices\u2019 decisions. In 2012, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. surprised many when he wrote the opinion saving Obamacare from a constitutional challenge. \u201cThe chief justice is very attuned to history,\u201d said Strauss. \u201cIt\u2019s possible he understood the court had tried to stay away from big political fights with the president and Congress.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Obama\u2019s criticism did little more than irritate the justices, who aren\u2019t accustomed to sniping from the executive branch.\n\n\u201cWhen I was solicitor general, I would not have wanted President Bush to be saying things like that, one way or another, about the Supreme Court or the decisions it was making,\u201d said Theodore B. Olson, who served as solicitor general under George W. Bush and is now a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington.\n\nObama is in the unusual position of having voted against the confirmation of both Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. when he was in the Senate. The tension between the branches was especially apparent in his 2010 State of the Union address, when Obama called out the court just days after its decision corporations\u2019 ability to support or oppose political candidates.\n\n\u201cWith all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that, I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections,\u201d Obama said of the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling.\n\nThe justices sat motionless and expressionless in front of him, except for Alito. \u201cNot true, not true,\u201d he appeared to say as he shook his head.\n\nIn reality, though, it is unlikely that any of Obama\u2019s statements on the court or its decisions \u2014 the longest of which clocked in at just over three minutes \u2014 had much impact on the court\u2019s decision in the most recent Obamacare case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it does anything,\u201d said Charles Fried, a Harvard Law School professor who served as Ronald Reagan\u2019s solicitor general.\n\nSo why does Obama sound off?\n\n\u201cProbably because he thinks it,\u201d Fried said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think about these things. Whether it is a good idea to be so explicit is another question entirely.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He has offfered strong opinions on how the justices should decide cases central to his legacy.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/greg.jaffe.5", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He has offfered strong opinions on how the justices should decide cases central to his legacy.", "title": "Why does President Obama criticize the Supreme Court so much?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-does-president-obama-criticize-the-supreme-court-so-much/2015/06/20/b41667b4-1518-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/20/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court-00530-4561.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GregJaffe"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/why-does-president-obama-criticize-the-supreme-court-so-much/2015/06/20/b41667b4-1518-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/greg.jaffe.5"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "b41667b4-1518-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c"}, "article_summary": "Compared with today\u2019s fights, Roosevelt\u2019s battles with the Supreme Court were far more poisonous.\nThe Supreme Court in Washington.\n(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)President Obama seemed to relish the chance to take yet another swipe at the Supreme Court justices who were deliberating a case that could determine the fate of his landmark health-care law.\nIn his more than six years in the White House, Obama has to an unusual degree \u2014 for a serving president \u2014 offered strong opinions on how the court\u2019s justices should decide cases central to his legacy.\n\u201cWe have not seen a court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on an economic issue, like health-care\u201d for decades."}
