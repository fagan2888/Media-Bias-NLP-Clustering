A countywide health survey conducted in 2012 showed that 12 percent of Lorain County residents \u2014 roughly 35,000 people \u2014 were without health insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have been trying to do things locally to encourage people to enroll before the deadline,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this county, there are multiple health service agencies that are trained and ready to answer questions and enroll residents as needed.\u201d\n\nTo date, 80,000 Ohioans have enrolled in health insurance programs. It is estimated that more than 1 million people still are without insurance in the state, Falk said.\n\n\u201cThose numbers tell us we still have so much work to do, and time is dwindling down,\u201d she said.\n\nMost of the uninsured in the state, as is the same for much of the country, include Latinos and young adults between 19 and 35 \u2014 historically the largest population of uninsured persons.\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t have insurance are one catastrophic illness away from financial ruin,\u2019\u2019 Falk said.\n\nMarch 31 is 16 days away and the next open enrollment period doesn\u2019t begin until Nov. 15.\n\nKathleen Burke, community outreach and volunteer program coordinator for Lorain County Health and Dentistry, said typical enrollment events include a lot of information sharing, but once clients\n\nare informed about the new law, many are eager to sign up.\n\n\u201cWe have enrolled about 400 clients since October with many coming in January once the Medicaid expansion came through,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are hearing about us through the grapevine, and they are calling us to enroll. The word is getting out there, but it needs to get out more.\u201d\n\nTanas Wilcox, nursing director of the Lorain County Health District, said enrollment specialists are not willing to give up as the deadline draws near.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we know we\u2019re helping people get insurance that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have,\u201d she said.\n\nContact Lisa Roberson at 329-7121 or lroberson@chroniclet.com.
