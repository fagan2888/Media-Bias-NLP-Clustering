Sixty Minutes' Lesley Stahl was shocked. \u201cSo sleep deprivation, dietary manipulation,\u201d she said to Jose Rodriguez, former head of the CIA\u2019s Clandestine Service. \u201cI mean, this is Orwellian stuff.\u201d\n\nOrwellian to her, maybe, but not to most doctors. These two methods of \u201ctorture\u201d are normal work conditions for the better part of a decade for most physicians. Internship and residency, especially in surgical specialties, involved being on call every second or third night, meaning 36 hours without sleep, with a night or two of rest before repeating the cycle. And those 36 hours were not sitting in a room. Life-and-death decisions were being made on a constant basis during these periods of sleep deprivation. Even this is far better than a hundred years ago. \u201cWilliam Halsted, the first chief of surgery at Johns Hopkins in the 1890s and a founder of modern medical training, required his residents to be on call 362 days a year.\u201d Talk about sleep deprivation. Times have changed from the days of Halsted and from even the training days of most middle aged physicians practicing today. In 2003, the residency accreditation board imposed an 80-hour-per-week work limit over concerns about medical errors due to sleep-deprived physicians. But torture was never mentioned in these discussions. Stahl also hyperventilated about Ensure being given to detainees. As for the medical field, Ensure was indeed given to hospital patients as a source of nutrition. But it was also a welcome snack for physicians working at night. During my training, when midnight rolled around and I was about halfway through my nights work, I was hungry. Hospital cafeterias were closed. The surrounding neighborhood was not the place to find a quick bite unless I wanted to be a patient in my own hospital or else in the morgue. A chilled can of Ensure, readily available on the hospital ward, hit the spot for a late-night snack and energy boost. Torture? Hardly. Don\u2019t forget the verbal abuse and humiliation. When directed at terrorists, \u201c[t]his is the kind of torture that leaves deep psychological wounds.\u201d What about when directed at physicians-in-training? An attending surgeon at my medical school routinely reminded students, \u201cMedical student worse than dog.\u201d Verbal castigation was fairly routine if as a resident you didn\u2019t know the latest pertinent lab result or the correct diagnosis. And always in front of your classmates and peers, perhaps even in front of the patient you were caring for. I never served in the military, but I expect that boot camp was similar for military recruits. How much sleep do SEAL candidates get during their hell week? Abuse and humiliation, yes; torture, no. We all developed thick skin along the lines of \u201csticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.\u201d Reasonable people can disagree about waterboarding, if it should be used, and under what circumstances. But sleep deprivation, humiliation, and Ensure are hardly the stuff of George Orwell. Otherwise, most physicians should be on disability for post-traumatic stress disorder due to the \u201ctorture\u201d they endured during their training. Instead, we have Obamacare, meaningful use, PQRS, preauthorizations, and other mandates. Now that\u2019s real torture.
