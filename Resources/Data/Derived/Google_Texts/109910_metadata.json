He won seven of the 11 Republican 2016 presidential primaries and caucuses. Trump now has 302 delegates as compared to Ted Cruz\u2019s 174 and Marco Rubio\u2019s 104. The Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d is in panic mode; it appears to most observers that Il Duce Donald Trump, the American right-wing\u2019s version of Immortan Joe from the movie \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d is a fait accompli as the 2016 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThis is the macro level story that the commentariat will be focusing on until Trump\u2019s formal coronation at the Republican National Convention in July\n\nCampaigns and elections are also a collection of micro-level, personal experiences. The notion that \u201cthe personal is the political\u201d is a clich\u00e9. It is nonetheless very true: this will be the first presidential election for millions of young and other new voters. Moreover, there are Americans who have never before volunteered to assist in a campaign or election. Some of them are \u201cfeeling the Bern.\u201d Others are working for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or the other prospective presidential candidates.\n\nMovements like Black Lives Matter, as well as other citizen activist groups are standing up for the rights of immigrants, Muslims, women, and people of color more generally, in an era of police thuggery, surveillance, the neoliberal nightmare, a broken economy, and resurgent nativism and sexism. In all, these organizations and nascent social movements are introducing many Americans to the power of protest and the realization that they too\u2014not just big money and inside the Beltway interest groups\u2014have a voice.\n\nUltimately, these activities\u2013voting, organizing, protesting, and other activities\u2013will be one of the primary moments of political socialization for many millions of Americans. Their experiences in the 2016 presidential election will influence the rest of their lives and how they think about (and experience) what it means to be a member of the polity.\n\nPolitics can be messy. It involves what are called \u201cpush and pull\u201d factors. At its worst, those moments can involve violence. In a functioning democracy such behavior is considered outside of \u201cnormal politics.\u201d But as Donald Trump\u2019s proto-fascist Herrenvolk nativism movement grows in power, and Republican Party elites are paralyzed by a knot of racism and demagoguery they both nurtured and created, many of the standing norms of recent American politics seem as though they are teetering on a precipice.\n\nThe following is a single data point, a news item that will likely be lost in the background noise of Super Tuesday, or just one person\u2019s experience which they will remember for a long while and others will quickly forget.\n\nAs reported by the TV station WLKY and shared on social media, a black woman was repeatedly assaulted at a Donald Trump rally in Louisville, Kentucky. White men in the crowd repeatedly shoved this young black woman while white women yelled at and harangued her. Whiteness united them in their vitriol and meanness across lines of gender and sex.\n\nIt was an ugly and disturbing scene.\n\nViolence at Donald Trump rallies is now a common and expected occurrence. Trump encourages violence with his Right-wing strongman professional wrestling routine. Trump\u2019s backers have followed through on his edicts. They have attacked a homeless person who they believed was an \u201cillegal\u201d immigrant, beaten upon a Black Lives Matter protester, and engaged in violent and hostile acts against others who they identify as not part of the tribe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Enough with the nonsense about a horrified GOP establishment.
