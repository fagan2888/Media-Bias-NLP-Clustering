To protect and serve, and to make a child’s Christmas wish come true? That’s exactly what two Oklahoma City police officers did, going above and beyond their call of duty.

According to the police department, Tuesday night, officers met a little girl, but not under the best circumstances. The girl’s mother was arrested for DUI and child endangerment. The girl was then taken into protective custody.

The girl told officers that she and her 7-year-old brother were hungry and hadn’t eaten all day. They were crying and scared, because they thought they would be taken away. The officers asked the children for their dates of birth. After telling them her birthday, the little girl added that they, “Got no presents this year because mommy is broke and daddy is in jail.”

Officers Cook and Vernier out of the department's Southwest Division knew this wasn’t acceptable. So they took the children to Wal-Mart and bought them both presents out of their own pockets. They also got them some food to eat before taking them to the shelter.
