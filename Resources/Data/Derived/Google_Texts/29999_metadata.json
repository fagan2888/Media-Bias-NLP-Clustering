And festivals goers who like their pop injected with a bit more art got their fill as well.\n\n\n\nU.K. Australian electro-troupe Empire of the Sun hit the Sahara Tent at 9:50pm and brought a bit of theater to a stage built more for blinding strobe lights. The band\u2019s on-stage setup entourage of costumed musicians, contorting dancers and glow-in-the-dark instruments added a surreal visual punch to the sleek tech-pop of live ringleader Luke Steele.\n\nFlashy costumes, synchronized dance routines and cascading lasers dazzled the eyes, while well-known hits like \u201cWalking on a Dream\u201d and \u201cAlive\u201d kept feet of the giant crowd -- which included a very enthusiastic Paris Hilton -- shuffling all the way back to the port-a-potties.\n\n\n\nNinety minutes later, British new wave icons Pet Shop Boys took the Mojave stage in front of a much smaller but undeniably devoted crowd. Keeping in step with the band\u2019s current Electric tour, PSB\u2019s set was an over-the-top visual feast imagined by reknowned costume and set designer Es Devlin. Dancers in animal skulls and other obtrusive headgear flanked singer Neil Tennant and ever-stoic keyboardist Chris Lowe, who treated the fans to a series of flamboyant, futuristic costumes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPet Shop Boys, Coachella 2014\n\n\n\nThe duo may have fulfilled the role of elder statesmen for the day (no band on Saturday\u2019s lineup has been around longer than the \u201880s innovators), but PSB\u2019s recent material packed an energetic punch that could have stood next to any of the younger acts on the bill. Tracks like \u201cFluorescent\u201d packed a dancefloor punch that could hold its own with anything the kids dropped in the Sahara. But of course, it was the classics like \u201cWest End Girls,\u201d \u201cOpportunities\u201d and \u201cAlways on My Mind\u201d that made the band worth skipping Muse.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "The wild diversity of Saturday\u2019s Coachella lineup meant there was something happening on the Empire Polo Field for just about everyone, including those who like their pop injected with a bit more art.", "title": "Coachella 2014: Empire of the Sun, Pet Shop Boys Bring Art Pop to the Desert", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6051469/coachella-2014-empire-of-the-sun-pet-shop-boys-bring-art", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/empire-of-the-sun-coachella-650-430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The wild diversity of Saturday\u2019s Coachella lineup meant there was something happening on the Empire Polo Field for just about everyone, including those who like their pop injected with a bit more art.", "title": "Coachella 2014: Empire of the Sun, Pet Shop Boys Bring Art Pop to the Desert", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6051469/coachella-2014-empire-of-the-sun-pet-shop-boys-bring-art", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/empire-of-the-sun-coachella-650-430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The wild diversity of Saturday\u2019s Coachella lineup meant there was something happening on the Empire Polo Field for just about everyone, including those who like their pop injected with a bit more art.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Coachella 2014: Empire of the Sun, Pet Shop Boys Bring Art Pop to the Desert | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7dd\"", "article_summary": "The band\u2019s on-stage setup entourage of costumed musicians, contorting dancers and glow-in-the-dark instruments added a surreal visual punch to the sleek tech-pop of live ringleader Luke Steele.\nKeeping in step with the band\u2019s current Electric tour, PSB\u2019s set was an over-the-top visual feast imagined by reknowned costume and set designer Es Devlin.\nAnd festivals goers who like their pop injected with a bit more art got their fill as well.\nNinety minutes later, British new wave icons Pet Shop Boys took the Mojave stage in front of a much smaller but undeniably devoted crowd.\nThe wild diversity of Saturday\u2019s Coachella lineup \u2013 bombastic EDM, muscular alt-rock, chart-topping R&B \u2013 meant there was something happening on the Empire Polo Field for just about everyone."}
