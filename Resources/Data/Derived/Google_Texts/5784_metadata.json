The high court voted to leave that option up to the individual states.\n\nFlorida is among 23 states that have thus far opted not to expand their Medicaid programs. Twenty-four states have chosen to expand Medicaid, and the rest are undecided, according to the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington.\n\nWho qualifies?\n\nIn Florida, the new health insurance exchange, which opens Oct.1, will offer tax credits to lower and middle-income individuals and families, earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The credits will go to offset costs of health insurance purchased through the exchange.\n\nUsing 2013 figures, that would mean individuals earning between $11,490 and $45,960 a year, and families of four earning between $23,550 and $94,200 would qualify for a tax credit.\n\nBut individuals and families who make less than 100 percent of the poverty level \u2014 and who don't qualify for Medicaid \u2014 don't have an affordable option, said Pollack.\n\nIn general, to qualify for Medicaid in Florida non-working parents must make 19 percent or less of poverty level, and a working-parent household would need to make 56 percent or less, said Chris Lee, spokesman for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health advocacy group.\n\nFloridians without children are not eligible for Medicaid unless they are disabled.\n\nThat leaves 995,000 Floridians in the coverage gap, according to estimates from the Urban Institute.\n\n\"The biggest problem in states like Florida is that the poorest of the poor will be left out in the cold,\" said Pollack.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "HEALTH, FEATURES", "og": {"url": "http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-09-13/health/os-medicaid-expansion-obamacare-20130913_1_medicaid-expansion-medicaid-coverage-health-insurance-exchange", "type": "article", "site_name": "tribunedigital-orlandosentinel", "description": "Nearly 1 million Floridians will fall through a large doughnut hole next month when the health insurance exchange - a key element in the Affordable Care Act - opens.
