More than a few observers, even the president\u2019s supporters, said that the decision to continue golfing immediately after announcing to the country that ISIS had executed what administration would later call a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d on the United States was unwise.\n\nOn Sunday, Obama acknowledged that he had erred, not only in seeming detached but also in failing to consider the \u201coptics\u201d associated with appearing callous and disinterested in the wake of that attack.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve anticipated the optics,\u201d Obama said on Sunday in an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. He said that he did not adequately consider how some would feel about his dispassion in the aftermath of that attack on the United States by ISIS.\n\n\u201cBut part of this job is also the theater,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that always comes naturally to me. But it matters, and I\u2019m mindful of that.\u201d\n\nDisplaying compassion for the Foley family and those Americans rocked by this gruesome affront by appearing somber and reserved \u2013 even at the expense of a whole day of vacation \u2013 is, in Obama\u2019s opinion, just more of the burdensome performance art that the public has come to expect of their commander-in-chief.\n\nThat may be slightly more insulting than if he had just golfed away the day and never acknowledged it again.\n\nObama sounded a bit resentful of the fact that the media had made the post-Foley speech golf outing an issue. \u201cI think everybody who knows me, including, I suspect, the press, understands that that, you know, you take this stuff in,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s serious business. And you care about it deeply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe possibility of a jarring contrast, given the world\u2019s news, is always \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be some tough news somewhere \u2014 is going to be there,\u201d he added. In other words, one day it\u2019s an American beheaded, another day it\u2019s some other horrible development. There will always be something critics will point to in order to say Obama shouldn\u2019t be golfing. What more do you people want from him?\n\nIf Obama\u2019s intention was to convey to the public the depth of his concern over the beheading of Americans by ISIS fighters, he failed to achieve that objective.\n\nA charitable interpretation of Obama\u2019s remarks would allow for the possibility that he was expressing his genuine regret for the hard-edged display that followed the Foley speech in an artless manner. Obama played pundit, as he often does, and sounded callous by making an assessment of the political implications surrounding what the public saw as a lack of empathy for those wounded by Foley\u2019s execution. But the president\u2019s implied scolding of the media for amplifying that criticism indicates that this interpretation of his remarks may be a bit too forgiving.\n\nObama capped off his venting to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd by insisting that he needs another vacation, but this time from the Fourth Estate. \u201cPart of what I want is a vacation from the press,\u201d Obama said.\n\nTodd reminded him that his permanent break from professional responsibilities begins on January 20, 2017, but does the vacation really ever end if you\u2019ve already checked out?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Checked out.", "title": "Obama blames the press for criticisms of his post-beheading golf outing", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/09/07/obama-is-annoyed-the-press-noticed-his-optically-tone-deaf-post-foley-speech-golf-outing/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-07T18:01:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-08T11:11:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, James Foley,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce64f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPart of what I want is a vacation from the press,\u201d Obama said.\nHe said that he did not adequately consider how some would feel about his dispassion in the aftermath of that attack on the United States by ISIS.\nObama sounded a bit resentful of the fact that the media had made the post-Foley speech golf outing an issue.\n\u201cI should\u2019ve anticipated the optics,\u201d Obama said on Sunday in an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\u201cI think everybody who knows me, including, I suspect, the press, understands that that, you know, you take this stuff in,\u201d Obama said."}
