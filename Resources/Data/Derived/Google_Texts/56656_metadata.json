The penalty levied against Alstom, over $772 million, will be the largest criminal fine that has ever been imposed under an FCPA. Provided that the District Court approves the plea agreement negotiated between Alstom and the Department of Justice, the resolution will rank just under the 2008 Siemens FCPA resolution, which involved combined criminal and civil penalties of approximately $800 million.\n\nAccording to the information, the corrupt conduct of Alstom personnel and agents, though noteworthy in its breadth and length of time, has the hallmarks of a textbook FCPA case: the use of third party consultants (often referred to by codename) with little documentation corroborating the purposes for their massive fees; a foreign subsidiary subject to insufficient parental supervision; attempts to obtain lucrative contracts for power and transportation projects for state-owned companies; and a failure to respond to red flags.\n\nAlstom was also flagged for failing to self-disclose the corrupt activity to law enforcement officials, and for resisting cooperation in the early stages of the investigation. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell emphasized, in announcing the plea, that the DOJ \u201cwill not wait for companies to act responsibly. With cooperation or without it, the department will identify criminal activity at corporations and investigate the conduct ourselves, using all of our resources, employing every law enforcement tool, and considering all possible actions, including charges against both corporations and individuals.\u201d\n\nAlstom\u2019s travails are not over. Its Swiss subsidiary also pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provision, and two of its U.S. subsidiaries entered deferred prosecution agreements in which they admitted the same. The U.K.\u2019s Serious Fraud Office has now filed new, related charges against Alstom\u2019s U.K. subsidiary for alleged bribes paid to Lithuanian officials. Based on Deputy Attorney General James Cole\u2019s statement that Alstom\u2019s conduct \u201cwas breathtaking in its breadth, its brazenness, and its worldwide consequences,\u201d and his lauding of the \u201cremarkable cross-border collaboration\u201d between law enforcement agencies across the globe during the investigation, it appears that there may be more to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alstom S.A., a French multinational pleaded guilty in Connecticut to violating the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Earlier this week, Alstom S.A., a French multinational power and transportation company, pleaded guilty in the District of Connecticut to a&amp;nbsp;two-count information&amp;nbsp;charging it with violating t", "title": "Alstom to Pay Largest FCPA Criminal Penalty in History - Foreign Corrupt Practices Act", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/alstom-to-pay-largest-fcpa-criminal-penalty-history-foreign-corrupt-practices-act", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/rolls%20of%20money.jpg?itok=yqAn__A_", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Department of Justice, DOJ, Enforcement, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FCPA, Settlement, Alstom, Criminal Fine, French Multinational", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Department of Justice, DOJ, Enforcement, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FCPA, Settlement, Alstom, Criminal Fine, French Multinational"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf34\"", "article_summary": "The penalty levied against Alstom, over $772 million, will be the largest criminal fine that has ever been imposed under an FCPA.\nAlstom was also flagged for failing to self-disclose the corrupt activity to law enforcement officials, and for resisting cooperation in the early stages of the investigation.\nAssistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell emphasized, in announcing the plea, that the DOJ \u201cwill not wait for companies to act responsibly.\nProvided that the District Court approves the plea agreement negotiated between Alstom and the Department of Justice, the resolution will rank just under the 2008 Siemens FCPA resolution, which involved combined criminal and civil penalties of approximately $800 million.\nMonday, December 29, 2014Earlier this week, Alstom S.A., a French multinational power and transportation company, pleaded guilty in the District of Connecticut to a two-count information charging it with violating the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act."}
