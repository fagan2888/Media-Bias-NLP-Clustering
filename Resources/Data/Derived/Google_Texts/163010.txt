Two boys, aged 5 and 7, suffered second- and third-degree sunburn while on a day care trip to a water park in Vinita, Okla., last Friday. The children’s mother, Shaunna Broadway, has now shared disturbing images of the boys’ injuries to warn others about the dangers of sunburn in children.

When Broadway picked up her sons from "Happiness is a Learning Center," she was shocked to see the severity of their sunburn.

“[The employees] were actually making fun of my older son, because both boys got sunburns, but he was being a ‘baby’ and crying about it,” Broadway told BuzzFeed.

By Saturday, the burns had developed into painful blisters all over the young boys' bodies. Worst of all, Broadway’s eldest son, who had received the worst burns, began to complain of chest pain. After a local hospital told the mother-of-two that they could do nothing for the boys, she took them to Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa to have the blisters lanced off. By Sunday, Broadway’s eldest’s chest pain worsened and the boys were flown to Shriners Hospital for Children in Galveston, Texas.

According to Broadway, the children are now in stable condition, although she remains upset with the day care center.

“It was common sense that they shouldn’t have been out in the sun all day, even if they wore their clothes,” Broadway said. “The heat index was 118 degrees in Vinita that day. The news was telling us not to be outside.”

Police are now looking into whether or not charges of child neglect or abuse can be brought up against the day care.
