After a grueling Valentine’s Day promoting Obamacare and fending off reports of “phony scandals,” President and Michelle Obama headed off for another fabulous vacation — separately. He’s in California, while she’s in Aspen — proving that Valentine’s Day really does last only one day.

The president will spend an extended bachelor’s weekend playing golf during the day and catching up on some HBO series episodes at night, according to The Hill.

The Hill reported:

Aides told [TheNew York Times] that Obama plans to play on the newly refurbished nine-hole golf course at the Sunnylands estate, the site of his bilateral talks with the Jordanian king. Separately, HBO chief executive Richard Plepler revealed to the paper that the president cornered him at Tuesday’s state dinner to ask for DVD copies of “True Detective” and “Game of Thrones” to watch during his trip. Plepler said the president instructed aides to coordinate the DVD shipment, so they could make it through White House security.

Meanwhile, the first lady literally stopped traffic for a full hour at Aspen–Pitkin County Airport Friday, when she and her daughters arrived for a weekend of skiing. For security reasons, all airport traffic came to a halt when they landed, according to the New York Post.

“Typically when VIPs land, we do not close the airport, but hold other traffic for a few minutes,” Jim Elwood, Aspen airport’s director of aviation said, according to the Post. “This is one of our busiest weekends of the year and we expect several hundred planes today.”

As a result, according to another source, other people trying to head into Aspen for Presidents Day weekend complained “that they’re shutting the airport for an hour so nobody can get in on their private jets on a high travel day.”

It’s good to be king — and queen.
