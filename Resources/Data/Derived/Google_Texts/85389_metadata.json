The main sticking point is that observation status patients are considered outpatients, even if they stay in a hospital bed for two or three nights for treatment and tests.\n\nCritics charge hospitals sometimes use observation status to avoid Medicare readmission penalties, as well as potential RAC audits and fines, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nIn September, a federal court judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by 14 Connecticut hospitals seeking to eliminate observation status in hospitals or at least require hospitals to inform patients when they are in observation so they can challenge Medicare coverage decisions, according to FierceHealthcare. Observation stays increased 25 percent from 2007 to 2009 as inpatient admissions declined, a Brown University study published last year in Health Affairs found.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the JAMA study\n\nRelated articles:\n\nHospitals defend observation-status policies as criticism grows\n\nMedicare patients sue HHS over outpatient status\n\nFederal judge dismisses hospital observation care suit\n\nHospitals evade audits, penalties with observation status\n\nObservation units offer hospital savings, patient confusion", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison, Wisc., lost an average of $331 for every patient in observation care compared to a net of $2,163 for patients who are admitted, according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association,\u00a0primarily because reimbursement for observation stays", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison, Wisc., lost an average of $331 for every patient in observation care compared to a net of $2,163 for patients who are admitted, according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association,\u00a0primarily because reimbursement for observation stays", "title": "Study: CMS definition of 'observation status' inaccurate; reimbursement lacking", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/study-cms-definition-observation-status-inaccurate-reimbursement-lacking/2013-11-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,CMS,JAMA,observation status,Patient Care & Outcomes,reimbursement,University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec54\"", "article_summary": "Observation stays increased 25 percent from 2007 to 2009 as inpatient admissions declined, a Brown University study published last year in Health Affairs found.\nCritics charge hospitals sometimes use observation status to avoid Medicare readmission penalties, as well as potential RAC audits and fines, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nThe main sticking point is that observation status patients are considered outpatients, even if they stay in a hospital bed for two or three nights for treatment and tests.\nThe information fuels the debate over observation audits and the government mandate for Medicare coverage.\nThe data also suggests that the reality of observation status is quite different from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services definition of \"a well-defined set of specific appropriate services\" that usually last less than 24 hours."}
