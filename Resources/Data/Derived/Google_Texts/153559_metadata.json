Burr, single payer, U.K., united kingdom, Video, News, Politics News\n\nSpeaking before a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday, Dr. Danielle Martin, vice president at the Women\u2019s College Hospital in Toronto, masterfully showed how to smack down a disingenuous politician\u2019s misleading and misinformed questions with courtesy, intelligence and, well, facts.\n\nIn this instance, the role of disingenuous and ill-informed politician was played by North Carolina\u2019s GOP Sen. Richard Burr, who decided to use his question time to imply that the Canadian healthcare system was bad because it led to Canadian doctors moving to America and rich people going to the U.S. to get complicated and expensive surgery. These were both good points \u2014 except for the fact that they were, as Martin made clear, completely wrong.\n\n\u201cDr. Martin, in your testimony, you note that Canadian doctors exiting the public system for the private sector has had the effect of increasing waiting lists for patients seeking public health care,\u201d Burr began. \u201cWhy are doctors exiting the public system in Canada?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for your question, Senator,\u201d Martin responded. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t express myself in a way that made myself understood, I apologize. There are no doctors exiting the public system in Canada; and in fact we see a net influx of physicians from the United States into the Canadian system over the last number of years.\u201d\n\nMartin then tried to reiterate her earlier point (which Burr had gotten about 100 percent wrong) by noting that \u201cthe solution to the wait-time challenge that we have in Canada \u2026 does not lie in moving away from our single-payer system to a multi-payer system.\u201d She cited the Australian example, where the move from a single-payer to a multi-payer model actually led to wait times increasing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Danielle Martin, V.P. at Toronto's Women's College Hospital, easily refutes a GOPer's uninformed talking points VIDEO", "title": "Canadian doctor makes anti-Obamacare senator look like a buffoon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dr. Danielle Martin, V.P. at Toronto's Women's College Hospital, easily refutes a GOPer's uninformed talking points VIDEO", "title": "Canadian doctor makes anti-Obamacare senator look like a buffoon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/13/canadian_doctor_makes_anti_obamacare_senator_look_like_a_buffoon/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-13-at-4.37.27-PM-1280x700.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Danielle Martin, V.P. at Toronto's Women's College Hospital, easily refutes a GOPer's uninformed talking points VIDEO", "title": "Canadian doctor makes anti-Obamacare senator look like a buffoon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-13-at-4.37.27-PM-1280x700.png", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Business Insider, Canada, Danielle Martin, Dr. Danielle Martin, Health Care, Medicare, National Health Service, NHS, Obamacare, Richard Burr, Sen.
