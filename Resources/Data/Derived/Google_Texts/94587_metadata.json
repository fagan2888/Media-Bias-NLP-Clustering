Over the years, they realized, the chances of a child \u201cbeing appropriately perceived by the parents declined by 30 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have changed our perceptions of what our weight ideals are,\u201d even among kids aged 2 to 5, who were the subjects of this study, said Dustin T. Duncan, an assistant professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Medical Center, who led the research.\n\nMost parents can no longer tell what a healthy weight looks like, and their doctors aren\u2019t helping them understand, Duncan said. \u201cIf every other child is obese or overweight, you would think your child\u201d is normal as well, he added.\n\nThe study also showed that 78.4 percent of parents of obese children believed them to be \u201cjust right,\u201d but the study made no comparison to earlier data for that group.\n\nInstead of focusing on small groups of overweight or obese kids as other studies have, Duncan\u2019s research used a national sample of children and parents surveyed for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1988 and 1994, and others questioned for the same survey between 2007 and 2012. Both samples had more than 3,000 children.\n\nParents were asked the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d question: Do you consider your child to be: overweight, underweight, just about the right weight, or don\u2019t know? Researchers compared those responses with the children\u2019s data on standard childhood growth curves.\n\nWith parental attitudes quite similar in both surveys and more overweight children in the population today, the chances of any child being seen correctly had declined sharply, according to the study, which was published online in the journal Childhood Obesity. The study contains a number of lessons, none of them pleasant. First, while some research has shown a possible plateau in the childhood obesity stats, the problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Duncan focused on 2- to 5-year-olds because that\u2019s the age when poor eating habits can take root.\n\n\u201cWe know that overweight pre-school children tend to be overweight school children, they tend to be overweight adolescents, and it follows them into adulthood,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nMore obviously, some parents have lost a clear idea of what a healthy youngster looks like, just as we all have as waistlines have expanded throughout our society. In African American and poor neighborhoods, where overweight and obese kids are more common, this phenomenon is more prevalent.\n\nAnd finally, pediatricians need to do a much better job of explaining what a healthy growth curve looks like, Duncan said. While the study didn\u2019t examine the idea, it\u2019s probable that parents with these perception problems are overweight themselves, Duncan said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t understand what it means to be overweight . . . and for a parent, I think it\u2019s really hard to understand these growth charts,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/hfyouth19.jpg.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8a6\"", "article_summary": "In African American and poor neighborhoods, where overweight and obese kids are more common, this phenomenon is more prevalent.\n\u201cWe know that overweight pre-school children tend to be overweight school children, they tend to be overweight adolescents, and it follows them into adulthood,\u201d Duncan said.\nParents were asked the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d question: Do you consider your child to be: overweight, underweight, just about the right weight, or don\u2019t know?\nWhile the study didn\u2019t examine the idea, it\u2019s probable that parents with these perception problems are overweight themselves, Duncan said.\nMost parents can no longer tell what a healthy weight looks like, and their doctors aren\u2019t helping them understand, Duncan said."}
