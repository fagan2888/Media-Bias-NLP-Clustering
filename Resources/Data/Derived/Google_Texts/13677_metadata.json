Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) would levy a flat 10 percent income tax and add a 16 percent business and payroll tax. Ohio Gov. John Kasich would lower the top income tax rate to 28 percent.\n\nThat would save taxpayers \u2014 particularly the wealthy \u2014 a lot of money. But federal revenues would shrink over 10 years by an estimated $9.5 trillion under Trump\u2019s plan and $8.7 trillion under Cruz\u2019s, which could lead to deep federal spending cuts or more borrowing.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would hike taxes across the board, but takes aim at those making more than $250,00 with four new brackets and a top tax rate of 52 percent to raise an additional $15.3 trillion over 10 years for universal health care and free college tuition.\n\nHillary Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York, keeps much current tax policy intact but would make people with incomes of $1 million or more pay at least 30 percent in taxes and add a 4 percent surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more, boosting federal revenue by $1.1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nLong Island\u2019s 1.5 million tax filers generally report higher incomes, more taxable dividends and more mortgage interest deductions than taxpayers in most other parts of New York, Internal Revenue Service data show. What exactly they would pay depends on many variables.\n\nBut take that four-member family making $92,000 and paying $20,090 in federal taxes under current tax law.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s plan, people like them would pay an average tax of $14,190, according to the Tax Policy Center estimates.\n\nUnder Cruz\u2019s, they would pay about $17,520. Under Clinton\u2019s, $20,140. And under Sanders\u2019, they\u2019d pay $32,250, though they\u2019d no longer pay for employer or individual health insurance.\n\nThose estimates are among the average tax bills for single and married filers with one, two or no children based on a national sample for the entire range of income brackets, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nHere are key features of each of the presidential candidates\u2019 tax proposals and analyses of those plans by the Tax Policy Center; the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank; and Citizens for Tax Justice, a left-leaning group. All are located in Washington.:\n\nTRUMP\n\nTrump said his policies will provide relief for the middle class, simplify the tax code, and grow the U.S. economy but won\u2019t add to the national debt and deficit.\n\nTax brackets: Collapse the current seven tax brackets, which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, into four brackets of 0 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent.

The top 1 percent would see a gain of $363,700.\n\nKASICH\n\nKasich says American taxes are too high and that he would cut and simplify them while launching a top-to-bottom review of the IRS and tax code.\n\nTax brackets: Collapse seven current brackets into three, with a top rate of 28 percent; other two rates not specified.\n\nDividends and capital gains: Reduce long-term capital gains rate to 15 percent.\n\nDeductions: Retain deductions for charitable donations and mortgage interest.\n\nAMT and estate tax: Repeal estate tax\n\nAffordable Care Act tax: Not addressed\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nAll three think tanks said Kasich had not provided enough detail for a substantive analysis.\n\nCLINTON\n\nClinton promises to give tax relief to middle-class families while making those with higher incomes pay more.\n\nTax brackets: No change, but establishes a minimum 30 percent tax for income above $1 million and a 4 percent surtax on incomes over $5 million.\n\nDividends and capital gains: Tax assets held less than two years at regular tax rates as high as 43.4 percent (top 39.6 percent rate with a 3.8 percent net investment income surtax); reduce the rate each additional year the asset is held.
