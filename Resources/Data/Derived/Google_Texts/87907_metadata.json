It turns out we\u2019re heading for a debt limit showdown at the end of February, earlier than expected, and a spokesman for John Boehner says Dems had better get ready to pony up:\n\n\u201cThe speaker has said that we should not default on our debt, or even get close to it, but a \u2018clean\u2019 debt limit increase simply won\u2019t pass in the House. We hope and expect the White House will work with us on a timely, fiscally responsible solution.\u201d\n\nOne supposes this means the press will again play along with the charade that the debt ceiling gives Republicans leverage, and that agreeing to avert economic chaos constitutes a concession on their part, for which they should be rewarded.\n\n* Jason Cherkins has a terrific piece explaining the historical background of Mitch McConnell\u2019s new ad touting his efforts to get health care to energy plant workers who desperately needed it. Interesting nugget: Union officials say the plant in the ad \u2014 long important to McConnell\u2019s political identity \u2014 is laying off workers and could now become a political liability.\n\n* Igor Volsky explains how exactly McConnell secured health care for sick workers, and notes that the Senator has a history of bringing in federal funds for coverage, even as he keeps describing Obamacare\u2019s benefits as \u201cfree health care.\u201d\n\n* Jed Lewison on how the McConnell ad shows that even Republicans know a continued total-repeal stance is politically untenable.\n\n* With Obama\u2019s State of the Union set for next week, here\u2019s Paul Krugman on why it\u2019s good economics, and good politics, to talk about the need to combat inequality as a way into the debate over job creation.\n\n* Jonathan Chait offers a simple prescription for Republicans whose austerity obsession has made showing feeling for the poor impossible: Rekindle that Dick Cheney \u201cdeficits don\u2019t matter\u201d magic once again.\n\n* Luke Johnson demonstrates that Patty Murray\u2019s new opposition to the Iran sanctions bill really does show momentum shifting against a vote.\n\n* Ron Kampeas has a fascinating piece explaining from the inside why AIPAC\u2019s push for a sanctions bill may be getting stymied by a group of Senate Dems who are holding the line, which could result in AIPAC finding a face-saving way out.\n\n* Jonathan Bernstein is good on why the new voting panel\u2019s recommendations are likely to go nowhere: \u201cVoting should be easy for everyone. There are reasons it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n* Steve Benen is even more blunt:\n\nRepublicans have come to the conclusion that the more voters are able to participate, the harder it is to GOP candidates to succeed. The result has been predictable: a policy agenda that creates longer voting lines on purpose, closes early-voting windows, addresses imaginary voter fraud through punitive voter-ID laws, and restricts voter-registration drives.\n\n* Hardline Obamacare foe Conn Carroll offers a real answer to my question as to what Republicans should say to the millions who would lose coverage if the law is repealed. Policy details aside, the key is Republicans know they can\u2019t say they\u2019d take that coverage away.\n\n* And Atrios asks: Now that Republicans are delivering two responses to the State of the Union address (one from the Tea Party), how many networks will play along?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/22/happy-hour-roundup-277/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/08/Boehner_Health_Care-000d7_image.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/22/happy-hour-roundup-277/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef74\"", "article_summary": "* Jason Cherkins has a terrific piece explaining the historical background of Mitch McConnell\u2019s new ad touting his efforts to get health care to energy plant workers who desperately needed it.\nPolicy details aside, the key is Republicans know they can\u2019t say they\u2019d take that coverage away.\n* Jonathan Bernstein is good on why the new voting panel\u2019s recommendations are likely to go nowhere: \u201cVoting should be easy for everyone.\nInteresting nugget: Union officials say the plant in the ad \u2014 long important to McConnell\u2019s political identity \u2014 is laying off workers and could now become a political liability.\n* Luke Johnson demonstrates that Patty Murray\u2019s new opposition to the Iran sanctions bill really does show momentum shifting against a vote."}
