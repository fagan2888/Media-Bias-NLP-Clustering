One is not just a politician... he\u2019s a former governor running for the presidency.\n\nWe have another presidential candidate who is a declared socialist... a popular candidate. He\u2019s popular because dumbed-down Americans haven\u2019t got a real clue as to what socialism is. Americans are so uninformed they think freedom exists even in a socialist state. He wants to give kids \u2013 probably all kids from all nations because, after all, he\u2019s a socialist \u2013 a free college education. No thought is given to what that would do to the already suffering state of America\u2019s institutions of higher learning. No thought is given as to how to pay for it. Certainly no CNN announcer asked about how to pay for it during the Democrat Presidential Debate.\n\nWe have a third candidate who, when the public is asked to describe her, the first words out of a majority of American mouths are \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d Yet a large number of voters say she\u2019d make a good President. How stupid can people be? She is obviously guilty of criminal behavior that should have put her behind bars long ago... and she is the more popular of the three Democrat candidates who think she would be a honest president.\n\nThus, my question: Aside from military strength (which has not been constitutionally implemented since World War II), does America matter?\n\nWe have a President of the United States who doesn\u2019t qualify for his position as a natural born (Constitutional as decided by the Supreme Court) American who has committed offenses against the American people that make him a good candidate for charges of Impeachment (if not treason). He has bowed to Muslim leaders with apologies for America\u2019s greatness \u2013 and he\u2019s done all within his power to remove what greatness we once had. He has given a Muslim nation access to nuclear weapons when that nation\u2019s citizens once kidnapped Americans from their Embassy and held them for over a year in a highly abusive terrorist environment. Today they chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d on the streets of Teheran. Obviously they are just the radical people to whom we should give the power to destroy us!\n\nThis same President has stolen money from the Social Security \u201clock-box\u201d and removed tax dollars paid into the fund (to be used only for Social Security recipients) and made billions of dollars available to illegal aliens. Seniors dependent on Social Security will get no cost-of-living increase in 2016 because of the theft. He has ruined the finest health care system in the world and used Medicare funds to support what he considers his \u201clegacy.\u201d Obamacare is such a disaster it is an apt legacy for this disaster of a President.\n\nOur veterans cannot get health care at VA hospitals \u2013 but illegals have access to Medicare. I have a friend in Georgia who had 2/3 of her colon removed 18 months ago because of colon cancer. She cannot get Medicare (federal) or Medicaid (state), cannot get disability, cannot get any access to any medical treatment or benefits. She has been unable to see a physician since her surgery because she has no income and no benefits... but bet your bottom dollar that the millions of illegals in Georgia don\u2019t have trouble getting benefits \u2013 her benefits.\n\nIf I sound angry, I am.\n\nUntil recently we had a United States Attorney General who thinks it is okay to prosecute voter intimidation cases when the intimidator is white, but not when the intimidator is black. A bunch of big guys swinging clubs in front of a voting precinct didn\u2019t bother either the Attorney General or the President... both of whom supported protesters turned rioters in Ferguson, MO. They support the unlawful actions of Baltimore\u2019s mayor and prosecutor when a man with an arrest record longer than your arm died in a police van and the police are charged with murdering the law breaker.\n\nWe have people who think it is okay to stay home and accept welfare \u2013 or, extended unemployment benefits \u2013 rather than look for a job. They willingly put their hand in their neighbor\u2019s pocket to pay for it. Many of them say they\u2019re Christians but obviously don\u2019t know what the word \u201ccovet\u201d means (it means putting your hand in your neighbor\u2019s pocket to take what\u2019s theirs so you can have yours \u2013 see the Ten Commandments for clarification). Women think it\u2019s okay to have a child every year to increase their welfare check \u2013 and they, too, put their hands in the pockets of their working neighbors. Or, if it\u2019s inconvenient to have the baby they can kill it while it\u2019s still in the womb.\n\nWhere is the compassion for the productive people of our society? And our problems have far less to do with race and far more to do with the productive versus the non-productive. I have for many years thought we are in an undeclared Civil War in America. That war is being fought between the productive and the non-productive.\n\nWe have employers who think it\u2019s okay to hire illegals because they work for less pay and the employer has no unemployment or Social Security taxes to pay for illegal workers. Illegals rent a house intended for one family and slum landlords turn their heads while ten families live there. Illegals send their money to a Latin American or other nations... it\u2019s not spent in America. It does not stimulate our economy. Instead, income sent from landed aliens, both legal and illegal, is the second highest source of income in Mexico.\n\nNo Social Security, unemployment insurance and state and federal taxes are withheld from illegal paychecks yet they are given access to Social Security, health, unemployment and other costly services. The useful idiots will tell you that illegals make an economic contribution to our society but the numbers say that for every dollar they put into the system, they take $3 out in unearned benefits. and entitlement spending is what is bankrupting the nation. Our politicians know this so bankruptcy must be something they want to achieve.\n\nChurches push collectivist and socialist ideals from the pulpit when the very core of Christ\u2019s teaching was self-responsibility and individuality. They teach that to love thy neighbor means prostrating yourself and being used as a rug rather than setting a good example of how to be successful and teaching others how to do it. Which ideology better expresses love? Love is not romance. It is commitment to another\u2019s happiness and well-being. Do you think people stuck in poverty due to welfare benefits are happy? No. They\u2019re out protesting and rioting because they have nothing better to do.\n\nWe have corporations that are so impressed with their international status that they have no sense their success came to them only because their roots are American. They have no sense of responsibility or gratitude to this country. And we have politicians who want to continue giving them an advantage over non-multi-international companies by renewing the worthless Export-Import Bank.\n\nPoliticians (and a lot of their Christian constituents) want amnesty for illegals. \u201cAfter all,\u201d liberals (and many Republicans) weep, \u201cillegals have lived here a long time and it would be cruel to send them back to Mexico or to separate them from their children!\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s cruel is their illegal entry into our country. What\u2019s cruel is the diseases they bring into our country... diseases (like tuberculosis) we did away with in America years ago. What\u2019s cruel are illegals that send hundreds of billions of dollars back home to their families in Mexico every year, removing those untaxed funds from a dying American economy. What\u2019s cruel is forcing American kids to drop out of school and/or have low-quality educations because of classmates who can\u2019t speak English. What\u2019s cruel? Having veterans who have defended this nation die from lack of care in a VA hospital because funds are diverted to pay health care for illegals is cruel. School systems have emerged that favor minority rights over those of non-minorities... of Muslims over Christians; of girls over boys. There is no balance. The compassion for American-born kids and the parents who pay taxes to support the education system is \u2013 where? I can\u2019t find it.\n\nWe have government employees earning up to three times more than people working in the private sector doing the same job. They tell us they\u2019re taxpayers, too \u2013 and apparently don\u2019t have the mathematical skills to understand that 100 percent of their salaries come from taxes paid by productive people in the private sector, but they only repay 0 to 30 percent of that cost to the Treasury in income taxes\u2026 a huge net loss.\n\nAnd politicians don\u2019t understand why the Conservative movement is so strong? Please! They don\u2019t understand that any better than they understand why conservative voters don\u2019t support candidates that come from the political establishment. They thought Trump and Carson and Fiorina and Cruz would go away. They aren\u2019t going to go away. ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT: You have lost the public trust.\n\nSo how do we, as a people, unify around all of this disunity? How do we rebuild our nation? How do we get rid of the totally corrupt political establishment?\n\nClick here for part -----> 1, 2,\n\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 2015 Marilyn M.
