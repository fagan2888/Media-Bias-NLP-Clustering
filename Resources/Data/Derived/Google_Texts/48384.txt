Madison â€” Brett Davis, a former state lawmaker who implemented key parts of Gov. Scott Walker's response to Obamacare, is leaving the administration to take a job in the private sector.

Davis has been Walker's Medicaid director since he took office in 2011 but will leave his post on March 21, according to state Health Services Department spokeswoman Stephanie Smiley. A replacement has not yet been named.

Davis ran for lieutenant governor in 2010, but lost a four-way Republican primary to Rebecca Kleefisch. He then took his position with the administration.

A key fundraiser for Davis, Kelly Rindfleisch, was later convicted of misconduct in office for doing campaign work for Davis while she was on the government payroll as Walker's deputy chief of staff when Walker was Milwaukee County executive. Davis and Walker were not charged, and Rindfleisch is appealing her conviction.

As Medicaid director, Davis was in charge of implementing Walker's plan to move adults above the federal poverty line from the BadgerCare Plus public health care plan into the private insurance marketplace. Walker's plan also included making BadgerCare Plus available to certain single adults below the poverty line who previously didn't have access to the program.

Smiley did not provide details on what job Davis is taking.
