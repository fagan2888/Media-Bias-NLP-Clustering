Some low-income students aren\u2019t seeing a separate .00 field and a filter is removing commas and decimals from the text box.\n\nThis means that when a student types $30,918.29 into the text field, the system may change this number to $3,091,829 by removing the decimal. In an instant, low income students are mistakenly filed as millionaires.\n\nJeff Baker, a policy liaison at the Education Department\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid acknowledged the how serious this issue is during annual meeting for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators and expressed the need to fix it.\n\nSo far the department has found 165,000 people who have been affected by this problem, though there may be even more.\n\nCatching this mistake is important so that students don\u2019t miss out on need-based financial aid or Pell Grants.\n\nMost colleges will have at least one student who this issue has impacted, estimated Baker. Some may have hundreds.\n\nFor affected students who have already gotten their aid, their colleges will have to reprocess the FAFSA forms. Reprocessing will begin in mid-July and the adjusted student aid amounts should be announced by late July.\n\nStudents who are eligible should still get their aid. Colleges may additional difficulties if their allotted award money has already been used before the fixes are in place.\n\nAny student who has questions or concerns about their FAFSA applications should get in touch with their financial aid offices right away.\n\nGet Free Updates!
