Health care lagged the broader market badly off those lows, given the shellacking the biotech sector experienced in recent months. So, interestingly enough, health care has the dubious distinction of being the worst sector over the last three months (+6.44% through Wednesday, more than half the S&P's 13.07%) but the best sector over the rolling 30 days.\n\nAt present, technically, health care looks like one of the best risk/rewards of any of the major sectors for the coming weeks and months, as it has begun to surge, breaking downtrend lines from last summer and regaining some of its mojo. Biotechnology stocks and pharma were the initial outperformers within the group -- following the failed Pfizer (PFE)/Allergan (AGN) merger) -- but recently we've seen more outperformance from the medical device stocks and HMOs, which still is the subsector to favor when considering trying to be \"healthy\" with your investments these days.\n\nTwo charts serve to illustrate these views. The first highlights the bullish breakout in the XLV. The recent mean reversion of this group in snapping back has helped XLV surpass its downtrend line from last summer, coinciding with a move in the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) back to new all-time highs. While parabolic in nature of late, it's worth pointing out that this acceleration in the last week has not even resulted in momentum reaching overbought levels. Thus, when trying to decide what to buy in this challenging market, it's worth considering this group given recent outperformance coinciding with structurally sound technicals, improving momentum yet with prices well off 52-week highs.\n\nThe second is a ratio chart showing the relative strength of the S&P Healthcare Equipment & Services Index vs. the S&P Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Life Sciences Index. The first index is chock-full of the device makers -- Medtronic (MDT), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Baxter (BAX), Becton Dickinson (BDX) -- along with the HMOs and service/supply stocks -- United Health (UNH), McKesson (MCK) and Express Scripts (ESRX), to name a few. The latter index is composed of stocks like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Bristol Myers (BMY), Merck (MCK) and Pfizer.\n\nThe outperformance of the device makers and service stocks began to accelerate in recent weeks over the pharma and biotech group, partly due to the failure of the PFE/AGN merger, with AGN slipping badly thereafter, and also given recent woes in Illumina (ILMN). However, the outperformance in equipment and services is not a new phenomenon by any stretch. As this chart shows, its own dominance began right when the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was implemented in 2014. Since then, the relative strength of this group has soared and outperformed the more popular biotech and pharma space. Given the upward momentum and bullish structural nature of this chart, it's right to think this can continue.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Real Money", "type": "article", "url": "http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/04/22/2016/health-care-sector-feeling-better", "title": "Health Care Sector Is Feeling Better"}, "google-site-verification": "uc_ZLKLwygSe1BLShxx0yffUxa-chB9MJ1eJrMH0P6M", "fb": {"app_id": 458919507482096}, "keywords": "ETFs,healthcare,investment strategy,Stocks"}, "article_summary": "Health Care Sector Is Feeling BetterJust at a time when most had written off the health care sector as an underperformer to be avoided, we've seen it turn in the \"healthiest\" gains of any major S&P sector all month, as mean reversion has helped the Health Care Select Sector ETF (XLV) snap back from the dead, turning in rolling one-month gains of 6.44% through Wednesday, trouncing the S&P's 2.44%.\nHealth care lagged the broader market badly off those lows, given the shellacking the biotech sector experienced in recent months.\nSo, interestingly enough, health care has the dubious distinction of being the worst sector over the last three months (+6.44% through Wednesday, more than half the S&P's 13.07%) but the best sector over the rolling 30 days.\nAt present, technically, health care looks like one of the best risk/rewards of any of the major sectors for the coming weeks and months, as it has begun to surge, breaking downtrend lines from last summer and regaining some of its mojo.\nThus, when trying to decide what to buy in this challenging market, it's worth considering this group given recent outperformance coinciding with structurally sound technicals, improving momentum yet with prices well off 52-week highs."}
