To be sure, the Court hadn't gone full-tilt liberal \u2013 it still upheld lethal injection and struck down environmental regulations attempting to protect against pollution. But in the most high-profile decisions, there was a decidedly leftward tilt for the Court.\n\nExpect all that to come to a screeching halt this term, which starts this week; the coming months are likely to bring some pretty regressive decisions that are more in line with what we've come to expect from the Republican-controlled Roberts Court.\n\nIf there's any upside to this likely flood of conservative decisions, it's that it might be the kick in the pants voters need to turn out for the 2016 presidential election. Last term's social justice wins on the Court may have made people forget the significance of a Supreme Court justice's political affiliation, as well as that of the president appointing a particular justice. After all, if Anthony Kennedy, a Republican appointed by President Reagan, and John Roberts, a Republican appointed by President Bush II, could join various liberal decisions, the thinking goes, then maybe the political affiliation of Supreme Court justices doesn't matter \u2013 right? Not so much.\n\nCurrently, Republicans have a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court. The five Republicans don't always vote together, as last term showed us, but they often do \u2013 together, they've built one of the most conservative judicial records in the Court's history.\n\nRight now, four Supreme Court justices are at least 77 years old: Stephen Breyer (77) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (82), who are both Democrats, and Anthony Kennedy (79) and Antonin Scalia (79), who are both Republicans. Without even considering these justices' individual medical histories, at those ages, it's hard to imagine all four of them remaining on the Court for another nine years. Which means that the next president, especially if she or he serves two terms, will almost certainly appoint at least one, and maybe even four, new justices to the Court.\n\nIf the next president is a Democrat \u2013 Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders or (who knows!) Joe Biden \u2013 and she or he gets to replace Kennedy and Scalia, the replacements could radically shift the balance of power, especially if the president's appointments are particularly young. We would have a liberal block on the Court that we haven't seen in generations: a Supreme Court that protects minorities, expands abortion rights, guarantees privacy, is concerned about the environment, opens access to courts for the poor, ensures workers are treated fairly and more. In other words, a Democratic president will likely have the opportunity to shift the Court into being something that most of us under age 50 have only read about in history books.\n\nBut if the next president is a Republican \u2013 Marco Rubio, say, or (please no) Donald Trump \u2013 and that person has the opportunity to replace Breyer and Ginsburg, the Court's current Republican majority will become an almost unstoppable 7-2 juggernaut. If that Republican president also gets to replace Scalia and Kennedy, those justices will be replaced with younger, possibly more conservative versions of themselves \u2013 ensuring a decades-long continuation, or even expansion, of one of the most conservative Supreme Courts in history. The occasional liberal victory, like the ones we've seen recently, would become an endangered species, and possibly even extinct.\n\nA rights-expanding, worker-friendly, environmentally minded, fair-access-concerned Supreme Court for the first time in generations? Or an even more extreme version of the uber-conservative Roberts Court? After the Supreme Court was awash in rainbows earlier this year, it may be easy to forget, but these are the unbelievably high stakes of next November's election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The next president will hold tremendous power over the make-up of the Supreme Court, and therefore the rights of millions of Americans.", "og": {"site_name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "The next president will hold tremendous power over the Supreme Court's make-up, and therefore the rights of millions of Americans", "title": "The Biggest Thing at Stake in the 2016 Election", "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-biggest-thing-at-stake-in-the-2016-election-20151009", "image": {"width": 1401, "identifier": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2015/article/the-biggest-thing-at-stake-in-the-2016-election-20151009/212346/large_rect/1444401132/1401x788-GettyImages-105065262.jpg", "height": 788}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2015/article/the-biggest-thing-at-stake-in-the-2016-election-20151009/212346/large_rect/1444401132/1401x788-GettyImages-105065262.jpg"}, "description": "The next president will hold tremendous power over the Supreme Court's make-up, and therefore the rights of millions of Americans", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Biggest Thing at Stake in the 2016 Election"}, "fb": {"app_id": 107978575944240}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rollingstone", "published_time": "2015-10-09T15:59:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, target-densityDpi=device-dpi", "news_keywords": "supreme court nominations, supreme court 2016, supreme court republicans, supreme court retirement, rbg retirement"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6663\"", "article_summary": "If there's any upside to this likely flood of conservative decisions, it's that it might be the kick in the pants voters need to turn out for the 2016 presidential election.\nFor a historically conservative Supreme Court, this was a stunning turn of events.\nAfter the Supreme Court was awash in rainbows earlier this year, it may be easy to forget, but these are the unbelievably high stakes of next November's election.\nA rights-expanding, worker-friendly, environmentally minded, fair-access-concerned Supreme Court for the first time in generations?\nCurrently, Republicans have a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court."}
