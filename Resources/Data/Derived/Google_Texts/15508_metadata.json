We were excited to have Australia as a challenger and we were also looking forward to the prospect of holding America's Cup World Series events in Australia.\"\n\nWine tycoon Bob Oatley, who owns the Hamilton Yacht Club, said it had been a financial decision.\n\n\"The challenge was initiated with a view to negotiating a format for the 35th America's Cup that was affordable and put the emphasis back on sailing skills,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately our estimate of the costs of competing were well beyond our initial expectation and our ability to make the formula of our investment and other commercial support add up.\n\n\"We are bitterly disappointed that this emerging team of fine young Australian sailors will not be able to compete at the next America's Cup under our banner.\"\n\nHamilton Island were named as Challengers of Record, who represent all of the challenging teams in negotiations with the holders of sport's oldest sporting trophy, after software billionaire Larry Ellison's Oracle Team USA retained the Cup last year.\n\nOracle won the final winner-takes-all race in San Francisco beating New Zealand 9-8 after the Dean Barker-skippered New Zealanders had held an 8-1 lead before the American team roared back.\n\nNew Zealand's challenge, which was partially government funded, have said they will challenge again, though a lack of clarity on the venue had been putting potential sponsors off committing to fund the venture.\n\nLocal media have reported that sponsors were also concerned at the move away from San Francisco.\n\nOracle and Hamilton Island released the protocol for the next event last month.\n\nThe event will be sailed with a similar but smaller version of the 72-foot (21.94-metre), wing-sail catamarans used in 2013.\n\nThe new 62-foot boats, called AC62s, will be crewed by eight people, three fewer than last year.\n\nNationality rules have also been introduced with at least two of the eight crew members having to be nationals of the country of the yacht club represented.\n\nThe venue will be announced in October.\n\nBritain's Olympic champion Ben Ainslie, who was the tactician on Oracle and widely credited with turning their fortunes around in the last regatta, has said he will head a British challenge.\n\nAmerica's Cup organisers said on Saturday the British were still continuing with their challenge.\n\n\"While the withdrawal of the Challenger of Record is regrettable, it is also not unusual and we will continue our own preparations for the 35th Americas Cup and look forward to an exciting future,\" a statement from Ben Ainslie Racing read.
