Waco Drive, where he will greet the public and autograph copies of his book, \u201cA More Perfect Union.\u201d\n\nThe best-seller addresses the framing of the U.S. Constitution; the rights and liberties it enumerates; and the separation of powers it demands of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government.\n\n\u201cBasically, everybody knows we have a Constitution, but very few know what\u2019s in it, including the guarantee of liberties to citizens that protects us from the expansion, invasion and control of government,\u201d Carson said.\n\nHe said the book has been well- received and his signings around the country typically have attracted sizable crowds.\n\nAddressing the separation of powers the Constitution espouses, Carson criticized President Barack Obama for what he called the abuse of executive orders, saying Obama too often circumvents the authority of Congress by enacting policy on his own.\n\n\u201cExecutive orders are supposed to be temporary measures reserved for situations when Congress is not available to legislate,\u201d Carson said.\n\nInstead, he said, Obama has used them to pursue his version of immigration reform and to craft changes to the Affordable Care Act, the controversial health care program that some refer to as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nCarson said Obama has gotten by with this strategy because \u201che\u2019s dealing with a weak legislative body he knows he can push around.\u201d\n\nThe candidate took issue with some news outlets covering his campaign and what he called \u201cthe dishonesty of the media.\u201d\n\nCarson came under attack for saying he does not think a Muslim should be considered for the office of president, and for saying he would not have \u201cstood by\u201d and been shot by a gunman who killed nine students at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon.\n\n\u201cAnyone from any religion or religious background must be willing to subjugate his or her religious views to the Constitution, and anyone not willing to do that would not be acceptable to me as the leader of this nation,\u201d Carson said.\n\nHe said the media made it appear he was purposely criticizing the victims of the massacre in Oregon, \u201cthough I certainly was not.\u201d He said he was simply trying to make the point that he would encourage the students to rush the shooter in hopes of disarming him.\n\nTrump\u2019s impact\n\nOf Trump, another outsider who never has held political office, Carson said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely glad he\u2019s in the race. He\u2019s getting the attention of people who normally would be sitting on their hands, making them interested in the process.\u201d\n\nAsked about last week\u2019s Democratic presidential candidate debate, including front-runners Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Carson said: \u201cI was surprised to see everyone embrace the policies of the current administration so strongly. I hope that continues; it will make it easy for the electorate to decipher which way it wants to go.\u201d\n\nIf one measures a president\u2019s impact by his ability to carry out a political agenda, then Obama unquestionably has been a success during his nearly seven years in office, Carson said.\n\n\u201cWhat he has done has fundamentally changed America,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the question is: \u2018Is it good for America and what the people want?\u2019 It certainly is not consistent with what I believe or with the opinions of most people I encounter. But that\u2019s why we have elections.\u201d\n\nCarson, known for his thoughtful answers and low-key persona, said he thinks his strength as a candidate is his common sense, \u201cwhich seems to be not so common anymore.\u201d\n\nHe added that political correctness \u201cis antithetical to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. The worst thing about it is that it stifles conversation, which is a killer in a pluralistic society.\u201d\n\nCarson, who is black, said he finds it \u201cvery telling\u201d that there is no ethnic diversity among the Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cI find Republicans much more open to diversity and different thought,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the Democratic side, you must toe the line. They are more intolerant, especially of people like myself. If you\u2019re black and you think for yourself, you\u2019re an Uncle Tom.\u201d\n\nThe candidate said he \u201ccontinues to walk through doors that the good Lord opened.\u201d\n\n\u2018Citizen statesmen\u2019\n\nCarson said the pundits contend he has no business succeeding as he has, running second in most national polls behind Trump, \u201cbut I view myself as the first in a long line of citizen statesmen.\n\n\u201cThere is a sizable list of people in our country who are more adept at solving problems than politicians, but they are hesitant to run, knowing they will be abused and their families will be abused,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. military has suffered under Obama, Carson said, with budget trimming \u201ccutting the heart out of our personnel numbers at the same time jihadists are growing.\n\n\u201cMorale is low, recruitment is down 14 percent, and 22 veterans commit suicide every day. It\u2019s a dismal situation, and with what\u2019s going on in the world today, (it\u2019s) the wrong time for our military to be going down.\u201d\n\nCarson said so far he has visited every state except North Dakota, and he has a donor base in every state.\n\nHe said he often visits Texas, \u201cand I\u2019ve found it full of people with common sense, though it is being infiltrated by more and more people from California, so I suspect it\u2019s going to change. Right now, it\u2019s still OK.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Carson said, he would immediately call a special session of Congress to announce that \u201cwe work for the people; they don\u2019t work for us.\u201d He would sign no budget increases, he said, adding, \u201cDo that for two or three years, and we\u2019d have a balanced budget.\u201d\n\n-----\n\nIf you go\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson will hold a book signing in Waco:\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Monday\n\nWhere: Barnes & Noble Booksellers, 4909 W.
