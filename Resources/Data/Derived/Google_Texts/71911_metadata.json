And little of it is good news, as home births by default are riskier than hospital births. Given the raft of possible complications, many also wonder what effect Born in the Wild will have on the viewing audience, particularly those who may see the decision as a viable method.\n\n\u201cI understand everybody wants to believe we over-medicalize pregnancy and that it\u2019s a natural process,\u201d Dr. Ron Jaekle, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cBut it\u2019s a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life.\u201d\n\nNaturalness may be the linchpin of the show\u2019s appeal. The women that signed up did so because they were dissatisfied with their initial experiences at the hospital. They wanted a more natural experience. Lifetime has already expressed that, in order to be eligible for the show, each woman had to be healthy and have one birth already under her belt; first-timers eager to greet the outdoors need not apply.\n\nBut \u201cnatural\u201d births aren\u2019t automatically safe. For centuries, the two groups with the highest mortality rates were newborns and the mothers who delivered them naturally. Even today, in many developing countries still untouched by modern medicine, these inflated rates hold steady. Data from the World Health Organization show that three quarters of all newborn deaths occur in the first week of life. Worse, nearly half of all mothers and newborns do not receive skilled care during and immediately after birth.\n\nLifetime contends that it is taking great steps to ensure the women and children of Born in the Wild don\u2019t turn out like third-world births, however. Eli Lehrer, Lifetime\u2019s senior VP and head of nonfiction programming, tells EW that a trained medical professional will be on standby at all times, and the show will never film outside a reasonable radius from a hospital \u2014 just in case. Complications could range from women bleeding out, to breeched births, to umbilical cords wrapped around babies\u2019 necks \u2014 a phenomenon formally known as \u201cnuchal cord.\u201d\n\nAnd still, even if someone can swoop in to save a miracle-gone-wrong, and a hospital is within driving distance, and even if both mother and child proceed without hitch, that still leaves ample room for danger, Jaekle argues. In fact, the show\u2019s very success could be what poses the greatest threat to mothers who put faith in the show\u2019s premise. \u201c[The number of children impacted] is a small number \u2014 until it\u2019s your kid,\u201d Jaekle told EW. One study found midwife delivery at home results in an average of 12.6 infant deaths per 10,000 births. Meanwhile, midwife delivery in a hospital poses a risk of only 3.2 deaths.\n\nIn other words, while on-screen moms may emerge from the wilderness unscathed, who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t influence mothers at home to do the same? It\u2019s not wild speculation: Psychologists have already demonstrated the how influential reality TV can be. Lehrer, meanwhile, remains unconvinced. \u201cI truly don\u2019t think this is something people would enter into lightly. This is a very specific subset of people doing this.\u201d Maybe, but too bad the same thing didn\u2019t happen with Jackass.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "new, lifetime, show, born, wild, chronicles, women, giving, birth, outdoors, and, putting", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "What should modern medicine make of Lifetime's new \"all-natural\" reality series, \"Born in the Wild\"?", "title": "Lifetime's New Reality Show Takes 'Natural Birth' To Unsafe Extremes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-lifetime-show-born-wild-chronicles-women-giving-birth-outdoors-and-putting-newborns-risk-286644", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/born-wild.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What should modern medicine make of Lifetime's new \"all-natural\" reality series, \"Born in the Wild\"?", "title": "Lifetime's New Reality Show Takes 'Natural Birth' To Unsafe Extremes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-lifetime-show-born-wild-chronicles-women-giving-birth-outdoors-and-putting-newborns-risk-286644", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/born-wild.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/05/born-wild.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-05T14:14:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T14:14:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "What should modern medicine make of Lifetime's new \"all-natural\" reality series, \"Born in the Wild\"?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ae4\"", "article_summary": "And little of it is good news, as home births by default are riskier than hospital births.\nBut \u201cnatural\u201d births aren\u2019t automatically safe.\nLifetime contends that it is taking great steps to ensure the women and children of Born in the Wild don\u2019t turn out like third-world births, however.\nThe women that signed up did so because they were dissatisfied with their initial experiences at the hospital.\nWorse, nearly half of all mothers and newborns do not receive skilled care during and immediately after birth."}
