Some issues, however, were universal for hospitals:\n\n\u25a0 Health-care access\n\n\u25a0 Health disparities\n\n\u25a0 Mental health\n\n\u25a0 Nutrition, physical activity, and obesity\n\n\u25a0 Transportation\n\n\u25a0 Maternal and child health (all hospitals but Brooks Rehab listed this)\n\nThe report took a detailed look at demographics and socioeconomic factors in the region. Duval had the highest poverty rate and the lowest median income, for example, and income and poverty are key factors in health outcomes. The report also looked at health outcomes and rankings \u2014 like Duval\u2019s high rate of sexually transmitted infections and air pollution.\n\nEven where the report found Northeast Florida\u2019s counties did better than the rest of the state and country, like in obesity, hospital executives said it was nothing to praise. \u201cThat simply reflects what a problem we have in our nation,\u201d said Gianrico Farrugia, CEO of Mayo Clinic in Florida, about the lower-than-average obesity rates in Duval, Nassau, Clay and St. Johns.\n\n\u201cOne way to determine what people need is simply to ask, which is what this study did,\u201d said Russ Armistead, CEO and president of UF Health. In addition to using data, the report relied on interviews and town hall meetings.\n\nThe report concluded that affordable care and a lack of knowledge about services, along with dozens of other factors, contribute to Northeast Florida\u2019s health-care needs.\n\nThe study collected data from five of Northeast Florida\u2019s counties \u2014 Baker, Nassau, Clay, St. Johns and Duval counties \u2014 with focus groups and town hall meetings.\n\nThe community\u2019s greatest needs, the report said, are transportation, nutrition and physical activity, access to care, mental health treatment and solutions to health disparities.\n\nThe report also estimated that the population that is 65 or older will grow by 23 percent in five years.\n\nOne of the key issues facing communities across the country is physician shortage, the report said. \u201cCurrent estimates predict a national shortage of between 46,100 and 90,400 active patient care physicians by 2025. \u2026 Various factors contribute to the anticipated shortages, including an increase in insurance coverage due to the Affordable Care Act, higher demand from an aging population, and a large proportion of the current workforce reaching retirement age.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, there already aren\u2019t enough doctors, the report said, and the number of primary-care physicians would need to increase by 38 percent just to maintain status quo. \u201cIn Duval County, between 6.8 and 17.9 percent of physicians are expected to retire within the next five years.\u201d\n\nTom VanOsdol, chief operating officer at St. Vincent\u2019s, said his hospital is trying to recruit more primary-care doctors, and it\u2019s launching a fifth mobile unit that can meet the needs of residents who struggle with transportation.\n\nAndrew Pantazi: (904) 359-4310", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacksonville\u2019s hospitals released Thursday an expansive report looking at the city\u2019s health needs \u2014 with mental health, transportation and access to care leading the long list of needs \u2014 and promising to work to solve problems.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "Jacksonville's hospitals released Thursday an expansive report looking at the city's health needs - with mental health, transportation and access to care leading the long list of needs - and promising to work to solve problems.", "title": "What are Jacksonville's biggest health needs?
