Court against his wife Heather. The hands receiving that information belonged to a gossip columnist for the Washington Post, who made the \u201cinformed decision\u201d to report on it. Later in the day Heather, who is also a lobbyist, informed the Post the text of her counter-suit. It published a follow-up.\n\nThe documents, which you can read below, did not become available to the rest of us until yesterday. They tell stories not only of a May-December romance gone sour, but of how obscene wealth can be amassed through rent-seeking and influence-peddling in Washington D.C., and of the hoary means by which the princelings of the capital and their consorts maintain and grow that wealth. They tell stories not only of an ugly divorce, but of the power of lobbying, of how one family maneuvered to the center of the nation\u2019s dominant political party, of the transactional relationships, gargantuan self-regard, and empty posturing that insulates, asbestos-like, the D.C. bubble.\n\nThat the broken couple now uses the tools of their trade\u2014the phone-call to a friend, the selective leaking of documents, the hiring of attorneys, the launch of a public-relations campaign\u2014against one another is more than ironic. It is fitting. Tony and Heather Podesta reached the pinnacle of wealth and influence in Barack Obama\u2019s Washington. Now they, like he, are in eclipse.\n\nThe stories begin in the fall of 2001. She was in her early thirties, working at a trade association, and on the rebound. Her second marriage had just ended. A friend, Dorothy Robyn, a Democratic policy wonk, suggested she meet Tony Podesta. Tony was decades older than she, and had been married once before, but he was young at heart. He took her to the opera for their first date. On the way, the story goes, they stopped by one of his homes to pick up a car. She noticed his art collection. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it is,\u201d Tony said, \u201cbut I have artworks where the women have no heads.\u201d The next day she sent him a note. It was signed, \u201cWoman with a head.\u201d\n\nThe woman with a head was Heather Miller, and soon she and Tony were in love. They moved in together. When they married, in April of 2003, Tony was 59, and Heather was 33. Nancy Pelosi witnessed their vows, as did Patrick Leahy, and Ed Markey, and Bill Richardson, and countless other Democratic bigwigs. According to the Post, which has chronicled the ups and downs of the Podestas\u2019 relationships and careers, the noted D.C. chefs and restaurateurs Roberto Donna and Kaz Okuchi \u201cpersonally cooked for the guests.\u201d This was no ordinary wedding.\n\nAnd Tony Podesta was no ordinary man. A longtime Democratic aide, a counselor to Teddy Kennedy, Tony had been one of the capital\u2019s most powerful lobbyists for some time. As his lawyers would later put it, \u201c\u2018Podesta\u2019 was a widely recognized and well-respected name in the lobbying industry at the time of the marriage.\u201d The lobbying firm he had established in 1987 was powerfully connected. His younger brother, John, was President Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. Tony Podesta owned art and wine and real estate in Italy, in Australia, in northern Virginia, and in D.C. He was a major Democratic donor, a force to be reckoned with, and a cut-up, a character who wore loud neckties and red Prada shoes. \u201cThe Pope wears Prada,\u201d he is known to say, \u201cand so do I.\u201d\n\nHeather changed her name\u2014something she had not done in her previous marriages\u2014to Heather Miller Podesta. She emulated her spouse, developing, in the words of the Post, \u201ca penchant for flamboyantly patterned dresses.\u201d She joined the company, began lobbying. She picked up Tony\u2019s art habit, and together they amassed a collection of more than 1,300 pieces. She set to work, renovating their six bedrooms, six-and-a-half bathroom home in Northwest D.C. off of Massachusetts Avenue, overlooking the Rock Creek Parkway.\n\nShe wanted, her lawyers would say later, \u201cto create a uniquely beautiful architectural space for the dual purposes of having a wonderful home in which to live and promote their shared interests, both professional and personal.\u201d The renovation took three years and cost millions of dollars. The \u201cmarital residence,\u201d where they promoted their shared interests in holding parties and fundraisers for Democratic politicians, and housed immense wine and art collections, is estimated to be worth some $5.6 million. Concerned about income inequality? The Podestas are the One Percent.\n\nThey would visit their apartment in Venice, Italy, up to a dozen times a year, hosting Janet Napolitano, entertaining passersby such as Reps. Shelley Berkley and Eliot Engel, \u201ceven,\u201d the Post once breathlessly intoned, \u201cTeddy Kennedy.\u201d They\u2019d open their homes to tours, so people could enjoy the art, could witness the spectacle of their wealth. One story they liked to tell took place in 2004, when the guests at their northern Virginia home, near Lake Barcroft, walked into a bedroom festooned with the works of Katy Grannan, \u201ca photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents\u2019 suburban homes.\u201d The guests were shocked. But oh, how Tony and Heather laughed.\n\nIn 2007 Podesta Matoon became the Podesta Group. Heather formed Heather Podesta + Partners, establishing two prongs of the Podesta family empire. The third prong was the Center for American Progress, founded in 2003 by John Podesta, who would oversee President Obama\u2019s transition team in 2009, and join the Obama administration as a senior adviser in 2014. The Podestas had become the most important non-elected family in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2009, with the inauguration of Obama and the dawn of unified Democratic control of Washington, business boomed. Revenues at Tony\u2019s firm close to doubled, and revenues at Heather\u2019s firm increased by 50 percent. The money has continued to roll in. The Podesta Group had some $13 million in lobbying income in 2013, sporting clients such as Lockheed Martin, Wells Fargo, U.S. Airways, Walmart, and the National Biodiesel Board. Heather Podesta + Partners made some $4 million, lobbying on behalf of health companies, the American Beverage Association, Brookfield Power, DeVry University, and others. A portion of that money was recycled, contributing to Democratic campaigns, opening up avenues of influence: Tony gave some $45,500 in 2013, all to Democrats; Heather some $95,798 to Democrats, Democratic committees, and liberal groups.\n\nAs government expands, extending its reach to every aspect of business, every sector of the economy, private citizens and corporations require sherpas to lead them through the mountains of regulations and tax provisions, to discover exemptions and special favors and other forms of relief or favoritism to improve the bottom line. And who better to act as sherpas than the relatives of the Democrats who impose the regulations and tax provisions in the first place, who better than the lively proprietors of a family business operating in the luxurious and morally uncomplicated world of the caste of limousine liberals who dominate politics, culture, news, and finance.\n\nCorporations give to Democratic politicians, avoiding the scrutiny of liberal attack dogs in the media and nonprofit sectors, and enjoying the ego boost that comes with being on the \u201cright side of history.\u201d Then those corporations hire the Podestas to get them out of the Rube Goldberg traps the Democrats have enacted into law. John\u2019s innovation was to establish a corporate-funded think tank where the burdensome policies would be concocted, and whose staff would go on to man the regulatory agencies that put their wool-headed ideas into practice. And to whom do the corporations turn when they find themselves on the receiving end of all this uplift, all this do-goodery, all this progress, hope, and change? Why, to the man in the red Prada loafers, and to his flamboyantly patterned wife.\n\nIt was in 2009 that the Washington Post dubbed Heather Podesta the \u201cIt Girl in a new generation of young, highly connected, built-for-the-Obama-era lobbyists.\u201d The appellation was bestowed in a lengthy and fawning \u201cStyle\u201d profile, which acted as a sort of advertisement for her lobbying firm. Heather Podesta lamented in the piece that the onrush of business, the peals from health insurance and green energy companies looking for special treatment under the new Democratic dispensation, had interfered with her and her husband\u2019s international travel. Whereas they used to visit Venice up to a dozen times annually, Podesta said, \u201cNow we only maybe get there six times a year.\u201d The poor dears.\n\nThe next year, Washington gadfly Tammy Haddad reported on Heather\u2019s fortieth birthday for Politico. \u201cAttending a Tony Podesta party is a pretty good way to start a new year,\u201d Haddad wrote, \u201cbut a party to celebrate his wife Heather\u2019s 40th birthday at their new showcase home is a great way to start a new decade.\u201d It was downhill from there. Like Elvis, with whom she shares a birthday, Heather Podesta, Haddad said, had \u201cbecome a rock star in the Washington power scene as a top lobbyist.\u201d There were red-velvet cupcakes. An Elvis impersonator gyrated for guests. Democratic Congressman John Larson and \u201cTerry Lierman, chief of staff to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, took a tour of the provocative and sometimes whimsical artwork with Jane Oates, John O\u2019Leary, Conrad Cafritz, and Hilary Rosen.\u201d Also there was Jonathan Silver, \u201cthe Energy Department\u2019s new money man,\u201d who gave the American taxpayer Solyndra, and who coordinated strategy with John Podesta\u2019s Center for American Progress.\n\nThose winsome days have passed, however. The couple separated a month before Obama\u2019s reelection. Their marriage\u2019s denouement, as related in their divorce filings, is like a retelling of The War of the Roses. He says that in March 2013, months after they had separated, she asked for money to \u201cpurchase a multi-million dollar residence for herself,\u201d and he agreed to pay half of the down payment. What he did not know at the time was that she was seeing another man. She says he\u2019s prevented her from accessing the database that keeps track of the art collection. He says she changed the locks on the Venetian flat. She says he\u2019s trying to get rid of the art before the court divides it between them. He says she forced the \u201ccancelation of a scheduled exhibition at the Australian embassy.\u201d She wants the Kalorama house, half the art, and \u201can equitable division of the parties\u2019 other marital property, including the value of each party\u2019s lobbying firm, retirement accounts, securities, business assets, tangible personal property, including jewelry, wine collection, and all other marital property.\u201d He just wants to be rid of her.\n\nIf Heather Podesta has a flaw in the eyes of Washington it is that she is entirely too honest about the mechanics of lobbying. When she launched her independent company in 2007 it was with the slogan, \u201cWe know people.\u201d Dianne Feinstein once canceled a fundraiser organized by the Podestas, the Post reported years ago, after she got wind that the invitation read as follows: \u201cThe prix fixe includes the Select Committee on Intelligence for the first course followed by your choice of Appropriations, Judiciary, or Rules Committees.\u201d\n\nHeather Podesta\u2019s court filing is just as direct. \u201cAs a married couple who both lobbied,\u201d it reads, \u201cthey strategically cultivated their public image, and worked to build the \u2018Heather and Tony Podesta\u2019 brand for the success of their shared enterprise.\u201d Now that shared enterprise is no more, the Heather and Tony Podesta brand is damaged, and all the years of strategic cultivation is in danger of coming undone. This \u201cmarried couple who both lobbied\u201d is sundered, revealing a political culture of pettiness and greed, and reminding us that there are few things as revolting, intellectually, morally, and ethically, as the \u201cWashington power scene.\u201d\n\nRead both Podesta divorce filings below:\n\nTony Podesta Divorce Filing by WashingtonFreeBeacon\n\nHeather Podesta Counterclaim by WashingtonFreeBeacon", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "\u201cI see lobbying,\u201d Tony Podesta has said, \u201cas getting information in the hands of people who are making decisions so they can make more informed decisions.\u201d Last week the information Tony Podes", "title": "Divorce Beltway Style", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/columns/divorce-beltway-style/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Tony-and-Heather-Podesta-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Tony-and-Heather-Podesta-150x150.png", "description": "\u201cI see lobbying,\u201d Tony Podesta has said, \u201cas getting information in the hands of people who ar", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Divorce Beltway Style"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Heather formed Heather Podesta + Partners, establishing two prongs of the Podesta family empire.\nThe hands receiving that information belonged to a gossip columnist for the Washington Post, who made the \u201cinformed decision\u201d to report on it.\nTony and Heather Podesta reached the pinnacle of wealth and influence in Barack Obama\u2019s Washington.\nTony Podesta owned art and wine and real estate in Italy, in Australia, in northern Virginia, and in D.C.\nA friend, Dorothy Robyn, a Democratic policy wonk, suggested she meet Tony Podesta."}
