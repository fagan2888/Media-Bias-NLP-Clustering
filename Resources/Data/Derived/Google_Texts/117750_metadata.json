Scary movies and phobias can produce a terrifying full-body experience, and even be a little dangerous for our health. Our perception of these consistent threats actually controls the amount of fear we\u2019re able to feel, but could our fear actually kill us? According to AsapSCIENCE\u2019s video \u201cCan You Be Scared To Death?,\u201d the short answer is yes.\n\nThe feeling of terror has the ability to activate our natural protective mechanism \u2014 the fight or flight response, and release adrenaline. Our involuntary nervous system is able to respond to an increase in heart rate, blood flow to the muscles, and dilating pupils, while slowing down digestion, among other things. As a result, you become temporarily stronger and faster. However, too much fear can kink this into overdrive, which could damage heart tissue and even stop it from bleeding all together, says AsapSCIENCE.\n\nAthletes are vulnerable to experiencing this fatal rush of adrenaline as a result of stimulated threats during intense competition. Moreover, spectators are also susceptible to its effects. A 2008 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found heart attacks more than doubled in countries in cities where the home team was eliminated during the 2006 World Cup.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say if you\u2019re heart healthy then the incident of being scared to death is extremely low. Also, if we train ourselves to think differently about fears, we can actually reduce the amount of adrenaline they produce \u2014 even if we have inherited that fear from our ancestors.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "science, being, scared, death, fight, or, flight, response, adrenaline, lead, rapid, heart, beat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "How healthy your heart is and your perception of fear can determine whether or not you can be scared to death.", "title": "Can You Really Be Scared To Death?
