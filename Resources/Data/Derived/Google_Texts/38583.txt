A wildfire burning north of Silverthorne was 30 percent contained Saturday evening, and Lake Dillon Fire Rescue estimated it would be fully contained by 7 p.m. Sunday.

The fire, much of it on national forest land, has burned more than 200 acres, officials said Saturday.

No residences are threatened, according to officials. The Brush Creek Ranch was voluntarily evacuated Friday night.

On Saturday afternoon, about 100 firefighters were on the ground trying to get a ring around the 229-acre fire while a helicopter dropped water from above, firefighters said.

The blaze is burning roughly 2 miles north of Colorado 9 near Ute Pass Road. Part of the fire is on the Brush Creek Ranch.

The fire, near the community of Heeney, was renamed the Brush Creek fire Saturday. It was originally named the Cemetery Ridge fire. The fire is burning dried grasses, beetle-killed pines and aspens.

Jeff Berino, Lake Dillon fire chief, told the Summit Daily that the wind has made it difficult for firefighters.

“It’s been a challenge as the wind is shifting back and forth,” he said. “Fortunately, it’s in an isolated area.”

“It’s probably going to take a few days to get it 100 percent contained, but we’re pretty confident that the threat to the highway and any structures here locally will be pretty well minimized once we get this area in front of us buttoned up,” Lake Dillon Assistant Fire Chief Bruce Farrell told 7News.

The Summit County Sheriff’s Office said on Twitter that local and mutual aid engines were working the blaze, along with the U.S. Forest Service.

Firefighters involved include Breckenridge’s Red, White & Blue Fire, Copper Mountain Fire, NorthWest Fire from Park County, Vail Fire and Kremmling Fire.
