The third Republican primary debate will focus on job growth, taxes, technology, retirement and national economic health. As younger brother of former President George W. Bush, Jeb Bush\u2019s political movements are under scrutiny. Here is a quick look at what he\u2019s proposing:\n\nCutting the corporate tax\n\nThe top corporate tax rate would be reduced from 35 to 20 percent, which Bush argues will stop American companies from moving out of the country.\n\nCorporate deductions\n\nBush\u2019s plan would allow companies to deduct the costs of their capital investments from what they eventually pay in taxes. Bush argues that this will encourage more investment in American corporations; the size of standard deductions would nearly double. Bush also plans to eliminate the tax deduction for paying interest on the money businesses borrow, and these two policies may have a cancelling-out effect on how businesses are ultimately affected.\n\nLower individual tax rates\n\nThe most prominent aspect of Bush\u2019s economic plan is reducing the amount of tax brackets from seven to three. Those brackets would be taxed 28, 25 and 10 percent respectively \u2014 you can view the income amounts to which the brackets apply in a chart by NPR here.\n\nExpand the earned income tax credit\n\nBush hopes to double the earned income tax credit for childless workers, which could encourage more Americans to enter the workforce.\n\nObamacare will be repealed, but there will be a replacement\n\nBush supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, and would replace it with a government-funded coverage system alternative. His plan would put the 17 million participants in a so-called \u201ctransition plan\u201d away from the current healthcare system. Bush has not specified what this transition plan entails. The plan overall would most likely lower health care costs, but it would do so by lowering the amount of benefits health plans are required to cover.\n\nMedicare will become a voucher system\n\nThe government\u2019s guaranteed insurance plan would become a voucher plan, in which senior citizens are given set amounts of money to find private health insurance. This plan would address the fact that the Medicare program is underfunded and, as it stands, cannot hold up forever. The downside is that the voucher would only be worth a certain amount \u2014 senior citizens would be left to pay the difference in their health plan\u2019s cost.\n\nRaising the retirement age\n\nBush is in favor of bringing the retirement age from 65 to somewhere around 68 to 70, which could have several unintended negative effects. The goal of the plan is to make the Social Security program more manageable, because in the long term, its current funding structure will not be able to sustain it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A rundown of Bush's proposals pre-debate.
