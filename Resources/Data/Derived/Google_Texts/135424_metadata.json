And in several weeks, all traces will be wiped away by new construction.\n\nDuring a recent archaeological excavation that is part of the requirements for the upcoming Sunset Bridge Improvement Project, investigators unearthed the oldest footprints that have been found to date in Southern Arizona, according to the project's head archaeologist Ian Milliken.\n\nThe footprints date to 800 to 500 B.C.E. and were likely preserved when an ancient flood washed sands over the area, Milliken said.\n\nAll told, there are more than 100 footprints, coming from men, women, children, even dogs \u2013 indicating that prehistoric people from this area had domesticated canines, he said.\n\nScientists have taken samples of the dirt to determine what used to grow in the farm fields, most likely corn and squash, he said.\n\nBut time marches on, and with the impending road project, the county is offering an opportunity for the public to view the site before it's gone. The media got a special tour Saturday in advance of the public opening.\n\nPublic tours will be offered every 30 minutes between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on the following dates:\n\nSunday, Jan. 24\n\nFriday, Jan. 29\n\nSaturday, Jan. 30\n\nSunday, Jan. 31\n\nFriday, Feb. 5\n\nSaturday, Feb. 6\n\nSunday, Feb. 7\n\nThe site is on the west side of I-10 at the intersection with Sunset Road. A fenced dirt parking lot is at the southwest corner of the intersection, and access to the area requires a short walk over uneven terrain, according to a media release. Participants must wear close-toed shoes and should also wear sunscreen and hats and bring water.\n\nAn app with a 3-D model of the site will soon be available at www.archaeologysouthwest.org, ensuring the footprints will be preserved long after the road project has taken over.\n\nCopyright 2016 Tucson News Now.
