China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp and the State Development & Investment Corp were provided discretionary power to make new investments and dispose of assets.\n\n($1 = 6.5338 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Matthew Miller; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/25/China-reform-SOEs-using-investment-firms-asset-managers-Xinhua", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Two central government-owned asset management and investment firms, China Chengtong Ho", "title": "China to reform SOEs using investment firms, asset managers: Xinhua"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/25/China-reform-SOEs-using-investment-firms-asset-managers-Xinhua", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Two central government-owned asset management and investment firms, China Chengtong Ho", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Two central government-owned asset management and investment firms, China Chengtong Holdings Group Ltd and China Reform Holdings Corp, will take on broader responsibilities, investing, holding and managing shareholdings on behalf of the government, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\nChina Chengtong and China Reform Holdings will be empowered to promote mergers and restructuring across a range of industries, while overseeing investment in strategic industries, the news agency said.\nChina Reform Holdings, which is owned by SASAC, was established at the end of 2010 with a mandate to restructure and merge small and uncompetitive SOEs.\nSeparately, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which overseas central government conglomerates, will select three to five companies as pilot state asset investment firms, Xinhua said.\nThe announcement was made at a news briefing by SASAC, the National Development and Reform Commission, Xinhua said."}
