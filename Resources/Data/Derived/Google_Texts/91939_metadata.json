John Walsh out of the race.\n\nWhile the polls already place the Senate race as practically unwinnable for Curtis, some of Curtis\u2019s beliefs will certainly help push that over the edge.\n\nAs a state representative, Curtis vlogged after each day during the legislative session and some of her off-the-cuff remarks are way out there. Millennials should find at least one of her beliefs particularly troubling.\n\nOn April 4, 2013, the Montana state house was considering a resolution that they would send to the U.S. Congress decrying the state of the economy and the need for change so that the outrageous debts of today are not passed on to the millennial generation and beyond.\n\nCurtis called this resolution all \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d and \u201cuntrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not stand for fear mongering,\u201d she said in her daily vlog.\n\nShe went on to make fun of the Republican who introduced the resolution.\n\n\u201cThere was even a little bit of drama where he was crying for his nieces and nephews because they were going to inherit this debt. It\u2019s bull and that\u2019s the nice word for it,\u201d Curtis said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making this up. It\u2019s like science and mathematics. It\u2019s arithmetic folks!\u201d\n\nSomeone might want to tell the teacher to double-check her math.\n\nRecent figures from The Can Kicks Back, a nonpartisan campaign focused on decreasing the national debt, found that the country\u2019s real debt exceeds $200 trillion. This real debt factors in the current national debt \u2014 $17.6 trillion \u2014 as well as all unfunded obligations currently approved by the federal government.\n\nTo cover this staggering amount, future tax hikes would have to be as much as 65 percent, a number they estimate to be as much as 60 cents on every dollar that millennials earn.\n\nCouple that with the more than $1 trillion today\u2019s millennials owe on student loans and you have a generation that will be paying off the government for policies they couldn\u2019t vote for and services like Social Security that they will likely never receive. Obamacare also majorly added to this debt, transferring the burden of healthcare costs onto healthy young people.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office issued a similar warning back in July. CBO officials said that the national debt is about 74 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. The historical average of debt to GDP is 39 percent.\n\nTo stay at this already high level, the U.S. would have to see a 6.5 percent increase in new taxes each year or a 6 percent cut each year. To get back down to the historical average, the CBO estimates that it would take a $465 billion spending cut or new revenues in that amount every year until 2039.\n\nJust who does Curtis believe will be paying for this?\n\nWe should be worried about the kind of math she is teaching her students.\n\nWatch the full vlog from April 4, 2013 below:\n\nThe Montana GOP also put together a highlights reel from some of her other vlogs:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Amanda Curtis, a state legislator from Butte, Montana was selected as the replacement candidate for the U.S. Senate race against Republican Rep.
