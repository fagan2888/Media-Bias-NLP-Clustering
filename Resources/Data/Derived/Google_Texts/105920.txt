In addition to performing “Highlights” and “Ultralight Beam” on last night’s “Saturday Night Live,” Kanye West found himself in a rap battle with cast member Kyle Mooney.

“This is the thing I’ve wanted my whole life,” said Mooney when talking about his plans to confront West. “This is what I’ve been working for. This is what I’ve been building towards.”

“My goal here,” Mooney explained, “is for people all over the world to look at me and just go like, ‘Wait a second, that’s hip-hop.'”

When Mooney confronted Kanye in the hallways of 30 Rock, the battle was unsurprisingly one-sided.

“That was the biggest mistake of my life,” Mooney reflected. “I just destroyed Kanye in a rap battle. And now he’s probably really sad.”
