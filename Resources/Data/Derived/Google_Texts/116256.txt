MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- It's the building on Madison Avenue with the brand-new big Obamacare sign on the outside.

Inside, you'll find people like Shirley Lucas, who walks with a cane and a limp.

"When I say hard, it's hard," Lucas said.

She currently pays about $50 to go back and forth to clinics for treatments.

"I'm constantly going to the doctor, and it's steadily taking money out of my pocket," Lucas explained. "Then I got hospital bills, hospital bills and I can't pay them."

Monday, Lucas and her sister went to the Health Help Agency to sign up for affordable healthcare.

"We both don't have insurance," Lucas told WREG.

"We figured opening a spot for them to be able to come in and talk to an agent -- they're going to be better helped," Yalonda Elder said.

Elder is one of many helping people navigate the insurance maze.

She said it is important for everyone to secure health insurance before the Dec. 15 deadline.

"The penalties this year have actually gotten higher," Lucas said. "So if they do not have medical coverage, they will be penalized."

"I seen it said penalized $700 -- it took my eyes real close," Lucas said. "I said what?"

She said $700 was a price tag she, and so many others, could not afford.
