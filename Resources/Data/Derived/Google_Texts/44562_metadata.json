Sen. Nancy Detert (R-Venice) says it\u2019s too easy for private guardians to take advantage of their wards.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce they run through your liquid assets the guardian can then sell your home and continue to pay themselves and if you don\u2019t like it we have no recourse,\u201d Detert says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an 800 number. We don\u2019t have anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t like it, you have to hire your own lawyer, and the guardian uses your mother\u2019s money to pay themselves for their lawyer,\u201d\n\nThe state already regulates publicly appointed guardians, but there\u2019s no oversight for private operators. Detert says the governor and elder affairs secretary support her efforts change that. The bill is headed for the Senate floor and a similar version has two stops left in the House.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "State lawmakers are taking steps to protect seniors from guardian abuse.\u00a0 Sen.
