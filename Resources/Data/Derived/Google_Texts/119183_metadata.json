The average cashier made $21,530, and the average meat packer got $25,960.\n\nNiccollai was paid about 25 times as much as the full-time workers contributing to his salary \u2014 and most of UFCW 464A\u2019s members don\u2019t work full-time.\n\nUFCW 464A took $445 per member from 10,603 part-time workers and $497 per member from 4,989 full-time workers last year, not including initiation fees.\n\nSetting aside the money Niccollai got from UFCW headquarters, his 2014 pay would break down to more than $35 from every UFCW 464A member.\n\nUFCW 464A did not respond to a Watchdog.org request for comment on how union compensation is determined and disclosed to members.\n\nNiccollai\u2019s father was a UFCW 464A officer for decades. Niccollai\u2019s son, John Niccollai III, was paid $250,835 last year as UFCW 464A\u2019s operations director.\n\nAlluding to questions about union boss pay, an undated release on the UFCW 464A website told members to beware of \u201cAnti-Union radicals posing as journalists in a concerted effort to destroy the Labor Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Radicals contend Union Leaders are grossly over-paid,\u201d UFCW 464A explained. \u201cWhen we compare the salaries of Union Leaders to that of their Corporate equals, the argument is utterly absurd and without one shred of merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason these radicals are making Union Leaders\u2019 wages an issue is clearly intended to build dissension in the ranks,\u201d UFCW 464A added.\n\nAt a 2014 meeting, Niccollai warned UFCW 464A members about an \u201cassault\u201d on labor unions by \u201cthe greedy few.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur numbers are being threatened by those who wish to concentrate the wealth of our nation into the hands of a small few at the expense of the middle class,\u201d Niccollai said.\n\nNiccollai\u2019s compensation is an extreme example of a state and national trend.\n\n\u201cIn Pennsylvania, there is often a wide gap between union leaders and the rank and file,\u201d Elizabeth Stelle, policy director for the free-market Commonwealth Foundation, said in an email to Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cUFCW President Wendell Young IV pulls in more than $330,000 a year, while the average liquor store clerk earns a salary of $31,700,\u201d Stelle said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for union members to choose to pay their leaders well, it\u2019s another thing when the dues used to pay these high salaries are forced.\u201d\n\nBecause the current system benefits the union, UFCW and its affiliates have spent big fighting efforts to break Pennsylvania\u2019s state monopoly on the sale of alcohol.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taxpayer-subsidized dues collection that allows union bosses to collect hefty salaries, a privilege no other political organization enjoys,\u201d Stelle told Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania workers helped pay union boss John Niccollai's $573,299 salary last year, whether they knew it or not.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Thousands of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania workers helped pay union boss John Niccollai's $573,299 salary last year, whether they knew it or not.", "title": "One New Jersey union boss was paid $600,000 in 2014 - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/ufcw-twitter-solidarityfist.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-07T08:57:03+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/216073/new-jersey-union/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Thousands of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania workers helped pay union boss John Niccollai's $573,299 salary last year, whether they knew it or not.", "title": "One New Jersey union boss was paid $600,000 in 2014 - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/ufcw-twitter-solidarityfist.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-05-07T04:00:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-07T08:57:03+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "union bosses, union boss pay, union pay, john niccollai, ufcw, united food and commercial workers, ufcw 464a, ufcw local 464, new jersey food and commercial workers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd383e\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgUnion boss John Niccollai took in $600,000 last year, and thousands of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania workers helped pay him.\nUFCW 464A did not respond to a Watchdog.org request for comment on how union compensation is determined and disclosed to members.\n\u201cIn Pennsylvania, there is often a wide gap between union leaders and the rank and file,\u201d Elizabeth Stelle, policy director for the free-market Commonwealth Foundation, said in an email to Watchdog.org.\nThe average food preparation and serving worker in New Jersey was paid $24,320 last year.\nAlluding to questions about union boss pay, an undated release on the UFCW 464A website told members to beware of \u201cAnti-Union radicals posing as journalists in a concerted effort to destroy the Labor Movement.\u201d\u201cThe Radicals contend Union Leaders are grossly over-paid,\u201d UFCW 464A explained."}
