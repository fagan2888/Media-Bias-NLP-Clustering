Tea Partiers force a showdown over ObamaCare\n\nThe threat of a government shutdown is growing as House Republicans move toward voting to strip ObamaCare of its funding in a bill needed to keep federal agencies open after September 30. GOP leaders, under threat of a revolt by Tea Party conservatives, are expected to announce the plan Wednesday. An attempt to undercut the health-care law would set up a stalemate with Senate Democrats, leaving federal agencies unable to open on October 1.
