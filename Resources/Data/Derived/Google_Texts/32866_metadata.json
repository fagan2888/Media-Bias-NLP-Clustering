No one \u2014 not Rand Paul, not Marco Rubio, certainly not Chris Christie, who expanded Medicaid under Obamacare \u2014 has fought Obamacare\u2019s implementation in a more demonstrated way than Cruz. Clearly, he shut down the government in a ridiculous, nonstarter effort to \u201cdefund\u201d the law. On Sunday, Cruz told the Washington Post that Republicans should \u201cpursue every means possible to repeal Obamacare.\u201d Merits of the shutdown past and reconciliation future aside, dismantling Obamacare has been the core issue of Cruz\u2019s political career \u2014 he ran on it in his Senate bid. This was his pitch in 2012: \u201cI\u2019m not running as a lawyer. I\u2019m running as a fighter.\u201d\n\nThe portfolio has to go beyond Obamacare, though. And based on the speeches Cruz has been giving lately, here\u2019s the kind of pitch Cruz is probably going to make to conservatives: I will lower taxes, I will protect religious liberty, I will enforce immigration laws strictly, I will defend Israel, I will restore America\u2019s robust presence in the world.\n\nStumping for Republican Senate candidate David Perdue in October, he emphasized the Hobby Lobby case, the threat of ISIS, and immigration. He has a small library of failed legislative efforts to back these up. In print and on stage this year, he\u2019s gone hard defending Israel.\n\nIt all sounds like a lot of the conservative priorities right now. And presumably, these are not random choices.\n\n\u201cAs Sun Tzu said, every battle is won before it is fought,\u201d he told Texas Monthly\u2019s Erica Grieder, who\u2019s written the best profiles of the senator. He was speaking of his litigation career, but he could have been talking politics. \u201cIt is won by choosing the terrain on which the battle is fought.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s this, perhaps the most important thing, and something that may surprise reporters who find him stiff and distant: If you put Cruz on a stage and then on the ground in the middle of a bunch of Republican families, he is warm, funny, and sincere.\n\nCruz\u2019s dour image might actually play to his advantage a little, insofar as it dramatically manages your expectations. I was in Georgia last month, outside Savannah, watching Cruz campaign for Perdue. Here\u2019s what he opened with:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the news about people jumping the fence at the White House \u2014 the guy who jumped over the eight-foot fence in front of the White House earlier this year. The Secret Service tries to run him down. They finally catch him, and they turn to him and say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Mr. President, you\u2019ve got two more years!\u2019\n\nThis week, somebody again jumped over the fence. The Secret Service catches this one, too, and this time they say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Hillary, not yet!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe laughter cut through the crowd \u2014 mostly families and older couples at a farm \u2014 and then turned to loud applause at the real punch line: \u201cAnd not ever!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s, like, not a bad joke. He had others. He delivers them well. Ted Cruz can be funny.\n\nThe biggest applause of the afternoon, though, may have been for Cruz\u2019s bill to strip Americans who join ISIS of their U.S. citizenship.\n\n\u201cYou want to know how radical and extreme the Democrats are? The Democrats stood up on the Senate floor and blocked that legislation,\u201d Cruz then said to a small gasp of a reaction.\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d one man said. Cruz left out the full details of the bill\u2019s outcome: He asked for the bill to be passed by unanimous consent, despite the complex legal issue of stripping citizenship. One senator, Mazie Hirono, objected on reasonable procedural grounds \u2014 the bill hadn\u2019t been considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIt sounded good in Georgia, though. And Cruz is good in this kind of setting.\n\nHe thanked person after person for coming to the event, intent and serious, posing for photos and talking to little kids like they were adults. And while Cruz kind of talks to reporters like a character in a 19th century novel \u2014 performative and clipped \u2014 his rapport with supporters is far more natural.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to shake the next president\u2019s hand!\u201d one woman told Cruz after the event; a number of others offered similar sentiments.\n\nCruz radiated sincerity in Georgia, and complex mental gymnastics aren\u2019t involved to imagine it working in Sioux City, Iowa, or Spartanburg, South Carolina. He can fluidly shift from an emotional appeal to a one-liner and back. And if he exaggerates, if he leaves out critical details, if he turns the somewhat reasonable into the outrageous \u2014 well, Ted Cruz isn\u2019t running as a lawyer, he\u2019s running as a fighter. You can trust him to always fight for conservative principles. And conservatives are the ones voting in Republican primaries.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3498785, "userid": 1003504}, "description": "What happens when you combine establishment credentials with a true believer...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
