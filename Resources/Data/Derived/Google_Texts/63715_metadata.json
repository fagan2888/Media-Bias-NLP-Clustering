(AP) - Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin says the Vermont economy has created thousands of jobs during his almost four years in office. GOP challenger Scott Milne and, more broadly, Republican interest groups say the state\u2019s economy has suffered under his leadership.\n\nVermont has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country and businesses are hiring, Shumlin says. Critics counter that rate is going up and the low rate is because thousands of Vermonters aren\u2019t looking for work. The poverty rate is up, too, and median income is falling.\n\nSo is Vermont\u2019s economy getting better or worse?\n\nIt\u2019s mixed, said Middlebury College Economics Professor Peter Matthews.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot in the Vermont data that you\u2019re not seeing nationally,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nTypically during a recession people leave the workforce after becoming discouraged. As the economy improves they will be drawn back into the labor force and labor rates and employment rates go up, he said.\n\n\u201cIn Vermont we haven\u2019t really seen that for prime-age workers. We\u2019ve seen increases in the number of jobs for younger workers and we\u2019ve actually seen them for older workers,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen dramatic increases in employment for prime-age workers. That\u2019s a bit of a puzzle. It\u2019s a very exaggerated version of a broader national trend.\u201d\n\nPart of Shumlin\u2019s basic campaign pitch is how far the economy as come during his time as governor recovering from the Great Recession. He points to the low unemployment rate and says 9,000 jobs have been created during his time in office, but he\u2019s quick to acknowledge that many Vermonters continue to struggle and more needs to be done.\n\nHis political opponents look at other bits of economic data to show his time has not made the state better. A television ad by the Republican State Leadership Committee, a group promoting Republican candidates, says Vermont has 3,000 fewer workers and it rattles off the names of a number of businesses that have closed.\n\nMatthews said that during an election season many imagine that governors and state legislatures are capable of reversing entrenched national trends.\n\n\u201cSometimes there are trends and puzzles out there that don\u2019t admit obvious explanations,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThe situation for Vermont workers is mixed. There are Vermont workers, especially at the upper end of the income distribution, who are doing well and in fact doing better and there are Vermont workers at the lower end of the distribution who are actually doing worse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic Gov.
