Todd Akin walked quietly off the public stage after being defeated by incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill on election night 2012 without blaming anyone, without casting aspersions, without excuses for his loss.\n\nMeanwhile, the same Republican political establishment that lost every other Senate race that year continued to pile on Akin, claiming his candidacy was responsible for the electoral disaster they oversaw while running away from the six-term Missouri member of Congress.\n\nThey are still blaming Akin today.\n\nBut others are coming to his defense.\n\nIn his new book, \u201cFiring Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom,\u201d Akin offers publicly for the first time a spirited defense of his campaign, including the words that were used to make his name a political byword.\n\nSo does Mike Huckabee, the Fox News Channel host and rising star of the Republican Party, in the form of a foreword to the book.\n\n\u201cTodd didn\u2019t ask for a war with the party establishment, but he sure did get one,\u201d he writes. \u201cNo one in American politics knows better than I do the immediate bias and attacks that come from liberals and the media establishment when Christians with sincere convictions make a move into the political arena. We\u2019ve got to deal with their attacks and have even come to expect them. More shocking are the attacks on social conservatives from party bosses, partisan power brokers and the entrenched GOP establishment. I\u2019m deeply offended by this infighting within the Republican Party, because it is so destructive to the country we care so deeply about.\u201d\n\nHuckabee says that party establishment never liked Akin in the first place. He wasn\u2019t their choice to run against McCaskill. When he beat their choice in the primary, the bosses weren\u2019t happy. In their eyes, he was already a loser \u2013 a lost cause. He adds that Akin never said anything negative about his Republican opponents \u2013 running only on his own ideas and record.\n\n\u201cI expected Democrats to pounce on Todd,\u201d Huckabee says regarding the infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d interview on a local TV show. \u201cBut I was disheartened and outraged when Republicans circled the wagons \u2013 not to support Todd and help him overcome an obstacle but instead as a firing squad pointed at the congressman.\u201d\n\nSome say it was worse that a circular firing squad. Karl Rove not only pulled his funding for Akin\u2019s campaign and publicly denounced him, he added in a closed-door meeting of GOP donors: \u201cWe should sink Todd Akin. If he\u2019s found mysteriously murdered, don\u2019t look for my whereabouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is something terribly ironic when the winning candidate in a primary who refused to say anything negative about his Republican opponents is attacked by one Republican after another,\u201d adds Huckabee. They sharpened their knives and got in line to repeatedly stab him in the back. Now, after the race, they are still saying, \u2018See, conservatives can\u2019t get elected!'\u201d\n\nOliver North had this to say about Akin\u2019s spirited defense of life that got him pilloried, first by partisan Democrats, then by the media and finally by the Republican establishment: \u201cI admire Todd\u2019s stand for the sanctity of life. His steadfast resolve against an onslaught of media bullies and party bosses is the stuff of legend.\u201d\n\nWND.com\u2019s Joseph Farah, who agreed to publish Akin\u2019s \u201cFiring Back,\u201d had this to say: \u201cI could never quite figure out what Todd Akin said that was so offensive to the supposedly pro-life Republicans who attacked him viciously. Had they actually watched the interview? It represents in its entirety one of the best articulations of the life ethic. There\u2019s simply nothing in there that is factually wrong or offensive \u2013 unless you are looking to be offended by something. I have watched that interview over and over again in context. Even the interviewer clearly didn\u2019t see anything in Akin\u2019s words to indicate a \u2018gotcha.\u2019 He quickly moved on to a different subject without missing a beat. This wasn\u2019t even a minor gaffe. He was technically and scientifically accurate in what he said. This was an example of a media and political lynching.\u201d\n\nWND reported last week that while two new fertility studies showing stress in males and females inhibits pregnancy have received worldwide attention, no one, to date, has linked them with the biggest U.S. political controversy of 2012 \u2013 Akin\u2019s suggestion that pregnancy as a result of rape is rare.\n\nWhen asked in a local television interview in August 2012 whether he would support abortion in the case of rape, Akin made the following statement, which led to a firestorm of criticism, denunciation and ridicule by many even in his own party, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney: \u201cIf it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let\u2019s assume that maybe that didn\u2019t work or something. You know, I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.\u201d\n\nAkin\u2019s statement was attacked on two premises:\n\nthe use of the term \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d with some suggesting Akin was attempting to delegitimizing the crime of rape;\n\nthat Akin was suggesting it is rare for rape victims to become pregnant as a result of the crime.\n\nAkin takes on the first point in \u201cFiring Back\u201d by saying: \u201cWhen a woman claims to have been raped, the police determine if the evidence supports the legal definition of \u2018rape.\u2019 Is it a legitimate claim of rape or an excuse to avoid an unwanted pregnancy? Are the police warranted to take action against a crime or not? In short, the word \u2018legitimate\u2019 modifies the claim and not the action. There have been women who have lied about being raped, as Norman McCorvey did before the U.S. Supreme Court. The infamous Roe v. Wade decision of 1972 was based on a lie.\u201d\n\nOn the second point, Akin writes: \u201cMy comment about a woman\u2019s body shutting the pregnancy down was directed to the impact of stress on fertilization. This is something fertility doctors debate and discuss. Doubt me? Google \u2018stress and fertilization,\u2019 and you will find a library of research on the subject. The research is not conclusive, but there is considerable evidence that stress makes conception more difficult. And what could be more stressful than a rape?\u201d\n\nSee Akin\u2019s comments:\n\nAkin also goes on to say that his critics twisted his remarks to suggest he was denying the possibility of pregnancy from forcible rape.\n\n\u201cIn fact, several fantastic young Americans who campaigned with me were themselves the product s of rape,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd they were thankful I would stand with them.\u201d\n\nIs Akin right that pregnancy seldom results from rape?\n\nThere\u2019s not much doubt about it. The studies pointing to the highest incidence suggest no more than 5 percent of rape victims become pregnant as a result of the attack. Many others suggest much lower numbers.\n\nWhile Akin\u2019s comments were dominating the news cycle in August 2012, the Los Angeles Times assigned reporter Kim Geiger to look into the question.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly few hard facts and figures were available about the prevalence of rape-related pregnancies,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMany news outlets, including this one, cited a 1996 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which estimated that more than 23,000 women experience a rape-related pregnancy each year. The report also concluded that 5 percent of rape victims become pregnant, which would mean that 640,000 rapes occur each year.\n\n\u201cBut that figure doesn\u2019t jibe with other reputable sources. For example, FBI data show that 95,769 forcible rapes were reported in 1996. The 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey calculates that 64,080 rapes occurred in 2004 and 2005,\u2019 she reported.\n\nYet, that seemingly questionable study in 1996 has formed the basis for many reports on the number of rapes that take place in America annually, the number of pregnancies that result and the percentage of rapes that result in pregnancy \u2013 all based on the assumption that pregnancies result from rape as often as they do from non-forcible sex acts.\n\nIn fact, no one knows how many pregnancies result from rape because no one is keeping records. But applying the 5 percent estimate to the 64,080 figure of rapes in 2004 and 2005 brings the pregnancy estimate down to 3,204, the figure used by the Justice Department\u2019s 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey. Still, it\u2019s only an estimate based on an assumption that pregnancy results from rape at the same rate as non-coercive sex.\n\nHowever, new studies released on the fertility of men and woman suggest stress could greatly reduce the incidence of pregnancy.\n\nPsychological stress may degrade sperm quality and sperm fertility, according to a study published May 29, 2014, in the journal Fertility and Sterility.\n\n\u201cMen who feel stressed are more likely to have lower concentrations of sperm in their ejaculate, and the sperm they have are more likely to be misshapen or have impaired motility,\u201d said researcher Pam Factor-Litvak, an epidemiologist at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, in a statement. \u201cThese deficits could be associated with fertility problems.\u201d\n\nWhile the study did not specifically address the question of rape, it begs the question asked rhetorically by Todd Akin: \u201cAnd what could be more stressful than a rape?\u201d\n\nBut Akin\u2019s controversial comment in 2012 did not address the role of male fertility, but rather female fertility \u2013 the idea that \u201cthe female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\u201d\n\nIndeed other fertility studies this year might lend support to that claim.\n\nProfessor Sarah Berga, from Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia, specifically studied 16 women in their 20s and 30s who were normal weight but had not had a period for six months. She found they had high levels of the hormone cortisol, which is linked to stress. Half the group was given cognitive behavioral therapy that resulted in at least two pregnancies among the group. But the stress study has relevance beyond those who fail to ovulate, noted Berga. Cortisol is known as the \u201cfight or flight hormone.\u201d It is produced within minutes of a stressful situation by the adrenal glands after receiving a message from the brain. In survival mode, the optimal amounts of cortisol can be life-saving. It helps to maintain fluid balance and blood pressure, while regulating some body functions like reproductive drive, immunity, digestion and growth, according to Dr. Amit Sood, director of Complementary and Integrative Medicine and chairman of Mayo Mind Body Initiative at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nAnother infertility clinic found pregnancy rates soared when patients were visited after treatment by a comedian who cracked jokes and performed magic tricks \u2013 again, strongly linking pregnancy to reduced stress. Dr. Shevach Friedler of the Assaf Harofeh Medical Centre in Zerifin, Israel, released details of the study at Prague conference this spring. He said 93 women were visited by the comic while they were lying down for 15 minutes after embryos were implanted into their womb. A similar number were left alone. \u201cTo our surprise we found a significant difference,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a good result.\u201d\n\nAnother study published in the journal Human Reproduction found a strong link between stress and infertility. Courtney Lynch, director of reproductive epidemiology at Ohio State\u2019s Wexner Medical Center, said it\u2019s common knowledge that women get pregnant while on vacation, or women with infertility problems become pregnant after adopting. She concluded it\u2019s not always coincidence. Again, the link is cortisol.\n\nThese studies were all widely reported in 2014, but no one mentioned the bruising Akin had received for making a similar point in 2012 \u2013 again, arguably the biggest controversy of the election year. Previous stress-pregnancy studies, conducted over many years, have produced similar results, as Akin notes in his book.\n\nAkin hasn\u2019t given an interview to the media in 18 months. But he has broken that silence with the release of \u201cFiring Back\u201d July 15.\n\nWhat else does he have to say? Akin, commended in a foreword to the book written by Mike\n\nHuckabee for never resorting to ad hominem attacks on his political opponents, does not shy away from defending himself in \u201cFiring Back\u201d:\n\nHe points out his arguably awkward and misunderstood comment about rape came two weeks before a sexual predator and accused rapist, Bill Clinton, got a standing ovation for his keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. He adds that same convention memorialized a man, Ted Kennedy, who let a young woman he preyed on drown to save his reputation. (pp. 129-130)\n\nWhen Rove, Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee abandoned Akin, he was in a virtual tie with incumbent Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill. But then his opponent was able to run a killer TV ad that asked the question: \u201cIs Todd Akin fit to serve in the Senate? Mitt Romney doesn\u2019t think so.\u201d It closed with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saying, \u201cFrankly, he would not be welcome by Republicans in the United States Senate.\u201d (p. 169)\n\nHe takes on McCaskill who won re-election by portraying herself as a \u201cmoderate.\u201d She said during the campaign: \u201cTodd Akin would consider it an insult if you called him a moderate. I wear the term moderate like a badge of honor.\u201d Akin points out she voted 98 percent of the time with President Obama and \u201ccontinued to support Obamacare even after Missourians resoundingly rejected it.\u201d (p. 88)\n\nWhat does he want to get out of this book? Is it written for revenge? To restart his political career? No, Todd Akin wants what he always wanted \u2013 what drove him to run for Congress successfully in the first place. \u201cEverywhere, freedom\u2019s enemies are busy twisting word meanings and attempting to force their opinions on others through what is known as \u2018political correctness.\u2019 We should resist this tactic by defending the truth and each other, especially those on our own team. We need to defend truth especially in those areas where liberals are attacking.\u201d\n\nOn the rapid growth of the superstate: \u201cBefore you forsake the crisp air and bright light on the high road of freedom, look well at the velvet-padded chains of government dependency. Although the government chains are well padded, they are chains nonetheless. They threaten to hold America\u2019s soul in the gloom, where vision is lost, where monotony and cynicism rule, and where the fresh air and bright sunlight of freedom are only a memory.\u201d\n\nFor Akin, government doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he truly believes there are answers to be found \u2013 or, perhaps, rediscovered.\n\n\u201cTrue freedom builds from the bottom up, and it starts with our \u2018selves,'\u201d he writes in \u201cFiring Back.\u201d \u201cIn early America, when people heard the word government, they would first think of how each of us, led by God\u2019s Spirit, manages his or her own life. They called it \u2018self-government.\u2019 They understood that the character of a citizen was critical to the nature of the country. A nation peopled by wise, hardworking, loving citizens would be altogether different from a nation of dishonest, self-seeking rogues.\u201d (p. 178)\n\nBut to be a self-governing people, there must be consensus on what is right and wrong, Akin suggests.\n\n\u201cPerhaps one of the greatest opportunities to return to good ideas and refute bad ideas is through the church,\u201d he writes. \u201cChurches exist in part to warn people of the bad consequences of bad ideas and teach obedience to God\u2019s laws. The source of the Founders\u2019 good ideas was the Bible. They saw the beautiful harmony between God\u2019s Word and the natural world around them. Today, for all the good work our pastors do, many make the mistake of not applying the Bible to the critical issues of our day. This is probably one of the most urgently needed changes in America.\u201d (p. 182)\n\nWill critics find new reasons to guffaw in \u201cFiring Back\u201d?\n\nFor those who think it\u2019s controversial to string together the two words \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d there\u2019s no doubt plenty of ammunition for the Akin-haters in \u201cFiring Back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Rep.
