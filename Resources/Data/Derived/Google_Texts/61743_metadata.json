Many opponents mistrusted doctors and were wary of a medical treatment they didn\u2019t understand. In the early days, the closely related cowpox virus was used to immunize people against smallpox.\n\n\u201cPeople were afraid that if you got the cowpox vaccine you would turn into a cow,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who is an outspoken critic of anti-vaccination groups.\n\nMore than a century and a half later, there\u2019s still an undercurrent of vaccine dislike and distrust in the United States as illustrated by the measles outbreak that started in December at Disneyland \u2014 likely brought in from overseas as has been the case in recent years. Many of those who got and spread the highly contagious illness hadn\u2019t gotten the childhood shots.\n\nAll this despite medical science\u2019s proven successes in wiping out not only the much-feared smallpox and polio, but nearly eliminating other serious illnesses like diphtheria, German measles, lockjaw and mumps in the United States. Through it all, anti-vaccine sentiments have ebbed and flowed.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to say that for as long as we\u2019ve had vaccines, governments have worked to promote those vaccines \u2014 and segments of the population have resisted,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a medical historian who studies vaccine policy at Princeton University.\n\nIn the U.S., opposition to vaccines was most intense in the late 1800s and early 1900s, said Susan Lederer, chair of medical history and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nThat\u2019s when organizations like the Anti-Vaccination League of America and the American Medical Liberty League led the charge. Some used photos depicting vaccinated children with scars and missing limbs and eyes, claiming immunizations were to blame.\n\n\u201cFor a long time in history, people treated anti-vaxers as irrational and anti-progress \u2014 kind of a lunatic fringe. But there were good reasons to be leery of vaccines\u201d back then, she said.\n\nVaccines sold at the time were unregulated, and many were not only ineffective but also risky because of how they were made or given. Some were not sterile and infected children with other germs, like tetanus.\n\nBut opposition faded. Legal challenges to school-attendance vaccination laws were shot down by the U.S. Supreme Court. Vaccine makers came under more federal regulation, and the shots were better and safer. And some of the richest and most influential opponents died off.\n\nBy the end of the 1930s, resistance had declined dramatically. And by the 1950s, the pendulum had swung. Medical science was widely respected, doctors were considered sages, and one of the nation\u2019s greatest heroes was Dr. Jonas Salk \u2014 inventor of the polio vaccine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vaccine opposition has ebbed and flowed over centuries", "title": "Vaccine opposition has ebbed and flowed over centuries", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Vaccine opposition has ebbed and flowed over centuries", "title": "Vaccine opposition has ebbed and flowed over centuries", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/14/vaccine_opposition_has_ebbed_and_flowed_over_centuries/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/vaccine-opposition-history.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vaccine opposition has ebbed and flowed over centuries", "title": "Vaccine opposition has ebbed and flowed over centuries", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/vaccine-opposition-history.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Stobbe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd033\"", "article_summary": "Medical science was widely respected, doctors were considered sages, and one of the nation\u2019s greatest heroes was Dr. Jonas Salk \u2014 inventor of the polio vaccine.\nThrough it all, anti-vaccine sentiments have ebbed and flowed.\nIn the mid-1800s, people protested in the streets of Victorian England after the British government began requiring citizens to get the vaccination.\nVaccine makers came under more federal regulation, and the shots were better and safer.\nIn the early days, the closely related cowpox virus was used to immunize people against smallpox."}
