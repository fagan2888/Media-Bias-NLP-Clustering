Fox News host Martha MacCallum on Monday suggested that President Barack Obama’s health care law was even worse than devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina or the Iraq War because it “touches so many people’s lives.”

In a segment on America’s Newsroom, MacCallum invited Fox News contributor Brit Hume to examine a recent conservative claim that the president was trying to “change the subject” from the health care reform law by negotiating to stop Iran’s nuclear weapons program.

“That’s certainly part of it,” Hume observed. “But these are issues — Iran, immigration — that the president was going to have to address anyway, whatever his standing and whatever the condition of his health insurance reform plan.”

“What I keep coming back to in all of this is unlike other issues — Katrina or the Iraq war — that we’ve seen in [President George W. Bush’s] second term, this is something that touches so many people’s lives across the country,” MacCallum opined. “And you don’t know whether the president is going to be able to successfully dodge it.”

“It looks as if the forecast is for more heavy weather on Obamacare,” Hume agreed. “And it will persist throughout this coming year, and it will be a burden, a huge burden on the backs of the Democratic Party.”
