Translation: Republicans rejected money to expand Medicaid and Republicans choose not to oversee rate regulation (if this doesn\u2019t ring a bell, when Republicans discuss it, they call their refusal to check corporation\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cfree markets\u201d).\n\nThese decisions may cost Wisconsinites $1,800 or more a year over what their Minnesota counterparts pay for health insurance. Wisconsinites will pay between 79% and 99% higher premiums before tax credits are applied, and the middle class will be hit the hardest. Some cities will pay as much as 136% higher premiums.\n\nCitizen Action of Wisconsin released a new report documenting the vast differences between Minnesota and Wisconsin in the cost for health insurance on the individual insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 Wisconsin health insurance exchange premiums for single coverage will be on average 79% to 99% higher than premiums in Minnesota, before tax credits are applied. That is a difference of over $1,800 a year. \u2022The health insurance cost differential will be even worse for some major Wisconsin cities. Rates in La Crosse are 136% higher than the Minnesota average, rates in Eau Claire are 116% higher, and rates in Milwaukee are 112% higher. \u2022 The cost gap with Minnesota has the biggest impact on middle class Wisconsinites because Affordable Care Act tax credits mitigate the impact on lower income people who buy insurance on the exchange.\n\nAdditionally, when Walker announced his Republican plan to reject Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare, he was warned that this would cost Wisconsin state taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Walker, with his eye on 2016, was at war with President Obama and what better way to prove his conservative bona fides than by rejecting as much of ObamaCare as he could.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Walker can run on his job creation numbers or making a great climate for business. Wisconsin is failing in both departments under Walker. He\u2019s got to be able to run as the guy who fought Obama and won \u2014 a feat he has not actually managed to do, regardless of how many times he and his BFF Paul Ryan blame Mitt Romney for the 2012 election loss. Reality plays a small part in Republican politics these days that Walker won\u2019t be hurt by inventing his own world so long as he is the comic book hero who said No to the Illegitimate President.\n\nComic book narratives aside, the Walker administration is still confused about how this fiscal stuff works (sure Walker didn\u2019t graduate from college, but that is no excuse \u2014 plenty of Americans can add and subtract without going to college). Walker\u2019s secretary of health services, Kitty Rhoades, claims to believe that they didn\u2019t walk away from money \u2013 the state will have more money by petulantly keeping the working poor off of Medicaid expansions at the fed\u2019s expense.\n\nThis belief earned her a Mostly False from PolitiFact. It turns out, the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says Walker\u2019s decision is going to cost state taxpayers $119 million and could exceed $459 million through 2021.\n\nScott Walker justifies this by claiming to believe the federal government won\u2019t come through with the money because of the debt (along this failed logic, why wait for anything to be proven \u2013 if you feel it, it must be \u2013 leadership by hysterical emotion of the mentally impaired has worked out so well in the past). To be fair, perhaps Walker knew of his party\u2019s plans to tank the economy with a shutdown and threat to refuse to pay our bills. If so, conspiracy charges are warranted, immediately following the mandatory Republican math class.\n\nThe Walker administration champions their plan to instead drive the money to health insurance companies and health care providers. More transferring of the wealth to corporations, or \u201cjob creation\u201d in Republican speak.\n\nMinnesota also took ObamaCare up on the money provided to review rates \u2013 aka, oversight, but Wisconsin hasn\u2019t. They\u2019re cool with whatever the insurance companies want to charge citizens. Regulation is the death of corporate freedom, after all, and when corporations aren\u2019t free to rob citizens, they allegedly won\u2019t create so many crappy jobs that don\u2019t pay a living wage.\n\nAppeasement of the corporate beast is a must in Republican circles and so Wisconsinites are getting it again. No doubt Republicans will blame Obama for this, too, since they are loath to take responsibility for their own behavior, ideology and policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to Gov.
