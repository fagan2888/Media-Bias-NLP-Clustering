Goodman walks through the average day of an average Victorian in Britain, describing the tools and habits that one would use throughout their day\u2014hair-grooming procedures, an average set of chores, the appropriate daily exercise for boys and girls, and how to get dressed. Goodman is also a singular historian for putting herself, literally, into the Victorian world\u2014she farms, dresses and lives as a Victorian for historical inquiry (and maybe also for fun), and as such can offer anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of the products and methods she\u2019s describing. She\u2019s chased pigs in a corset and made her own sanitary pads according to pattern (before washing them according to custom, in a bucket of cold salty water).\n\nThe Victorian era is particularly fascinating because it was a time where globalization and industrialization were rapidly transforming daily life. Cotton was cheap, thanks to the British Empire\u2019s stranglehold on India and slave labor in America; mass-producing clothing became possible, thanks to the sewing machine\u2019s decimation of the domestic hand-sewing cottage industry. It\u2019s also an era defined by a sense of progress, although toward what was naturally in some disputation. The behaviors Goodman described almost always trickle down from some sort of conventional wisdom, whether that is moral philosophy, popular science or long-standing tradition. The day-to-day life of the Victorian, as it is made up of tasks and things, belies the day-to-day mind of the Victorian\u2014the preoccupations, superstitions, beliefs and ideals of an entire society. Goodman is very thorough, but the measure of a generation\u2019s consciousness is a monumental task.\n\nIn at least the sliver of the Victorian brain that was dedicated to nightmares, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is picking up the slack. The Showtime drama is set in London in 1891\u2014the era of both Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes\u2014but offered, in its first season, a treatment of the era quite unlike anything else we\u2019ve seen. \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d tells the story of an unlikely ensemble pitted against the forces of evil. Eva Green plays the show\u2019s heart and soul, its protagonist Vanessa Ives; she\u2019s joined by a cast of characters with names so recognizable that it is, like Victorian-era tales of the fantastic, hard to believe. I don\u2019t just mean the actors\u2014though those are recognizable; Josh Hartnett plays an American sharp-shooter with a lot of secrets, and Timothy Dalton plays Vanessa\u2019s father-figure, Sir Malcolm\u2014it\u2019s the characters, too, whose names ring a bell. Harry Treadaway plays a young ambitious scientist named Victor Frankenstein. Reeve Carney is a slippery dandy named Dorian Gray. And Sir Malcolm\u2019s lost daughter\u2014Vanessa\u2019s best friend\u2014is named Mina Murray, the name of Bram Stoker\u2019s protagonist in \u201cDracula.\u201d\n\n\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is about these people encountering the demimonde, which is alternately a physical space and a spiritual plane where the forces of the supernatural meet our world. The word means, in French, \u201chalf-world,\u201d and in the show, it seems to reign best in the shadows. It\u2019s a kind of horror extraordinarily well suited to the hulking, smoggy mass of brick and coal that is London in the 1890s\u2014the city is a warren of secrets, most of them rather unsavory ones. And rather than be a show about the demimonde, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d entirely takes place in the demimonde\u2014the show itself is the space where the unexplained rises up to mingle with what is known.\n\nAnd what is particularly astounding about the show is how period-appropriate its concerns are. \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d engages with not just the period appropriate details of what it would mean to be alive in 1891, but also what it would mean to think and feel in the era. Evil is not just darkness, but explicitly the devil, whether he goes by Lucifer or Satan. Mary Shelley set her Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s experiments in 1823, but in a dank London cellar in 1891, they seem all the more resonant\u2014the anxieties of advances in science eclipsing the dominion of God. Frankenstein\u2019s creature is played by Rory Kinnear, who searches for acceptance in a teeming city of apothecaries and grotesqueries\u2014the metaphorical underground of a city where, by 1891, the creature could himself go down a flight of stairs and step onto the London Underground\u2019s tube system. Dalton\u2019s Sir Malcolm is in London after decades of exploring the rest of the world, revealing an awareness of the effect the British Empire was having on the rest of the world. And perhaps most important, these Victorians all truly believe in the world beyond their own, Christian or otherwise; they know it to exist, and they know there is a good side, and a bad side. \u201cPenny Dreadful\u2019s\u201d demimonde is a long-dead way of thinking carefully brought back to life, much like Frankenstein\u2019s monster.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Season 2 of this period mashup of spooky-tale heroes and monsters is a remarkable improvement on the last", "title": "The strange and magical Victorian wonders of \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d suffer no sophomore slump", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Season 2 of this period mashup of spooky-tale heroes and monsters is a remarkable improvement on the last", "title": "The strange and magical Victorian wonders of \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d suffer no sophomore slump", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/the_strange_and_magickal_victorian_wonders_of_penny_dreadful_suffer_no_sophomore_slump/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/penny_dreadful3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Season 2 of this period mashup of spooky-tale heroes and monsters is a remarkable improvement on the last", "title": "The strange and magical Victorian wonders of \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d suffer no sophomore slump", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/penny_dreadful3.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, billie piper, Eva Green, harry treadaway, helen mccrory, how to be a victorian, john logan, josh hartnett, penny dreadful, rory kinnear, ruth goodman, Showtime, timothy dalton, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22e3\"", "article_summary": "In at least the sliver of the Victorian brain that was dedicated to nightmares, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d is picking up the slack.\n\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d tells the story of an unlikely ensemble pitted against the forces of evil.\nThe Victorian era is particularly fascinating because it was a time where globalization and industrialization were rapidly transforming daily life.\nAnd rather than be a show about the demimonde, \u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d entirely takes place in the demimonde\u2014the show itself is the space where the unexplained rises up to mingle with what is known.\n\u201cPenny Dreadful\u2019s\u201d demimonde is a long-dead way of thinking carefully brought back to life, much like Frankenstein\u2019s monster."}
