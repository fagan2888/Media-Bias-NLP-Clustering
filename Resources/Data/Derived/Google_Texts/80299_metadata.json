What is surprising is that in 2013 their coverage of climate change was actually better than it was in 2012, when a jaw-dropping 93 percent of their statements about it were misleading.\n\nIf we were to grade them, in 2012 they\u2019d have gotten an \u201cA\u201d in being unfair and unbalanced.\n\nDiving into this a bit is interesting. The biggest contribution to CNN\u2019s bad showing was due to false balance, having deniers on panels along with real scientists. For the most part with Fox the problem is with the hosts themselves, though they tend to have deniers on as guests quite a bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMSNBC was generally graded down by UCS because of a few mild overstatements linking some specific extreme weather events and climate change; in other words for going the other way than the other networks. They said that that climate change makes hurricanes and tornadoes more frequent, and tornadoes more intense. To my knowledge there is no well-established link for that (though climate change is indeed making the most intense hurricanes even stronger). So that\u2019s a fair enough call by the UCS, but it\u2019s chump change compared to the blatant denial so often seen on Fox. There are degrees of wrongness, and Fox wins here.\n\nWorse, Fox viewers greatly outnumber those of CNN and MSNBC (1.76 million, 568,000, and 640,000 respectively), which means that even though MSNBC did a much better job, and covered climate change far more often, Fox\u2019s distortions probably had a wider reach.\n\nPhoto from Media Matters for America\n\n\n\nFox\u2019s ideological bias is so well-known it\u2019s like the air around us; taken for granted. At least, it is to those of us who know better. Polls show that Fox viewers tend to be misinformed on a broad range of topics (though it\u2019s not known whether less-informed viewers watch Fox News, or whether Fox News makes them less well-informed). This is no surprise; for example just last week Fox News was reporting on the Affordable Care Act, and used a seriously misleading graph. It was so stupendously bad that it even got lampooned by Saturday Night Live:\n\nI think that graph is the best part of the segment, even more than the bit dealing with climate change, which also has some fun with my pal Neil Tyson as well. I\u2019ll note a Fox News host later admitted the graph was misleading, but by then the damage was done.\n\nAnd while that SNL segment was funny, the topic itself is not. Many of the effects of climate change are already and unequivocally being felt now, today. The latest IPCC report was dire, saying we need to take action right now to prevent the worst effects of climate change over the next few decades \u2026 and in some cases, no matter what we do, some of those effects are coming anyway.\n\nYet Fox News seems hellbent on making sure the public is less informed than ever about one of if not the most important issue of our time.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "Fox News usually wrong about climate change, Fox News biased about global warming, fox news climate change, fox news facts, union of concerned scientists climate change, snl fox news", "sailthru.author": "Phil Plait", "description": "A new study just released by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows that of the three major cable news networks, in 2013 Fox News far and away was the ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "A new study just released by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows that of the three major cable news networks, in 2013 Fox News far and away was the ...", "title": "Shocker: Fox News Is Usually Wrong About Climate Change", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/fox_news_leading_cable_news_network_is_usually_wrong_about_climate_change.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/ucs_foxnews_climatechange_piechart354.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study just released by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows that of the three major cable news networks, in 2013 Fox News far and away was the ...", "creator": "@BadAstronomer", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/fox_news_leading_cable_news_network_is_usually_wrong_about_climate_change.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/ucs_foxnews_climatechange_piechart354.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "Shocker: Fox News Is Usually Wrong About Climate Change", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-08T07:45:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Shocker: Fox News Is Usually Wrong About Climate Change", "sailthru.headline": "\u201cOur National Debate About Climate Policy Is Broken\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Shocker: Fox News Is Usually Wrong About Climate Change\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/fox_news_leading_cable_news_network_is_usually_wrong_about_climate_change.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/ucs_foxnews_climatechange_piechart354.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"232140408001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-08T07:45:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Health and Science\",\n  \"author\": \"Phil Plait\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"Fox News\",\n    \"climate change\",\n    \"global warming\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "Shocker: Fox News Is Usually Wrong About Climate Change", "tw-line": "Shocker: Fox News Is Usually Wrong About Climate Change", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Phil-Plait/251070648641"}, "keywords": "Fox News usually wrong about climate change, Fox News biased about global warming, fox news climate change, fox news facts, union of concerned scientists climate change, snl fox news", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "A new study just released by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows that of the three major cable news networks, in 2013 Fox News far and away was the ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/ucs_foxnews_climatechange_piechart354.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc7f\"", "article_summary": "To my knowledge there is no well-established link for that (though climate change is indeed making the most intense hurricanes even stronger).\nThey said that that climate change makes hurricanes and tornadoes more frequent, and tornadoes more intense.\nMany of the effects of climate change are already and unequivocally being felt now, today.\nAdvertisementMSNBC was generally graded down by UCS because of a few mild overstatements linking some specific extreme weather events and climate change; in other words for going the other way than the other networks.\nPolls show that Fox viewers tend to be misinformed on a broad range of topics (though it\u2019s not known whether less-informed viewers watch Fox News, or whether Fox News makes them less well-informed)."}
