Three people were killed in an early-morning crash Saturday in Phoenix.

Police said the 21-year-old driver of a black Chevrolet Tahoe ran a red light at 59th Avenue and Indian School Road and plowed into a four-door Lexus around 2 a.m.

"It is tragic, three people have lost their lives here in the early morning hours because of red light running is what we suspect," said Phoenix police Officer James Holmes.

The driver of the SUV was OK, according to Holmes, but a passenger was complaining of injuries and taken to a local hospital for treatment.

All three people in the Lexus were killed. They have been identified as Jonathan Lawrence Green, Jose Luis Hernandez and Jose Angel Martinez Jr., all 25 years old. Green was driving the car.

Hernandez is a local rapper and goes by the name "Low Key." He has performed at several local venues, including Celebrity Theatre.

At this point it's not known why the driver failed to stop at the red light. Police said that is part of the ongoing investigation.

"We're assessing everyone involved as much as we can to find out if there was any alcohol any impairment involved, at this point we've not determined that alcohol is a factor as far as the driver of the SUV," Holmes said.

He went on to say the driver did admit to running the red light and was detained. He has since been released pending biological testing, Holmes said. Charges are pending.

"He is facing charges anywhere from possible manslaughter to vehicular homicide," Holmes said.

The intersection was closed for several hours and reopened around 10 a.m.
