ICTMN is continuing its food tour around the country, and we’re making a pit stop at the Red Sage restaurant in Santa Fe, N.M.

Inside Buffalo Thunder Resort in Santa Fe the Red Sage restaurant features new American grill cuisine, and has an extensive list of menu offerings.

The restaurant’s Chef de Cuisine is Edgar Morales, a veteran in fine dining, who has more than 20 years of experience. According to the restaurant’s web site, Morales’s speciality is combining a variety of unique flavors and tastes from the Southwest to his foods.

So, what’s on the menu at Red Sage?

Braised Talus Wind Lamb

The restaurant’s braised talus wind lamb is priced at $37, and comes with french gnocchi, mushrooms, arugula and house made ricotta. Pair the lamb with a glass of wine from the restaurant's diverse selection of domestic and European blends that earned it Wine Spectator's 2015 Award of Excellence.

Caramelized Brussel Sprouts

A very yummy side dish! Red Sage’s caramelized brussels sprouts are seasoned with lemon, garlic and chili vinaigrette.

Slow Roasted Pork Belly

Pork belly is a tasty appetizer at Red Sage instead of a main entree. Priced at $15, the pork is plated with honey yogurt, cornbread croutons, quince and fennel.
