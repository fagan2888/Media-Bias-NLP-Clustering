Walls separate and divide. Bridges get people closer.\u201d\n\nThe Pope also allowed the teenagers to express their views during the video conference using the Google Hangouts platform.\n\nA student from Istanbul reflected on world peace. \u201cPeople from all nationalities that contain different religions and ethnic groups must learn how to live in peace,\u201d the Turkish student said.\n\nThe Pope participated in the video chat after meeting with the directors of the Scholas Ocurrentes organization, an international education initiative based in Argentina that promotes development of young students through technology, sports, arts and culture. The Vatican is promoting the project.\n\nThe Pope spoke without a prepared text. Before the video chat, he had shared an anecdote from his childhood with Scholas directors in attendance.\n\nFrancis said he once got in trouble with his teacher for misbehaving. His mother, the Pope said, went to his school and made him apologize to the teacher upon confirming he had misbehaved.\n\n\u201cToday in many schools,\u201d the Pope said, \u201ca teacher will make an observation about a child and the next day the parents will denounce the teacher. The educational pact is broken!\u201d\n\nFor dozens of Salvadoran students, the video chat with the Pope was cause for celebration. For a brief moment, the spotlight was on La Campanera, a community near San Salvador, the capital, plagued by gang violence and poverty.\n\n\u201cBeware of maras,\u201d Pope Francis told them using the local word for gangs, \u201cbecause in the same way that there are bridges that unite you there are also links that can destroy you. Be alert. There are groups that seek destruction, that seek war, that don't know how to be team players.\u201d\n\nThere were also funny moments during the 20-minute video chat. A student from South Africa told the Pope in Spanish not to get nervous as he was about to ask a few questions. The Pope laughed out loud.\n\nTo a question from a Turkish boy about what young people should expect from the future, the Pope said he doesn't have a crystal ball. \"The future,\" the pontiff said, \"is in your heart, in your mind and in your hands.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Rafael Romo, CNN Senior Latin American Affairs Editor (CNN) -- It was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity: teenagers from five continents speaking directly with Pope Francis through a Google video chat.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "In 'hang out' with students, Pope says he was no angel", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/05/in-hang-out-with-students-pope-says-he-was-no-angel/", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/belief.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Rafael Romo, CNN Senior Latin American Affairs Editor\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- It was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity: teenagers from five continents speaking directly with Pope Francis through a Google video chat.", "title": "In 'hang out' with students, Pope says he was no angel"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "catholic church, pope francis, catholic church, pope, pope francis", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/05/in-hang-out-with-students-pope-says-he-was-no-angel/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3594\"", "article_summary": "The educational pact is broken!\u201dFor dozens of Salvadoran students, the video chat with the Pope was cause for celebration.\nBefore the video chat, he had shared an anecdote from his childhood with Scholas directors in attendance.\nBy Rafael Romo, CNN Senior Latin American Affairs Editor(CNN) - It was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity: teenagers from five continents speaking directly with Pope Francis through a Google video chat.\nThere are groups that seek destruction, that seek war, that don't know how to be team players.\u201dThere were also funny moments during the 20-minute video chat.\n\u201cIn life,\u201d the Pope from Argentina told them, \u201cyou can (do) either one of two opposite things: You can build bridges or walls."}
