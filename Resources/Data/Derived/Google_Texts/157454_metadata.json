(Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images)\n\n4822081\n\nThe largest Arab-American organization in the U.S. just called for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to drop out of the election because of hateful rhetoric.\n\nThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) is convinced Trump is responsible for an uptick in attacks against Arab and Muslim Americans. According to ADC, Trump has \u201cspewed hate rhetoric\u201d ever since he started his campaign, leading to an inordinate number of hate crimes.\n\n\u201cTrump is an embarrassment to the American electoral process, the Republican Party, democratic principles and the country,\u201d the ADC\u2019s press release reads. \u201cHis words and actions continue to exhibit the worst America has to offer by playing into people\u2019s fears and biases through lies, deception and faulty logic.\u201d\n\nWhat this means, apparently, is that both the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee need to \u201cdistance themselves\u201d from Trump because he\u2019s attracted support from people who know people who are affiliated with supposed hate groups.\n\n\u201cWith the enormity of the challenges we face as a nation it is imperative that Trump end his campaign,\u201d ADC President Samer Khalaf says in the press release. \u201cHis words have led to violent acts of hate, and it is clear that he is not good for the country. As put by the White House \u2013 Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. disqualifies him from being President. It is time for Trump to do the nation a favor and drop out of the race for the Republican Presidential nomination.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslims does seem constitutional, despite protest from lawmakers like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and advocacy groups. Even GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio , himself a law graduate, complained the proposal is unconstitutional. Two prominent law professors, one in support of the plan and one opposed, say the plan is constitutional. It also happens to court wide favor with nearly two-thirds of Republican primary voters and even a sizable number of Democrats.\n\nFollow Jonah Bennett on Twitter\n\nSend tips to [email protected].\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
