Pretax income for the quarter was $921 million compared with $929 million the same quarter a year ago. Revenue for the quarter rose to $9.9 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in the third quarter the prior year.Officials said the squeeze on its operating margin was the result of labor costs and a less favorable mix of payers.\u201cLabor costs increased as a percent of revenues to 46.9% compared to 45.7 percent in last year's third quarter,\u201d the company said in a news release. \u201cThis increase was driven primarily by less productivity and a greater use of contract labor to fill staffing needs.\u201dHCA also reported an uptick in the uninsured last quarter.
