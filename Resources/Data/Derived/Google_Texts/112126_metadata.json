He is the chair of the Youth Advisory Board for Lakota Children\u2019s Enrichment, a nonprofit that empowers youth of Pine Ridge.\n\n\u201cI am officially a 2015 Truman Scholar representing Villanova, my family, and the Native American youth out there who have a dream. Everyday I remind myself why I do what I do. That is, to make the future brighter for the youth that I know can reach their potential,\u201d Martinez said in a release. \u201cI want to take this time to say that I am extremely grateful for this opportunity, it has been quite the journey to get to where I am today\u2014but my journey is not over, I look forward to the next chapter. I am glad to be in such amazing company at the Truman Foundation.\u201d\n\nDelena is majoring in human biology and minoring in education at Stanford. He is also writing an honors thesis that takes a \u201cqualitative, narrative approach to understanding undergraduate happiness and success,\u201d according to a Stanford press release.\n\nHe dedicated his award to his parents, Vanessa and Larry Delena. \u201cDespite the constant struggle of growing up in poverty, I learned to appreciate how small things can make a big difference,\u201d he said in the release. \u201cI am humbled by and grateful to my parents, who continually support and value the importance of my education, despite not having had such opportunities themselves. I am here because my parents never gave up on me. Through their love and sacrifice, I have gone to places I never dreamed possible.\u201d\n\nHelms, a molecular and cellular biology major at Vanderbilt, is preparing for a career researching and treating diabetes within her Cherokee community.
