Macy's is moving its annual July Fourth fireworks show from the Hudson River to the East River. It will be spectacular for the folks in Brooklyn and Queens. Not so good for the New Jersey side. The Star-Ledger reports that Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras insisted the change was not intended as a slight against the Garden State, nor did politics factor into the decision to go east.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been working on this particular show for over two years,\" he said. \"We wanted to celebrate \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner\u2019 with a show against an iconic backdrop and the Brooklyn Bridge certainly is that.\"\n\nOK, so they block out the view from Jersey. There's always Philadelphia, which knows a thing or two about July 4th and also right across the river from the Garden State.\n\nBob Ingle State Issues Columnist: Bob Ingle is a New York Times Best-Selling Author.
