Putting that intensity to good use, researchers at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have been looking at how the game can help people with multiple sclerosis overcome certain symptoms of the disease.\n\n\u201cIndividuals with multiple sclerosis have a lot of balance issues and vertigo problems,\u201d Ruchika Prakash, an assistant professor of psychology at the university, told Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s numbness in the extremities \u2026 and then there\u2019s spasticity, or stiffness of the muscles, as a result of which the movement of joints becomes challenging, becomes restricted.\u201d\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) affects the brain and spinal cords, damaging myelin sheaths, a protective layer surrounding nerve endings that aids in signal conduction. This damage causes signal disruption, according to the National Institutes of Health. Other symptoms of the disease include visual disturbances, and thinking and memory problems.\n\nWhen using Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), patients follow arrows on a screen and step on the corresponding arrow on a pad laid on the ground. The game can become more difficult as the arrows move faster and the directions become more complicated.\n\n\u201cWe thought this game might motivate them, because it\u2019s fun, and entertaining and because the game gives a lot of feedback,\u201d Anne Kloos, assistant professor of clinical health and rehabilitation sciences at the university, told Fox. When a player does well, encouraging words appear, such as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nThe game has shown some promise already. Tracy Blackwell, 51, who was diagnosed with MS when she was 39 years old, said that the game had helped her, even when her medications did not. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything, My left leg dragged, my left arm was almost useless, so it stopped me from living day to day,\u201d she told Fox.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m in infusion therapy where I just go once a month,\u201d she told Fox. \u201cBefore I participated in the study, I\u2019d say I walked maybe to the mailbox \u2014 and that\u2019s not very far \u2014 and now I walk a half mile every day, and I do DDR every day.\u201d\n\nAs video games have become more interactive, older patients or patients with disabilities have been using them more than ever. Among Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, who also have difficulties with balance, the Wii Balance Board has been shown to help improve balance, mobility, and gait, when used alongside exercise", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "multiple sclerosis, balance, dance dance revolution, video games, exercise, ohio, state, blackwell,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People with multiple sclerosis may lose their balance and gain muscle stiffness, but the playing game Dance Dance Revolution may help them loosen up and regain some control.", "title": "Dance Dance Revolution Helps Multiple Sclerosis Patients Regain Their Balance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dance-dance-revolution-helps-multiple-sclerosis-patients-regain-their-balance-257558", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/ddr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People with multiple sclerosis may lose their balance and gain muscle stiffness, but the playing game Dance Dance Revolution may help them loosen up and regain some control.", "title": "Dance Dance Revolution Helps Multiple Sclerosis Patients Regain Their Balance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dance-dance-revolution-helps-multiple-sclerosis-patients-regain-their-balance-257558", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/ddr.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/ddr.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-22T14:11:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T14:11:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People with multiple sclerosis may lose their balance and gain muscle stiffness, but the playing game Dance Dance Revolution may help them loosen up and regain some control."}, "article_summary": "Anyone who has played the video game Dance Dance Revolution will know just how physically intense moving your feet to the beat of the music can get.\nWhen using Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), patients follow arrows on a screen and step on the corresponding arrow on a pad laid on the ground.\n\u201cIndividuals with multiple sclerosis have a lot of balance issues and vertigo problems,\u201d Ruchika Prakash, an assistant professor of psychology at the university, told Fox News.\n\u201cNow I\u2019m in infusion therapy where I just go once a month,\u201d she told Fox.\nAmong Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, who also have difficulties with balance, the Wii Balance Board has been shown to help improve balance, mobility, and gait, when used alongside exercise"}
