(Photo: David Wallace, David Wallace/The Republic)\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, really, that Senate President Andy Biggs can\u2019t meet a little boy from Peoria. His name is Paul and he\u2019s five years old.\n\nBut then it\u2019s not likely that the millionaire legislator would have to time to work Paul into his schedule, busy as he is running both the state Senate and his campaign for Congress.\n\nYet Biggs should take the time to Paul in the eye and explain to the little guy why he\u2019s not worth helping.\n\nNot even when it would cost the state nothing.\n\nPaul is one of 30,000 Arizona children whom Biggs could help simply by getting out of the way.\n\nTheir parents are among Arizona\u2019s working poor, people who earn too much to qualify for AHCCCS but not enough to afford decent insurance.\n\nEvery other state in the nation has a federally funded Children\u2019s Health care Program that offers affordable options to parents like Paul\u2019s.\n\nAndy Biggs doesn\u2019t think Arizona needs KidsCare, as Arizona\u2019s long-frozen program is called.\n\nMillionaire legislators may not need it but that five-year-old boy in Peoria? He really does.\n\nPaul was born with craniosynostosis. Basically, it means his skull closed before his brain was fully formed. He\u2019s had surgery to reshape his head but he has a variety of problems, including developmental delays, poor muscle tone and obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nHis mother, Christy, stays home with Paul and his two sisters. It doesn\u2019t pay to work, given the cost of childcare. His father, Paul, makes just over the limit to qualify for AHCCCS.\n\nBut not enough, they say, to find private insurance they can afford, even with the $78 subsidy offered through the Affordable Care Act. The policies with manageable premiums and co-pays have deductibles they never could pay. The policies with reasonable deductibles cost too much.\n\nPaul recently took a second job to scrape together what money he can for his son\u2019s weekly therapy sessions but they don\u2019t have money for the luxuries. Things like seeing the battery of doctors who should be overseeing the boy\u2019s care and medical tests to monitor his health issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where to go, I don\u2019t know how to help him,\u201d Christy said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying as much as we can. We save what we can but it\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\nHad Paul been born just a few years earlier, he could have been on KidsCare, Arizona\u2019s version of the federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. But the Legislature froze KidsCare in 2010 to save money. It\u2019s likely not a coincidence that we now have the nation\u2019s third highest rate of uninsured children, according to a recent study by Georgetown University.\n\nRep. Regina Cobb, R-Kingman, has been pushing House Bill 2309 to lift the freeze on KidsCare.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t cost the state a nickel. The feds are funding it through at least 2017 and likely through 2019. Cobb\u2019s bill has a safeguard in place, terminating kids from the program should federal funding be cut.\n\nThat was enough to convince 47 of 60 House members to support HB 2309 and send it to the Senate\u2026\n\n\u2026Where it ran into Biggs. The Senate president has refused to allow the bill even to be heard.\n\nWhy, you might ask, should tens of thousands of children go without health insurance when it costs the state nothing to offer it? Why would we say no to a low-cost alternative for parents of the working poor when 49 other states have said yes?\n\nCue Biggs: \u201cI don\u2019t support KidsCare.\u201d\n\nBiggs\u2019 spokesman hasn\u2019t responded to my request to talk with him about why he doesn\u2019t support helping 30,000 children when it\u2019ll cost the state nothing.\n\nI understand why he might not want to talk to me. But he really should talk to people like Paul\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cI would ask him why he won\u2019t unfreeze it,\u201d Christy said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reasoning? It\u2019s already paid for and it could help many children, including mine. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1RTDPGp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Senate President Andy Biggs refuses to help 30,000 Arizona kids, even though it would cost the state nothing.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Senate President Andy Biggs refuses to help 30,000 Arizona kids, even though it would cost the state nothing.", "title": "Roberts: Why is Andy Biggs turning his back on kids like Paul?", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2016/04/04/roberts-why-andy-biggs-turning-his-back-kids-like-paul/82518714/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senate President Andy Biggs refuses to help 30,000 Arizona kids, even though it would cost the state nothing.", "title": "Roberts: Why is Andy Biggs turning his back on kids like Paul?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/05cb7e49a64baabe4ef967061b2bc15a92670b41/c=556-0-2888-2332&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurie.roberts1?fref=ts"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Arizona Senate", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Arizona Senate", "title": "Roberts: Why is Andy Biggs turning his back on kids like Paul?", "author": "Laurie Roberts", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e9ce42d03a0edeb79ddad4474bdf934a23ae2bd/c=335-0-2084-2332/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1166b36afe2af0e41efd657e61248bc7d1b3e13c/c=556-0-2888-2332/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/be36ed6f39d5f9aaf472e905ce074228830c0ad7/c=171-0-3273-2332/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/99c08fb7e3584352fbd9473f9f890aea0b80e4ab/c=0-193-3444-2139&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-03T22:21:38.230000-07:00", "shorthed": "Roberts: Why is Andy Biggs turning his back on kids like Paul?", "articleid": 82518714, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4283070528982264b9dc78bd994dc3874cc9d48b/c=0-193-3444-2139/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/289fe6edc74ebd6f89cbaa4028e5c80da986f81e/c=556-0-1862-2332/local/-/media/2016/04/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635951146902021747-Andy-Biggs.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Andy Biggs, KidsCare, federal Children's Health Insurance, uninsured children, Arizona, Regina Cobb"}, "article_summary": "Paul is one of 30,000 Arizona children whom Biggs could help simply by getting out of the way.\n(Photo: David Wallace, David Wallace/The Republic)It\u2019s a shame, really, that Senate President Andy Biggs can\u2019t meet a little boy from Peoria.\nYet Biggs should take the time to Paul in the eye and explain to the little guy why he\u2019s not worth helping.\nAndy Biggs doesn\u2019t think Arizona needs KidsCare, as Arizona\u2019s long-frozen program is called.\nEvery other state in the nation has a federally funded Children\u2019s Health care Program that offers affordable options to parents like Paul\u2019s."}
