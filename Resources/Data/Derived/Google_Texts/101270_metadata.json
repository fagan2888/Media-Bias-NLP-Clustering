Swanson wanted to make it easier for instructors to teach their students valuable music skills. To assist in her project, Swanson recruited eight volunteers.\n\n\u201cI noticed that the keyboards used in music classes at The River were extremely difficult to use and they were getting damaged as they were being transported, so I wanted to develop a more streamlined transportation system,\u201d said Swanson.\n\nSwanson has volunteered at The River for two years and participated in theatre at Strake Jesuit and has received the All-Star Cast Award during UIL competition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved musical theater and playing the piano, so this project really served both of those passions,\u201d said Swanson.\n\nHermoso, a junior at St. Agnes, introduced the concept of healthy living to children at La Escuela Rice by creating a homegrown garden. With assistance from 15 volunteers, Hermoso turned a small plot of land into what she calls a \u201cthriving prolific garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe children not only learned how to maintain the garden, but they also gained responsibility, learned about the importance of nutrition and diet and had tons of fun while doing it all,\u201d said Hermoso.\n\nBesides raising and harvesting plants such as carrots, onions, tomatoes and radishes, Hermoso enlisted help from the school\u2019s librarian to help her engage students in fun and healthy activities. These activities ranged from making homemade peanut butter and freshly squeezed carrot juice to having a Christmas pizza party using produce from the garden.\n\n\u201cMy project will impact more than I can imagine,\u201d said Hermoro. \u201cSince I influenced the children at la Escuela Rice to live a healthy lifestyle, I suspect that they will influence many others to do the same.\u201d\n\nMattioli recruited nine volunteers to help her improve and expand the storage space in each of the sleeping quarters located at Casa Juan Diego, a temporary shelter for homeless immigrants in Houston. Mattioli designed, constructed and installed shelving, helped renovate and repair common areas and helped update residences.\n\n\u201cI was glad to help solve the limited space issue for recent immigrants adjusting to a new country,\u201d said Mattioli. \u201cThis project taught me that leadership requires patience, perseverance and hard work.\u201d\n\nMattioli\u2019s said that her Gold Award project integrated many things important to her \u2013 her faith and family history. Casa is an organization founded by Catholics committed to serving those in need and it focuses on immigrants. Many of Mattioli\u2019s ancestors immigrated to the U.S.\n\nSince 1916, girls have successfully answered the call to Go Gold, an act that indelibly marks them as accomplished members of their communities and the world. Swanson and Mattioli are both members of the Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourexaminernews.com", "description": "Fiona Swanson and Jana Hermoso, students at St. Agnes Academy and Francesca Mattioli, a senior at Carnegie Vanguard High School earned the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award in Girl Scouting.", "title": "St. Agnes Academy, Carnegie Vanguard Girl Scouts earn highest honor", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/west_university/news/st-agnes-academy-carnegie-vanguard-girl-scouts-earn-highest-honor/article_080eac04-bf12-566e-8106-9422a900ca7d.html", "image": {"width": 303, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/4b/74bf633e-e789-529a-a227-4c1ee25d5bfb/553dc4e4eb8c3.image.jpg?resize=303%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Fiona Swanson and Jana Hermoso, students at St. Agnes Academy and Francesca Mattioli, a senior at Carnegie Vanguard High School earned the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award in Girl Scouting.", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Fiona Swanson and Jana Hermoso, students at St. Agnes Academy and Francesca Mattioli, a senior at Carnegie Vanguard High School earned the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award in Girl Scouting.\nTo assist in her project, Swanson recruited eight volunteers.\n\u201cThis project taught me that leadership requires patience, perseverance and hard work.\u201dMattioli\u2019s said that her Gold Award project integrated many things important to her \u2013 her faith and family history.\nSwanson and Mattioli are both members of the Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council.\nHermoso, a junior at St. Agnes, introduced the concept of healthy living to children at La Escuela Rice by creating a homegrown garden."}
