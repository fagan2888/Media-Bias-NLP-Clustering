Last year about 40 percent of Oregonians in the individual market used the health insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov, to receive credits that can be used to reduce monthly premiums.\n\nState regulators will accept public comment and review the rates before issuing a final decision. But the trend is not a positive one for consumers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care act requires most people have coverage or face a penalty in tax time.\n\n\u0093For the next two months, we will analyze the requested rates to ensure they adequately cover costs without being too high or too low,\u0094 said Insurance Commissioner Laura Cali. \u0093Our open process allows Oregonians to see everything we do and provide comments on the filings that affect them.\u0094\n\nFor now, the specifics are daunting. Providence has proposed boosting its rates by an average 29.6 percent, coming on top of a 13.8 percent overall hike last year. As of February, Providence led the individual market with more than 100,000 Oregonians enrolled. A 40-year-old on a Providence silver plan pays $273 a month now.\n\nModa, meanwhile, has requested a market-leading average rate hike of 32.3 percent, coming on top of an average 25 percent rate hike approved last year. Moda reported about 60,000 members in Oregon\u0092s individual market, and a 40-year-old on a Moda silver plan pays $307 a month now.\n\nHealth Net Health Plan of Oregon is the only insurer located in the state not to propose raising its rates. The firm is being sold to an out-of-state for-profit insurer, Centene.\n\nOther rate hikes proposed by insurers range from about 15 percent by PacifiSource and Atrio Health Plans to 32 percent by Oregon\u0092s Health CO-OP. The latter company, along with Providence, offered what agents considered some of the more attractive plans in 2016, with a $274 premium for a 40-year-old on a silver plan.\n\nDriving insurers\u0092 rate hikes last year were massive losses due to unexpected claims costs.\n\nAccording to the state, people can search www.oregonhealthrates.org to submit comments and review rates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New premium requests from insurers spell trouble for Oregonians, Local News,", "generator": "Pamplin Communications", "rights": "Pamplin Communications Corp.", "og": {"site_name": "Oregon Local News", "description": "New premium requests from insurers spell trouble for Oregonians, Local News,", "title": "Oregonians who buy own health insurance face big hikes in 2017", "url": "http://www.pamplinmedia.com/nbg/142-news/306157-184260-oregonians-who-buy-own-health-insurance-face-big-hikes-in-2017-", "image": "http://www.pamplinmedia.com/images/cni-logo-red.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Social Issues, Business_Finance, Healthcare reform in the United States, 111th United States Congress, Types of insurance, Internal Revenue Code, Internal Revenue Service, Health insurance, Insurance, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Rate Review Program, Health insurance in the United States, HMO Medical Centers, Managed Healthcare - NEC, Health Net, health insurance face, www.oregonhealthrates.org, Department of Consumer and Business Services, Centene, Insurance Commissioner, out-of-state for-profit insurer, health insurance, Laura Cali, health insurance exchange, Oregon, Medicare,", "my": {"tw": "on", "fb": "on", "google": "on", "in": "on"}}, "article_summary": "Driving insurers\u0092 rate hikes last year were massive losses due to unexpected claims costs.\nHealth Net Health Plan of Oregon is the only insurer located in the state not to propose raising its rates.\nThe premium hikes don\u0092t take into account tax credits available to those with qualifying incomes.\nOther rate hikes proposed by insurers range from about 15 percent by PacifiSource and Atrio Health Plans to 32 percent by Oregon\u0092s Health CO-OP.\nNew premium requests from insurers spell trouble for OregoniansOregonians who buy their own health insurance face a second straight year of hefty premium hikes that could boost coverage costs by nearly a third."}
