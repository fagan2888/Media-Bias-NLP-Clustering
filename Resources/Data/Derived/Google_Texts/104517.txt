A Sarasota man is jailed today after he got upset with the yelping of a 3-month-old puppy having a seizure and poured hot sauce on the dog.

At about 1:20 a.m. Sunday, officers responded to the 3500 block of Old Bradenton Road after getting a report of animal cruelty, according to Sarasota police. When officers arrived, a woman told them her boyfriend, Ephrian Myles, 47, of 1511 31st St., Sarasota, covered her 3-month-old dachshund/Chihuahua mix with hot sauce.

The owner said the dog, which has a history of seizures, and was suffering one and yelping, and that annoyed Myles, police said. He then grabbed Gizmo and covered the dog with the hot sauce, which got into its eyes and throat.

The homeowner took the dog to a fire station for help, police said. When officers found the puppy, they saw Gizmo's eyes were swollen shut and that he was having difficulty breathing. The puppy went limp while officers were there.

Officers Jessica Sullivan and Adam Arena washed Gizmo with water and a towel, police said, and the dog was turned over to Animal Services. Gizmo is expected to recover.

Officers contacted Myles and they saw a lot of hot sauce on the floor, police said, to which he denied any connection.

Myles has been charged with felony aggravated animal cruelty and taken to the Sarasota County Jail. He is being held on $5,000 bond.
