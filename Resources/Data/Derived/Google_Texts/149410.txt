In rural parts of Uganda, medical centers and makeshift hospitals are often left in the dark at night, as they have no light or power. This makes it difficult and even dangerous to treat medical emergencies or deliver babies at night.

The “solar suitcase” is changing that, however. Developed by We Care Solar, the yellow suitcase contains two 20 watt solar panels, a 14 amp-hour sealed lead acid battery, two headlamps, and a battery charger. Mounted to a wall, the suitcase provides a package for health care workers to get the light and power they need at night.

The solar suitcase provides three lights: one in the delivery room, the waiting room, and the security light. In addition to being able to charge phones, “it also has a fetal Doppler, which they use as they are checking the baby’s heartbeat,” Dorah Taranta, the health project manager for Pathfinder International, said in a video.

So far, We Care Solar has installed yellow suitcases in various parts of the world, including parts of Mexico and Central America, India, and African countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Check out this map to see where else they’ve brought them.

The suitcase is a seemingly simple package — yet the difference in care is night and day. According to the WHO, 800 women die from pregnancy and childbirth daily, most of them from preventable causes. The vast majority of these deaths occur in third-world countries, especially in rural, poor communities.

“[The solar suitcase] brings the confidence of the mother out to know that I can really walk in at night and I will be taken care of,” Taranta said in the video. “So it’s saving lives.”
