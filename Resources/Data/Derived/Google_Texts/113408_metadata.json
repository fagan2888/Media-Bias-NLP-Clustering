He leaned his crutches against the wall and took a seat in the corner. His seven pill bottles, of varying heights, created a miniature skyline of orange and white.\n\nA heavyset man with a scraggly beard, Alvarez has diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma. He was at this clinic in East Los Angeles for his 2 p.m. appointment with Sangeeta Salvi.\n\n\u201cI was in denial for a very long time,\u201d Alvarez, 42, said about his diabetes. Now he comes in every three weeks to discuss his medications, diet and exercise with Salvi.\n\nDespite the white coat slung over the back of her chair, Salvi isn\u2019t a physician, but a pharmacist.\n\nShe\u2019s one of a growing number moving out from behind grocery store pharmacy counters across the country and seeing patients in new ways, part of a push to reduce health-care costs, address social issues that impede people\u2019s health and ease a national shortage of primary care physicians.\n\nSteven Chen, a University of Southern California clinical pharmacy professor, runs this pilot initiative at 10 clinics belonging to AltaMed, a nonprofit clinic network that serves largely low-income populations in L.A. and Orange counties.\n\nIn a health-care system that often seems impersonal and intimidating, pharmacists can act as a much-needed sympathetic ear and source of advice, spending extra time with patients.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we\u2019ve been very successful,\u201d Chen said, \u201cbecause someone is taking the time to sit with the patient.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTeam-based medical care, in which multiple health care professionals work together to treat a patient, is a central feature of the Affordable Care Act. But as different workers collaborate, there\u2019s concern that pharmacists could overstep their bounds.\n\n\u201cEvery member of the team is critical but not interchangeable,\u201d said Reid Blackwelder, board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nPharmacists\u2019 roles are fundamentally different from doctors\u2019; whereas doctors try to diagnose a root problem, pharmacists just try to make the symptoms better. Pharmacists are best trained to determine appropriate uses and dosages of medications to help patients with their problems.\n\nNearly 90 percent of patients with chronic illnesses take medication as the first line of treatment. In the United States, between a third and a half of patients don\u2019t take their medicines properly, which \u2014 along with poor prescribing and diagnoses \u2014 costs the health-care industry as much as $290 billion a year, according to the New England Health-Care Institute.\n\nOn average, clinical pharmacists in the USC program find 10 drug-related problems per patient \u2014 things such as taking the wrong dosage or missing a needed medicine.\n\nBut they also act as a sort of medical counselor, helping patients with a range of issues, including diet, exercise and stresses of all kinds. Many pharmacists taking part in the USC initiative \u2014 funded by a $12-million federal grant \u2014 also call insurance companies and drug manufacturers to make sure patients can get needed medications.\n\n\u201cOur patients need that,\u201d said Rosie Jadidian, director of pharmaceutical services for Community Clinic Assn. of Los Angeles County. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting on bus schedules, and their lives are organized in different ways. They need that one-stop shopping.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSitting face-to-face in her cramped office, their knees almost touching, Salvi and Alvarez review the medicines he\u2019s taking.\n\nThree times a day. Eight milligrams. Before meals. When I wake up.\n\nPharmacists at AltaMed clinics are paired with patients they can help most: those with chronic illnesses.\n\nWhen Salvi first started treating Alvarez, she realized he was using only a quick-relief inhaler, not one for long-term control.\n\nNow that he\u2019s taking the preventive inhaler regularly, Alvarez, who lives in Boyle Heights, says he hasn\u2019t experienced much shortness of breath.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been a month and a half, two months, and I\u2019ve noticed a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nSalvi said the fast-paced work of clinical pharmacy was more appealing than working behind a counter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re directly involved in their care,\u201d said Salvi, who\u2019s been treating patients at AltaMed clinics for two years. \u201cWe develop a strong relationship.\u201d\n\nPatients usually see their pharmacists once a month, while they see their primary care doctors a few times a year. And pharmacist visits are typically longer, lasting up to an hour.\n\nAlvarez has had diabetes for more than 10 years. He lost his job as a chef last year because of a foot ulcer that made it impossible for him to stand all day in the kitchen. After he lost a toe in January, he decided to start trying to keep his diabetes under control.\n\nAfter consulting her notes, Salvi asked Alvarez whether he\u2019s still eating eggs and two pieces of wheat toast for breakfast. He says he\u2019s reduced it to one slice.\n\n\u201cI used to drink a 2-liter Coke by myself at lunch,\u201d he said. Now, he has half a 23-ounce Arizona iced tea with his midday meal, but he\u2019s working to cut that out too, he says.\n\nSalvi tells him that breaking a habit cold turkey is always difficult. \u201cRemember to take baby steps,\u201d she says.\n\n___\n\nClinical pharmacists are part of a burgeoning number of recent medical interventions that aim to increase access to medical care. Across the country, patients can see a nurse or a pharmacist at new retail clinics, urgent-care clinics and kiosks. Some patients can also now talk to a health-care professional on video chat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably exhilarating and also a little overwhelming,\u201d said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a Harvard Medical School professor who studies innovations in health care delivery.\n\nBecause these innovations often take care out of the hands of doctors, many of them also help with the shortage of providers across the country that worsened with the expansion of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe nationwide shortfall of primary care doctors is expected to grow to about 45,000 by 2020. Almost a quarter of Californians already live in a primary care shortage area, according to state data.\n\nA California law went into effect last year that allows pharmacists to bill for medical care \u2014 seen as a step toward solidifying their expanded roles outside pharmacies. Congress is considering a similar bill, but critics say that an already costly health care system can\u2019t afford to pay another provider.\n\nEarly data from the AltaMed initiative shows that bringing in a clinical pharmacist saves money overall by reducing hospitalizations and other expensive medical treatments, but initially increases costs both to pay the pharmacists and to provide more medicines.\n\nHistorically, that\u2019s made clinical pharmacists a hard sell because clinics haven\u2019t been financially responsible if a patient ends up in the hospital, so there is little incentive to pay for the extra service. That\u2019s slowly changing with the Affordable Care Act, as payment models shift so providers are rewarded if patients stay healthy, and penalized if they don\u2019t.\n\nAt AltaMed clinics, pharmacists\u2019 schedules are almost always booked.\n\nSalvi took Alvarez\u2019s blood pressure one last time. With a smile, she told him she thought they\u2019ve covered everything for the day.\n\nShe tentatively scheduled him an appointment in three weeks, because he\u2019s not sure when he\u2019ll be free next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be calling you anyways,\u201d Salvi said. \u201cYou know how we are.\u201d\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Jose Alvarez clutched a red drawstring bag as he hobbled into a small office.
