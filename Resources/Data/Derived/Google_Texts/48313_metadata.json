But it would be a case study with a twist: its research subjects increasingly control our economy, our politics, and even our personal lives. We\u2019re dealing with a cohort of highly fortunate, highly privileged and highly unaware individuals who have been inappropriately lionized by society. That lionization has led them to believe that their wealth and accomplishments are their own doing, rather than the fruits of collaborative effort \u2013 effort which in many cases was only made possible through government support.\n\nBut instead of thanking the government and the taxpayers for their good fortune, they\u2019ve allowed their own good press to go to their heads. And they\u2019re biting the hand that feeds them, attempting to shut down the system of taxpayer support and government action which created their world.\n\nOur money-obsessed society gives them far more praise and privilege then they deserve. Our corrupted political system gives them far more influence than we deserve. And, slowly but surely, they are now turning their considerable resources to dismantling government\u2019s role in society.\n\nCall them the \u201ccool tycoons of libertarianism.\u201d They have neat ideas (when they\u2019re not talking about government or the economy, that is). They have neat toys and neat houses. But what they would do to our society isn\u2019t neat at all.\n\nHere are five of them.\n\n1. Tom Perkins\n\nPerkins has already received well more than his deserved 15 minutes of fame. But, while he\u2019s been appropriately reviled for his infamous \u201cKristallnacht\u201d comment, comparing the treatment of America's 1% to that of Jews in Nazi Germany, too few people have taken him to task for the depth of his ignorance on economic issues.\n\nThat ignorance was in full display when he went on Bloomberg television to \u201capologize\u201d for his Nazi reference \u2013 an occasion in which he spent far more time defending his ugly worldview than he did apologizing.\n\nIn his original comments, Perkins compared \u201cthe progressive war on the American one percent, namely the \u2018rich\u2019\u201d with Nazi persecution of Jews. But as we first reported, much of the \u201cpersecution\u201d which triggered Perkins\u2019 outrage involved his ex-wife\u2019s hedges; it was a one-paragraph item in the San Francisco Chronicle criticizing author Danielle Steele's landscaping. It wasn\u2019t a progressive critique; it was an aesthetic one.\n\nNobody\u2019s criticizing all wealthy people, of course. In fact, a number of them showed uncommon good sense during the Perkins kerfuffle. The investment firm which Perkins cofounded tweeted that \u201cWe were shocked by his views \u2026 and do not agree.\u201d Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen called him an unprintable name. (Well, okay: it isn\u2019t unprintable. Andreessen called Perkins an \u201casshole.\u201d)\n\nPerkins\u2019 defense of his initial comments on Bloomberg betray the shallowness of his libertarian thought. He insisted that his fellow tycoons are \u201cjob creators,\u201d despite the fact that they\u2019ve been paying very low taxes for more than a decade \u2013 and there are no jobs!\n\nPerkins also insisted that society should \u201clet the rich do what the rich do\u201d and enjoy the expanded job opportunities that will flow from that. But on Wall Street the rich were allowed to do what the rich do and it robbed the economy of millions of jobs and trillions in wealth. Apple and other big tech manufacturers were allowed to \u201cdo what they do\u201d and hundreds of thousands of jobs were shipped overseas.\n\nPerkins defended the incivility of the San Francisco tech crowd by saying that \u201cmaybe have to put up with some techno-geek arrogance to get those sorts of folks thinking.\u201d But what, exactly, are these geeks thinking about? One of the most stunning things about Silicon Valley triumphalism is the way it celebrates itself for what are, after all, a very mediocre set of inventions.\n\nTruly smart tech companies are few and far between. Facebook? An accidental discovery by two guys who thought they were creating a college students\u2019 app and still can\u2019t design a decent user interface. Uber? An obvious idea with a nice user interface. Zynga? The less said the better.\n\nNor was Perkins himself the winner of some Darwinian free-market competition. He made his money the old-fashioned way: by meeting two brilliant guys named Hewlett and Packard and getting them to hire him. Perkins himself was never the entrepreneur or the innovator at Hewlett-Packard. He ran the research department, then became general manager of its computer division.\n\nHewlett-Packard itself would never succeeded without Uncle Sam. As Bloomberg News has reported, \u201cDefense contracts spurred the growth of the instrument-maker Hewlett-Packard not long after its founding.\u201d (Today HP is one of the nation\u2019s l argest defense contractors.)\n\nBut guys like Tom Perkins don\u2019t know how to say \u201cthank you.\u201d Instead, when they\u2019re asked to people like him live in a \u201cbubble,\u201d they tend to answer as Perkins did, by claiming that it is \u201ca bubble that has changed the world.\u201d\n\nActually the government changed the world. So did brilliant inventors like Bill Hewlett and David Packard. Guys like Tom Perkins, while they may have been smart and/or hard-working, mostly caught a lucky break. But they\u2019ve managed to rewrite their own histories as a libertarian fantasy, a Victory of the Supermen upon which all others must gaze in wonderment and awe.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to say nice things about the hedges.\n\n2. John Mackey\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, is one of the nation\u2019s most visible \u201cfree-market libertarians.\u201d Mr. Mackey said this about government, and specifically about Obamacare, last year on NPR:\n\n\u201cIn fascism, the government doesn't own the means of production but they do control it and that's what's happening with the health care program with these reforms and so I'd say the system is becoming more fascist.\u201d\n\nPresumably that means that the privatization of government services \u2013 an effort which includes every major defense contractor in this country \u2013 is a \u201cfascist\u201d scheme. We haven\u2019t heard Mr. Mackey make that argument, however.\n\nThe \u201cfascist government Mackey despises provides a number of services which have helped make him become very wealthy. The USDA, for example, certifies that the food sold in his stores is organic. Without that certification, Whole Foods customers would have no way of trusting Mr. Mackey\u2019s claims about his food. His business probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten off the ground without it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. Government built and maintains the roads and rails which bring Mr. Mackey\u2019s goods to each of his far-flung stores. Government regulators ensure that his stores\u2019 food is grown, prepared, packaged, and shipped in a manner that is safe and disease-free.\n\nWithout government, John Mackey would still be running a little hippie store in Austin.\n\nMr. Mackey believes that business, not government, is best suited to addressing society\u2019s ills. He points to his corporation\u2019s own health plan as proof, claiming that it\u2019s superior to Obamacare. Actually, it\u2019s quite similar to Obamacare. Like the president\u2019s plan, Mackey\u2019s offers employees a choice of private-sector insurance options.\n\nBut the benefits are much worse in Mackey\u2019s program. As Consumer Watchdog points out, Whole Foods employees have \u201castronomical\u201d deductibles and copayments. If corporations can do the job better than government can, why is Mackey\u2019s plan so much worse?\n\nWhile government is evil in Mackey\u2019s eyes, he\u2019s a great believer in the existence of \u201c heroic business.\u201d And yet, Mr. Mackey doesn\u2019t exactly practice what he preaches. Consider this quote from Mackey: \u201cBusiness is based on cooperation and voluntary exchange. People trade voluntarily for mutual gain. No one is forced to trade with a business.\u201d\n\nReally, Mr. Mackey? Whole Foods is well-known for buying out all its competitors in a city or region. Some of the competitors it closed down this way include Wild Oats, Wellspring, Bread & Circus, Mrs. Gooch\u2019s, Food for Thought, and Fresh and Wild.\n\nA former Whole Foods employee described what happened after Mackey\u2019s corporation shut down the competing Wild Oats store or in his town: \u201cWithin one year of this merger \u2026 prices on many items went up by 15-20%. At the time our cat food was $13.59 a bag, today it is $16.59 and mostly due to the lack of competition in the market (another nearby WFM in another region has a lot more competition and the food is at its original $.59).\u201d\n\nFor a believer in the \u201cfree market,\u201d Mr. Mackey certainly seems to do everything he can to suppress it. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission was forced to step in on antitrust grounds over Whole Foods handling of Wild Oats stores. Whole Foods finally settled and agreed to sell off the remaining Wild Oats locations, but by then the damage to the \u201cfree market\u201d had already been done.\n\nMr. Mackey, who is 60 years old and has no children, reportedly views himself as a \u201c daddy\u201d to his employees. If so, he can be a Scrooge-like one. Despite the corporation\u2019s PR campaigns claiming otherwise, Whole Foods pays at or near the minimum wage for many positions in its stores.\n\nAmong other things, that means that this anti-government zealot is being subsidized by government programs so that he can keep underpaying his employees. Here\u2019s how that works: Anyone who earns 130 percent of the Federal poverty line or less (currently about $25,400 for a three-person household) is eligible for food assistance. That\u2019s $12.21 per hour for a full-time employee.\n\nThe employment website Glassdoor.com lists salaries for a number of Whole Foods positions. Jobs that start in the $8/hour range or below include assistant bulk buyer, cashier\u2019s assistant, bakery assistant, cashier, customer service representative, and associate. There are dozens of jobs whose average pay is less than that.\n\nWhy don\u2019t both parents work? Sometimes it\u2019s because there\u2019s only one parent at home, with two kids to raise. That\u2019s no way to treat the grandkids, Pop.\n\nOne more thing: Mackey doesn\u2019t think the climate change is real, either. So he doesn\u2019t just think he can do government\u2019s job better than government can. He also thinks he knows more about science than scientists do. Sounds more like an ego problem than a difference in ideology.\n\n\u200b3. Peter Thiel\n\nWhatever his shortcomings, John Mackey can also be an engaging and interesting personality. Internet tycoon Peter Thiel, on the other hand, shows all the signs of being a rather unpleasant individual. He doesn\u2019t think women or minorities \u2013 excuse me, I mean \u201cwelfare beneficiaries\u201d \u2013 should be allowed to vote, for one thing. Since 1920,\u201d Thiel fulminated in an essay, \u201cthe extension of the franchise to (these two groups) have (sic) turned \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\"\n\nGive him points for honesty: \u201cI no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,\u201d writes Thiel. That\u2019s not an unusual point of view in one strain of libertarian thinking. But it\u2019s unusual to hear it stated so plainly.\n\nIn his rather comically grandiose essay, Thiel compares the criticism his undergraduate newspaper received at Stanford to the \u201ccarnage\u201d of \u201ctrench warfare on the Western Front in World War I.\u201d Thiel, who made his fortune at PayPal with Elon Musk, has shown none of his former partner\u2019s genius for technological and business creativity.\n\nAnd speaking of grandiosity, Thiel tells us that \u201cthe founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution\u201d \u2013 and presumably controlled instead by the likes of Peter Thiel. He waxes equally excessive about Facebook and other Internet companies, touting their inability to overthrow democracy and replace it with a newer and \u201cfreer\u201d (at least for Peter Thiel) digital regime.\n\nBut Thiel\u2019s expansive vision doesn\u2019t end with regime change. \u201cBy starting a new Internet business,\u201d he writes, \u201can entrepreneur may create a new world.\u201d (By now, Star Trek fans may be noticing a growing resemblance between the essay\u2019s author and a certain semi-omnipotent recurring character.)\n\nThiel is honest about one thing, if only inadvertently, when he writes that \u201cthe prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed.\u201d That\u2019s true. His brand of politics is extremely unpopular with the general public. But he fails to take that thought to its logical conclusion: democracy is the free market of governance. When Thiel rejects its judgment he contradicts his own political philosophy.\n\nBut Peter Thiel has a much bigger problem than that. He clearly believes that he and his fellow Internet success stories are a brand of Nietzsche ubermenschen. \u201cThe fate of our world,\u201d he writes, \u201cmay depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.\u201d\n\nIn other words: there\u2019s an app for that.\n\nBut Thiel, along with the other boys in his treehouse, made his millions by relying on taxpayer-funded and democratically-managed assistance every step of the way. Like Facebook and the other big tech corporations, PayPal was built on the government-created Internet. It is accessed by computers whose core technology was funded by government research. The vast majority of its customers are able to read its instructions because of government-funded education.\n\n4. Elon Musk\n\nAs the old brain-teasers used to say, \u201cone of these things is not like the others.\u201d Elon Musk differs from the other people on this list in one very important way: He\u2019s a smart guy who actually invents things. They are real things, useful things, tangible things. Where the other Silicon Valley libertarians merely imagine they\u2019re real inventors like Ford and Edison, while doing nothing more than making trivial front-ends for existing technology, Musk really seems to be what he appears: an inventor and entrepreneur in the old-school style.\n\nUnfortunately, he also hangs around with the wrong crowd. Some of their silly ideas seem to have rubbed off on him. We don\u2019t know if that happened when he was working on PayPal with Thiel, or even earlier when they were part of the same conservative circle as undergraduates at Stanford.\n\nWhatever it was, the tendency for ideologically-based hypocrisy has not entirely eluded Musk. As Mother Jones reports, Musk was able to save Tesla Motors \u2013 and his sizable ownership stake in it \u2013 with a low-interest government loan. \u201cShortly after paying off his $465 million loan,\u201d Josh Harkinson writes, \u201cMusk proclaimed that government should no longer provide such assistance.\u201d\n\nA carbon tax would have been better, Musk argued (ignoring the fact that such attacks appears to be politically impossible right now). The market, Mosque then tweeted, \u201cwill achieve best solution.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Musk, a market-driven economy have never invested in the pure research necessary to develop personal computing technology and the Internet. And without those two platforms, Musk would never have had the financial resources to launch Tesla. So, when Musk tweeted that \u201c\"Technically, I 'got rich' from Zip2 & PayPal w zero govt anything,\u201d he wasn\u2019t demonstrating anything except his own ignorance of the economics and history of his own field.\n\nI met Musk once and was quite impressed with his brilliance. Unfortunately, brilliance too easily leads to hubris. It\u2019s like the old saying goes: it\u2019s not what you don\u2019t know that takes you down. It\u2019s what you don\u2019t know you don\u2019t know. Silicon Valley libertarians, take note.\n\n5. Jeff Bezos\n\nAnd speaking of hubris: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos went on 60 Minutes and told the country that in a few years his corporation will deliver its products by drone. All that claim did was reinforce the stereotype of the Silicon Valley libertarian as someone who doesn\u2019t understand the social realities of the world around him.\n\nAnyone who thinks an unmanned aircraft filled with valuable goods will routinely survive a descent path into the most heavily-armed nation on Earth has got another think comin\u2019.\n\nFor some people, the drone claim was a surprise. But it was part of what has become a routine pattern for the admittedly brilliant, if ruthless, leader of Amazon: allow the taxpayers to develop a costly new technology (first computers, then the Internet, then drones), adopt it for your own profit-making ends, then cling to a belief system which says that government played no part in the success of people like yourself.\n\nMuch of Bezos\u2019 libertarian worldview has been a matter of private speculation rather than public advocacy, noted in biographical profiles but much less visible in public donations and proclamations. The one exception is education, where Bezos has invested large sums of money in libertarian and neoliberal efforts to replace public education as we know it with a privatized, for-profit, anti-union nexus of corporations.\n\nWhether or not Mr. Bezos is aware of it, the fundamental pattern undermining our educational system is a simple one: first, starve school districts of needed funds. Second, lament their declining performance. Third, claim that something called the \u201cfree market\u201d can bring the innovation necessary to rescue it. Fourth, make greater sums of money available for private corporations than you were willing to do for public education.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of this Mr. Bezos understands. But, as Lee Fang reported in The Nation, he has aggressively pushed a destructive privatization agenda on our educational system through the Bezos Family Foundation.\n\nBezos also put a capstone on his hypocrisy by donating $100,000 to defeat an initiative which would have imposed a mild additional income tax on high earners. The computing technology which is made Mr. Bezos wealthy was developed using taxpayer funding which began in the 1950s, when the top federal income tax rate was 93 percent. Today it is 39.5 percent.\n\nWhere will the innovations of the future come from if the government doesn\u2019t have the resources needed for investment \u2013 either in new technologies, or in the bright young minds of the future who will someday invent them? Government is how we create a better world, Mr. Bezos. It won\u2019t just be delivered to our doorstep by a drone.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "science,technology,enhancement,genetic,nanotechnology,virtual,metaverse,future,bioethics,mp3,political,politics,policy,progressive,radical,radio,religion,science fiction,scientific,scifi,sex,university,technoprogressive,transhumanist,transhumanism,Bostrom,Hughes,Treder", "description": "These highly privileged and highly unaware individuals have been inappropriately lionized by society.The cult of the libertarian-minded ultra-weatlhy would make an intriguing anthropological case study.
