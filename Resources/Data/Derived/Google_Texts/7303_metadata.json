Bush, Iraq war, Olivia Nuzzi, rutgers university, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, The New York Times, Timothy Egan, Torture, Media News, News, Politics News\n\nAs sincerely as I wish everyone involved with the George W. Bush administration would just go away \u2014 or at least agree to only appear in the public eye in brief, tweet-size increments \u2014 I must admit that I think the recent kerfuffle over former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Rutgers University has been valuable, if only for the way it\u2019s laid bare some of American society\u2019s ugliest hypocrisies and quirks. I\u2019m thinking of two in particular: the contradictory demands we make of our college students, and the intellectual ravages of our toxic cult of American exceptionalism.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, here\u2019s a quick recap of the incident: After a vocal student outcry at her selection, Rice decided she would not accept the university\u2019s offer to speak at this year\u2019s commencement, walking away from $35,000 and an honorary doctorate. \u201cCommencement should be a time of joyous celebration for the graduates and their families,\u201d Rice wrote in a Facebook note explaining her decision. Describing her invitation as \u201ca distraction for the university community at this very special time,\u201d Rice took the high road and swiftly put the controversy to rest by bowing out.\n\nBecause hers was just one of a recent handful of commencement reversals \u2014 the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Christine Lagarde withdrew from a Smith College engagement, as did Robert Birgeneau from one at Haverford College \u2014 some pundits have since argued that Rice\u2019s concession is proof that \u201cliberal intolerance\u201d is ascendant, threatening academic freedom and free speech all across our nation\u2019s campuses. (To her credit, Rice disagreed, writing in her Facebook note that while she has \u201cdefended America\u2019s belief in free speech and the exchange of ideas\u201d these values are \u201cnot what is at issue here.\u201d) Other, smarter pundits have instead claimed that her story is an example of college kids being intellectual hothouse flowers, incapable of gracefully listening to opinions they don\u2019t like without throwing a fit.\n\nOlivia Nuzzi of the Daily Beast, for example, wrote with obvious frustration that the class of 2014 needs to \u201ccalm the hell down\u201d and recognize that \u201coftentimes you find great wisdom in shitty people.\u201d Before declaring that young people \u201care the worst\u201d (which, considering Nuzzi\u2019s own young age, was almost certainly written with tongue slightly in cheek) Nuzzi writes that the \u201centire point of college is to be exposed to different things,\u201d a truism that 2014 graduates of Rutgers and Smith shamefully forgot. \u201c[M]aybe some of those people will hail from organizations that negatively impacted poor countries, or maybe they were partly responsible for a war that ate up the country\u2019s resources and resulted in human rights abuses and lots of needless death,\u201d Nuzzi grants. But still.\n\nAt the Week, meanwhile, Damon Linker took Nuzzi\u2019s attack one step further, arguing that not only did these students fail to understand the point of college but that they were perpetuating \u201cthe tyranny of right-thinking moralism\u201d that is ruining America\u2019s institutions of higher learning. Noting that he, too, opposed the war of choice that will forever be Rice\u2019s chief legacy, Linker writes that \u201c[t]he world is an imperfect and morally complicated place, filled with people who regularly do things I consider wrong, stupid, misguided, foolish, and unethical\u201d but that such people should still not be \u201cexcommunicated, ignored, or banished from public life.\u201d Besides, Linker writes, what good does protesting Rice serve \u201cbeyond convincing the protesters of their own moral superiority?\u201d\n\nTwo thoughts. First (and less important) is that bashing college kids \u2014 especially ones who are defined by their idealism and hunger for change \u2014 remains one of our most widely accepted and least logically defensible pastimes. Despite telling ourselves that we in America value youth, education and self-expression, there are few cultural archetypes more universally loathed than the campus activist. We say we want our kids to be independent, informed, fearless and disruptive, but then we attack, patronize and demean them as soon as they decide they\u2019d like to be more than seen and not heard. (This dynamic is especially unfortunate when played out among the press. As my friend Ned Resnikoff snarked on Twitter, \u201cWhat made you guys all want to be journalists? For me it was the thrill and fulfillment that comes with mocking college activists.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Rutgers students got her commencement speech canceled, critics went nuts.
