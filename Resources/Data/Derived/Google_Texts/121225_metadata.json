But the tax has been stagnant since 1993 and it has struggled to keep up with infrastructure expenses as cars have become more fuel efficient in recent years.\n\nDeputy Federal Transit Administrator Therese McMillan said the 1965 transit bill showed what can happen when lawmakers approve investments in transportation projects.\n\n\u201cOver the last half century, we have seen the enormous benefits of federal investments in public transportation in cities from Boston to San Diego, in rural communities from Nebraska to Missouri\u2014all of which spur billions of dollars in economic development and create much-needed transportation choices,\u201d McMillan said in a statement. \u201cContinued investments in public transportation will create jobs, revitalize communities, and create new opportunities for hard-working families.\u201d\n\nThe current transportation funding bill, which authorizes the collection of the gas tax, is scheduled to expire in September.\n\nThe transportation department has said that it will begin cutting back on payments to state and local governments on Aug. 1 unless Congress reaches an infrastructure funding deal.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "DOT celebrates Mass Transit Act 50th anniversary", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-09T15:30-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "DOT celebrates Mass Transit Act 50th anniversary", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/211696-dot-celebrates-mass-transit-act-50th-anniversary", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/publictransit_chicago_010614getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-09T15:30:37-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/211696-dot-celebrates-mass-transit-act-50th-anniversary", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-09T11:38-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Transit Administration, Highway Trust Fund, Gas Tax, MAP-21 Reauthorization,Anthony Foxx,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-09T11:38:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T15:30:37-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/211696-dot-celebrates-mass-transit-act-50th-anniversary", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "DOT celebrates Mass Transit Act 50th anniversary"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bc6\"", "article_summary": "Lawmakers are in the midst of a standoff over federal transportation funding that is threatening modern day public transit funding.\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) is celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the 1965 Urban Mass Transit Act on Wednesday as Congress is debating the future of present transportation funding.\nDeputy Federal Transit Administrator Therese McMillan said the 1965 transit bill showed what can happen when lawmakers approve investments in transportation projects.\nApproximately 20 percent of the revenue that is collected for the Highway Trust Fund is set aside for transit projects.\nThe legislation, which was signed by former President Lyndon Johnson, established the agency that is now known as the Federal Transit Administration, officials with the transportation department said."}
