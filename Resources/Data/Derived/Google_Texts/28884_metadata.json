According to the most recent statistics, Florida ranks second to last among the nation's states and the District of Columbia in per capita funding dedicated to mental health. The $37.49 it spends per resident represents just 30 percent of the national average of $124.99 per individual. Put another way, for every dollar Florida spends on mental health services, states on the whole spent $4.74, according to the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine any business running without a rate increase over 15 years?\u201d said Minge. \u201cWe would need $400 million in effective funding now just to equal where we were 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nGov. Rick Scott's refusal of state Medicaid funding through the Affordable Care Act has prevented local entities from strengthening the community-based programs that were intended to provide services after the closure of state mental hospitals since the mid-1960s. Citing just one example of a missed opportunity, Minge noted the federal government provided grants to 24 states, underwriting the development of planning strategies that would improve their mental health systems. Currently eight of those states \u2014 and potentially all 24 in the future \u2014 will be receiving implementation grants that will allow them to put their discoveries in place.\n\n\u201cFlorida was not one of the states that applied,\u201d Minge said.\n\nBayside's Alexander estimated that the number of Sarasota County residents with mental health needs as \u201cin the tens of thousands\u201d but said that, while the Florida Legislature is well aware of the pressing needs, \u201cin general, things get resolved in Tallahassee by crisis or by lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd of course, there's a finite amount of money,\u201d he added. (To which an audience member responded: \u201cThere's a finite amount of thinking.\")\n\nMinge said local legislators and county officials have been supportive in advocating for more funding and have been successful in getting small increases in pocket areas. But, he added, \u201cas a whole, this is not an issue that has been adopted at the state level.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, there are conflicting priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with our most recent governor, the priority is for tax cuts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"vf": {"unique_id": "art-2C5F3143-510E-508C-E053-0100007F29A8-pubSH"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20160222/article/160229900", "site_name": "HeraldTribune.com", "image": "http://G52-SHweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SH&Date=20160222&Category=ARTICLE&ArtNo=160229900&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article", "title": "Mental health providers decry lack of state funding"}, "publishdate": 20160222, "fb": {"app_id": 131646103569058}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-160229900-pubSH"}}, "keywords": "MANATEE COUNTY (FL),  ENGLEWOOD (CHARLOTTE COUNTY, FL),  ENGLEWOOD (SARASOTA COUNTY, FL),  NORTH PORT (FL),  VENICE (FL),  EEK (AK),  EKWOK (AK),  MANOKOTAK (AK),  SKWENTNA (AK),  NUIQSUT (AK),  VENETIE (AK),  Social Issue"}, "article_summary": "Thanks to a legislative priority of tax cuts over social services, the state-funded mental health system is capable of serving only a fraction of the estimated 4 million Floridians with mental health challenges, primarily those with severe and persistent illnesses who are in crisis.\nAccording to the most recent statistics, Florida ranks second to last among the nation's states and the District of Columbia in per capita funding dedicated to mental health.\n'\u201dAccording to a report on mental health spending compiled by the Florida Association of Managing Entities for 2014-2015, more than 36 percent of adult mental health funding in the state is spent on crisis intervention, while just 0.03 percent is spent on prevention and only 13.7 percent on recovery support.\nPut another way, for every dollar Florida spends on mental health services, states on the whole spent $4.74, according to the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy.\nRick Scott's refusal of state Medicaid funding through the Affordable Care Act has prevented local entities from strengthening the community-based programs that were intended to provide services after the closure of state mental hospitals since the mid-1960s."}
