John McCain in the upcoming primary election.\n\n\n\nThe resolution will also be submitted to the Arizona GOP for a vote at their upcoming Jan. 23 meeting.\n\n\n\nThe resolution, titled \u201cAZGOP State Committeemen Endorse Anyone BUT Senator John McCain,\u201d and is worded as follows:\n\n\n\n\u201cWe state committeemen of the Arizona Republican Party (AZGOP) fully support our Party platform and the candidates in the general elections that support that platform. However, in the primary elections we are free to endorse and support the Republican candidates of our choice. Since the AZGOP members overwhelmingly censured Senator McCain in January 2014, we had hoped he would have returned to our Party\u2019s values. He has not. So with conviction we rise and declare:\n\n\n\n\u201cWHEREAS, Senator McCain is a self proclaimed \u201cRepublican\u201d, but is actually a RINO, that was censured by the Arizona Republican State Committeemen on January 25, 2014; and\n\n\u201cvoted for DHS funding that included money for Obama\u2019s illegal amnesty for illegal aliens; and\n\n\u201ccampaigned on securing the border but co-sponsored legislation giving \u2018pathway to citizenship\u2019 to millions of illegal aliens; and\n\n\n\n\u201cactively worked to purge the party of grassroots conservatives using out-of-state funding via the Arizona Grassroots Action PAC; and\n\n\n\n\u201cvoted to kill an amendment requiring certification that Iran has not directly supported or carried out an act of terrorism against the United States before sanctions can be lifted; and\n\n\u201cdemeaned Republicans who stand for the Constitution, calling them \u2018crazies\u2019 and \u2018wacko birds;\u2019 and\n\n\n\n\u201cvoted to support funding for the Iran Nuclear Deal, Obamacare, Executive Amnesty and Planned Parenthood\u2019s selling of body parts.\n\n\n\n\u201cBE IT HEREBY RESOLVED that the AZGOP state committeemen endorse anyone BUT Senator McCain in Arizona\u2019s 2016 Republican primary election for the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast year McCain was booed by a majority of MCRC precinct committeemen who also turned their back on him, symbolic of what he has done to his constituents.\n\n\n\nIt was their hope McCain, who will turn 80 this year, would decide to finally step down and not to run for reelection.\n\n\n\nHowever, that is not the case.\n\n\n\nDr. Kelli Ward, the former Arizona State Senator who is challenging McCain in the primary, received a standing ovation during Saturday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\n\nMCRC also voted in a slate of anti-establishment members at large: Linda Brickman, Wes Harris, Tom Morrisey and Mark Spencer with an endorsement from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, along with establishment candidate John Ashley, all of whom were sworn in by Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell.\n\n\n\nChairman Tyler Bowyer was retained as MCRC chairman by a vote of 1037-636, while First Vice Chair Jeni White and Second Vice Chair Aaron Borders were both ousted by votes of 1083-692 and 1070-640, respectively.\n\n\n\nBowyer stated, \u201cThe \u2018Anyone But McCain\u2019 sentiment expressed by the grassroots Republicans perfectly mirrors the dissatisfaction of the millions of everyday Arizonans who are tired of an out-of-control federal government. From the commentary of many activists, Senator McCain\u2019s recent vote to increase the national debt to more than $20 trillion, while fully funding Planned Parenthood was a clear message that he is more inclined to choose President Obama and Harry Reid over the will of the Arizona voters in order to retain his D.C. establishment power.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll resolutions presented on the ballot passed, including a resolution to strengthen the Republican Party, calling the Party \u201cmerely a mechanism to enable likeminded individuals to work together in advancing common goals,\u201d in the direction as determined by its members and recorded in the Republican Party Platform.\n\n\n\nMCRC also resolved to fully repeal Obamacare, which it says has already proven we cannot keep either our doctors or insurance plans if we like them, costs will not be decreased as promised, it will be a massive tax increase on America\u2019s middle class as well as on the poor, and has already become a drag on our economy depressing job creation and stagnating wage growth.\n\n\n\nIt points out Republicans have several alternative plans that return control of healthcare decisions to patients and their chosen doctors, along with several options that both increase competition and decrease regulation among providers and insurers to force costs down.\n\nMCRC also passed a resolution to repeal medicinal use of marijuana, previously adopted in November 2010 as Prop. 203.\n\n\n\nThe resolution claims there has been lax oversight, weak medical rationale for prescriptions being written and widespread marijuana use for purposes other than those anticipated following the passage of Prop. 203.\n\n\n\nAnother resolution, authored by Tristan Manos, addressed the \u201cRightful (original natural law) understanding of the meaning of U.S. Constitution Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 \u2018natural born Citizen.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt states the U.S. Declaration of Independence was strongly guided by \u201cLaws of Nature and Nature\u2019s God.\u201d\n\n\n\nFurther, it notes our Founding Fathers/Framers of the Constitution were strongly guided by Emerich Vattel\u2019s \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d (1758, Book 1, Chapter 19, Section 212): \u201cnatural-born citizens are those born in the country of parents who are citizens\u201d and states, \u201cmeaning person born in the U.S. to two U.S.-Citizen parents.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt goes on to state it was the first Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay who recommended the natural born citizen clause directly to President and Commander-In-Chief George Washington as a \u201cstrong check to admission of foreigners into administration of our national government,\u201d and which ultimately passed unanimously at the Constitutional Convention.\n\n\n\nMCRC also passed a Human Life Amendment, explaining the Republican Party came into existence to enfranchise a sector of humanity - people of African descent - legally deprived of equal protection under the law.\n\n\n\nThe resolution cites the Supreme Court, through cases Roe vs. Wade and Doe vs. Bolton, \u201cconditionally deprived preborn humans of equal protection under the law, that condition being that the personhood of the preborn not being recognized.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe resolution seeks to mandate \u201cequal protection for preborn humanity and establish a consistent definition of humanness.\u201d\n\n\n\nRussell Pearce authored a resolution supporting Sheriff Joe Arpaio, declaring the Party\u2019s support and thanks to Arpaio for keeping his oath of office and enforcing our laws, despite attacks by liberal courts and the open borders crowd, noting the sheriff is the last line of defense to preserving the constitutional laws of the land.\n\n\n\nThe resolution also condemned the \u201cunconstitutional actions\u201d of U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow and the Obama administration\u2019s non enforcement policy.\n\n\n\nPearce also authored several other resolutions seeking to: prohibit participation in federal violations of the Second Amendment; defund Planned Parenthood, nullify Obama\u2019s non-enforcement/backdoor amnesty policies by demanding worksite enforcement to protect American jobs, end the reign of activist judges and judicial corruption, and one in support of Kim Davis\u2019 First Amendment rights relating to the free exercise of religion.\n\n\n\nMichael Loverine authored a resolution opposing the legalization of marijuana, stating teen use of marijuana has been on the rise in Arizona since 2007 and has been found to be harmful to the adolescent brain.\n\n\n\nIt states, \u201c[T]eens who smoke marijuana can see an eight point drop in IQ putting a person of average intelligence into the lowest third of the IQ range,\u201d and \u201ccan lead to poorer academic performance,\u201d while claiming \u201c[T]eens who use marijuana heavily are more likely to develop mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2012 Arizona Youth Survey, \u201c2012 was the first time in Arizona\u2019s history that past 30-day use of marijuana by teens surpassed their use of cigarettes\u201d and \u201cis one of only two substances whose use is on the rise among Arizona teens.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt also notes legalization of marijuana, which is the second leading substance for which people seek drug treatment and increased emergency room visits, would lead to increased marijuana consumption, can negatively affect workplace safety and productivity, and lead to higher health and safety costs.\n\n\n\nJoel Alcott of the Tenth Amendment Center authored a resolution in support of protecting Arizona\u2019s state rights, resolving to have the Arizona State Legislature and governor pass and sign into law legislation that protects U.S. citizens from warrantless spying by federal and state agencies, asserting county sheriffs having constitutional jurisdiction over federal agencies, pro-property rights laws to protect Arizona citizens from unconstitutional federal land acquisitions, pro-Second Amendment laws, anti-Affordable Care Act laws, and any legislation specifically protecting due process and the Bill of Rights.", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "MCRC resolved to endorse anyone but McCain"}, "article_summary": "Since the AZGOP members overwhelmingly censured Senator McCain in January 2014, we had hoped he would have returned to our Party\u2019s values.\nDr. Kelli Ward, the former Arizona State Senator who is challenging McCain in the primary, received a standing ovation during Saturday\u2019s meeting.\n\u201cBE IT HEREBY RESOLVED that the AZGOP state committeemen endorse anyone BUT Senator McCain in Arizona\u2019s 2016 Republican primary election for the U.S. Senate.\u201dLast year McCain was booed by a majority of MCRC precinct committeemen who also turned their back on him, symbolic of what he has done to his constituents.\nHowever, in the primary elections we are free to endorse and support the Republican candidates of our choice.\nMCRC also passed a Human Life Amendment, explaining the Republican Party came into existence to enfranchise a sector of humanity - people of African descent - legally deprived of equal protection under the law."}
