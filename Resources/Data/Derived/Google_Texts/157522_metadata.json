LOUIS \u2014 The calm before the storm is, well, a storm.\n\nThun-der!\n\nBefore the lightning flurry that is a Mark Melancon ninth inning, he enters the game to \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d the searing storm of an AC/DC song, which gives a fan\u2019s arm goose bumps and a batter\u2019s throat lumps.\n\nOh-wow-ow-ow-ow-oh.\n\nThun-der!\n\nOh-wow-ow-ow-ow-oh.\n\nBut this only occurs when he\u2019s at home \u2014 well, not home home, which is back in Golden \u2014 but Pittsburgh home. Here in St. Louis, on the road Thursday, the Pirates\u2019 closer jogs out to the Jell-O bouncy beats of J-Lo.\n\nLet\u2019s get loud, let\u2019s get louuud \u2014 turn the music up to hear that souuund!\n\nThey surely play this song to pep up the ballpark, but it feels like they\u2019re just trolling Melancon, anything to get him off his game.\n\nBut in a matter of minutes, a smattering of mastery. One, two, three, and Melancon is done with work, ho-hum.\n\n\u201cHe has been a fantastic executor of pitches,\u201d said our old friend Clint Hurdle, the former Rockies manager who has been Pittsburgh\u2019s skipper since 2010. \u201cHe has intent, he has commitment, he has execution.\u201d\n\nIs the best closer in baseball a Denver-area native?\n\nIt appears that way, although the Alydar to this Affirmed is here in St. Louis \u2014 Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal, Melancon\u2019s fellow all-star. Each reliever entered the weekend with 35 saves, the most in baseball. Melancon has blown a lone save, Rosenthal two. Their ERAs are similarly minuscule, and Melancon whips him in WHIP (walks and hits per innings pitched): 1.02 to 1.16.\n\nAs we head into late August, with the Rockies again irrelevant, it\u2019ll be worth following the Golden High golden boy, as his Pirates plunder the National League for wins.\n\nThey\u2019ve made the playoffs the past two seasons, and Pittsburgh entered Friday with 66 wins, the third-most in baseball. Alas, St. Louis has 73, so the Pirates are in second place in the National League Central, battling daily for a playoff berth, wild card or otherwise.\n\nIn the Pirates\u2019 clubhouse, before Thursday\u2019s game, I asked Melancon if there\u2019s still that little boy from Golden in his big-league persona.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, for sure \u2014 without a doubt,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cEvery day. It\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d\n\nHe grew up like you. Before \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d he was awestruck, watching the Blake Street Bombers massacre curveballs. He played on numerous youth teams, making varsity for three sports as a Golden High freshman. He was drafted in the ninth round out of the University of Arizona in 2006, and he made the bigs in 2009, playing for the Yankees and Astros and Red Sox and now the Pirates, who are good at baseball.\n\nNow, we sports fans and journalists often succumb to neatly fitted comparisons. Like, he has a big heart for his family \u2026 and his teammates! But with this said, I will say that Melancon is as fearless (here we go!) off the field (don\u2019t do it, Ben!) as he is (cover your eyes!) on the field.\n\nYes, the high-pressure closer has also literally swum with sharks \u2014 OK, he was in a protective cage \u2014 and so, they call the Pirates\u2019 bullpen the \u201cShark Tank.\u201d\n\nAnd when \u201cThunderstruck\u201d (or even \u201cLet\u2019s Get Loud\u201d) blares, \u201cIt\u2019s right where I want to be, you know?\u201d Melancon said. \u201cIt\u2019s just special. You don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Mark Melancon\u2019s output is thunderstriking", "title": "Hochman: Mark Melancon\u2019s output is thunderstriking", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/14/hochman-mark-melancons-output-is-thunderstriking/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T21:26:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T11:01:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here in St. Louis, on the road Thursday, the Pirates\u2019 closer jogs out to the Jell-O bouncy beats of J-Lo.\nIt appears that way, although the Alydar to this Affirmed is here in St. Louis \u2014 Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal, Melancon\u2019s fellow all-star.\nST.
