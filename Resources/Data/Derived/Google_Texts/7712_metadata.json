The modest delicacy of its melodies led to commissions for film scores, including the Oscar-winning \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d and \u201cBabel.\u201d His new album, \u201cCamino\u201d (Masterworks), is the sequel to \u201cRonroco.\u201d Mr. Santaolalla overdubs most instruments, nearly all of them acoustic, and once again, the music is virtually transparent. The melodies are plucked ever so lightly over accompaniments that are often skeletal counterpoint, exquisitely understated. The tunes are waltzes, lullabies, elegies, glimpses of suspense or tentative questions, and they move just far enough into the foreground to separate them from his film music. They don\u2019t overstay; the 13 tracks add up to 36 minutes. \u201cCamino\u201d is not as unworldly as \u201cRonroco\u201d was \u2014 two tracks have been heard in commercials \u2014 but the modesty remains.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlison May\n\nLOVED/DARK\n\nFolk rock guitars wash over Alison May\u2019s voice throughout her album \u201cLoved/Dark\u201d (Misery Loves Company): picked, strummed, twanged, ringing, floating, crisply acoustic or glimmering with reverb. Intricate and enveloping, they\u2019re often on the verge of inundating her gauzy, unemphatic voice \u2014 but just on the verge. The music parallels the way the narrators in her cryptic songs find themselves swallowed up in overwhelming situations, facing regrets, separations, irreparable losses and sometimes imminent death: \u201cI cannot be followed/I\u2019m going to the other side now,\u201d she sings in \u201cJon,\u201d possibly after being struck by lightning. She\u2019s a humble figure in a larger landscape \u2014 but the landscape is her creation, too, and she holds her place within it.\n\nPS I Love You\n\nFOR THOSE WHO STAY\n\nOn its third album, \u201cFor Those Who Stay\u201d (Paper Bag), PS I Love You gets blunt in a song called \u201cAdvice\u201d: \u201cYou\u2019re never gonna win/Keep trying is all you can do,\u201d Paul Saulnier sings, quavery yet certain, in a storm cloud of distortion over a Crazy Horse stomp. Futility and falling short are home turf for this two-man Canadian band. With Mr. Saulnier on guitar and Benjamin Nelson on drums, PS I Love You takes the frazzled, fuzzed-out example of indie-rockers like Dinosaur Jr., the Replacements and especially Pavement and cranks it up. Not limited by the band\u2019s lineup, Mr. Saulnier slathers on multiple guitar and vocal parts in the studio. The album starts with a hurtling apology \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m sorry I forgot about that thing that I was supposed to do/Last week\u201d \u2014 and later explores the sinking feeling of being told he can be \u201cFriends Forever\u201d or warning how easy it is to end up stuck with \u201cMore of the Same.\u201d Low expectations, high volume and melody amid the din; the combination is a throwback, but a potent one.\n\nPhoto\n\nMestre Cupij\u00f3 e Seu Ritmo\n\nSIRI\u00c1\n\nEscaped slaves in Brazil founded their own settlements, called quilombos, on the Amazon, where their music mingled with indigenous styles. Mestre Cupij\u00f3 (1936-2012) was born in the northern Brazilian state of Par\u00e1, and to steep himself in the music, he spent time living in quilombos before he started his Jazz Orquestra os Azes do Ritmo. Making music that would eventually transform local carnival traditions, he forged a big-band version of Amazonian rhythms like siri\u00e1, topping the sway and strut of samba with a crosscurrent of rhythm guitar; he also soaked up mambo and cumbia from abroad. The songs on \u201cSiri\u00e1\u201d (Analog Africa), a compilation of his local recordings, are low-fi but alive. They go bounding along with saxophones and brass and a carnival parade in the percussion. Often, the singers are extolling the pleasures of the music. They\u2019re right.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeck and Others\n\nSONG READER\n\nIt had to happen sooner or later. When Beck released his \u201cSong Reader\u201d (McSweeney\u2019s) in 2012 as a collection of sheet music, it was a high-concept coup. It was also a tease for nonmusicians, though soon enough there were performances of the songs online. Now it\u2019s time for some anointed pros. On the audio version of \u201cSong Reader\u201d (Capitol), Beck and 19 other acts perform the songs, often taking considerable liberties with the written melodies, as Beck does himself in \u201cHeaven\u2019s Ladder,\u201d rewriting both words and music into a \u201cMagical Mystery Tour\"-flavored production. Some take their cues from the vintage-style graphics of the sheet music, like Loudon Wainwright III giving \u201cDo We? We Do\u201d an old-timey bounce, Swamp Dogg making \u201cAmerica, Here\u2019s My Boy\u201d a desolate parlor song and David Johansen growling through \u201cRough on Rats\u201d with a saxophone-pumped jump-blues combo. Others make the songs an extension of their own personality, like Laura Marling staying folky and depressive in \u201cSorry,\u201d Jack White pushing the countryish \u201cI\u2019m Down\u201d into distortion, and Juanes translating \u201cDon\u2019t Act Like Your Heart Isn\u2019t Hard\u201d into Spanish-language pop. What comes through all the different voices and styles is that these songs hold some of Beck\u2019s canniest wordplay, and that his initial concept remains telling: Melodies, chords and lyrics only begin to define a song.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140809161410, "twitter": {"description": "New albums feature works by Alison May, Gustavo Santaolalla, PS I Love You, Mestre Cupij\u00f3 and Beck.", "title": "If Friends Play Your Songs, They Just May Change Your Tune", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/music/if-friends-play-your-songs-they-just-may-change-your-tune.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003039694"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "JonPareles", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/10/arts/10PLAYLIST4/10PLAYLIST4-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/music/if-friends-play-your-songs-they-just-may-change-your-tune.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003039694", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/music/if-friends-play-your-songs-they-just-may-change-your-tune.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/music", "hdl_p": "If Friends Play Your Songs, They Just May Change Your Tune", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 9, 2014", "edt": "SundayAdvance", "org": "PS I Love You (Music Group)", "keywords": "Music,Beck,Santaolalla  Gustavo,Cupijo  Mestre,PS I Love You (Music Group),May  Alison,PS I Love You,Mestre Cupijo,Seu Ritmo", "news_keywords": "Music,Beck", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jon Pareles", "SCG": "music", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "May, Alison", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JON PARELES", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "New albums feature works by Alison May, Gustavo Santaolalla, PS I Love You, Mestre Cupij\u00f3 and Beck.", "tom": "Review", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/10/arts/10PLAYLIST4/10PLAYLIST4-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/10/arts/10PLAYLIST4/10PLAYLIST4-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "New albums feature works by Alison May, Gustavo Santaolalla, PS I Love You, Mestre Cupij\u00f3 and Beck.", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Review", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/jon_pareles/index.html", "section": "Music", "modified": "2014-08-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "tag": "May, Alison", "published": "2014-08-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "10playlist", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140824030004, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/music/if-friends-play-your-songs-they-just-may-change-your-tune.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/10/arts/10PLAYLIST4/10PLAYLIST4-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "New albums feature works by Alison May, Gustavo Santaolalla, PS I Love You, Mestre Cupij\u00f3 and Beck.", "title": "If Friends Play Your Songs, They Just May Change Your Tune"}, "pdate": 20140809, "des": "Music", "articleid": 100000003039694, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "If Friends Play Your Songs, They Just May Change Your Tune", "col": "Playlist", "PST": "Review"}, "article_summary": "Not limited by the band\u2019s lineup, Mr. Saulnier slathers on multiple guitar and vocal parts in the studio.\nIt was also a tease for nonmusicians, though soon enough there were performances of the songs online.\n\u201cCamino\u201d is not as unworldly as \u201cRonroco\u201d was \u2014 two tracks have been heard in commercials \u2014 but the modesty remains.\nThe songs on \u201cSiri\u00e1\u201d (Analog Africa), a compilation of his local recordings, are low-fi but alive.\nSome take their cues from the vintage-style graphics of the sheet music, like Loudon Wainwright III giving \u201cDo We?"}
