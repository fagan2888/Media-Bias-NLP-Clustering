(Photo: Courtesy photo)\n\nRecently, former Gov. Brian Schweitzer took to the pages of Montana\u2019s major newspapers with an op-ed maligning Americans for Prosperity and other free-market advocates for opposing Medicaid expansion in our state.\n\nBut Schweitzer seems to have forgotten that while he was governor, he too adamantly opposed Medicaid expansion. In fact, as governor, Schweitzer even echoed many of our same concerns about adding 70,000 Montanans to the government\u2019s health care rolls. In particular, that plan could bankrupt our state and do little to help our most vulnerable.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Yes Magazine, then-Gov. Schweitzer admitted that expanding Medicaid would \u201crun the risk of bankrupting Montana.\u201d\n\nNow, Schweitzer is trying to have it both ways. But we have news for him: You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too. We\u2019re not exactly certain what changed his mind as the Medicaid program hasn\u2019t changed, but Schweitzer was absolutely right to be worried of Medicaid\u2019s exorbitant costs. We are, too.\n\nConsider first the sheer cost of expansion. Washington will pay for the first three years with $750 million in federal funds \u2014 but that only covers the first three years. Montana state taxpayers will be left to cover 10 percent of the additional costs every year after that. While that may not sound significant at first glance, with such an expensive program the sum quickly exceeds hundreds of millions of dollars over time.\n\nBut the $750 million from the feds isn\u2019t \u201cfree money\u201d as Schweitzer would have you believe. Federal tax dollars pay for this $750 million expansion. If we refuse to expand, our money doesn\u2019t go to other states \u2014 this money simply isn\u2019t spent and doesn't add to the already $18 trillion national debt.\n\nOther states have tried Medicaid expansion \u2014 and they\u2019re paying the price.\n\nTake Illinois, for example. State health officials originally estimated that expansion would cost state taxpayers $573 million. Yet after only one year of going online, budget officials were forced to revise their projections to $2 billion \u2014 nearly quadruple their initial estimates. Meanwhile, Arkansas\u2019s expansion has come in over budget every single month since its inception. And Ohio? On track to be $1 billion over budget by the end of this fiscal year.\n\nEverywhere you look, the result is the same: Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is costing states far more than what they originally projected. And when costs run over, the only options are to cut funding for programs like schools and roads, or raise taxes to fill the gap. Montana can\u2019t take this risk.\n\nWe forget that expansion is prescribed directly by President Barack Obama though his health care law. If that law hadn\u2019t passed, we wouldn't be talking about expanding Medicaid. In a word: expanding Medicaid is expanding Obamacare.\n\nSchweitzer can accuse us all he likes of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d Montana\u2019s state Legislature into opposing Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut by arguing that Montanans won\u2019t pay the price for this shortsighted plan, he\u2019s only trying to hoodwink you.\n\nZach Lahn is the Montana state director for Americans for Prosperity.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1C5QorD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Don't let Schweitzer hoodwink you", "og": {"site_name": "Great Falls Tribune", "description": "Don't let Schweitzer hoodwink you", "title": "Schweitzer phony on Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/opinion/guest-opinions/2015/03/11/schweitzer-phony-medicaid-expansion/70153614/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greatfallstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Don't let Schweitzer hoodwink you", "title": "Schweitzer phony on Medicaid expansion", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0c6a2abed6c99c5d0cab82f4a92df13f8c23b8aa/c=0-34-1275-1309&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreatFalls/2015/03/12/B9316540472Z.1_20150312140845_000_G72A6UCHD.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@GFTribune", "site": "@GFTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=863095595", "fb": {"app_id": 137930962930704}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a72\"", "article_summary": "Schweitzer admitted that expanding Medicaid would \u201crun the risk of bankrupting Montana.\u201dNow, Schweitzer is trying to have it both ways.\nBut Schweitzer seems to have forgotten that while he was governor, he too adamantly opposed Medicaid expansion.\nSchweitzer can accuse us all he likes of trying to \u201choodwink\u201d Montana\u2019s state Legislature into opposing Medicaid expansion.\nBrian Schweitzer took to the pages of Montana\u2019s major newspapers with an op-ed maligning Americans for Prosperity and other free-market advocates for opposing Medicaid expansion in our state.\nIn a word: expanding Medicaid is expanding Obamacare."}
