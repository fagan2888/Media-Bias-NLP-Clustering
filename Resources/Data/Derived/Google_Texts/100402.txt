Two children from La Plata County who authorities said were abducted by their mother were found Saturday night in Alto, N.M.

Kiarah Hughes, 5, and Brooklyn Hughes, 3, are both safe. Their mother, Kallisha Hughes, is being held on a La Plata County warrant for 2nd degree kidnapping, burglary and violation of a restraining order.

The family was stopped while driving through Lincoln County, New Mexico, in a 2003 gray Chevrolet Malibu, license plate Colorado 035 PCQ.

The mother, who lost her parental rights, has an extensive criminal history, is violent and is a frequent drug user, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

The father, Brandon Hughes, was arrested Friday for violating a restraining order. The children were staying with their aunt, Taylor Lucero, in Durango until he was released from jail.

According to the La Plata Sheriff’s Office, Hughes, who also goes by Kallisha Henneberger, 30, took the girls from the home at about 1:30 p.m. Saturday.

Hughes’ brother Ryan Henneberger said his sister made a mistake but she is a good person. He said he does not want to see her portrayed as a monster.

“She is a good mother,” said Henneberger, who called the The Denver Post after he saw the alert. “She is a loving mom. She’s not going to hurt her babies.”
