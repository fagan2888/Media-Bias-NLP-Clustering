Jerry Brown\u2019s desk. The bill was scaled down in order to aid with hits passage.\n\nIntroduced by Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), SB 4 is estimated to cost taxpayers anywhere between $170 to $740 million annually\u2013a figure Gov. Brown reportedlysuggests might be too expensive for his taste.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for us to lead,\u201d Sen. Lara said, according to the Sacramento Bee. He added:\n\nWe are talking about our friends, we are talking about our neighbors and our families who are denied basic health care in the richest state of this union\u2026 Ensuring that every child in California grows up healthy and with an opportunity to thrive and succeed is simply the right thing to do.\n\nAlthough Sen. Lara touts the bill as being bipartisan, it only received the vote of two Republicans, Sen. Andy Vidak (R-Hanford) and Sen. Anthony Canella (R-Ceres). Sen. Janet Nguyen (R-Garden Grove) was the only senator to abstain, according to the San Jose Mercury News.\n\nNguyen said even if the bill passes the necessary stages to become a law, it would be like providing someone with a car without an engine. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to enroll people into something they don\u2019t have access to,\u201d she reportedly said on the Senate floor.\n\nWith over 12 million members, the state\u2019e Medi-Cal program is struggling to handle the requests it\u2019s already been inundated with.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz", "article_metadata": {"description": "California Senate Approves Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "California Senate Approves Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants", "title": "California Senate Approves Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3603, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Immigrant-Health-Care-John-Moore-Getty.jpg", "height": 2700}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/02/california-senate-approves-healthcare-for-illegal-immigrants/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California Senate Approves Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants", "creator": "@AdelleNaz", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Immigrant-Health-Care-John-Moore-Getty.jpg", "title": "California Senate Approves Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "healthcare for illegals, SB 4, Sen.
