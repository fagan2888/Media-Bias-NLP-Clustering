This year's headliner is Taj Mahal.\n\nOBAMACARE: Thank you, Sun-News, for reporting that county health care costs increased 18 percent last year and 25 percent this year. Hey, Democrats, how is your AFFORDABLE health care plan working out?\n\nPOLITICS: Why have six out of nine New Mexico super delegates already pledged their support, before the results of the New Mexico primaries are known?
