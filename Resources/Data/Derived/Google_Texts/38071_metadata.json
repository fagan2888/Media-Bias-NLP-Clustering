Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: After his talk, Professor Chomsky read and answered questions from the audience. This is one of those questions.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \"What do you think about the antics of Donald Trump, in tangent to your earlier idea about American exceptionalism?\"\n\nWell, actually, I think we should recognize that the other candidates are not that different. I mean, if you take a look at\u2014just take a look at their views. You know, they tell you their views, and they\u2019re astonishing. So just to keep to Iran, a couple of weeks ago, the two front-runners\u2014they\u2019re not the front-runners any longer\u2014were Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. And they differed on Iran. Walker said we have to bomb Iran; when he gets elected, they\u2019re going to bomb Iran immediately, the day he\u2019s elected. Bush was a little\u2014you know, he\u2019s more serious: He said he\u2019s going to wait 'til the first Cabinet meeting, and then they'll bomb Iran. I mean, this is just off the spectrum of not only international opinion, but even relative sanity.\n\nThis is\u2014I think Ornstein and Mann are correct: It\u2019s a radical insurgency; it\u2019s not a political party. You can tell that even by the votes. I mean, any issue of any complexity is going to have some diversity of opinion. But when you get a unanimous vote to kill the Iranian deal or the Affordable Care Act or whatever the next thing may be, you know you\u2019re not dealing with a political party.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question why that\u2019s true. I think what\u2019s actually happened is that during the whole so-called neoliberal period, last generation, both political parties have drifted to the right. Today\u2019s Democrats are what used to be called moderate Republicans. The Republicans have just drifted off the spectrum. They\u2019re so committed to extreme wealth and power that they cannot get votes, can\u2019t get votes by presenting those positions. So what has happened is that they\u2019ve mobilized sectors of the population that have been around for a long time. It is a pretty exceptional country in many ways. One is it\u2019s extremely religious. It\u2019s one of the most extreme fundamentalist countries in the world. And by now, I suspect the majority of the base of the Republican Party is evangelical Christians, extremists, not\u2014they\u2019re a mixture, but these are the extremist ones, nativists who are afraid that, you know, \"they are taking our white Anglo-Saxon country away from us,\" people who have to have guns when they go into Starbucks because, who knows, they might get killed by an Islamic terrorist and so on. I mean, all of that is part of the country, and it goes back to colonial days. There are real roots to it. But these have not been an organized political force in the past. They are now. That\u2019s the base of the Republican Party. And you see it in the primaries. So, yeah, Trump is maybe comic relief, but it\u2019s just a\u2014it\u2019s not that different from the mainstream, which I think is more important.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Noam Chomsky, speaking at The New School this weekend here in New York City, \"On Power and Ideology.\" Professor Chomsky is institute professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he\u2019s taught for more than half a century. A world-renowned linguist and political dissident, Chomsky has written more than a hundred books; his latest, Because We Say So.\n\nFor the full transcript and video and audio of the speech, you can go to democracynow.org.
