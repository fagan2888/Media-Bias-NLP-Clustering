LA THUILE, italy — Apologizing for a gaffe on social media, Lindsey Vonn had little to celebrate after clinching her record 20th World Cup crystal globe title and surpassing Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark on Saturday.

A day earlier, Vonn posted a video of an angry outburst in which she destroyed her bindings with a hammer after a race where one ski detached.

After erasing the post from her Facebook page, Vonn spent the night drafting an apology with her Los Angeles-based agent and called Johan Eliasch, chairman of the Head group that supplies the Vail star’s equipment.

“I made a mistake and everyone does that. I am human. I had a lot of emotions yesterday and I should have just done boxing with my trainer,” Vonn said after bouncing back to finish second Saturday and wrap up the season-long downhill championship.

“I’m always usually careful with what I do and say on the social media platforms and I just didn’t really think it through,” Vonn said. “I was a little bit too emotional. It was a good lesson for me. I just have to remember that I have a lot of people looking up to me and I can’t let my emotions get the best of me.”

Nadia Fanchini of Italy won with a 0.14-second margin ahead of Vonn in a race shortened by strong wind. Italy’s Daniele Merighetti finished in third place, 0.72 behind.

With only one more downhill race this season, Vonn extended her lead to an insurmountable 173 points ahead of Larisa Yurkiw of Canada.

This is Vonn’s record eighth downhill title — adding to four overall globes plus five in super-G and three in combined.

Sweden’s Stenmark held the previous record of 19 globes established from 1975 to 1984.

Vonn also reclaimed the overall lead from Swiss rival Lara Gut, who finished 11th on Saturday. Vonn is 43 points ahead of her.
