Since 9/11, in fact, the continent has increasingly been viewed by the Pentagon as a place of problems to be remedied by military means. And year after year, as terror groups have multiplied, proxies have foundered, and allies have disappointed, the U.S. has doubled down again and again, with America\u2019s most elite troops \u2014 U.S. Special Operations forces (SOF) \u2014 leading the way.\n\nThe public face of this engagement is a yearly training exercise called Flintlock. Since 2005, it has brought together U.S. special operators and elite European and West African troops to \u201cstrengthen security institutions, promote multilateral sharing of information, and develop interoperability among the partner nations of the Trans-Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP).\u201d\n\nDirected by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sponsored by SOCAFRICA \u2014 the special operations contingent of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) \u2014 and conducted by Special Operations Command Forward-West Africa, the Flintlock exercises have sought to \u201cdevelop the capacity of and collaboration among African security forces to protect civilian populations across the Sahel region of Africa.\u201d This year, for instance, 1,300 troops representing 28 countries \u2014 including U.S. Army Green Berets \u2014 trained together in the host nation of Chad, as well as in Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Tunisia, conducting mock combat patrols and practicing counterterrorism missions.\n\nFlintlock exercises provide AFRICOM with a patina of transparency and a plethora of publicity each year as a cherry-picked group of reporters provide mostly favorable, sometimes breathless cookie-cutter coverage. (The command has, for years, refused my repeated requests to attend.) Spinning tales of tough-talking American commandos barking orders at \u201craw,\u201d \u201cpoorly equipped\u201d African troops \u201cunder the pewter sun\u201d in the \u201csuffocating heat\u201d and the \u201cfine Saharan sand\u201d on a \u201cdusty training ground\u201d in the \u201crocky badlands\u201d of West Africa, they dutifully report on one three-week U.S. special ops mission.\n\nWhat goes on the rest of the year is, however, shrouded in secrecy as the U.S. military \u201cpivots\u201d to Africa and shadowy contingents of Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets shuttle on and off the continent under the auspices of various programs. This includes Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET), low-profile missions that lay the groundwork for each year\u2019s Flintlock exercise, providing instruction in all manner of combat capabilities, from advanced marksmanship and small unit tactics to training in conducting ambushes and perfecting sniper skills.\n\nThe U.S. military says little about JCET activities in Africa or elsewhere. Special Operations Command, which oversees America\u2019s most elite forces, will not even disclose the number of JCETs carried out by American commandos on the continent. AFRICOM, for its part, refuses to reveal the locations of the missions, citing \u201coperational security reasons and host nation sensitivities.\u201d And what little information that command will divulge only raises additional questions.\n\nAccording to AFRICOM, special operators conducted \u201capproximately nine JCETs across Africa in Fiscal Year 2012\u201d and 18 in 2013. Documents obtained by TomDispatch through the Freedom of Information Act from the office of the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs indicate, however, that there were 19 JCETs in 2012 and 20 in 2013. The reports provided by the Pentagon to keep Congress informed of \u201ctraining of Special Operations forces\u201d show that, from October 2011 to October 2013 (fiscal years 2012 and 2013), there was only one month in which U.S. commandos did not conduct Joint Combined Exchange Training somewhere on the African continent. In all, according to those documents, Special Operations forces spent nearly 2,200 days in 12 countries under the JCET program alongside more than 3,800 African soldiers.\n\nAFRICOM attributes the confusion over the numbers to differing methods of accounting. However one tallies them, such missions increased last year according to figures provided by the command and they seem to be on the rise again this year. In 2014, the number of JCETs jumped to 26. By the end of July, \u201capproximately 22\u201d had already been carried out.\n\nU.S. Africa Command refuses to name the forces it\u2019s training with. All that can be said, in the words of AFRICOM spokesman Chuck Prichard, is that \u201cthere are locations where U.S. personnel are working side-by-side with African military members in close proximity to various threat groups.\u201d The documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, however, paint a vivid picture of unceasing special ops missions across Africa \u2014 many in nations with checkered human rights records.\n\nThe Company You Keep\n\nOfficially, Joint Combined Exchange Training is designed to enable U.S. special operators to \u201cpractice skills needed to conduct a variety of missions, including foreign internal defense, unconventional warfare, and counterterrorism.\u201d Authorization for the program also allows \u201cincidental-training benefits\u201d to \u201caccrue to the foreign friendly forces at no cost.\u201d\n\nIn reality, JCETs appear little different from other far more overt U.S. military overseas training efforts. \u201cThey have to be able to show that more than 50% of the benefit of this training activity goes to U.S. Special Operations forces,\u201d Linda Robinson, a senior international policy analyst at the Rand Corporation and author of One Hundred Victories: Special Ops and the Future of American Warfare, says of the missions. \u201cNow, of course, the other 49% can be for the benefit of the partner and this certainly is a very strong rationale for doing it \u2014 ultimately that is the overarching goal of these activities.\u201d\n\nAfrica Command doesn\u2019t, in fact, shy away from touting the benefits to foreign troops. \u201cJCETs improve the capabilities of African forces to protect civilians from current and emerging threats. The ultimate goal is to enable African states to address security issues without the need for foreign intervention and empower regional solutions to transnational threats,\u201d according to AFRICOM\u2019s Chuck Prichard. Experts, however, question the efficacy of such training missions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unexamined assumption in policy circles that because we have, by our own estimation, the best soldiers in the world \u2014 indeed the best soldiers in all of recorded history \u2014 therefore it must follow that our soldiers have the ability to convey fighting capacity to anybody else that they deal with,\u201d says Andrew Bacevich, retired Army lieutenant colonel and author of Breach of Trust: How Americans Failed Their Soldiers and Their Country. \u201cAt root,\u201d he notes of U.S. efforts in Africa, \u201cit\u2019s probably a racist assumption that the white guys are going to be able to teach the \u2018lesser breeds\u2019 and somehow lift them up in a military sense.\u201d\n\nFrom October through November 2011, for example, Green Berets were deployed in Mali to work with 150 local troops. For 45 days, they practiced patrolling and desert warfare, as part of a JCET, according to the Pentagon documents obtained by TomDispatch. \u201cInternational principles and procedures of human rights will be integrated throughout all phases of training,\u201d reads the report. What effect it had is open to debate.\n\nThat same year, the State Department called out Mali due to \u201cseveral reports that the government or its agents committed unlawful killings\u201d as well as \u201carbitrary and/or unlawful deprivation of life.\u201d In early 2012, with the next Flintlock exercise to be held there, America\u2019s troops were already in Mali when a U.S.-trained officer overthrew the democratically elected government. Flintlock 2012 was first postponed, then finally cancelled.\n\nThe junta soon found itself being muscled aside by Islamist militants whose ranks were joined by American-trained commanders of elite army units, leading to a humanitarian catastrophe, civilian deaths, and savage atrocities at the hands of all parties to the conflict. Years later, after a U.S.-backed French and African intervention, Mali is still plagued by a seemingly interminable and increasingly brazen insurgency and remains a fragile state. \u201cIt\u2019s not some place that, by any stretch, you can say we\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d says RAND\u2019s Linda Robinson.\n\nAnd Mali was hardly an anomaly.\n\nUnder the so-called Leahy Law \u2014 named for Vermont senator Patrick Leahy \u2014 the U.S. is prohibited from providing assistance to units \u201cof the security forces of a foreign country if the secretary of state has credible information that such unit has committed a gross violation of human rights.\u201d But this hasn\u2019t stopped the U.S. from conducting JCETs alongside the military forces of African countries with genuinely dismal records in that regard.\n\nFrom October through December 2011, for example, members of an elite force of Navy SEALs and support personnel, known as Naval Special Warfare Unit 10 (NSWU-10), carried out JCET training alongside soldiers from Cameroon\u2019s elite 9th Battalion Intervention Rapid (9th BIR). That same year, the U.S. State Department noted that the \u201cmost important human rights problems in the country were security force abuses,\u201d including killings and the mistreatment of detainees and prisoners. Members of NSWU-10 nonetheless were back in the country in January and February 2012 to continue the training, this time with troops from the 8th BIR, and members of still another BIR unit that August and September. The same year, accordingto the State Department, members of various BIR units threatened, beat, shot at, and sometimes seriously injured civilians as well as policemen.\n\nIn 2013, personnel from NSWU-10 trained with troops from Cameroon\u2019s 1st BIR \u2014 three separate JCETs from January through June. That same year, according to the State Department, \u201cthere were reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings,\u201d specifically that members of \u201cthe BIR, an elite military unit\u201d were \u201cimplicated in violence against civilians.\u201d In September, for example, \u201cthree members of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) beat a man to death in a barroom altercation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Obama makes peace with Iran, U.S. forces and their trained allies are running amok in Chad, Niger and beyond", "title": "Africa is our new quagmire: Special ops, human rights abuses and the latest battlefront in our failed War on Terror", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While Obama makes peace with Iran, U.S. forces and their trained allies are running amok in Chad, Niger and beyond", "title": "Africa is our new quagmire: Special ops, human rights abuses and the latest battlefront in our failed War on Terror", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/13/africa_is_our_new_quagmire_special_ops_human_rights_abuses_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/shutterstock_286093226.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While Obama makes peace with Iran, U.S. forces and their trained allies are running amok in Chad, Niger and beyond", "title": "Africa is our new quagmire: Special ops, human rights abuses and the latest battlefront in our failed War on Terror", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/shutterstock_286093226.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nick Turse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AFRICOM, Chad, niger, TomDispatch.com, U.S. Special Operations", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fd8\"", "article_summary": "In all, according to those documents, Special Operations forces spent nearly 2,200 days in 12 countries under the JCET program alongside more than 3,800 African soldiers.\nSpecial Operations Command, which oversees America\u2019s most elite forces, will not even disclose the number of JCETs carried out by American commandos on the continent.\nAccording to AFRICOM, special operators conducted \u201capproximately nine JCETs across Africa in Fiscal Year 2012\u201d and 18 in 2013.\nU.S. Africa Command refuses to name the forces it\u2019s training with.\n\u201cJCETs improve the capabilities of African forces to protect civilians from current and emerging threats."}
