Sioux Falls, SD

Two people are arrested following a tip about drugs being sold out of a Sioux Falls home.

Earlier on Thursday, police got information that meth was being sold from the home on West 53rd Street, which is also used as an in-home day care. Authorities acted quickly because they knew more kids would be arriving at the home when school got out. Witnesses say police arrived around 2:30 p.m.

When the Sioux Falls Area Drug Task Force and child protection services arrived, they found three children under the age of 2 at the day care. Once the kids were turned over to their parents, authorities searched the home.

Jennifer Darger, 33, and Adam Darger, 32, face a number of charges including possession of controlled substance, possession of controlled substance with intent to distribute, and violation of a drug free zone.
