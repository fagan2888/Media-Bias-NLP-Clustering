Oh the schadenfreude! Twitter has been buzzing over an article at CNN that described Democrats as “nervous” with “rattling nerves” due to the train wreck known as Obamacare.

More from CNN:

Quick, can you hear it? That creaking sound from Washington is the nerves of congressional Democrats in response to the political firestorm raging around Obamacare. The botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s vital new marketplaces, coupled with insurers notifying more than a million Americans that their policies were being canceled, raised questions about the administration competence and honesty in selling and implementing President Barack Obama’s signature health care reforms.

Snickering madly! Also, duh. They are just realizing he is a dangerously incompetent pants-on-fire liar?

“Signature” legislative achievement! Double snickers. But no worries: Obama is totally reassuring them.

I lol'd RT @politico For now, Barack Obama is trying to reassure nervous Democrats that the problems with Obamacare are being ironed out. — Paul Blair (@gopaulblair) November 8, 2013

Stop it! Our sides truly can’t take any more aching.

And this Twitter user summed it all up. Rattled nerves, idjits? Perhaps you should have thought of that before.

Maybe you idiots should not have passed it just so you could see what was in it. http://t.co/rdD49ob0fx — Leon Wolf (@LeonHWolf) November 12, 2013
