Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wasted little time in letting his thoughts be known on former President Bill Clinton's Tuesday Obamacare criticism.\n\nIn an interview with OZY TV, Clinton said that President Barack Obama should \"honor the commitment the federal government made\" by letting folks keep health care plans that have been cancelled as a result of the Affordable Care Act's rollout.\n\nCruz injected some political thoughts into the equation, suggesting to Fox News Wednesday that Clinton's comments were related to wife Hillary's potential 2016 run for president.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly revealing, and it suggests perhaps that Hillary Clinton is looking to run away from President Obama and Obamacare,\" Cruz said. \"And that ought to be a signal to Democrats. This thing isn\u2019t working.\"\n\nIn his Tuesday press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney toed the line on Clinton's comments, saying Obama agreed with his words. But the administration is not relenting on its promise to fix the plagued HealthCare.gov by the end of November.\n\n\"The president has tasked his team with looking at a range of options, as he said, to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled and they can\u2019t afford a better plan, even though they\u2019d like to have a better plan,\" he said.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Sen.
