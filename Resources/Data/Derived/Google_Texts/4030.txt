Republicans have already poisoned the debate over an anti-human trafficking bill by inserting anti-abortion language into the legislation, and if Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) gets his way, the bill will contain yet another divisive provision.

As senators haggle over GOP language that bans using fines paid by traffickers to fund victims’ abortions, NOLA.com reports that Vitter aims to tack on an amendment that would end deny citizenship to the U.S.-born children of unauthorized immigrants.

Vitter’s amendment contravenes the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause, which confers citizenship on “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.” Supreme Court precedent dating to the 19th century affirms that the clause applies to the U.S.-born children of noncitizens.

“I hope my colleagues, whatever their feelings on this issue, will understand, you cannot amend the Constitution by a statute,” Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) said of Vitter’s amendment. “I thought that was in basic Senate 101.”

Vitter has defended his amendment by resorting to the right’s “anchor baby” shibboleth.
