The increase was approved by the Florida Board of Medicine a year ago and affirmed by a hearing officer in December.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent the votes were not there,\u201d said the board\u2019s legal advisor, Ed Tellechea. \u201cWe hope to bring it back next year, when it\u2019s not an election year.\u201d\n\nInaction by the Legislature means that even if the state prevails in an appeal of the rule to the courts, the price hike cannot go into effect in 2016.\n\nDoctors and companies that specialize in copying medical records have been pushing for the price increase for years. They say that federal privacy laws make it more time-consuming and costly to copy records than it used to be. Even without that complication, they say, costs have risen since the current price cap for doctors\u2019 copies was set in 1988.\n\n\u201cThe medical community is not looking to make money off this; we\u2019re looking to minimize the amount of money we lose,\u201d doctors\u2019 lobbyist Chris Nuland testified at a subcommittee hearing in January.\n\nNoting that hospitals are allowed to charge $1 a page, \u201cwe\u2019re just looking for fairness,\u201d said Alan Pillersdorf, past president of the Florida Medical Association.\n\nThe current cap on doctors\u2019 copying charges is $1 a page for the first 25 pages, and a quarter a page after that. The fee is the same whether records are kept on paper or in a computer.\n\nProponents of a higher cap for doctors\u2019 copies say the record for an average patient would have only about three dozen pages. That would make the price hike less than $10.\n\nBut opponents \u2013 including AARP and lawyers who help clients apply for disability or injury claims \u2013 say those who have the fattest files are those least able to pay the higher fee: the elderly, disabled, sick and injured.\n\nA 100-page file would cost less than half as much to copy under the current price structure as it would in the one the medical board proposed.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The Florida Legislature has killed a measure that would let doctors increase what they charge patients for copies of medical records to $1 a page.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/lawmakers-wont-consider-medical-record-charge-increase", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201406/medical_records_photo_from_Barry_Gutierrez_of_NPR.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Legislature has killed a measure that would let doctors increase what they charge patients for copies of medical records to $1 a page.", "title": "Lawmakers Won't Consider Medical Record Charge Increase"}, "story_id": 467783618, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Carol Gentry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Lawmakers Won&#039;t Consider Medical Record Charge Increase"}, "nid": 13715, "datePublished": "2016-02-23", "keywords": "copies of medical records, price transparency, Florida Legislature, Florida Legislature 2016", "wordCount": 425, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Florida Legislature has killed a measure that would let doctors increase what they charge patients for copies of medical records to $1 a page.\nDoctors and companies that specialize in copying medical records have been pushing for the price increase for years.\nNoting that hospitals are allowed to charge $1 a page, \u201cwe\u2019re just looking for fairness,\u201d said Alan Pillersdorf, past president of the Florida Medical Association.\nA 100-page file would cost less than half as much to copy under the current price structure as it would in the one the medical board proposed.\nEven without that complication, they say, costs have risen since the current price cap for doctors\u2019 copies was set in 1988."}
