Scott Walker on broadcast television in Wisconsin, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis of advertising buys around the state.\n\nThat\u2019s a surprising state of affairs \u2014 and it seems unlikely to endure this fall.\n\nBut the competitiveness of the ad wars in recent months is a big change from the 2012 recall campaign, when Walker thoroughly dominated the airwaves, outspending his opponents on TV by roughly 2 to 1.\n\n\u201cIn the recall, (Walker) had an advantage in paid media that one rarely sees in competitive campaigns,\u201d says ad expert Ken Goldstein, a University of San Francisco professor and former head of CMAG, a company that tracks political advertising. \u201cThis year, he\u2019s not going to massively out-advertise the other side. It\u2019s going to be a much more competitive place when it comes to the air wars.\u201d\n\nPolls show that Walker is locked in a tight re-election fight with Democratic challenger Mary Burke after winning his first two races for governor by six points in 2010 and seven points in 2012.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign has spent just under $2.1 million in the state\u2019s five principal television markets from the start of June through Sept. 9, according to a review of public records at 19 local TV stations. Those records are filed with the Federal Communications Commission and available online.\n\nBurke has spent just under $1.6 million.\n\nBut aiding Burke\u2019s cause has been an anti-Walker group heavily funded by organized labor, the Greater Wisconsin Committee, which has spent just under $1 million since it begain airing ads last month.\n\nSo while Walker has spent more than Burke since early summer, he has been modestly outspent by the combined forces of Burke and the Greater Wisconsin Committee.\n\nThe Democrats have the spending edge since June in two major TV markets \u2014 Milwaukee and Green Bay \u2014 and two much smaller ones: Wausau/Rhinelander and La Crosse/Eau Claire.\n\nOnly in the heavily Democratic Madison market does Walker have a spending advantage in recent months, due largely to the fact that Democrats have spent almost nothing on what is generally regarded as home turf for them.\n\nThe rest of the state is covered by two Minnesota TV markets -- the Twin Cities and Duluth -- where Wisconsin candidates typically don\u2019t run broadcast ads because they end up paying to reach mostly out-of-state voters. But Republicans have aired cable ads in those markets.\n\nNone of this means Walker will be outgunned in the ad wars this year.\n\nRepublicans had a big spending advantage early in the year. In Last February and March, the Republican Governors Association spent more than $1 million on broadcast and cable ads attacking Burke, according to sources in both parties.\n\nFurther, Walker is stepping up his own ad buys, records show. And the RGA is just now plunging back into the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race. The group has reserved around $1 million in airtime on broadcast stations around the state during September and October. Those ads have only just started to run.\n\nAll these figures on broadcast ads do not reflect what the campaigns are spending on other forms of advertising \u2014 cable TV, radio, mail and digital. But broadcast TV remains the single biggest weapon that campaigns wield in getting their message to voters.\n\nAnd that battle is shaping up to be far less lopsided than it was in 2012, when the governor\u2019s campaign was fueled by millions of dollars in uncapped contributions, permitted in a recall race under Wisconsin law but not in other campaigns.\n\nWhat effect if any is political advertising having in this race so far?\n\nPublic opinion about Walker in Wisconsin is so polarized and entrenched that there are relatively few persuadable voters who might be swayed by television ads.\n\n\u201cHow many undecided voters could there be left in the state of Wisconsin?\u201d asks Goldstein, who spent many years as a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nBut the biggest story may be how Burke has weathered the air wars. The Democratic challenger, a little-known figure without much political history, withstood an early wave of GOP ads designed to drive up her \u201cnegatives.\u201d In polling by Marquette Law School, Burke actually closed the gap with Walker after that early GOP advertising blitz, and before Burke began running her own ads at significant levels this summer. In effect, Burke survived a very dangerous phase in the campaign, and has been battling Walker since then on a much more even footing on television.\n\nFollow Craig Gilbert on Twitter @WisVoter\n\n***\n\nGraphic: TV ad spending in governor's race", "article_metadata": {"title": "In a big change from 2012, Democrats outspent Walker on broadcast TV this summer", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/275054291.html", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/antiwalker_cronies_ad.jpg", "height": 413}, "type": "article", "description": "Aiding Mary Burke\u2019s cause has been the Greater Wisconsin Committee, an anti-Walker group heavily funded by organized labor.", "title": "Democrats outspent Walker on TV this summer"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/antiwalker_cronies_ad.jpg", "description": "Aiding Mary Burke\u2019s cause has been the Greater Wisconsin Committee, an anti-Walker group heavily funded by organized labor.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "In a big change from 2012, Democrats outspent Walker on broadcast TV this summer"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But broadcast TV remains the single biggest weapon that campaigns wield in getting their message to voters.\nScott Walker on broadcast television in Wisconsin, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis of advertising buys around the state.\nAll these figures on broadcast ads do not reflect what the campaigns are spending on other forms of advertising \u2014 cable TV, radio, mail and digital.\nSo while Walker has spent more than Burke since early summer, he has been modestly outspent by the combined forces of Burke and the Greater Wisconsin Committee.\nThe group has reserved around $1 million in airtime on broadcast stations around the state during September and October."}
