Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and a panel of experts discussed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) at the event he sponsored with the Maryland Federation of Chapters of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE).\n\nLike other members of the regional congressional delegation, Van Hollen holds the annual forum during Open Season, the period when people can change health-care plans. This year it runs through Dec. 9.\n\nUnlike active federal employees, retirees have not had their income cut by furloughs or limited by the three-year pay freeze. Nor do the seniors face having to contribute more toward their retirement benefits, a development that could emerge for current workers from the congressional conference committee trying to resolve differences in budgets approved by the Senate and the House.\n\nYet, the retirees feel a kinship with their colleagues still on the job. They reject proposals for additional hits on the pocketbooks of workers.\n\nIn fact, the first question from the audience was about potential congressional budget action that could negatively affect the federal workforce. Van Hollen criticized a Republican proposal that would require active workers to pay 5 percent more of salary over five years toward their retirement benefits.\n\nThis \u201ceffectively would be a pay cut,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it would mean for those current federal employees more comes out of their paycheck to go to their federal retirement without an increase in their overall federal retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans approved a 5 percent increase last year. Van Hollen said it \u201cremains very much a part of my Republican colleagues\u2019 proposal.\u201d Not mentioned was the Obama administration\u2019s plan to hike the employee contribution by 1.2 percent of salary over three years.\n\nThe good news for retirees: Van Hollen told them he knows of \u201cno current proposal out there for budget cutting that would affect retired federal employees.\u201d\n\nThere was more good news.\n\n\u201cSo many people are still concerned that the Affordable Care Act is going to affect their benefits,\u201d said David Snell, the NARFE\u2019s director of retirement benefit services and a panelist at the forum. \u201cOf course, it does not.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s always been the case. But with all the talk lately about Obamacare\u2019s big problems, including reports of millions losing their insurance plans, it\u2019s not surprising that some people might wonder.\n\nJim Hathaway, who retired from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency after 37 years of service, said his main concern was the impact of the law on his health insurance. He was glad to learn there is none, \u201cbecause I\u2019m satisfied with my health care.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen said the Affordable Care Act strengthens the FEHBP by requiring health plans to provide coverage for young adults up to age 26 and preventive care such as immunizations.\n\nAt the top of the agenda for many retirees is the cost of insurance, Snell and another panelist, Walt Francis, chief author of Checkbook\u2019s annual \u201cGuide to Health Plans for Federal Employees,\u201d said after the forum.\n\nThe senior citizens also want to \u201cfind out if there is something they don\u2019t know,\u201d Francis said.\n\nJulian Abbott fits into that category.\n\nThe 80-year-old Social Security Administration annuitant from Silver Spring visited displays where health insurance vendors provided information about their plans. Abbott, cane in hand, attended the forum to see if \u201cI could find something better than what I have.\u201d Like others, he also complained about \u201ca lot of politicians going after federal employees and retirees.\u201d\n\nBut he left pleased, after hearing that the FEHBP seems safe, for now, from political interference.\n\nDespite assurances, the political climate leads to a certain uneasiness among federal retirees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always a target, especially from a certain party we won\u2019t name,\u201d said Klara Vida, who at age 63 is a young retiree from the surgeon general\u2019s office. She realizes there will have to be sacrifices in the form of budget cuts and increased taxes, but it can\u2019t always be \u201con the backs of feds,\u201d she said.\n\nFrances Rutt, the 85-year-old wife of a retired Federal Aviation Administration employee, wasn\u2019t shy about naming names. Congress, she said, is a dysfunctional mess.\n\nIf the tea party had its way, she added, \u201cthey\u2019d throw us all into the Potomac.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @JoeDavidsonWP\n\nPrevious columns by Joe Davidson are available at wapo.st/JoeDavidson.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "federal employees, federal diary, Joe Davidson, federal retirees, federal annutants, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, Open Season, National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, NARFE, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Federal retirees at health forum have questions about cost of health care and impact of Obamacare.", "title": "Federal retirees glad to hear Obamacare doesn\u2019t hurt, but strengthens their health insurance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/fed-retirees-glad-to-hear-obamacare-doesnt-hurt-but-strengthens-their-health-insurance/2013/11/18/93ea3126-5086-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Federal retirees at health forum have questions about cost of health care and impact of Obamacare.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/fed-retirees-glad-to-hear-obamacare-doesnt-hurt-but-strengthens-their-health-insurance/2013/11/18/93ea3126-5086-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "federal employees, federal diary, Joe Davidson, federal retirees, federal annutants, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, Open Season, National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, NARFE, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "93ea3126-5086-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaebc\"", "article_summary": "Unlike active federal employees, retirees have not had their income cut by furloughs or limited by the three-year pay freeze.\nand a panel of experts discussed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) at the event he sponsored with the Maryland Federation of Chapters of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE).\nThey are federal retirees, like the seniors attending a health benefits forum Monday at the Holiday Park Senior Center in Wheaton.\nThe 80-year-old Social Security Administration annuitant from Silver Spring visited displays where health insurance vendors provided information about their plans.\nFrances Rutt, the 85-year-old wife of a retired Federal Aviation Administration employee, wasn\u2019t shy about naming names."}
