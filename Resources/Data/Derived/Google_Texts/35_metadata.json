Ted Cruz roused a crowd of tea party supporters with stories of his journey to the United States and his call for constitutional conservatism.\n\nRafael Cruz, pastor of Purifying Fire Ministries in suburban Dallas, received multiple standing ovations throughout his speech, delivered at a We the People rally organized by the Nashville Tea Party at the Millennium Maxwell House Hotel on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Cuban native spent much of his lecture analyzing the merits of Declaration of Independence and accusing the federal government of straying from it. He also said how his beliefs are inspired by the same wellsprings as his son, the Texas senator who has enthused some conservatives enough to call on him to run for president.\n\n\"That passion has been like fire in him, and let me tell you, that fire has been as alive 32 years ago as it is today,\" Cruz said. \"That's why I know he's not going to compromise in Washington.\"\n\nCruz threaded his life story \u2014 one that has him fleeing Cuba to come to school in Texas and establishing himself as a self-made businessman \u2014 with his belief that adhering solely to the country's founding documents was key to its success. He accused established politicians of telling \"lie after lie\" instead of enacting the policies they called for while running for office.\n\nAt times, he condemned the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter, comparing them to the authoritarian and communist regime he left behind.\n\nThroughout the speech, he breezed though a flurry of conservative assertions questioned by some even within the Republican Party \u2014 a call to end the federal education department, an accusation that death panels are part of the Affordable Care Act and the belief that a right to bear arms is intertwined with a right to life.\n\nThe pastor's message was one that spoke loud and clear to Brentwood resident Janice Murphree. She said Cruz put into words the feelings of many tea party conservatives in the region.\n\n\"He's able to speak the truth,\" she said.\n\nThe rally also served as a campaign event for Nashville-area candidates wanting to ally themselves with Cruz and tea party conservatives. U.S. Senate candidate Joe Carr, a Tennessee state representative, spoke before Cruz did, calling on Tennessee voters to take on the established leaders in Congress.\n\nEven if it takes one man, he said he would fight business-oriented Republican leaders \"who ignored the American worker or the needs of you and I when it comes to 'We the People,'\" he said.\n\nReach Brian Wilson at 615-726-5970 or on Twitter @brianwilson17.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2014/07/19/ted-cruzs-father-sparks-revival-spirit-tea-party-rally/12890305/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Pastor Rafael Cruz spoke at a \"We the People\" rally organized by the Nashville Tea Party.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Pastor Rafael Cruz spoke at a \"We the People\" rally organized by the Nashville Tea Party.", "title": "Ted Cruz's father sparks revival spirit during tea party rally", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2014/07/19/ted-cruzs-father-sparks-revival-spirit-tea-party-rally/12890305/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pastor Rafael Cruz spoke at a \"We the People\" rally organized by the Nashville Tea Party.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1ee02072a46246bb17fbccadcdccd9d509e5646/c=718-0-3162-2444&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz's father sparks revival spirit during tea party rally", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Ted Cruz", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Ted Cruz", "title": "Ted Cruz's father sparks revival spirit during tea party rally", "author": "Brian Wilson", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a215296a9f1bf9956d0ea4c6f9b6eda112df463/c=1023-0-2856-2444/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/663de5ba573cb6f3c7493a64012b5b7f8874cd8c/c=718-0-3162-2444/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad58f20761aafb0165ab7d05f483ab33e51492c2/c=310-0-3569-2444/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a2b4564693be04911ed7c17514a54603b8c8697f/c=0-131-3879-2313&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-19T23:56:00.007000-05:00", "shorthed": "Cruz's father sparks revival spirit", "articleid": 12890305, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24e7774fd70a4b9e9718f961e5b9931188e9ab25/c=0-131-3879-2313/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79ae67debb4fe9e361698110c0cf25d06489b729/c=1252-0-2627-2444/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/20/nas-teapartyrally001.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd800e\"", "article_summary": "The rally also served as a campaign event for Nashville-area candidates wanting to ally themselves with Cruz and tea party conservatives.\nShe said Cruz put into words the feelings of many tea party conservatives in the region.\n(Photo: John Partipilo / The Tennessean)Buy PhotoThe father of conservative firebrand U.S. Sen.
