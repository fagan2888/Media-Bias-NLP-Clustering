One running gag had to do with the typical child\u2019s response to accountability for errors and mischief.\n\nKeane would draw a ghostlike figure running through a scene, behaving badly with a manic sort of glee while the mother demanded to know who had broken the lamp, created a mess in the living room, or let the dog out. Keane gave the ghost character the name of the inevitable response from the children \u2013 Ida Know.\n\nWelcome to the Ida Know administration.\n\nRELATED: SCANDALS THREATEN TO DERAIL OBAMA'S AGENDA\n\nFive months ago, I wrote that the Barack Obama administration\u2019s scandals had eroded the argument for activist, large-scale government. Three scandals in particular undermined the \u201cgovernment is more competent\u201d claim.\n\nWhen news of the IRS scandal broke, the White House claimed it knew nothing about the practice of targeting conservative groups for greater tax-exemption scrutiny \u2013 even though President Obama\u2019s own White House Counsel and his Chief of Staff had been briefed on the problem more than a month before the Inspector General report exposing the practice became public.\n\nJay Carney was left to argue that neither of these officials, whose core duty is to keep the President abreast of significant legal and political issues, ever got around to telling him about the politicization of the IRS at the expense of the President\u2019s political opponents.\n\nOn the heels of that scandal came the news that the Department of Justice had named a Fox News reporter as a potential suspect in an espionage case in order to tap his communications. Attorney General Eric Holder signed off on that claim personally. Yet when Congress demanded to know why he did so and how many other taps on reporters he had approved, Holder issued so many Ida Knows that the Washington Free Beacon compiled them into an 88-second YouTube video, below.\n\nA month earlier, State Department whistleblowers exposed a number of false claims made by the White House about the Benghazi terrorist attack that left four Americans dead, leading Obama administration officials to tell CBS\u2019 Sharyl Attkisson that the problem wasn\u2019t dishonesty, but that \u201cit\u2019s actually closer to us being idiots.\u201d These incidents, while embarrassing, had avenues on which to spread the blame--whether on Congress, the media, low-level bureaucrats, or anyone else they can find.\n\nRELATED: WHY THE REVILED TEA PARTY WAS RIGHT ABOUT OBAMACARE\n\nThe collapse of the Obamacare project over the first three weeks offers no such pathways away from responsibility. Obama and his team demanded that Congress pass the Affordable Care Act so that they could impose their own ideas of central-planning reform on the health-care industry, which makes up a sixth of the American economy.\n\nIt passed with no Republican votes, and thanks to its tax provisions, provides most of its own revenue streams. The Department of Health and Human Services has had 42 months to prepare for the rollout of the web exchange, the critical tool that would allow people to purchase mandated insurance policies under government supervision.\n\nIn short, the ACA was the Obama administration\u2019s own bid to prove that activist, large-scale government was superior in innovation and competency. Instead, it has become a signature example of the lack of accountability, incompetence, and rank dishonesty that activist, large-scale government creates and protects. And that was just on performance. Despite the 42 months lead time and the outlay of $400 million, the web portal failed immediately, and two successive weekends of repair couldn\u2019t make it work.\n\nWhen the media demanded to know what happened, the White House responded with a battalion of Ida Knows. How many people had succeeded in actually purchasing insurance through the federal exchange? Ida Know, White House sources told the Associated Press this past weekend when trying to brag about having 476,000 user accounts set up in the portal. Did insurers actually get their data and have them enrolled? Ida Know. When will the system actually work? Ida Know, OMB Director Sylvia Burwell told Bloomberg News.\n\nRELATED: JON STEWART MAKES MINCEMEAT OF SEBELIUS OVER OBAMACARE\n\nIf this wasn\u2019t enough to undermine confidence in government operations, the personal responses from President Obama and Kathleen Sebelius settled the matter. Obama gave a strange pep rally in the Rose Garden, surrounded by thirteen people who purportedly benefited from the ACA, only to discover later that only one of them actually bought insurance through the exchange.\n\nObama declared, \u201cNobody\u2019s madder than me\u201d about the system failures, but offered no explanation of what went wrong. Instead, he started hawking the toll-free phone number of the Healthcare.gov center and claimed that people could buy insurance through that option, which callers soon discovered wasn\u2019t true. Not once \u2013 not once \u2013 did Obama promise accountability for the failure of the $400 million project, or even mention accountability.\n\nSebelius followed this up with a series of claims that strained credulity \u2013 even among Obama\u2019s allies. Sebelius told CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta that Obama didn\u2019t know of any problems with the web portal prior to its launch \u2013 even though Obama was fighting a bruising battle with Republicans over the program and the potential delay of the individual mandate. She further implied that she had no idea of the disaster to come, either. However, the Washington Post reported on Monday that the system failed a light-load test days before the website launch, and Reuters reported in August that the system testing was inadequate.\n\nAs Ron Fournier wrote in disgust at National Journal, Sebelius\u2019 claim of ignorance is \u201ceither a lie \u2026 or it reveals an unfathomable lack of oversight.\u201d Even former Obama administration press secretary Robert Gibbs couldn\u2019t swallow that spin, telling Willie Geist on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that \u201cthe reason it defies belief, Willie, is that it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 7 PEOPLE WHO COULD DETERMINE OBAMACARE'S FATE\n\nIn a deliciously ironic twist, Obama and Sebelius conducted the final coup de grace to the big-government approach. Both of them promised a \u201ctech surge\u201d to make the website work in a matter of weeks \u2013 by private-sector experts. \u201cOur team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve healthcare.gov,\u201d HHS declared in a statement posted over the weekend. \u201cExperts from some of America's top private-sector tech companies,\u201d Obama told the nation in his Rose Garden pep rally, are \u201creaching out \u2026 offering to send help.\u201d\n\nIn other words, how does the government fix a disaster it created all on its own? Ida Know. The \u201cbest and brightest\u201d don\u2019t work in government but in the private sector, where the real expertise in online commerce and risk-pool management exists.\n\nThat\u2019s where health insurance and health-care reform should have been left in the first place. Instead, we have this instructive spectacle to remind us why Ronald Reagan warned us that the nine most frightening words in the English language are, \u201cWe\u2019re from the government and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When I first started reading comic strips more than 40 years ago, one of the most popu", "title": "Obama and Sebelius: \"The Dog Ate My Homework\"", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/10/24/Obama-and-Sebelius-Dog-Ate-My-Homework", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Pinocchio%20puppet%20image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/10/24/Obama-and-Sebelius-Dog-Ate-My-Homework", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Pinocchio%20puppet%20image.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "When I first started reading comic strips more than 40 years ago, one of the most popu", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedc7\"", "article_summary": "Keane gave the ghost character the name of the inevitable response from the children \u2013 Ida Know.\nIda Know, White House sources told the Associated Press this past weekend when trying to brag about having 476,000 user accounts set up in the portal.\nWelcome to the Ida Know administration.\nRELATED: JON STEWART MAKES MINCEMEAT OF SEBELIUS OVER OBAMACAREIf this wasn\u2019t enough to undermine confidence in government operations, the personal responses from President Obama and Kathleen Sebelius settled the matter.\nWhen will the system actually work?"}
