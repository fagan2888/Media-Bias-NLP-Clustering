At the close of an hour-long interview, best-selling author and social critic Camille Paglia launched into an epic rant against expected 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Earlier in the exchange, she told Reason TV’s Nick Gillespie that the former secretary of state is a fraud. He asked, “How is she a fraud?” Paglia opened the dam gates and everything pent up inside her was suddenly released.

“Hillary is a mess,” she said and then turned to Clinton’s role as first lady.

“And we’re going to reward the presidency to a woman who’s enabled the depredations and exploitation of women by that cornpone husband of hers?”

Although she acknowledged that Clinton appears to be the Democratic Party’s favorite — especially among women — she said Clinton’s past conduct should place her in the least favored category among women.

“The way feminists have spoken makes us blind to Hillary’s record of trashing [women]. They were going to try to destroy Monica Lewinsky.” Paglia reminded Gillespie. “It’s a scandal! Anyone who believe in sexual harassment guidelines should have seen that the disparity of power between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was one of the most grotesque ever in the history of sex crime. He’s a sex criminal! We’re going to put that guy back in the White House? Hillary’s ridden on his coattails. This is not a woman who has her own career, who’s made her own career! The woman who failed the bar exam in Washington! The only reason she went to Arkansas and got a job in the Rose law firm was because her husband was a politician.”

Whew!
