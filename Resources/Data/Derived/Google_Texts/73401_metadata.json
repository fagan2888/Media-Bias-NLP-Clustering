I then got a confirmation page that claimed that I had not signed up on December 14th at around 745pm Chicago-time, but rather had signed up on December 15th at 1:43 in the morning. In other words, the DC ACA Web site was working on London time. More importantly, I was lucky I didn\u2019t sign up on the evening of December 15, or the site apparently would have claimed I\u2019d signed up on the 16th instead, I\u2019d have missed the December 15th deadline, and my coverage wouldn\u2019t have started until February or later.\n\nLittle did I know, it was an omen of things to come.\n\nThe site indicated that my status was \u201capproved,\u201d and that my coverage was starting on January 1, 2015, so all in all I was pretty happy.\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nSo, it\u2019s December 29th, 2014, and my ACA coverage starts this coming Thursday. I\u2019ve been checking the DC health exchange Web site diligently, waiting for an update, and it kept telling me that I was \u201capproved,\u201d that my enrollment was \u201cin progress,\u201d and that my new coverage would start \u201c1/1/2015\u201d.\n\nBut as that date is only a few days away, and I have yet to receive a bill in the mail, or online, from Blue Cross (meaning I also don\u2019t have my new insurance card), I decided to phone up the ACA folks in DC to find out whether in fact I was going to have health insurance on January 1.\n\nMy first mistake was failing to take a Valium before calling.\n\nAfter a 15 to 20 minute hold, I got a very nice woman who informed me that if I hadn\u2019t received a bill yet from Care First, I need to call them asap.\n\nSo, I called Care First, sat through another turbo-hold, and got a young woman who wasn\u2019t terribly informed about how any of this works, and then put me on hold, a lot, to go find out (which was fine). I was finally informed that yes, I did in fact need to pay for the new plan, pronto. So she walked me through how to do that.\n\n(I had a flashback to when I had major surgery in a French hospital and it was like pulling teeth trying to find out how and when they wanted me to pay \u2014 they were content discharging me with no payment for services whatsoever (we\u2019ll probably send you a bill later, the discharge-woman told me at the time). I strongly suspected that my current tale with Care First would not have such a happy ending.)\n\nWhile the Care First woman had me on hold, I decided to log in to my Blue Cross Web account, just for thrills. And I discovered that I had a $1,400 bill waiting for me \u2014 for two plans covering me concurrently next month.\n\nApparently, not only did I need to figure out how to pay for the new plan myself, I also needed to take the initiative to cancel my old Blue Cross plan, even though Blue Cross knew that I couldn\u2019t possibly want two plans for myself with the same company. (The cancellation can\u2019t be done online \u2014 you need to print out a form and then mail it in, or fax it.) It might have been nice for the ACA site, or Blue Cross itself, to tell me all of this when I signed up for the new plan.\n\nSo, I paid the new bill, cancelled auto-pay on the old bill, and printed out the cancellation form.\n\nThinking all was well, I thought of another quick question right before the woman from Care First hung up. \u201cI assume my coverage is starting January 1, right?\u201d, I asked her.\n\nIf the payment arrives on time, yes \u2014 she told me.\n\nHuh?\n\nWait, I told her, you\u2019re telling me that because Blue Cross dropped the ball and didn\u2019t process my new registration in time, even though I met the December 15th deadline for having new insurance by January 1, I might not have insurance on the 1st, even though I\u2019m canceling my old plan on that date?\n\nIt \u201cshould\u201d be processed by the 1st, she told me. It normally takes \u201c2 to 3 days,\u201d she said.\n\nBut three days puts us on January 1st itself, I said. If it doesn\u2019t process until, say, that evening, or the next day, I don\u2019t have insurance on January 1?\n\nYou\u2019ll be fine, she said, it \u201cshould\u201d process by then, repeating the same bogus assurance she\u2019d given me a moment ago.\n\nThe Care First woman just wasn\u2019t getting the math that 3 days from now means I could potentially not be covered on the 1st at all.\n\nSo, I asked to speak to a manager, and got promptly disconnected. To their credit, a manager called me back, and repeat the same line about the payment \u201cshould\u201d go through by January 1, so I had nothing to worry about.\n\nHaving just had this discussion, I asked to talk to her manager, and got the supervisor. I explained to him all that had happened, from not hearing back at all from Care First after signing up for the new coverage online, to being double charged for two plans at once, to now being told I might not have insurance come January 1 at all.\n\nInterestingly, I told the supervisor, this is what happened last year too. A lot of people weren\u2019t processed in time, and the insurers were forced to start coverage on January 1, with the proviso that so long as the payments came in by January 10, people would be covered retroactively. I asked him to do the same for me, and to his credit he did.\n\nWhy does it have to be this hard?\n\nWhy was there nothing on the DC ACA Web site telling me that I had to call Blue Cross by a certain date or I wouldn\u2019t be covered by January 1?\n\nAnd why didn\u2019t the site tell me that I had to physically cancel my old Blue Cross plan, even though my new plan was using the same subscriber number as my old plan, so Blue Cross was clearly aware of what I was doing?\n\nOf course, it remains to be seen if Blue Cross cancels my old plan in time (they say it can take ten days), or whether they\u2019re going to try to charge me for January too. So stay tuned on that one.\n\nAs I said at the start, my new ACA is basically better than my old grandfathered plan. It\u2019s cheaper, for starters. And it has an annual cap on expenditures, which is pretty nifty should I ever have any catastrophic (or not even catastrophic) medical bills. So all of that is great.\n\nBut still, there\u2019s really no excuse for Blue Cross (and Coventry, a friend tells me, who\u2019s going through the exact same thing with them as I write) not having a working process in place to fulfill these registrations in a timely and transparent manner.\n\nHad I not acted today, I could have had no plan \u2014 or potentially two plans \u2014 come January 1. And that\u2019s not right. Not everyone is as tenacious as me.
