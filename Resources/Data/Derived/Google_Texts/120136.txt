President Obama gave us a sneak peak of his upcoming agenda for 2016, his last year in the Oval Office, during an interview with GQ Magazine. His top concern? Not ISIS, foreign policy or saving Obamacare, but...gun control of course. From the Washington Times:

President Obama hopes to make gun control the top issue of his final year in office, saying Americans aren’t more violent than other people but they “have more deadly weapons to act out their rage.”



In an interview published Tuesday in GQ magazine, Mr. Obama said easy access to guns is “the only variable” between the U.S. and other developed countries.



Asked by interviewer Bill Simmons of HBO if gun control will be the “dominant” issue on his agenda next year, Mr. Obama replied, “I hope so.”

Hm, I wonder if Obama considers France a developed country.....

Best of luck, Mr. President. The American people are against you on this issue.

I'll leave you with this.
