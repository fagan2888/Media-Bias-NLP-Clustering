Justin Olson, R-Mesa, said the proposals embody the spirit of voter-approved Proposition 122, which allows the state to opt out of federal laws deemed unconstitutional by the voters or the Legislature.\n\nOlson sponsored House Bill 2643 that stops state and local governments from using financial resources to enforce and implement the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe proposal passed the same day federal officials announced that more than 200,000 Arizonans had signed up for health insurance during the just-ended open enrollment period, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.\n\nThe White House says that 11 million Americans have signed up for Obamacare.\n\nThe bill will not affect those enrolled in the program, but is designed to prevent future legislation that would establish a state exchange, Olson said. \u201cWe want to make sure that state dollars are not used to enforce the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Federalism and States\u2019 Rights Committee voted 5-3 along party lines to pass the legislation Wednesday. The bill is set to move to the House floor after a routine constitutional review.\n\nRep. Bruce Wheeler, D-Tucson, said he voted against the bill despite having his own reservations against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how anybody can question its constitutionality, its applications and its function in the state of Arizona,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, sponsored three bills preventing the state from funding executive orders and policy directives.\n\n\u201cOur president and the departments under the president have no direct authority over the states,\u201d he said.\n\nOne bill, House Bill 2368, blocks state funding for executive orders and policy directives from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nRep. Rebecca Rios, D-Phoenix, said the president has the constitutional authority to issue executive orders and Arizona would be better off sending a message of unity rather than state sovereignty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our place to pick and choose what we want to follow,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014House Bill 2058 blocks state funding for any federal rule, policy or regulation that has not been voted on by Congress or signed into law.\n\n\u2014House Bill 2055 stops state and local governments from using any resource to enforce or implement changes made to U.S. waters on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Senate public safety committee also passed a bill that prohibits state and local governments from enforcing or funding future federal laws regarding guns.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
