Never in his wildest dreams did he think these two passions would come together, but they have in a most unusual way.\n\nAfter Parker retired from the California Department of Education, the former teacher and administrator launched a private consulting business to help California schools improve their Academic Performance Index (API) scores\u2014a numeric measurement from 200 to 1,000 assigned to individual public schools based on how well\u2014or not\u2014students score on standardized tests.\n\nHis proven, theoretical technique that he calls \u201cStrategic Schooling\u201d has been in great demand by public schools in several states because it works. Parker says about 85 to 90 percent of his clients have seen significant gains in their API scores.\n\nAbout the same time he started his consulting business, Parker began riding horses and adopted two wild mustangs that he tamed. One day he realized the same methods he uses to establish a relationship and trust with his mustangs could also be used in the classroom to help students perform better on tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like training horses; you don\u2019t break them, you teach them,\u201d the 68-year-old Parker, who has worked with up to 100 K-12 schools a year, said. \u201cI didn\u2019t start out using horse training as a major avenue to fix schools, but now it\u2019s just one more thing I have in my tool kit.\u201d\n\nThe teacher-turned-horse-wrangler, who lives on his ranch in Zamora, California, with a stable of 11 horses, sat down with Indian County Today Media Network to talk about his equine-inspired teaching methods.\n\nHow does horse training play into your teaching methods?\n\nI work on relationships as much as I work on the curriculum. My approach involves three things. First, you have to get students to like you. So before I start teaching, I try to get a relationship going with kids by chatting them up about something that has nothing to do with math or language arts. I spend five or six minutes saying, \u201cSo this is your class, huh? Is that all your work on the wall? How many got up before 6:30?\u201d It\u2019s exactly the same thing I do with my mustangs. When I first get a horse in an arena, we just walk around; no reins, we just roam freely. So we\u2019re chatting each other up, too.\n\nOnce you establish trust with your students\u2014and horses\u2014what\u2019s next?\n\nThen I have to get students to do something for me so they will respect me. Unless you can get another human being to do something at your request, you don\u2019t have respect. So with kids, you get them to repeat after you, get them to learn something that\u2019s fun to do\u2014that\u2019s getting respect. \u201cI need everyone\u2019s eyes up here. Thanks! That\u2019s perfect.\u201d With horses, they\u2019ll be galloping one way and then I\u2019ll ask them to change direction, then do it again. Now I am getting respect because I am making the horse do something at my request.\n\nWhat\u2019s the third step to building a rapport with both students and horses?\n\nGet them to engage with me by giving them some voice and choice, some say in their day. Like saying to kids, \u201cI have a blue pen and a green pen. Anyone prefer me to use the green pen?\u201d With the horse, if I want him to back up and he doesn\u2019t want to do it, I\u2019ll wait, and then ask the horse again. Then I\u2019ll wait and ask again.\n\nWhat can a horse teach a teacher?\n\nThe horse is always 100 percent in the moment. They don\u2019t think about the future or the past. Their survival depends on them being in the moment. There\u2019s been some research that teachers who are more \u201cwith it\u201d and are more observant in their classroom end up having better classroom management and better results than teachers who are clueless about what is going on in their classroom.\n\nGive a specific example of a technique that works well with both horses and students.\n\nBoth horse trainers and teachers who are in the moment will reward the \u201ctry.\u201d If you\u2019re asking the horse to back up, you push on its lead rope saying, \u201cBack up for me.\u201d When the horse gives you the slightest try, then you release and pet the horse on its neck. If you notice every single little try and reward it, and ask for a little more next time, you can be backing that horse up in about 10 minutes. The basic principle is, \u201cIf you can get \u2018em to do anything, you can get \u2018em to do anything!\u201d In the classroom, I\u2019ll notice the kids who aren\u2019t with me and make eye contact or walk over to that side of the classroom. I\u2019ll notice the kids that got it and give them acknowledgement with my eyes or a little thumbs up. Bad horse trainers and bad teachers miss the try all the time.\n\nWhat has been your greatest success story so far?\n\nI would say Artesia High School. When I first started working with them, they were a 594, and after six years of averaging a 28-point gain per year, their API score was 765 in 2011. I\u2019ve also worked with schools that were ranked extremely low and are now distinguished schools.\n\nDo you ever invite teachers or students out to your ranch?\n\nI have held about 40 training events at the ranch for faculty leaders and administrators\u2014and eight annual Principals Summits. The focus of these events is training in the latest research-based strategies to accelerate the achievement of disadvantaged students in order to close the achievement gap. I always try to pull out a mustang for a 30-minute demonstration as part of each event.\n\nHow did you capture two wild mustangs?\n\nYou can get them from the Bureau of Land Management. They gather these horses and you can adopt them. I ended up with three mustangs and learned to train them by going to clinics, reading books and watching people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dennis Parker, part Cherokee, loves to teach\u2014and he is fond of horses.
