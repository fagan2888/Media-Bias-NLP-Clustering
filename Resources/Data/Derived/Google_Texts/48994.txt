Aging Gracefully: More Centenarians, With Women Leading The Trend

Usually I don’t care much about the New Year — it’s just a number, right? But this year is a little different because I’m turning 50 in 2014.

It’s not quite as bad as it seems: I still get carded when I buy wine at Whole Foods, and I’m in pretty good shape, with no chronic health problems and no major physical woes. Still, there’s no denying the significance of this half-century milestone. Fifty is, frankly, a little scary; from here on out it’s all about maintenance.

But I got a tiny blip of joy from this Canadian report that shows the number of centenarians (at least those living in Ontario) increased over 70 percent in the last 15 years. Women are leading the trend, researchers report, “making up more than 85 percent of people over 100.”

So, I face the next 50 years with some hope: At Thanksgiving, a 93-year-old relative of mine (who is now dating a 100-year-old man; they met at the 92nd Street Y in New York, apparently the meat market of the centenarian set) told me, “I’m really enjoying my 90s.”

Here’s more from the Canadian study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, via news release:
