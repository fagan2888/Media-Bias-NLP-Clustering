We live here and we care about the outcomes, so we are very pleased to have these two new agreements in place.\"\n\nThe new agreement marks the first state/tribe partnership project for Superfund cleanup and will involve cleaning up an area dubbed Chat Base 11 North, which is right next to the Catholic Forty, the Quapaw said. The project entails removing about 72,000 tons of contaminated material, the press release stated. It will be hauled to the Ottawa County repository.\n\nIt is one of two new Tar Creek cleanup projects included in the agreement with the Quapaw, the tribe said. One will be administered through the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, and another through Region 7 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Kansas City. For the second project, the tribe will partner with EPA Region 7 in cleaning up the Cherokee County Superfund site, for one.\n\nMoreover, the precedent-setting agreement will be replicated in many projects in southeastern Kansas, the Quapaw said. In all, the Tar Creek Superfund site takes up 40 square miles sprawling over parts of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from 10 to 15 years ago, when the Quapaw fought to have a voice in cleaning up the mess made by mining.\n\nRELATED: Quapaw Excluded From Tar Creek Superfund Decisions\n\nQuapaws Sue Tar Creek Polluters\n\nQuapaws File Against Tar Creek Polluters\n\nQuapaw Tribe Files Suit Against Federal Government for Alleged Land Mismanagement", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fresh off success in cleaning up the Catholic Forty, part of the Tar Creek Superfund site, the Quapaw have signed an agreement to clean up two other sections of the massive contQuapaw Tribe signs agreement to spearhead Tar Creek Superfund site cleanup in Oklahoma and Kansas.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/04/quapaw-take-lead-tar-creek-superfund-site-cleanup-oklahoma-kansas-155155", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tar_creek_superfund-epa.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Quapaw Take Lead in Tar Creek Superfund Site Cleanup in Oklahoma, Kansas"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Quapaw Take Lead in Tar Creek Superfund Site Cleanup in Oklahoma, Kansas"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/04/quapaw-take-lead-tar-creek-superfund-site-cleanup-oklahoma-kansas-155155", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-04T16:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Quapaw, Quapaw Reservation, Superfund Sites, Superfund,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Quapaw Take Lead in Tar Creek Superfund Site Cleanup in Oklahoma, Kansas"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8563\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Quapaw Excluded From Tar Creek Superfund DecisionsQuapaws Sue Tar Creek PollutersQuapaws File Against Tar Creek PollutersQuapaw Tribe Files Suit Against Federal Government for Alleged Land Mismanagement\nIn all, the Tar Creek Superfund site takes up 40 square miles sprawling over parts of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.\nThe Catholic Forty project marked the first-ever Superfund cleanup project conducted by an American Indian tribe, the Quapaw Tribe said in a media release on June 4.\nIt is one of two new Tar Creek cleanup projects included in the agreement with the Quapaw, the tribe said.\nFor the second project, the tribe will partner with EPA Region 7 in cleaning up the Cherokee County Superfund site, for one."}
