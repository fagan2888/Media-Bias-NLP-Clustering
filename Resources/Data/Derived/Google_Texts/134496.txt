I recently wrote about the great divide between South Florida and Tallahassee, and mused that moving the capital to Orlando was the only way to bridge the gap many of us here feel when it comes to policy and lawmaking in the state.

I also suggested there was a way to break Florida into two states. Many of you wrote to ask how I'd go about splitting the baby. So, continuing to muse, and as preposterous as this scheme sounds, here it goes:

First, look at a road map. Check out the squiggly line that cuts a southwest to northeast swath in the central part of the state. It's Interstate 4, and it lies completely inside Florida. The traditionally congested interstate, which intersects many of the state top tourist areas, would make a natural border between North Florida and South Florida. It starts in Daytona Beach, and ends in Tampa, bisecting the peninsula as evenly as possible.

The I-4 corridor cuts directly through some of the most populated areas of Central Florida, so as a result we would have South Orlando and North Orlando, South Tampa and North Tampa, South Daytona and North Daytona. Starting to get it?

When the west side of the interstate ends near Tampa, use State Road 60 as border out to Clearwater Beach. When it ends to the east near Daytona Beach, use State Road 400 out to the beach. Simple. Now we have boundaries for two states, geographically speaking.

We logically change the postal codes to NF and SF. So, for instance: Jacksonville, NF and Fort Lauderdale, SF. Easy enough.

The new capitals? Also easy. Tallahassee is fine where it is, since it is equidistant between Pensacola and St. Augustine. It remains the natural capital of North Florida. I'd propose West Palm Beach as the capital of South Florida, since it would be close to the population center, and not too far from either the south end of the I-4 corridor or the Florida Keys.
