Basically that's pretty much what she said,\" explained applicant Jamisha Drue.\n\nOther applicants told Diamant once inside the salon, staff directed them to a Bank of America website to open a health savings account, gave up their Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license info, then signed a document agreeing to pay, who Diamant later learned was the salon owner, $500 once they got a check card for that account.\n\n\"There's almost unlimited risk when you're providing that kind of personal financial information to somebody who's entering into a transaction with you that is bogus to begin with,\" said Sours.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Bank of America spokesman, Matthew Daily, told Diamant the bank started getting complaints Monday.\n\n\n\n\"These activities were done without our knowledge and without authorization to use the bank's name,\u201d said Daily. \u201cWe have opened up an abuse investigation, and we will cooperate fully with any law enforcement investigation.\"\n\n\n\nFor the second day in a row, no one at the beauty salon would answer Diamant\u2019s questions. Channel 2 Action News also got a tipped off to a similar operation in Covington.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the United States Department of Health and Human Services emailed Channel 2 Action News a statement saying, \u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not ask individuals or groups for any financial contribution in order to receive a grant award. The HHS Office of the Inspector General is aware of the incident.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Channel 2 Action News has confirmed state investigators and Bank of America are now looking into a possible health care scheme uncovered by a Channel 2 Action News Investigation.", "author": "EndPlay", "og": {"site_name": "WSBTV", "description": "Channel 2 Action News has confirmed state investigators and Bank of America are now looking into a possible health care scheme uncovered by a Channel 2 Action News Investigation.", "title": "State officials call mysterious health care grant a scam", "url": "http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/state-officials-call-mysterious-health-care-grant-/27310889", "image": {"altText": "Hundreds show up for to sign up for Obamacare grant_8265467", "caption": "Police are investigating after hundreds of people showed up to a strip mall and waited in the parking lot for hours to supposedly apply for a federal healthcare grant.", "title": "Hundreds show up for to sign up for Obamacare grant_8265467", "height": 90, "width": 160, "identifier": "http://media.beta.wsbtv.com/photo/2015/10/12/ObamacareGrant1_439111_ver1.0_160_90.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "video": {"height": 0, "width": 0, "thumbnailUrl": "http://media.beta.wsbtv.com/photo/2016/01/17/Police%20grow%20skeptical%20over%20federal%20healthcare%20grants_11976871_1453037106219_403036_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "content-type": "video", "title": "Police grow skeptical over federal healthcare grants"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Channel 2 Action News has confirmed state investigators and Bank of America are now looking into a possible health care scheme uncovered by a Channel 2 Action News Investigation.", "title": "State officials call mysterious health care grant a scam", "url": "http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/state-officials-call-mysterious-health-care-grant-/27310889", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.beta.wsbtv.com/photo/2015/10/12/ObamacareGrant1_439111_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@wsbtv", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Local", "article": {"section": "Local", "published_time": "2015-10-13T20:39:42+0000", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T22:11:45+0000"}, "news_keywords": "State officials call mysterious health care grant a scam", "content_id": 27310889, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb91e\"", "article_summary": "On Tuesday, Sours sized up the promise of a mysterious health care grant that's drawing more and more people to area shopping center store fronts, like one near Sylvan Road and Langford Parkway in Southwest Atlanta.\n\"I've been out of work, under a doctor's care, and I'm really having a financial hardship,\u201d applicant Mattie Brown told Diamant.\nTuesday afternoon, Bank of America spokesman, Matthew Daily, told Diamant the bank started getting complaints Monday.\nUpdated: Oct 13, 2015 - 4:39 PMChannel 2 Action News has confirmed state investigators and Bank of America are now looking into a possible health care scheme uncovered by a Channel 2 Action News Investigation.\n\"Basically, what this has every appearance of being is a scam,\" Georgia Consumer Protection Administrator John Sours told investigative reporter Aaron Diamant."}
