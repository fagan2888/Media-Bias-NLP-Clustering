Missing players during practices became a familiar sight during the regular season. And on Tuesday, as the Nuggets began summer-league preparations, history was repeating itself just a bit.

But it wasn’t as bad.

Both first-round draft pick Gary Harris and free agent Solomon Alabi missed the first day of drills in advance of Saturday’s opener in the NBA Las Vegas summer league, but neither was because of injury. Harris’ rookie contract was not yet finalized, so he was not permitted to practice. Afterward, he expressed no concern that it would be done in time for him to be on the court for Wednesday’s practice.

“I’ll be out there,” Harris said.

Alabi, a center, was held out due to FIBA not yet receiving a letter of his release from his club team in Taiwan. He expected the release to be received in time to be in uniform for the Nuggets’ summer-league opener.

The Nuggets’ summer-league team will be coached by assistants Patrick Mutombo and Noel Gillespie. They will have one more practice in town before leaving for Las Vegas.
