Here\u2019s how that\u2019s going to work.\n\nWhen you file your 2014 taxes, you'll be asked to check a box saying whether or not you had insurance. This year only, the Internal Revenue Service really won't have a way of checking if you're lying about having coverage, but remember your legal obligation to be truthful on your return.\n\nIf you didn't have insurance in 2014, you will either have to provide a valid reason why you didn't have to be covered or pay a fine.\n\n\n\nHow big is the fine?\n\nYou may have heard that the penalty for not having health insurance is only $95 for the year, but that\u2019s only for certain people. Here\u2019s the full formula. For the 2014 tax year, you\u2019ll pay the greater of these two numbers: A. 1 percent of your household income above $10,000, up to a maximum of $2,448 per person; or B. $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, up to a family maximum of $285.\n\nIn 2015 the penalty gets bigger. It\u2019s going to be 2 percent of your household income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child up to a family maximum of $975.\n\nTo spare you the trouble of doing the math, the Tax Policy Center has a calculator that will figure your penalty for you. For instance, a family of four with an income of $60,000 would pay a penalty of $285 in 2014 and $650 in 2015.\n\nWhat if I had insurance for part of the year?\n\nIf you were uninsured for less than 3 months, you won\u2019t have to pay anything. But if you were uninsured for longer, your fine will be 1/12th of the annual total for every month you didn\u2019t have coverage.\n\nHow will the government collect it?\n\nIt will be part of the income tax that you owe the government. If you are due a refund, the IRS will deduct your penalty from that.\n\nWhat if I refuse to pay?\n\nThe IRS will keep track of what you owe, and the first chance it gets it will withhold it from a future refund. But unlike with other tax obligations, it can\u2019t come after you with a lien or criminal prosecution.\n\nIs anyone excused from these fines?\n\nYes. \u201cMost people who are uninsured will qualify for an exemption, the government estimates,\u201d says Karen Pollitz, a health insurance expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThe question is, will they get it? Until you get your exemption, you can\u2019t file your taxes.\u201d\n\nWhat are the exemptions?\n\nThere's an extensive list, which you can find here. For instance, you don\u2019t have to pay the fine if:\n\nYou earned too little money to be required to file taxes. Right now, the \u201ctax filing threshold\u201d is about $10,000. If you don\u2019t file, the IRS won\u2019t collect your insurance information. (This is the only exemption you can get automatically.)\n\nThe cheapest coverage you can find, even with tax credit premium subsidies, costs more than 8 percent of your household income.\n\nYou are in jail.\n\nYou are living abroad.\n\nYou are not a legal resident of the United States.\n\n\n\nYou have some kind of hardship. The government has come up with a long list of these, including having crushing medical debt, being homeless, or being the victim of a natural disaster or domestic violence. The biggest hardship category is the people who fall into the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d because they make too little to qualify for health insurance premium subsidies but live in a state that\u2019s not expanding Medicaid to cover all low-income residents. Here\u2019s a complete list of eligible hardships.\n\nYou can claim some of these exemptions right on your tax return, but must obtain others from your state Health Insurance Marketplace. Here's a chart from the IRS giving details. You can apply for any of these exemptions right now, and probably should so you\u2019ll have them granted by the time you have to file your income taxes. Here\u2019s more information on how to do that.\n\nUpdated to clarify the process of reporting coverage to the IRS and to provide more information on obtaining exemptions.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "individual mandate, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Obamacare, tax penalty, fine, Medicare, Medicaid, income tax, Internal Revenue Service, IRS, tax refund, Health, Taxes, Family finance, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance", "Title": "Penalty for Not Having Health Insurance - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/11/penalty-for-not-having-health-insurance/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/CRO_HCR_income_tax_subsidy_09-13.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Penalty for Not Having Health Insurance - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2014-11-20T00:00Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2014-11-22T00:05Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Penalty for Not Having Health Insurance - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "individual mandate, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Obamacare, tax penalty, fine, Medicare, Medicaid, income tax, Internal Revenue Service, IRS, tax refund, Health, Taxes, Family finance, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance", "contenttag": "Family finance", "description": "If you don't have health insurance you must either get an exemption or pay a penalty.
