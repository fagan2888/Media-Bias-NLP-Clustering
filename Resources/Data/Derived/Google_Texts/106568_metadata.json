The report, put out jointly in June by the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, the DC Fiscal Policy Institute and the Maryland Center for Economic Policy, shows that inequality and poverty reign even in the region which houses the US federal government and its many contractors, and is also the home of numerous elected officials who themselves are millionaires.\n\n\u201cWhile the region is not alone in experiencing an economy that increasingly only works for some and a rising cost of living for everyone, in many ways it offers an extreme example of these trends,\u201d the report says. Numerous indices in the DC metropolitan area\u2014including income, employment, access to healthcare, and affordable housing\u2014have plummeted in the last decade.\n\nChild poverty in the DC area has increased by nearly 25 percent since the recession began, from 8.2 to 10.7 percent today. Though officially the region\u2019s poverty rate is 8.4 percent\u2014almost half the national average of 15.9\u2014the report states that the percentage jumps to 13.4 percent when considering the increased cost of living in the area.\n\nSignificantly, poverty levels have increased sharply in the District\u2019s surrounding suburbs, even doubling in some places. \u201cIt underlines that poverty exists, and it is actually in greater numbers in the suburbs than in the core of the region,\u201d stated Benjamin Moore, executive director for the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, of the findings.\n\nMore than a third of all homeowners in the Washington capitol region, comprising nearly 25 counties and cities in District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, have been determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to be \u201ccost burdened,\u201d meaning they pay more than 30 percent of all earnings on housing. The percentage jumps to more than 50 percent for all renters. In the District of Columbia, nearly one in four renters is cost burdened.\n\nCompounding the cost of housing is the difficulty many face in commuting to work. In several areas, more than 45 percent of income is spent on housing in tandem with the price of commuting daily to a job. In certain counties\u2014Fauquier, Prince George\u2019s, Spotsylvania, and Frederick\u2014the cost of living is greater than the median household income.\n\nThe report cites a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute, which determined that a family of four\u2014two adults and two children\u2014requires a yearly income of between $81,900 and $89,600 to live comfortably in the region. While this number falls into the median household income range for the Washington, DC area, the report explains that more than 25 percent of all families in the DC area make less than this required amount.\n\nThe median price of a home located near the capitol is $313,792, over twice the national figure. Though the average price of homes in the area are nearly 20 percent above their pre-2007 levels, the majority of all active home listings were for homes above $1 million. \u201cThat makes affording a home very difficult for potential first-time home buyers,\u201d the report says. In order to afford a ten percent down payment on such a house, the average home buyer would need an income of at least $85,728.\n\nThe prevalence of such high-priced homes has led to an expanding number of individuals taking out adjustable rate loans, whose interest rates increase rapidly after initial payments. Over 15 percent of homes in the DC region have been purchased with such loans, greater than the US average (10 percent). The prevalence of such loans, which contributed to the housing collapse in 2007, indicates that the so-called economic \u201crecovery\u201d has simply set the stage for another financial crisis, this time even more heavily impacting those in the region.\n\nSimilarly, the employment level of workers without college degrees fell by nine percent since 2007, while workers with college degrees saw a three percent decline regionally. The report notes that although the region has added over 200,000 high-paying jobs since the 2007, it has lost more than 110,000 positions that do not require college degrees. Despite the relative increase in higher-paying work, the glut of educated professionals moving to the region as a whole has actually increased the level of unemployment even among this group. Since 2010, the region\u2019s population has grown by more than six percent, double the national average.\n\nThough the DC region\u2019s average unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, below the national average of 6.1, it rises to 10 percent when including part-time workers and over 15 percent for those without high school educations. Workers with less than a bachelor\u2019s degree have seen their wages fall by between 5 and 13 percent.\n\nThe report found that workers making $11.89 or less saw an average drop in pay of $.71 per hour, while those higher paid\u2014more than $43.07 per hour\u2014saw an average increase of $4.11 an hour, or $8,220 a year.\n\nOn the whole, lower-paid workers in the region make 16 cents on the dollar compared to their better-paid counterparts, a rate less than the national average difference of $.22. Likewise, the report found that lower-paid workers make only 85 cents more than their peers elsewhere, despite the significantly higher cost of living in the DC area.\n\nAs the price of housing has skyrocketed, the region as a whole has seen a decline in median household income of nine percent, to $88,233. As a specific locality, the District of Columbia saw an increase in household wealth, though mostly due to increases in pay for those with higher incomes.\n\nIn terms of access to healthcare, as of 2012 over 40 percent of workers without high school diplomas aged 25 or above had no insurance. The total amount for all adults in the region is not much better, with over 31 percent, or 1.3 million working-age people, having no employer-based insurance.\n\nThe report recommends a series of tepid proposals in order to address the massive social crisis in the region, including an expansion of President Obama\u2019s healthcare \u201creform,\u201d the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Rather than improving the lot of workers in the capitol area, this counter-reform\u2014\n\nwhich mandates that an individual buy health insurance or pay a fine\u2014will work to further erode living standards across the US. Other recommendations, such as a gradual rise in the minimum wage enacted by the D.C. city council and in several other localities, would fail to seriously help in meeting the average family\u2019s cost of living.\n\nThe author also recommends:\n\nWidening social inequality in US capital\n\n[09 June 2012]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"category": "ineq-us", "ranking": 9, "date": "2014-07-15", "description": "Child poverty in the DC area has increased by nearly 25 percent since the recession began, from 8.2 to 10.7 percent today.", "language": "en", "author": "Nick Barrickman", "og": {"image": "http://www.wsws.org/img/open-graph-icon.png"}, "headline": "Metro Washington, DC among the most unequal areas in US", "keywords": "social inequality, Washington, DC, Virginia, Maryland, District of Columbia, financial crisis, housing, income, poverty, health care, Obama, Affordable Care Act", "id": "84bd46c5-848c-44f4-b1eb-a9304190127M"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2261\"", "article_summary": "Child poverty in the DC area has increased by nearly 25 percent since the recession began, from 8.2 to 10.7 percent today.\nWhile this number falls into the median household income range for the Washington, DC area, the report explains that more than 25 percent of all families in the DC area make less than this required amount.\nMetro Washington, DC among the most unequal areas in USBy Nick Barrickman15 July 2014A new report, entitled \u201cBursting the Bubble: The Challenges of Working and Living in the National Capital Area,\u201d details the massive growth of social inequality across the Washington, DC metropolitan area since the 2008 financial breakdown.\nOver 15 percent of homes in the DC region have been purchased with such loans, greater than the US average (10 percent).\nSince 2010, the region\u2019s population has grown by more than six percent, double the national average."}
