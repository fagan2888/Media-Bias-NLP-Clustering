For example, video recording of a doctor visit could be vital for reducing misconceptions and redundant questions among caregivers, families, and patients themselves. mHealthIntelligence.com spoke with Dr. Randall Porter, neurosurgeon at Barrow Neurosurgical Associates, and Lucas Felt, President of the medical video messaging company The Medical Memory, to find out how video recording benefits both the patient and provider communities.\n\nFirst, Felt explained the idea behind how The Medical Memory app \u2013 a video recording platform that shares physician conversations among patients and their families - originated and was developed over the last several years.\n\n\u201cOriginally, the idea that Dr. Porter had was based off his experience with his father,\u201d Felt stated. \u201cHis father had prostate cancer. Being a neurosurgeon, Porter knew that the importance of communication was high, but what he noticed was that his dad wasn\u2019t making sense on all the information he received from his physician. This made him think about how he talks to his patients and how well they understand the information.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. Porter looked into this further and found an overwhelming amount of research that suggested patients aren\u2019t able to recall the information that they receive in medical settings,\u201d Felt said. \u201cFrom there, he developed a system using a regular camcorder and burning it onto a mini-DVD. That was the early stages. Then he toyed with moving the videos to the cloud \u2013 instead of having to give discs out to everybody \u2013 to streamline the experience and use email to give out the videos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hardest part was workflow. It required a ton of work and explanation for the office staff. There was loss in translation as to what it was about and why it was being offered. The idea was to make the office environment accessible to their patients forever, so they can go refer back to that visit as often as need be. With cloud computing and mobile devices, we decided to embark on finding a streamlined way to bring those together. We did this with our current product today,\u201d Felt explained.\n\n\u201cFor me, the idea for The Medical Memory started in 2003 when my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer,\u201d Dr. Randall Porter mentioned and went over the lack of effective communication between his father and the team of oncologists.\n\n\u201cI noticed many patients often called back to the doctor\u2019s office to clarify and ask questions previously explained,\u201d Porter continued. \u201cI even saw kids flying in to talk to a doctor who would repeat information previously explained to the patient. While family members experienced frustration, I saw physicians also frustrated at having to repeat themselves. Offering video recording to patients solved the issue.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what strategy would best spread the adoption of The Medical Memory application across healthcare settings, Felt responded, \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to be risk- and change-averse. One thing that we\u2019ve seen is that initially when people first hear about it, they\u2019re skeptical that they\u2019re communicating poorly or that their patients misunderstand what they are told. What ends up happening \u2013 two to three weeks later \u2013 is a patient who has to call back repeatedly to ask redundant information, a patient whose comfort with understanding of their treatment options was low, or a patient who later required a repeat visit. Knowing that it\u2019s out there and that it\u2019s used in a way that enhances the things that are working will help spread adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, spreading adoption of the app is done through social media and by getting the word out,\u201d Porter positioned. \u201cWe\u2019ve been meeting with hospital administrators and providers to discuss the application. Providers should ask themselves, \u2018What\u2019s the best thing for my patients?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen asked how telemedicine services and video recording affects patient care in his practice, Dr. Porter responded, \u201cThe facts are that patients don\u2019t hear what we tell them. They listen and understand only about 10 percent of what we say. For example, as part of the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019re required to print out and distribute a note when sending patients for a test, but still I\u2019ve seen patients come back and tell me they\u2019re upset because they missed something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe video recording helps patients remember important medical information,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt also protects me legally and can help patients, family, and caregivers comply with physician recommendations. When patients can\u2019t remember a treatment plan because their diagnosis is overwhelming, the video recording helps. If, a month after an initial conversation, a patient isn\u2019t clear on their treatment or recovery, he or she can refer to the videos.\u201d\n\nDr. Randall Porter also spoke about some of the biggest benefits of video recording among the patient population.\n\n\u201cIn short, patient satisfaction and patient compliance are major benefits,\u201d Porter stated. \u201cThe family is more satisfied and more brought in to the patient\u2019s care. But it also reduces phone calls by 25 percent and cuts costs due to disparities in health literacy.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how telemedicine benefits the healthcare provider community, Porter answered, \u201cFor me, as a provider, it gives me time for other patients because I don\u2019t have to repeat myself to patients and caregivers, it protects me in a legal standing, it assists me with more difficult patients and makes my practice more efficient by reducing patient calls.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "mHealthIntelligence.com spoke with Dr. Randall Porter, neurosurgeon at Barrow Neurosurgical Associates, to find out how video recording benefits patients.", "author": "mHealthIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/news/how-telemedicine-video-recording-promotes-patient-care", "site_name": "mHealthIntelligence", "image": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/computer_3.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "How Telemedicine, Video Recording Promotes Patient Care"}, "twitter": {"description": "mHealthIntelligence.com spoke with Dr. Randall Porter, neurosurgeon at Barrow Neurosurgical Associates, to find out how video recording benefits patients.", "creator": "@mHealthIntel", "image": {"src": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/computer_3.jpg"}, "title": "How Telemedicine, Video Recording Promotes Patient Care", "site": "@mHealthIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "For example, video recording of a doctor visit could be vital for reducing misconceptions and redundant questions among caregivers, families, and patients themselves.\nWhen patients can\u2019t remember a treatment plan because their diagnosis is overwhelming, the video recording helps.\nmHealthIntelligence.com spoke with Dr. Randall Porter, neurosurgeon at Barrow Neurosurgical Associates, and Lucas Felt, President of the medical video messaging company The Medical Memory, to find out how video recording benefits both the patient and provider communities.\n\u201cI even saw kids flying in to talk to a doctor who would repeat information previously explained to the patient.\nProviders should ask themselves, \u2018What\u2019s the best thing for my patients?\u2019\u201dWhen asked how telemedicine services and video recording affects patient care in his practice, Dr. Porter responded, \u201cThe facts are that patients don\u2019t hear what we tell them."}
