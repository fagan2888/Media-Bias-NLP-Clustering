Mark Begich voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time last year, and this year he's backed the Obama agenda even more. Begich not only cast the deciding vote to pass ObamaCare, he has voted at least ten times against fixing it. He has voted for trillions in new spending and over one trillion dollars in new taxes on families and small businesses. He has empowered President Obama to shred the rule of law, from making it easier to confirm the President's activist judicial nominees to rescuing President Obama's plan for executive amnesty. And Mark Begich has doubled down on President Obama's strategy of \"leading from behind,\" preferring to take options off the table instead of offering Alaskans comprehensive strategies to defend against the national security threats facing our nation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION: I am running for the U.S. Senate for many reasons, but among the most important is to bring Alaska's values to D.C.", "og": {"url": "http://adn-pb.internal.arc2.nile.works/pb/commentary/article/dan-sullivan-many-reasons-represent-alaska-us-senate/2014/11/03/", "site_name": "Alaska Dispatch News", "description": "OPINION: I am running for the U.S. Senate for many reasons, but among the most important is to bring Alaska's values to D.C.", "title": "Dan Sullivan: Many reasons to represent Alaska in the US Senate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@alaskadispatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bb45485406c9d670397d6aa46b9c295a"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/akdispatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d9e\"", "article_summary": "Mark Begich voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time last year, and this year he's backed the Obama agenda even more.\nHe has empowered President Obama to shred the rule of law, from making it easier to confirm the President's activist judicial nominees to rescuing President Obama's plan for executive amnesty.\nSenator who has been a rubber stamp for this failed Obama agenda and helped lead our state and our country down the wrong path.\nBegich not only cast the deciding vote to pass ObamaCare, he has voted at least ten times against fixing it.\nAnd Mark Begich has doubled down on President Obama's strategy of \"leading from behind,\" preferring to take options off the table instead of offering Alaskans comprehensive strategies to defend against the national security threats facing our nation."}
