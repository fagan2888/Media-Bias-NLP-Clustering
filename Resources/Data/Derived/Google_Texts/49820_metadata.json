Lori Robertson of FactCheck.org breaks down the misleading claims. VPC\n\nHillary Clinton speaks during the Nov. 14, 2015, Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Rodney White, The Des Moines Register)\n\nThe three Democratic presidential candidates faced off on a Saturday night and made several inaccurate claims.\n\n\u2022 Former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley said that in President Reagan\u2019s first term, the highest marginal income tax rate was 70%. But Reagan signed a bill in his first year dropping that to 50%, and it dropped again to 28% in his second term.\n\n\u2022 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that the U.S. \u201chas more income and wealth inequality than any major country on earth.\u201d But Israel, Brazil and Chile have both greater income and wealth inequality, and more countries beat the U.S. in one of the measures.\n\n\u2022 Former secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrongly said that wages \u201chaven\u2019t risen since the turn of the last century.\u201d Real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file workers rose 7.2% since 1999.\n\n\u2022 Sanders repeated his talking point about billionaires paying \u201can effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.\u201d That may be the case for some in those professions, once we factor in payroll taxes, but it\u2019s not accurate for all.\n\n\u2022 When Clinton cited Princeton economist Alan Krueger\u2019s support for her minimum wage proposal, O\u2019Malley called him a Wall Street economist. He\u2019s not.\n\n\u2022 O\u2019Malley boasted that Maryland was \u201cthe only state\u201d to freeze college tuition four years in a row. This year, Maine did so as well.\n\nClinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley met at Drake University in Iowa for the debate, which was hosted by CBS News, KCCI-TV in Des Moines and the Des Moines Register.\n\nO\u2019Malley on Top Tax Rate Under Reagan\n\nO\u2019Malley said that in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term, \u201cthe highest marginal [income tax] rate was 70%.\u201d That was true only briefly. In Reagan\u2019s first year in office, he signed a bill reducing the top rate to 50%. And in his second term, he reduced it again, to 28%.\n\nO\u2019Malley cited the top marginal tax rate during the debate to make the point that upper-income taxpayers should be paying more, and historically have.\n\nO\u2019Malley: And may I point out that under Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term, the highest marginal rate was 70%. And in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy, millionaire and billionaire category, a great number of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for America\u2019s middle class.\n\nAs a matter of history, the top marginal tax rate of 70% was established in 1964, when Congress passed a tax cutbacked by President John F. Kennedy. In the decades before that, the top rate was much higher \u2014 hovering around 90%.\n\nSo 70% was the top rate when Reagan took office in January 1981. Eight months after taking office, Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which cut the highest marginal tax rate to 50%.\n\nIn his second term, Reagan signed a bill in 1986 that lowered the top marginal income tax rate to 28%.\n\nBernie Sanders makes a point during the Nov. 14, 2015, Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Rodney White, The Des Moines Register)\n\nSanders Off on Inequality and Poverty\n\nSanders continued to peddle some false claims about U.S. inequality and child poverty:\n\nSanders: This country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on earth. \u2026 We have the highest rate of childhood poverty. \u2026\n\nRegarding income inequality, we noted back in May that World Bank statistics list at least 41 countries with greater income inequality than the U.S. \u2014 including Israel, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina.\n\nAnd as for wealth inequality, the share of wealth held by the top 1% in the U.S. puts it in 11th place among 37 nations listed in the 2015 edition of the Global Wealth Databook. The top 1% in Russia, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, China, Czech Republic and Israel each hold a greater share of their nation\u2019s wealth, according to that publication.\n\nFinally, the rate of child poverty is far worse in many other countries, including several with industrialized economies. The campaign told us the senator was referring to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but that report ranks the U.S. seventh in \u201crelative childhood poverty\u201d among the 38 countries listed.\n\nTurkey, Israel, Mexico, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria all had higher rates of child poverty than the U.S., in the OECD\u2019s ranking.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that \u201crelative poverty\u201d is a measure of household disposable income relative to others in that country.\n\nHillary Clinton speaks during the Nov. 14, 2015, Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Rodney White, The Des Moines Register)\n\nClinton Wrong on Wages\n\nClinton erred when she said real wages haven\u2019t risen in nearly 15 years.\n\nClinton: [W]ages adjusted for inflation haven\u2019t risen since the turn of the last century.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file workers were 7.2% higher in September than they were in December 1999.\n\nFurthermore, real weekly wages have jumped 2.3% in the most recent 12 months alone.\n\nSanders on Truck Drivers\u2019 Tax Rates\n\nSanders repeated one of his campaign trail talking points: \u201cBut we are going to end the absurdity, as Warren Buffet often remind us \u2026 that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers.\u201d That\u2019s the case for some in those professions \u2014 compared with billionaires who earn their money through investments \u2014 but it\u2019s not accurate for all. In fact, a truck driver would have to earn more than the median salary to pay a higher effective rate.\n\nWe previously ran the calculations for several different hypothetical nurses and truck drivers (and firefighters and police officers, who have also been part of this Sanders claim), comparing total effective tax rates, including payroll taxes, to what an investment fund manager would pay if only paying capital gains tax rates on earnings.\n\nThe billionaire fund manager would pay 23.8% \u2014 the top capital gains rate for income above $413,200 for individuals \u2014 and a 3.8% Medicare surcharge tax on investment income for those earning more than $200,000. A truck driver earning the median income for the profession ($39,520) wouldn\u2019t pay a higher rate then the fund manager\u2019s 23.8%. But if that truck driver earned a higher salary \u2014 such as the average pay in Peabody, Massachusetts ($57,250) \u2014 and was single with no dependents, he or she would pay an effective tax rate of 26%, higher than the fund manager. If that truck driver had one dependent child, however, the rate would drop to 21%.\n\nAs for nurses, the median salary is much higher \u2014 $66,640. A single nurse with no dependents would have a 28% effective tax rate with that salary. But once we add a dependent child, or a nonworking spouse, or both, the nurse\u2019s rate sinks below that of the wealthy fund manager.\n\nIf the billionaire fund managers\u2019 earnings were taxed at regular income tax rates, he or she would pay a higher rate. Most marginal income tax rates are higher than capital gains rates, with individual income between about $37,000 and $90,000 at the 25% rate for 2015. The top income tax rate is 39.6%, which starts after income surpasses $413,200.\n\nMartin O'Malley speaks during the second Democratic debate on Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Rodney White, The Des Moines Register)\n\nKrueger Not a Wall Street Economist\n\nO\u2019Malley lumped Princeton economist Alan Krueger in with what he called \u201ceconomists on Wall Street.\u201d Krueger is not a Wall Street economist.\n\nO\u2019Malley made his remarks when he had a disagreement with Clinton over how much to raise the minimum wage. O\u2019Malley supports raising it to $15 per hour. Clinton has proposed $12 per hour, and she cited Princeton economist Alan Krueger\u2019s support for her proposal and concern for increasing the minimum to $15 per hour.\n\nO\u2019Malley: I think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on Wall Street \u2026 Clinton: He\u2019s not Wall Street. O\u2019Malley: \u2026 And start taking advice \u2026 Clinton: That\u2019s not fair. He\u2019s a progressive economist.\n\nO\u2019Malley is wrong about Krueger\u2019s background. It is entirely in academia and education.\n\nKrueger graduated with a doctorate in economics from Harvard University in 1987. \u201cSince 1987 he has held a joint appointment in the Economics Department andWoodrow Wilson School at Princeton University,\u201d according to his biography on the university website.\n\nKrueger also has held top positions in government, including chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and chief economist at the Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton. His full curriculum vitae can be found here.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s Outdated Tuition Boast\n\nO\u2019Malley claimed that Maryland was the only state that went four consecutive years without an increase in college tuition. That\u2019s no longer the case.\n\nO\u2019Malley: We were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny\u2019s increase to college tuition.\n\nYes, as governor, O\u2019Malley did sign bills implementing a tuition freeze at public universities in Maryland that lasted from 2007 until 2010. But Maine has now matched what Maryland once achieved.\n\nIn March of this year, the University of Maine System Board of Trustees again voted to freeze in-state tuition at its seven member schools. That means the school system has now gone four years without an increase in tuition at its public universities.\n\nFor a full list of sources, see FactCheck.org.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share The second primary Democratic debate focused on national security and terrorism, following the attacks in Paris.
