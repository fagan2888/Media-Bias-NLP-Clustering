Their states would be directly affected if the court rules that the health law\u2019s subsidies can go only to people living in states that did establish the new online Obamacare markets.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThey\u2019d have several options, all which carry significant political risk as they balance their roles as governors with their presidential aspirations.\n\nThey can say it\u2019s a Washington problem. But if gridlocked Washington can\u2019t fix it, they\u2019d be stuck with no good answers for their own citizens losing coverage \u2014 other than trying to deflect blame to President Barack Obama and Obamacare.\n\nOr they could undertake the politically and economically challenging task of trying to create a state exchange, after shunning them a few years ago. But that would put them in the difficult position of fixing a law they\u2019ve vowed to repeal; doing anything that looks like salvaging the Affordable Care Act is not going to go over well with GOP primary voters.\n\nNeither is easy. But how the governors position themselves now, and how they\u2019d react in a few months if the ranks of the uninsured grow in the aftermath of a Supreme Court decision in the coming days, is a big unknown that could well play out in the GOP primaries.\n\nAs governors, their immediate concern would be making sure the people who lose subsidies are taken care of, says Republican pollster David Winston, who tracks health politics. But as presidential candidates, they would \u2014 in the event of a Supreme Court ruling against the White House \u2014 receive an opening on the campaign trail to criticize Obamacare as fatally flawed and spell out how they\u2019d move the country beyond it.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment where people are going to be listening, and if the response is effective, that enhances the credibility for when you want to address the broader issue,\u201d Winston said.\n\nEach of these four governors has interacted in his own way with Obamacare: Complete rejection by Jindal. An original twist on using the federal subsidy dollars by Walker. An acceptance of Medicaid expansion for the poor by Christie and Kasich. That past may contour how they respond to the ruling in King v. Burwell.\n\nWalker, who hopes to appeal in the GOP primaries to the conservative base, faces a unique set of circumstances of his own creation.\n\nWisconsin had expanded its Medicaid program before Obamacare. But after the federal law was enacted, he took 92,000 people who were just above the poverty line out of that program and moved them to the Obamacare exchange instead, where they could get heavily subsidized private insurance. That let him boast that he rejected Obamacare \u2014 but still made sure everyone in his state had access to coverage.\n\nBut if the Supreme Court rules against the subsidies, those low-income Wisconsinites \u2014 as well as tens of thousands of middle-class residents of the state \u2014 could be among the 6.4 million people whose subsidies would be cut off, perhaps within a matter of weeks. On average, the subsidies pay for about three-fourths of the monthly premium, and a lot of this population wouldn\u2019t be able to keep their health plans without them.\n\nWisconsin Democrats have introduced legislation to create a state exchange, but it\u2019s gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled legislature. And Walker himself has been saying for months that it\u2019s up to the feds to fix the problems stemming from a terrible law.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to monitor the federal court case and the pending outcome later this year, ultimately, the responsibility rests with the federal government to fix this federal law,\u201d his press secretary, Laurel Patrick, emailed. \u201cFollowing the issuance of a decision, we will continue to work with members of Wisconsin\u2019s federal delegation to enact a solution.\u201d\n\nEven though he\u2019d have a whole lot of newly uninsured people at home, he might be able to turn it to political advantage, said Charles Franklin, who oversees the Marquette University Law School Poll.\n\n\u201cThis paradoxically works to Walker\u2019s advantage to point to a new reason why he was right to oppose the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt gives him a talking point.\u201d\n\nJindal probably has the clearest political path. With Obamacare, he\u2019s been a \u201cjust say no\u201d governor all along. He didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. He didn\u2019t do an exchange, and has said he won\u2019t do one no matter how the Supreme Court rules. Of the likely 2016 candidates, he has the most fleshed-out alternative health proposal, his own Obamacare replacement plan that he released more than a year ago.\n\nHe says too many GOP proposals are \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d His is not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that any plan that repeals and replaces Obamacare\u2019s trillions in taxes and spending is a conservative alternative,\u201d he wrote in a POLITICO op-ed this year.\n\nThe looming King ruling hasn\u2019t changed that view.\n\n\u201cCreating a state exchange would be a mistake as it would reintroduce these government mandates and increase taxes,\u201d his office said in a statement. \u201cThe bottom line is that Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with a plan that will reduce costs and put patients in charge.\u201d\n\nWhile GOP governors tend to rail against Obamacare generally, a few of them have nuanced histories with the law\u2019s implementation. Kasich and Christie, who would be vying for center-right voters in the primary, already bucked party orthodoxy when they accepted Obamacare\u2019s voluntary expansion of Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income adults.\n\nChristie didn\u2019t have much choice; he\u2019s got a Democratic legislature in a blue-leaning state. But he didn\u2019t set up an exchange, twice vetoing Democratic bills that would have established a state-run marketplace.\n\nIf the court rules against the subsidies, the state Democrats say they would step up the pressure for an exchange.\n\n\u201cI would hope that he would not leave tens of thousands of New Jerseyans in the lurch,\u201d said New Jersey state Sen. Joseph Vitale.\n\nLike the others, Christie has said it\u2019s Washington\u2019s job to fix the problem if subsidies are scrapped. He\u2019s not likely to change that tune, said Harvard University political scientist Theda Skocpol, who tracks health care politics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to position himself as a tough guy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I expect a lot of yelling from him about how this is President Obama\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nKasich has been the most willing to accept and actually champion at least part of Obamacare, the Medicaid expansion. He went to extraordinary lengths to enact it, relying on an obscure state board when his Republican legislature wouldn\u2019t agree. He\u2019s consistently argued that there\u2019s a moral case for expansion to cover the poor \u2014 and that expansion keeps Ohio tax dollars in Ohio.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s never embraced the state exchange concept, his aides said he hasn\u2019t ruled it out if the high court rules against the White House. But that could be a problem for the 2016 race, where conservatives already aren\u2019t thrilled about his decision on Medicaid.\n\nBut Ohio political observers think a state-run exchange is where the policy-oriented and sometimes blunt governor might end up, assuming Washington doesn\u2019t find a solution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think John Kasich would be in the \u2018hell no\u2019 category,\u201d said John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron. Kasich might not even wait that long to see if a federal fix emerges, Green suggested.\n\n\u201cHe can be a pretty impatient leader, and I don\u2019t know how long he would wait,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, who ran Health and Human Services in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, said pragmatism may win the day. Being under the microscope of the Republican primary might impact the governors\u2019 views, but he still thinks the state executives will try to find a way to keep subsidies for their residents, he said.\n\n\u201cGovernors tend by nature to defend their partisan flag until such time as their own state becomes negatively affected and their constituents are directly impacted,\u201d said Leavitt, now a consultant whose firm has advised Republican states on health law implementation.\n\nHe recently pitched his own plan on how the Obama administration could make it easier for states that rely on HealthCare.gov to instead set up their own exchanges as a way to keep the subsidies flowing.\n\nRepublican pollster Gene Ulm, who has been in active in states including Walker\u2019s Wisconsin, has another take.\n\nThe governors understand that the loss of subsidies \u201cwould affect massive amounts of people and massive constituencies \u2014 hospitals, insurers, everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people just praying to God \u2014 although they never say it \u2014 that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t overturn it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The question: Salvage subsidies or stick to 2016 repeal script?", "title": "Obamacare dilemma for GOP govs running for president", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/obamacare-dilemma-for-gop-governors-running-for-president-119343.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/23/150622_kasich_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,Scott Walker,Tax Credits,Supreme Court,Bobby Jindal,White House,Affordable Care Act,New Jersey,Health Care,2016,Insurance,John Kasich,Louisiana,Chris Christie,Ohio,Wisconsin,ACA", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The question: Salvage subsidies or stick to 2016 repeal script?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fff\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people just praying to God \u2014 although they never say it \u2014 that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t overturn it.\u201d\nOr they could undertake the politically and economically challenging task of trying to create a state exchange, after shunning them a few years ago.\nWisconsin Democrats have introduced legislation to create a state exchange, but it\u2019s gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled legislature.\nHe didn\u2019t do an exchange, and has said he won\u2019t do one no matter how the Supreme Court rules.\n\u201cCreating a state exchange would be a mistake as it would reintroduce these government mandates and increase taxes,\u201d his office said in a statement."}
