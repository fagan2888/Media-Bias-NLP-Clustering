The program penalizes hospitals that rank in the worst-performing 25 percent.\n\nThe fines are based on the frequency of various infections, hip fractures, collapsed lungs, sepsis and other complications.\n\nThis is the program\u2019s second round. In the first round a year ago, 11 area hospitals, including three of this year\u2019s four \u2013 Truman, Menorah and KU \u2013 got hit with penalties.\n\nThe penalized hospitals were ranked on a score of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst. Blue Valley Hospital scored a 9.25, followed by Truman, 8.0; KU, 7.75; and Menorah, 7.25.\n\nDr. Tim Williamson, vice president of quality and safety at KU Hospital, said in an email that the penalties were based on older data, which he compared to looking in a rearview mirror.\n\n\u201cWe at The University of Kansas Hospital are focused on current data. What is our safety reduction today? We have robust teams working daily on multiple safety initiatives (including more areas than Medicare reports) and tracking our progress to keep patients safe,\u201d Williamson said.\n\n\u201cOur data shows significant improvements such as recent substantial progress in reducing central line infections. Having said that, all hospitals have room to do better and we are working toward zero harm daily. It\u2019s a challenge when you care for the sickest of the sick, complex patients with compromised immune systems and at high risk for infection, but are absolutely committed to this important goal.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of Truman, Menorah and Blue Valley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nDan Margolies, editor of the Heartland Health Monitor team, is based at KCUR.
