The exchange, which is the primary way uninsured people can shop for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, opens for enrollment Saturday.\n\nThe lack of a window-shopping function was cited as one reason for poor performance on the exchange last year because many people who logged on simply to view plans and prices first had to sign up and create an account, which overwhelmed the site's capacity. Technical glitches hurt the site and caused delays that prevented some people from signing up for days to weeks.\n\n\u201cUsing this tool, consumers can compare plans, covered benefits and physician and hospital networks before the marketplace annual open enrollment period starts on Nov. 15,\u201d CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNew features will give consumers a comprehensive picture of the plans in their area so they can choose the one that's right for them,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout 8 million signed up for coverage on the exchange last year. A total of about 13 million, including people renewing their coverage, are expected to enroll for 2015, the government has said.\n\nNot only are UPMC and Highmark duking it out for low-cost offerings, but there also are more insurers selling more plans on the exchange for 2015 than last year.\n\nThere are five insurers offering 23 plans at the silver level, compared with three carriers and 13 silver plans last year. United Healthcare and Assurant Health are new to the exchange. Aetna Inc.'s Coventry subsidiary replaces its HealthAmerica subsidiary for 2015.\n\nExchange plans are grouped by metal level according to richness of benefits, and range from a bronze plan that covers 60 percent of costs to a platinum plan that covers 90 percent of costs.\n\nSilver plans were the most popular among enrollees last year.\n\nPremium prices overall for next year fall within a more narrow range.\n\nThe least expensive 2015 silver plan for a 40-year-old in Allegheny County is $170 a month, not including tax subsidies that low-income workers might qualify for. The most expensive silver plan for that same person is $312 a month.\n\nSilver plans for a 40-year-old in Allegheny County for 2014 ranged from $163 to $346.\n\nFor 2015, UPMC Health Plan is selling 12 silver plans that range in price for a 40-year-old in Allegheny County from $170 a month to $209 a month. Last year, its six plans ranged from $288 to $346.\n\nHighmark has five plans at the silver level for 2015, with monthly premiums from $179 to $276. Last year, its six silver plans ranged between $163 and $240.\n\nUnited's two plans for next year are $204 and $205; Coventry's two plans are $269 and $282; and Assurant has two plans at $306 and $312.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
