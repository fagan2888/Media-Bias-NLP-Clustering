SCOTTSDALE, Ariz — While the Rockies are trying to decide who should fill out their rotation, Jordan Lyles continues to show why he’s been their most reliable starter this spring.

The right-hander needed just 72 pitches (48 strikes) to complete six innings Sunday. He allowed the Diamondbacks just one run, allowing three hits, striking out four and walking one.

Behind Lyles, the Rockies edged the Diamondbacks 2-1 in a split-squad game at Salt River Fields.

The Rockies’ other half, including a poor start from Christian Bergman (three innings, eight hits, 6 earned runs), was leading Arizona 8-7 in the eighth inning at Hermosillo, Mexico.

Lyles has been the Rockies best pitcher this spring — with 0.86 ERA in 21 innings.

After allowing a double to David Peralta in the first inning, Lyles cruised. He didn’t allow a hit in the next 10 plate appearances.



Hits

Your browser does not support iframes.

* First baseman Justin Morneau hit his second homer of the Cactus League season — and this one was a doozy. His solo shot off Ruby De La Rosa flew about 425 feet, landing in the desert landscaping beyond the center-field wall.



* Matt McBride is pushing hard to force the Rockies to find a roster spot for him. He hit two, two-run homers in the game in Mexico, giving him four homers this spring. Blackmon is primarily an outfielder, but he can also catch and play first base.

* His strained oblique healed, infielder Daniel Descalso hit a solo homer to right-center to put the Rockies up 2-1 in the seventh at Salt River Fields.



Misses

* Right-hander Christian Bergman failed to make a convincing argument for a spot in the rotation with his start in Mexico. He threw two scoreless innings before the wheels came off in the third. He was done after three innings after allowing six runs on eight hits.

* Outfielder Drew Stubbs, whom the Rockies are paying $5.8 million this season, is really struggling at the plate. He struck out three times Sunday, giving him 23 strikeouts in 41 at-bats this spring. He’s hitting .195.



Up Next

The Rockies travel to Mesa on Monday to face the A’s at renovated Hohokam Stadium. Right-hander Eddie Butler, trying to lock down a spot in the starting rotation, starts for Colorado. Scheduled to start for Oakland is lefty Drew Pomeranz, the former Rockie.
