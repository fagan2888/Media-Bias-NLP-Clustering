Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -1.31% has put carnitas back on the menu at 90% of its restaurants nationwide. Back in January, the dish was discontinued at more than one-third of its restaurants, 1,700 total, after an audit found that one of its pork suppliers was not raising its pigs to the company's animal welfare standards. Restaurants in the Cleveland and Atlanta areas, along with those in North Carolina and South Carolina, still don't have carnitas on the menu. Chipotle was able to source its pork through existing suppliers and by adding a new supplier, U.K.-based Karro Food. Chipotle stock is up 6% for the year-to-date. The S&P is down 7.5% for the same period.
