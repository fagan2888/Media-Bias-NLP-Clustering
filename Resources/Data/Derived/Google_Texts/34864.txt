The editor of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo said the magazine will no longer draw cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

In an interview with the German magazine Stern, Laurent Sourisseau said that the magazine had done its job and what it had set out to fulfill.

“We have drawn Mohammed to defend the principle that one can draw whatever they want,” the editor, also know as Riss, said, The Telegraph reported Friday. “It is a bit strange though: we are expected to exercise freedom of expression that no one dares to.

“We’ve done our job. We have defended the right to caricature.”

Mr. Sourriseau said he did not want to believe the magazine was possessed by Islam but maintained that he believed they had “the right to criticize all religions.”

His comments come six months after the three-day siege in Paris, which began January 7 when two brothers — Said and Cherif Kouachi — stormed the magazine’s office and gunned down 12 people.
