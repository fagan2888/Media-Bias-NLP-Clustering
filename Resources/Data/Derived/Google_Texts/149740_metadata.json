This assessment, of course, is ludicrous: Reducing access to birth control is a major defeat for everybody.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to take anything away from women. I get that being better able to control pregnancy has a certain extra resonance when your body is able to get pregnant. So it\u2019s totally fair to say that restrictions on access to birth control impact women more than men \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that men are unaffected, especially heterosexual men.\n\nReal talk: If you\u2019re a straight man who isn\u2019t a virgin and isn\u2019t a father, or if you are a man who is a father to a non-ridiculous number of children, you are almost certainly a beneficiary of birth control. Therefore, if you are a man in one of these categories, an attack on birth control is an attack on you. And you should probably be mad about it.\n\nIndeed, right-wingers may howl about the ills of \u201cconsequence-free sex,\u201d but consequence-free sex is actually an objectively good thing: Most people are going to end up having sex, they\u2019re going to do it for non-procreative purposes \u2014 because they always have \u2014 and it is therefore in everyone\u2019s interest, male and female, to not leave the consequences of sex to chance. Parenthood is simply too great a responsibility to bestow upon any man or woman who isn\u2019t ready for it or doesn\u2019t want to undertake it again, and that\u2019s too important a principle for men to just pass the buck of responsibility on to women and say it\u2019s a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that beyond the moral imperatives of contraception, it serves a variety of social benefits that are as good for men as they are for women: It\u2019s good for economic growth, it\u2019s good for businesses, and it\u2019s good for marriages. Oh, and it also dramatically reduces the odds that a woman or baby will die during childbirth, which is probably something guys can get behind too.\n\nIf you are a man in one of these categories, an attack on birth control is an attack on you. And you should probably be mad about it.\n\nOf course, this is the point where supporters of the Hobby Lobby decision inevitably argue that the question at issue in the case was not about the merits of birth control but rather about who should pay for it. Indeed, conservative Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. did say the government had a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in birth control being accessible but that there were ways to pursue this objective without unduly burdening certain businesses. I don\u2019t agree with Alito\u2019s analysis, but I can understand it.\n\nOn July 3, however, Alito and the five other male justices indicated that they might strike down the alternative arrangements for accessing birth control that just a few days earlier they had cited as a possible workable compromise. If that\u2019s not undermining access to birth control \u2014 in effect if not intent \u2014 I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nThe good news is that access to birth control in the United States has, overall, grown dramatically as a result of the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s a great thing for men and women alike. But the Hobby Lobby decision is a reminder to all of us that we must fight to defend the gains we\u2019ve made. As we head into the 2014 and 2016 campaigns, men need to make it clear that universal access to birth control is our issue too.\n\nJoel Silberman is a Los Angeles-based writer and the producer of such viral Web videos as \"Legitimate Rape\" Pharmaceutical Ad (TW) and Kids Do The News.
