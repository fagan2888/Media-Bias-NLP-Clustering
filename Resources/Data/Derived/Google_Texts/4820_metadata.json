The \u201cHHS mandate,\u201d even with the so-called accommodations that the Administration has provided, still forces many organizations to violate their conscience and religious beliefs.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring his visit, Pope Francis paid a visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have one of the cases against the HHS mandate. Priests for Life likewise has such a case, and in fact was one of the very first to challenge the mandate in court back in February of 2012. Our case is now pending at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBy now, most people are familiar with the Hobby Lobby case where the Supreme Court held that the Department of Health and Human Services could not force families that own businesses to violate their religious faith by requiring them to provide abortion-causing drugs and devices to their employees. That decision on the \u201cHHS mandate\u201d however, while a victory for religious liberty, only applies to closely-held, for-profit enterprises.\n\nNot-for-profit organizations, including Priests for Life, and hundreds of religious schools and charities are still required by the Obama administration to be complicit in acts that our deeply held beliefs inform us are evil.\n\nThis we will not do.\n\nAs such, we face a crossroads. Unless the Supreme Court hears Priests for Life\u2019s legal appeal \u2013 or that of one of the myriad other groups that have brought suits \u2013 and again reigns in the Obama administration, charities across the nation will face the prospect of closing their doors.\n\nFortunately, a recent appeals court decision makes it more likely that the court will accept our case.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in mid-September against the administration and for a Christian college and a Christian residential treatment center for those with behavioral and substance abuse problems. The judges unanimously decided that the HHS mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\nThis ruling puts the Eighth Circuit in conflict with other appeals courts \u2014 including the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which decided against Priests for Life. And when appeals courts reach conflicting opinions on the same question, the Supreme Court is more likely to accept a case that will settle that difference.\n\nWhat\u2019s troubling is why the Obama administration is using such iron-fisted tactics in the first place. If it wants to make abortion-causing drugs and devices available, it could do so without threatening to destroy religious schools, programs for the elderly, and other organizations that are part of the fabric of the social safety net. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s more important for the President to force church groups to violate our beliefs and submit to his agenda than it is for him to achieve what he says is his goal.\n\nUnder RFRA, the government cannot place a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on an individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s religious liberty unless it has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d and it uses the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of fulfilling that interest. In the recent victory for religious freedom, the Eighth Circuit said that the government failed this three-pronged test.\n\nFor instance, for the HHS mandate to pass legal muster, the government must show that the regulation is the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d it can use to provide the four disputed birth control methods to employees. The appeals court, however, noted that if the administration wanted, it \u201ccould provide subsidies, reimbursements, tax credits, or tax deductions to employees, or that the government could pay for the distribution of contraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based support.\u201d\n\nIn short, the government could simply provide the drugs to women directly and end this controversy. Instead, it has chosen to use the heavy hand of government to violate the rights and consciences of those with whom it disagrees.\n\nThe Pope has left our country, but the Supreme Court\u2019s nine justices are returning to Washington to make more history in a year of major events. That history begins now.\n\nThe first Monday in October officially starts the court\u2019s term.\n\nThe justices, however, have had the summer months to weigh which cases they will chose to adjudicate in the coming months. The Solicitor General has stated that Priests for Life\u2019s petition, which has been combined with one filed by the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., may be the best of the HHS mandate cases for the court to accept. Unlike other cases, our consolidated case covers the full range of legal questions the court would want to address regarding the HHS mandate, and it also covers all the different health coverage arrangements that have given rise to challenges against the mandate, based on the somewhat different situations of various co-plaintiffs.\n\nWe hope that the Court sees it that way and accepts the case. We are also praying that, as it did with Hobby Lobby, the court will uphold religious liberty.\n\nIf ultimately it does not, we will simply not obey the mandate, and our employees will need to obtain insurance on their own. They will be the first to insist that the ministry to which they give their best efforts every day not betray the very principles that inspire its mission.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catholic institutions in the US -- with many other institutions -- are battling the Obama Administration to preserve that religious freedom.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Catholic institutions in the US -- with many other institutions -- are battling the Obama Administration to preserve that religious freedom.", "title": "Is The High Court Poised To Accept Religious Freedom Case? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Little-Sisters-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/28/is-the-high-court-poised-to-accept-religious-freedom-case/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Catholic institutions in the US -- with many other institutions -- are battling the Obama Administration to preserve that religious freedom.", "title": "Is The High Court Poised To Accept Religious Freedom Case? - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Little-Sisters-Getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Faith,Religious Freedom", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-09-28T06:12:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Fortunately, a recent appeals court decision makes it more likely that the court will accept our case.\nThe judges unanimously decided that the HHS mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\nThat decision on the \u201cHHS mandate\u201d however, while a victory for religious liberty, only applies to closely-held, for-profit enterprises.\nOur case is now pending at the U.S. Supreme Court.\nAnd when appeals courts reach conflicting opinions on the same question, the Supreme Court is more likely to accept a case that will settle that difference."}
