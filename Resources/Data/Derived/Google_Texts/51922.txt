Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried was one of 19 players selected Monday for USA Basketball’s men’s national team training camp roster.

Faried, who is 6-foot-8, averaged 13.7 points and 8.6 rebounds for the Nuggets last season.

“This group possesses outstanding individual talents, while also boasting of excellent versatility and varying amounts of USA Basketball experience,” said Jerry Colangelo, USA Basketball chairman and national team managing director.

The roster will participate in the USA National Team training in Las Vegas later this month. The team will be trimmed to 12 players for 2014 FIBA World Cup, which takes place Aug. 30-Sept. 14 in Spain.

Included on the roster are Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kevin Love, who were members of the 2012 Olympic gold medal-winning squad.
