And, it\u2019s important we protect the whole child because this is the next generation of Floridians, the next generation of Americans. It means a lot more than meeting basic, given expectations.\u201d\n\nAt the 18th annual Child Protection Summit in Orlando, Carroll also said while his agency has made progress, there\u2019s still more work to do. He says that includes reducing the number of child fatalities in Florida. More than 85 percent of the child deaths called into the state abuse hotline involve kids under the age of 3.\n\n\u201cThe leading cause of death for children 0 to 1\u2014those are our babies\u2014is unsafe sleep or unsafe sleep-related deaths. The leading cause of death for children ages 1 and 2 is drowning,\u201d added Carroll.\n\nAnd, Carroll says most are unintentional.\n\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t inflicted child deaths,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey weren\u2019t intentional. But, almost every one of them is inherently preventable. And, most of them are related to marginal parent oversight. You might have a parent who doesn\u2019t know how to be a parent. You might have a parent with a mental health issue. You might have a parent with a substance abuse issue that contributed to the circumstances that led to that child\u2019s death. But, there are too many kids in our state that died because of that.\u201d\n\nCarroll says if a child in Florida can stay alive until the age of three, their chances of survival go up considerably.\n\nChild deaths have been a big focus for the state, after a spate of child abuse deaths occurred under the state\u2019s supervision in recent years.\n\nRep. Gayle Harrell (R-Stuart) worked with Sen. Eleanor Sobel (D-Hollywood) over the years to focus on revamping Florida\u2019s child welfare system. Both chair legislative committees in the House and Senate dealing with children issues.\n\n\u201cAs we were dealing with out child legislation in SB 1666, it became more evident that probably the three key factors that affect child abuse have to deal with mental health issues, substance abuse issues, and domestic violence. And, domestic violence is all related\u2014to a large part, probably 80 percent\u2014to mental health and substance abuse. So, when you get down to the core issue, we need to as a child welfare system to look at integration within our system, and bringing in our partners within our substance abuse and mental health issues,\u201d said Harrell.\n\nA proposal delving into mental health and substance abuse issues did not pass amid the budget impasse between the House and Senate, during this past legislative session. But Harrell says in the coming year, mental health and substance abuse will again be a priority.\n\n\u201cAnd, you see it in the headlines, each and every day,\u201d added Harrell. \u201cYou see a child being thrown off the bridge, you see parents struggling with addiction, you see children suffering because of the difficulties, the struggles, the problems that the parents are happening, and who suffers? The children. So, I think this next year, we\u2019re going to continue our hard work, and we\u2019re going to hopefully come back next session with an even better bill.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, both Harrell and Carroll say they\u2019re also encouraged by the Governor\u2019s recent Executive Order. It builds on a collaborative effort among state agencies who offer mental health services in Florida, which includes DCF.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The head of Florida\u2019s child welfare agency as well as some state lawmakers are renewing a push towards mental health and substance abuse reform in", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/mental-health-substance-abuse-issues-fla-child-welfare-system-be-priority-2016", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201509/439604671.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The head of Florida\u2019s child welfare agency as well as some state lawmakers are renewing a push towards mental health and substance abuse reform in", "title": "Mental Health-Substance Abuse Issues In Fla.
