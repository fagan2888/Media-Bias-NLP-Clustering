The college has a self-insured plan through Christian Brothers, which is subject to a temporary injunction issued by the U.S. Supreme Court in a similar case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor. That case is before the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nA federal judge has not formally ruled that Wyoming Catholic College already has the benefit of the other injunction.\n\nBut the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s stance works for now, Roberts said.\n\n\u201cJustice department officials\u2019 understanding is this is legally binding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have to comply with the mandate until further notice.\u201d\n\nHowever, those officials did not agree that this exception applied to the other plaintiffs in the original late January lawsuit filed in January. The other plaintiffs are the Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne, which covers all of Wyoming; Catholic Charities of Wyoming; Saint Joseph\u2019s Children\u2019s Home in Torrington; St. Anthony\u2019s Tri-Parish Catholic School in Casper, and John Paul II Catholic School in Gillette.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/k2radio.com/files/2014/04/Kevin-RobertsWCC-Courtesy-Wyoming-Community-College.jpg", "sailthru.author": "tommorton", "description": "The Wyoming Catholic College has won a battle with the federal government without firing so much as a legal brief about mandated health insurance compliance", "og": {"site_name": "K2 Radio", "description": "The Wyoming Catholic College has won a battle with the federal government without firing so much as a legal brief about mandated health insurance compliance", "title": "Wyoming Catholic College Already Has Its Temporary Injunction", "url": "http://k2radio.com/wyoming-catholic-college-already-has-its-temporary-injunction/", "image": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/k2radio.com/files/2014/04/Kevin-RobertsWCC-Courtesy-Wyoming-Community-College.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@k2radiowyo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-03 16:24:12", "sailthru.title": "Wyoming Catholic College Already Has Its Temporary Injunction", "fb": {"admins": 732998853, "app_id": 204598309557300}, "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-ktwo, tsmmarket-casper, tsmtype-local, local-news", "sailthru.description": "The Wyoming Catholic College has won a battle with the federal government without firing so much as a legal brief about mandated health insurance compliance", "sailthru.image.full": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/k2radio.com/files/2014/04/Kevin-RobertsWCC-Courtesy-Wyoming-Community-College.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaadf\"", "article_summary": "The other plaintiffs are the Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne, which covers all of Wyoming; Catholic Charities of Wyoming; Saint Joseph\u2019s Children\u2019s Home in Torrington; St. Anthony\u2019s Tri-Parish Catholic School in Casper, and John Paul II Catholic School in Gillette.\nA federal judge has not formally ruled that Wyoming Catholic College already has the benefit of the other injunction.\nKevin Roberts, Courtesy Wyoming Community CollegeThe Wyoming Catholic College has won a battle with the federal government without firing so much as a legal brief about mandated health insurance compliance with the Affordable Care Act, its president said.\nBut U.S. attorneys representing the government say in a footnote in the motion that a temporary injunction is already in effect only for the college.\nThe college has a self-insured plan through Christian Brothers, which is subject to a temporary injunction issued by the U.S. Supreme Court in a similar case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor."}
