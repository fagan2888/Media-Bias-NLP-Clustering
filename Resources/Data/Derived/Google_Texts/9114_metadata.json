Twelve players were assigned to Lake Erie of the American Hockey League and 2014 first-round draft pick Conner Bleackley was among three to be sent back to juniors.\n\nRoy said he was disappointed in Bleackley and the Avs\u2019 top pick in 2013, Chris Bigras, who also was sent back to his junior team. The coach said Bleackley, a forward, did not come into his first NHL training camp in adequate shape, and defenseman Bigras did not play as well as last year.\n\nThe Avs also sent defenseman Mason Geertsen back to juniors.\n\nThose sent to Lake Erie were: goalies Francois Tremblay and Sami Aittokallio; defensemen Karl Stollery and Cody Corbett; and forwards Troy Bourke, Trevor Cheek, Nate Condon, Mitchell Heard, Garrett Meurs, Michael Sgarbossa and Colin Smith. Forward Kenny Ryan was released.\n\nThe Avs had 35 players participating in practice Tuesday. Captain and left wing Gabe Landeskog, who did not play in either game Monday, was held out because of a minor back injury, Roy said, and forward Daniel Briere was excused to travel to Philadelphia and attend to his son who was injured playing hockey.\n\nCenter John Mitchell (migraines) skated on his own but winger Jamie McGinn (back) has yet to skate in camp and could be weeks away from playing, Roy said. Winger Patrick Bordeleau (back) is out indefinitely.\n\nMeanwhile, this week\u2019s trip is special for the Quebec-born Roy, who won two his four Stanley Cups with the Canadiens, and fellow first-ballot Hockey Hall of Famer Joe Sakic, the Avs\u2019 executive vice president/general manager who played the first seven years of his playing career with the Quebec Nordiques.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs trim preseason roster; Conner Bleackley, Chris Bigras to juniors", "title": "Avs trim preseason roster; Conner Bleackley, Chris Bigras to juniors", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/23/avs-trim-preseason-roster-conner-bleackley-chris-bigras-to-juniors/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__conner-bleackley-avs-092314p1.jpg", "height": 465}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__conner-bleackley-avs-092314p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-23T14:32:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:18:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Roy said he was disappointed in Bleackley and the Avs\u2019 top pick in 2013, Chris Bigras, who also was sent back to his junior team.\nTwelve players were assigned to Lake Erie of the American Hockey League and 2014 first-round draft pick Conner Bleackley was among three to be sent back to juniors.\nThe Avs also sent defenseman Mason Geertsen back to juniors.\nThe Avs reduced their roster by reassigning 15 players and making one cut before practice Tuesday, following a split-squad, two-city doubleheader against the Anaheim Ducks on Monday night.\nThe coach said Bleackley, a forward, did not come into his first NHL training camp in adequate shape, and defenseman Bigras did not play as well as last year."}
