The report established safeguards for contractors that conduct seismic testing in the Atlantic, and highlighted potential significant effects that it would have on whales, dolphins and other marine life.\n\nWhile the report did not authorize seismic testing, BOEM is considering such a move, and Beaudreau said it could happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe Interior Department would review the tests to consider whether or not to allow drilling. But if the process continues without delay, the release of the environmental review would set the agency on a five-year planning process that would open up the Atlantic to drilling between 2017 and 2022.\n\nBeaudreau said the agency has made no decisions yet about whether to allow drilling.\n\nDemocrats on the Appropriations committees remain skeptical of allowing companies to drill \\ in the Atlantic.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. James Moran (Va.), asked Beaudreau what safeguards the agency plans to establish to prevent spills and other disruptions to the environment.\n\n\u201cWe're going to have to make sure there are sufficient safeguards in place before we proceed,\u201d Moran said.\n\nIn addition to the harms it could cause for marine life, Moran expressed concerns about the disruptions spills could cause for the shipping and tourism industries, as well as military operations.\n\n\u201cYeah, I've got a lot of concerns about drilling, particularly off Virginia's coast,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very important tourism industry, and fishing industry, and there's a shipping channel, and we have extensive naval operations going on, and I don't want to jeopardize any of it. \u201c\n\nBeaudreau said BOEM is looking to establish the \u201cmost protective\u201d set of regulations it can for any such drilling and testing activities.\n\nMoran also expressed concerns that BOEM is delaying a rule that would increase the maximum fines for offshore drilling companies that are responsible for oil spills.\n\n\u201cI understand that opposition has surfaced, of course, from the industry, and that the cap adjustment may be delayed,\u201d Moran said. \u201cWhen do you expect that cap adjustment to be implemented on spill liability?\u201d\n\nBeaudreau said he hopes to raise the fines to a maximum of $134 million from the current $75 million by the end of the year. The fines haven't not been raised since 1990, so the changes mostly account for inflation, he said.\n\n\u201cWe had some catch-up to do,\u201d Beaudreau said.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans complained to Brian Salerno, director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, who was also at the hearing, that the permitting process takes too long for companies that want to drill in the Gulf.\n\n\u201cWe had companies who were complaining that they never got a permit done,\u201d said Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), chairman of the subcommittee. \u201cThe permitting process took an extraordinarily long time with permits being kicked back and forth. How is the timing on permits now?\u201d\n\nSalerno said his agency is speeding up the permitting process. In 2011, it took an average of 71 days from the time a company submitted an application to the time it was approved. Last year, the number of days had declined to 59.\n\n\u201cThe number is coming down,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Obama administration may allow companies to begin seismic testing.", "description": "Obama administration may allow companies to begin seismic testing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Obama administration may allow companies to begin seismic testing.", "title": "Interior says Atlantic offshore drilling tests could begin this year", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/202709-interior-atlantic-offshore-drilling-tests-could-begin-this-year", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-04T19:31:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-04-04T19:31-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/202709-interior-atlantic-offshore-drilling-tests-could-begin-this-year", "dcterms.date": "2014-04-04T16:20-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Offshore drilling, Environment, Petroleum production,Tommy Beaudreau,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-04T16:20:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T19:31:45-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/202709-interior-atlantic-offshore-drilling-tests-could-begin-this-year", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Obama administration may allow companies to begin seismic testing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Interior says Atlantic offshore drilling tests could begin this year"}, "dcterms.title": "Interior says Atlantic offshore drilling tests could begin this year"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7d9\"", "article_summary": "The Interior Department would review the tests to consider whether or not to allow drilling.\nMoran also expressed concerns that BOEM is delaying a rule that would increase the maximum fines for offshore drilling companies that are responsible for oil spills.\nThe Interior Department released an environmental impact statement in February that laid the foundation for testing to begin.\nThe Obama administration could allow companies to begin surveying the Atlantic for oil and gas development by the end of the year.\n\u201cBeaudreau said BOEM is looking to establish the \u201cmost protective\u201d set of regulations it can for any such drilling and testing activities."}
