The percentage of students graduating from North Carolina high schools now stands at 83.8 percent,

the highest in state history.

Since 2006, the first year the state reported a four-year cohort graduation rate, the percentage of students graduating from high school in four years or less has risen 15.5 percentage points.

The State Board of Education released the results on Thursday along with end of grade testing results.

“A top priority of the State Board of Education is to ensure that high school diplomas are meaningful and aligned with the skills and knowledge that students need in college and in careers,” said Board Chairman Bill Cobey. “It is good news that students are reaching higher standards and graduating in higher numbers as well.”

A closer look at the numbers finds that female students posted a higher graduation rate than male students. Asian students had the highest rate overall, while students considered to have limited English proficiency had the lowest rate.
