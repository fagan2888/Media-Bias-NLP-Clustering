Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) argued that the major political fight in the United States is not Republicans versus Democrats, but rather career politicians versus non-career politicians on Thursday’s “Laura Ingraham Show.”

“It’s not Republicans and Democrats, it’s career politicians versus non-,” he said, adding that people should vote Republican “in most instances, not all,” because “most of the time you have fewer careerists on the Republican side.”

Coburn did not name any specific instances where he believes people should not vote Republican, and stressed the importance of a GOP Senate majority, arguing that “a 51-49 Republican Senate stops the assault on the rule of law through the judges that Obama’s putting on [the bench]” and would result in the Senate being able to pass appropriations bills rather than continuing resolutions.
