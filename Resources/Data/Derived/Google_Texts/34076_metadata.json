But when the credits started rolling on each episode, he found himself wanting to discuss the developments with someone. While he missed out on seeing Amsterdam\u2019s canals and museums, he did come back with the germ of an idea for a new television show.\n\nWhen he returned to Houston, he discussed the possibility of creating a live talk show to follow \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d and the idea was received enthusiastically. \u201cManor of Speaking,\u201d which had its premiere in January 2013 and celebrates the end of its second season on Sunday night, has picked up a devoted following of hard-core \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fans. The show airs live from the University of Houston\u2019s Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting in the 30 minutes immediately following \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d the critical darling of the \u201cMasterpiece Classic\u201d umbrella series. Just under 50,000 people tune in for \u201cManor of Speaking\u201d each week, and 112,000 watch \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d immediately before.\n\n\u201cWe have an amazing retention rate this season,\u201d Mr. Manouse (pronounced mah-NOOSE) said. This makes the show the most popular locally produced series in the history of Houston PBS. Those outside the viewing area can watch a live stream online, and by next season the show may be on public television stations nationwide. \u201cWe\u2019ve had interest from coast to coast,\u201d Mr. Manouse said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Manouse moved to Houston 18 years ago to take a job with the local PBS station. He wants \u201cManor of Speaking\u201d to have both universal appeal and Texas flavor, he said.\n\n\u201cThe show is a mix of turn-of-the-century English country house and modern-day Texas,\u201d Manouse said. \u201cI\u2019m in a tux as an hommage to those days, but I\u2019m wearing cowboy boots because I\u2019m a Texan.\u201d Each week, around 50 Houstonians, often bedecked in period clothing, make a $90 donation to Houston PBS for the privilege of driving over to the Melcher Center to watch that week\u2019s episode of \u201cDownton\u201d as a group. After the show, they shift to the studio next door, which features a set decorated like the kind of living room many Anglophiles might love to curl up in on a cold winter day, complete with fireplace, book-filled library wall (fake-looking, even from a distance) and moss green wallpaper.\n\nExpanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization. To join the conversation about this article, go to texastribune.org. Cultural coverage for the Texas Report is provided by Texas Monthly. For stories, reviews, news and more, go to texasmonthly.com.\n\nFrom the overstuffed maroon and gold brocade couches and chairs in the center of the room, the silver-haired Mr. Manouse holds court with his two British regular guests, St. John Flynn, director of classical programming at Houston Public Media, and Helen Mann, a former vice consul at the British Consulate in Houston. Over the next 30 minutes they dissect that week\u2019s episode, speculate on where various plot points will lead, and delve into nuggets of British history, etiquette and customs.\n\n\u201cIf \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019, is your meal then \u2018Manor of Speaking\u2019 is your dessert. It\u2019s a fun, easy show to watch,\u201d Mr. Manouse said.\n\nWhile much of \u201cManor of Speaking\u201d is devoted to lighthearted subjects like pig husbandry or famous chefs of the early 20th century, there are exceptions. When a character was raped during the fourth season, Mr. Manouse invited Leticia Manzano from the Houston Area Women\u2019s Center to discuss the trauma. \u201cWe opened with her and spoke for a few minutes in order to address things properly and not make light of a serious situation,\u201d Mr. Manouse said. (The victim was the lady\u2019s maid Anna, who is married to Bates, Lord Grantham\u2019s valet. And the aftermath of the event is still a crucial plot point.)Throughout the show, Mr. Manouse is approached by his butler, Mr. Rodgers (Luke Wrobel). \u201cI have your tweets, m\u2019lord,\u201d he says, holding out a silver tray stacked with 140-character missives, scrawled in felt marker on notecards, reacting to that evening\u2019s \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d episode.\n\nOne week a Twitter user suggested that Mr. Manouse, as the \u201clord of the manor,\u201d should properly address his butler simply as Rodgers. When Mr. Manouse broached this subject on the air, Rodgers responded with a curt \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with change, m\u2019lord.\u201d Mr. Manouse said he appreciated the interactive aspects of his show because it let him constantly see and explore things from different angles.\n\nEach week features Mr. Manouse\u2019s pretaped interview with a celebrity guest. Guests have included Marcia Clark, who was the prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder trial; Gareth Neame, executive producer of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d; and the Countess of Carnarvon, chatelaine of Highclere Castle, where \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is filmed, inside and out. But the most prominent guest so far has been the former first lady Barbara Bush. \u201cI love the program, and every friend I have loves it,\u201d she said enthusiastically during her appearance. \u201cI just can\u2019t tell you what a clean, wonderful, joyous time it is to watch it.\u201d (Her husband, however, is \u201cnot into\u201d the series, she said.)\n\n\u201dManor of Speaking,\u201d too, has been greeted with critical acclaim. Both Mr. Manouse and his improbably named director, Matthew Brawley (one of Downton\u2019s most beloved residents was Matthew Crawley), received 2013 Lone Star Emmy Awards.\n\nAfter one recent show, members of the audience greeted Mr. Manouse and his co-hosts. One woman was dressed as a flapper; another wore a long lace skirt. They encircled that week\u2019s special guest, Robert Patten, an emeritus professor of English and humanities at Rice University.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe fans\u2019 enthusiasm appears to have heartened Mr. Manouse. \u201cIt\u2019s been a joyous ride,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140222225432, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fans who watch Houston PBS don\u2019t have to leave Edwardian England after each episode ends; they can keep the mood going with Ernie Manouse\u2019s \u201cManor of Speaking.\u201d", "title": "Let\u2019s Talk a Bit More About Bates and Anna", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/lets-talk-a-bit-more-about-bates-and-anna.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002727564"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttCulture/23ttCulture-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/lets-talk-a-bit-more-about-bates-and-anna.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002727564", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/lets-talk-a-bit-more-about-bates-and-anna.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Let\u2019s Talk a Bit More About Bates and Anna", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 22, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "ttl": "Downton Abbey (TV Program)", "keywords": "Texas,Television,Public Broadcasting,Downton Abbey (TV Program),Public Broadcasting Service", "news_keywords": "Texas,TV", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Sonia Smith", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttCulture/23ttCulture-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By SONIA SMITH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fans who watch Houston PBS don\u2019t have to leave Edwardian England after each episode ends; they can keep the mood going with Ernie Manouse\u2019s \u201cManor of Speaking.\u201d", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttCulture/23ttCulture-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fans who watch Houston PBS don\u2019t have to leave Edwardian England after each episode ends; they can keep the mood going with Ernie Manouse\u2019s \u201cManor of Speaking.\u201d", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Public Broadcasting Service", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "23ttarts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140223014707, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/lets-talk-a-bit-more-about-bates-and-anna.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/23/us/23ttCulture/23ttCulture-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d fans who watch Houston PBS don\u2019t have to leave Edwardian England after each episode ends; they can keep the mood going with Ernie Manouse\u2019s \u201cManor of Speaking.\u201d", "title": "Let\u2019s Talk a Bit More About Bates and Anna"}, "pdate": 20140222, "des": "Public Broadcasting", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-02-23", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Public Broadcasting Service", "published": "2014-02-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "articleid": 100000002727564, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Let\u2019s Talk a Bit More About Bates and Anna", "col": "Texas Monthly", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Just under 50,000 people tune in for \u201cManor of Speaking\u201d each week, and 112,000 watch \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d immediately before.\n\u201cWe have an amazing retention rate this season,\u201d Mr. Manouse (pronounced mah-NOOSE) said.\nIt\u2019s a fun, easy show to watch,\u201d Mr. Manouse said.\n)Throughout the show, Mr. Manouse is approached by his butler, Mr. Rodgers (Luke Wrobel).\nAfter one recent show, members of the audience greeted Mr. Manouse and his co-hosts."}
