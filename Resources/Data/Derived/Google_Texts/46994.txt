During an interview with Brian Stelter on CNN’s Reliable Sources, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had some tough words for the media’s concentration on political personalities rather than the merits of campaigns.

Stelter asked Sanders about whether he felt that media outlets were providing serious coverage of his campaign and policies, or if the media was using him as a headlining foil to Hillary Clinton. “We have gotten more serious discussion on our issues than I might have thought about,” said Sanders. “But this is what I worry about: In terms of campaign coverage, there is more coverage about the political gossip of a campaign, about raising money, about polling, about somebody saying something dumb.”

When Sanders talked about his perceived shortage of coverage to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Stelter responded, “We might say that they cover it on there website, or we might say there are niche outlets that can do a better job of covering this issue.” Sanders turned it back to broadcast news, saying “television is an important medium, you cannot ignore that.”

Sanders conceded that there are two sides to every issue, but he stressed the importance of focusing on the debate, rather than campaign spectacle. When Stelter asked about how the media can maintain audience interest, Sanders said, “I just hope that we are concerned about the state of American democracy. We need serious discussion on serious issues.”
