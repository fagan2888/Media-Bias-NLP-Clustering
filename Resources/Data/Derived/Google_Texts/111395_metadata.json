In part, from the archdiocese newspaper, the Georgia Bulletin:\n\n\u201cThis judgment\u2026 does not absolve either those who may approve or disapprove of this decision from the obligations of civility toward one another. Neither is it a license for more venomous language or vile behavior against those whose opinions continue to differ from our own. It is a decision that confers a civil entitlement to some people who could not claim it before. It does not resolve the moral debate that preceded it and will most certainly continue in its wake.\n\n\u201cThis moral debate must also include the way that we treat one another \u2013 especially those with whom we may disagree. In many respects, the moral question is at least as consequential and weighty as the granting of this civil entitlement. The decision has offered all of us an opportunity to continue the vitally important dialogue of human encounter, especially between those of diametrically differing opinions regarding its outcome.\n\n\u201cThe decision has made my ministry as a pastor more complex since it demands that I both continue to uphold the teachings of my Church regarding the Sacrament of Matrimony while also demanding that I insist upon respect for the human dignity of both those who approve of the judgment as well as those who may disapprove.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/06/27/atlantas-catholic-archbishop-on-gay-marriage-decision-disagreement-is-no-license-for-vile-behavior/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gregory-wilton.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It is nearly Sunday, and the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down state bans on gay marriage is likely to be the topic of many a sermon in Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Catholic side, Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Atlanta has laid down some rational guidelines for the debate.
