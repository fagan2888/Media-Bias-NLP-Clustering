It appears the first wave of Americans being sent to FEMA concentration camps has begun. Over the last couple of years, many homeless across America have been given the choice to go to jail or reside in a government camp, miles away from the city.

The Federal government is able to accomplish this because many cities have essentially made it illegal to be homeless. Thus, by having restrictions on the location and time one can spend in a certain area without being considered homeless, many cities have shipped their homeless to nearby FEMA camps. From Fresno, California to Columbia, South Carolina, America's homeless are being forcefully sent to detention centers under the guise of governmenthousing.

As if this revelation isn't bad enough, a claim recently surfaced that those sent to FEMA camps have been given an option of having a RFID chip implanted or lose their benefits. http://www.teapartycrusaders.com/u-s-news/shocking-fema-camp-choice-rfid-chip-homeless-lose-benefits-north-carolina/

It is easy to dismiss these stories as science fiction, but the fact that police in most major cities have been actively looking for and removing the homeless from their usual camping areas in recent years, as well as large numbers of homeless, having simply disappeared across the country, seems to confirm these claims as truth. Police raids, too numerous to even think of listing them all.

All this is being done under the guise of helping the homeless get off the streets. What will come next under the Bush family NAZI plan of a New World Order, implemented by George H.W. Bush shortly after the first Gulf War is rounding up and imprisoning those who speak out against the government.

Euthanasia and mercy killings are not too far off and will be initiated later, in connection to the Affordable Care Act "Obama Care".
