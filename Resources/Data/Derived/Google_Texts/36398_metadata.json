Skies will become mostly clear and it will turn bitterly cold tonight, with near record low temperatures falling into the middle single digits below zero and wind chills as cold as -10 to -20. Full forecast\n\n1. RIGHT TO WORK\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter across the border?: A Minnesota Republican says his Wisconsin counterparts are dead wrong about the right to work legislation. Rep. Pat Garofalo said in a letter Tuesday to Rock Road Costruction in Janesville that he welcomed Wisconsin companies to Minnesota where \"Many Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature understand that 'Right to Work' significantly interferes with your right to set the terms and conditions of employment in your workplace.\" Wisconsin Republicans say the legislation says nothing about businesses doing away with unions, so they do not worry about job makers leaving for that reason. But Democrats say the letter proves Minnesota is already capitalizing off legislation that has not even passed. The Labor Committee is holding an executive session on the bill to consider Democratic amendments today. More on this story\n\n\n\n2. BELTLINE CONSTRUCTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCone zone returns: Tonight, preliminary work will start on a major construction project between Whitney Way and Seminole Highway on the Beltline. And by next Monday night - weather permitting - you will see lane changes as well. It is a two-year project. This year the eastbound lanes will be completely rebuilt. That means a lane shift will occur to put all traffic where the westbound lanes are. They will maintain two lanes in each direction. All of this is being done to get the Beltline up to meet new highway safety standards. More on this story\n\n\n\n3. WALKER ABORTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Open letter on life': Gov. Scott Walker said he will sign into law a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Walker on Tuesday issued what he called an \"open letter on life\" in which he stated his support for the ban, saying he expects the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass such a bill. Walker, a likely presidential candidate, also says he supports a federal ban. Putting a ban on abortions after 20 weeks is based on the assertion that fetuses can feel pain at that point, which is disputed in medical research. More on this story\n\n\n\n4.

NETANYAHU\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational spat: U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have never been buddies, but they didn't fight in public, either.
