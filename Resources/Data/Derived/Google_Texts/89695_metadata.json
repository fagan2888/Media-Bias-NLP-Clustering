(Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\nDouglas F. Gansler was the envy of Maryland\u2019s political world in early 2013, as he openly mulled a campaign for governor.\n\nAlready undefeated in two statewide races, Gansler had a robust record of accomplishment and $5.2 million in his campaign account \u2014 more than three times what had been amassed by Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, his chief rival in the race to succeed Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D).\n\nTo many Democratic strategists, Gansler was the undisputed front-runner, a stature that made his humiliating defeat in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary all the more remarkable.\n\nAfter 16 years as one of Maryland\u2019s most prominent leaders, a man whose political ambition once seemed as vast as his potential, Gansler saw his career stall at the moment he expected to celebrate a crowning achievement.\n\nHis collapse resulted from an array of factors, say allies and political strategists, beginning with the timing of his announcement, which occurred months after Brown\u2019s. In the interim, Brown chose as his running mate Ken Ulman, the Howard County executive whose $2 million war chest helped neutralize Gansler\u2019s fundraising edge.\n\n\u201cEighteen months ago, Doug was the candidate to beat,\u201d said Mike Morrill, a Democratic strategist and a former Gansler campaign adviser. \u201cBy the time Doug came to what he thought was the starting line, the race was already underway, and he was behind.\u201d\n\nOn election night, the numbers told a story of political devastation. From Baltimore to Garrett County, Brown built a lead of nearly 30 percentage points over Gansler, who strained in some areas to keep up with Del. Heather R. Mizeur (Montgomery), once regarded as the race\u2019s long shot.\n\nEven in Montgomery County, where Gansler lives and launched his political career, Brown swamped him by nearly 15,000 votes.\n\n\u201cWe fell short today, not because of a lack of hard work or conviction or dedication,\u201d Gansler told supporters Tuesday night, his voice a mix of defiance and resignation. \u201cWe worked hard. You all worked hard. But tomorrow we wake up, we shake off the dust, and we each do what we can to help others build a better life here in Maryland.\u201d\n\nFor months, his loyalists were baffled by his struggle to mount a more competitive campaign. After all, he had risen from state\u2019s attorney in Montgomery County to attorney general with relative ease.\n\nIf his adversaries and even allies sometimes lampooned his inartful candor, if they derided him as a grandstanding, lacrosse-loving frat boy, they also predicted that he could be a formidable contender for governor.\n\n\u201cI believed Doug was a master strategist,\u201d said Del. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), a supporter. \u201cAnd I was pretty sure he would have the political campaign to get it done.\u201d\n\n1 of 35 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Marylanders go to the polls Tuesday View Photos In the Maryland primary, voters will choose candidates for governor, attorney general and local offices.

Brown had the support of O\u2019Malley and the Democratic establishment, and the historic distinction of potentially becoming the state\u2019s first black governor.\n\nYet no Maryland lieutenant governor had ever won the premier job, and Brown was largely unknown to voters. His main responsibility as O\u2019Malley\u2019s deputy \u2014 overseeing the implementation of the Affordable Health Care Act \u2014 was considered a fiasco.\n\nGansler forfeited whatever advantages he had soon after announcing his candidacy, when he was stung by revelations that he ordered state troopers to violate traffic laws and that he hadn\u2019t stopped apparent underage drinking at a party his son attended.\n\nThe stories allowed Brown to portray Gansler as reckless and undisciplined, chatter that dominated the race as voters began paying attention.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t make your campaign about big things, the media and your opponent will make it about little things real fast,\u201d said state Sen. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Montgomery), a longtime friend. \u201cHis campaign got buried in petty distractions right from the beginning.\u201d\n\nGansler was further weakened, strategists said, by not investing enough in ground-level campaign operations in key counties such as Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s.\n\nEugene Grant, Seat Pleasant\u2019s mayor and a Gansler supporter, said he urged the campaign to hire workers to knock on doors. Instead, he said, Gansler relied on volunteers, who \u201ccan\u2019t be out there seven days a week.\u201d\n\nGansler\u2019s biggest failure, perhaps, was not finding a transcendent issue to electrify voters. His message often was muddled. He pleased progressives by trumpeting the environment and then made a show of advocating a pro-business cut in the corporate income tax.\n\nBy spring, as polls showed him trailing by more than 20 points, Gansler resorted to attacking Brown, at times so aggressively that he upset his own supporters.\n\n\u201cMost observers found the distinguishing, core rationale for the Gansler candidacy to be in\u00adcred\u00adibly unclear and unsettled,\u201d said Keith Haller, a Maryland pollster. \u201cIf the political junkies couldn\u2019t figure it out, you can imagine how murky it must have been for average Democrats.\u201d\n\nAs he greeted prospective voters in Bethesda on Monday, Gansler told reporters that his campaign had \u201cdone a great job\u201d and said he was \u201cconfident we\u2019re going to win.\u201d He declined an opportunity to assess his own missteps. Instead, he talked about his campaign facing an \u201cuphill climb,\u201d because Brown took contributions from special interests.\n\nNone of that concerned Sabina Radin, 56, a special education teacher, as she approached him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bring up something \u2014 the party,\u201d she said, a reference to the Beach Week incident, requiring Gansler to patiently explain himself yet again.\n\nHours later, as Brown and Mizeur hosted rallies, Gansler retreated to a place he has always loved: a lacrosse field. At one point, he had the ball and was zig-zagging through a thicket of defenders, looking for his moment to score.\n\n\u201cGive it up, Dougie! Give it up!\u201d his coach yelled. But Gansler kept the ball, still running, still searching for his opening.\n\nJenna Johnson contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "mdpolitics, doug gansler, anthony brown, maryland governor's race, gansler loses, gansler's fall, lacross, heather mizeur, gansler war chest, gansler money, gansler campaign,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Popular attorney general had good reputation, huge war chest \u2014 but lost big in primary to Anthony Brown.", "title": "What happened to Doug Gansler?
