(WLFI) \u2014 Trinity Life Ministry is a faith-based operation in Lafayette and for the past 20 years, it has been a helping hand in the community.\n\nJust within the past decade, the ministry has focused on helping men struggling with addictions through their life-recovery program.\n\n\u201cRipple effects of addiction affect every member of the family and every member of the household, so if we can get to the men first we have a much better success rate in seeing that family change,\u201d said Trinity Life Ministry Executive Director Phil Gabriel.\n\nTrinity hosts a 21-week residence program that helps the men overcome addiction.\n\nThrough the course of the program, the men are housed at a residence in Crawfordsville.\n\nOnce the program is completed, the men participate in a graduation ceremony.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve probably helped over 1,000 men get back to their families and become contributors to their community and to their families,\u201d said Gabriel\n\nFunding for the program comes from a variety of sources including churches, organizations and two thrift shops Trinity operates.\n\nThe thrift shops are located in Lafayette and Crawfordsville. They generate 25 percent of the funding for the program.\n\nRecently, the Purdue Navy ROTC decided to give a hand as well.\n\n\u201cWe had the idea of a clothing drive because it would be a good way to give back to the community,\u201d said Purdue Navy ROTC member Ryan Barry.\n\nTrinity Life Ministry Director of Community Partnerships and Ministries Joe Radzikowski said, \u201cTo get a phone call from Purdue and the Navy ROTC just out of the blue is really special.\u201d\n\nThe clothing drive, known as the White Out, collected general clothing from the community for the men in the program.\n\nOver the course of the four weeks clothing was collected, four large boxes were filled.\n\nAlong with donations from the community, the Navy ROTC purchased new white T-shirts and socks.\n\n\u201cPurdue, it\u2019s a second home for most of us for about four years and while we\u2019re here we want to make sure we leave a good foot print on there,\u201d said Barry. \u201cIt\u2019s all about giving back and serving and doing what we can to help out.\u201d\n\nIt costs around $8,500 to put each man through the 21-week program.\n\nFor more information, you can visit their website.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAFAYETTE, Ind.
