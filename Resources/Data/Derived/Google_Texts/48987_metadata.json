The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office made the announcement today after a two-year investigation.\n\nThe dealers used force, fraud, and coercion to make their money, according to Sergeant Dave Allmond of the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation, one of the agencies involved in the bust.\n\n\u201cThey not only profit off selling the drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey profit off stringing out the prostitutes and earning money from them. This was a very sophisticated, complicated organization that involved a lot of people.\u201d\n\nHe said many of the defendants are repeating drug offenders who made hundreds of dollars a day off the sex workers. Agents discovered $10,000 when they busted the operation.\n\nAllmond said they have rescued at least twenty sex trafficking victims so far, including a child.\n\n\u201cLike any long-term investigation, we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do because now we\u2019re going to identify some of the people that were arrested. Actually, once we debrief them, they could actually be victims,\u201d he added.\n\nThe defendants face felony charges including drug charges, racketeering, and human trafficking.\n\nThe Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Highway Patrol, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will continue the investigation in hopes of targeting traffickers and finding more victims.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "An investigation into a heroin and sex trafficking ring has ended with the arrest of more than two dozen people.
