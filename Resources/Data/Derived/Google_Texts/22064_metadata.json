Downton said he had to sell that business as a result of cuts to independent imaging imposed by federal health care regulations.\n\n\u201cObamacare really destroyed that, and that\u2019s what motivated me to get more involved in that [legislative] process,\u201d Downton said.\n\nIn 2012, he ran unsuccessfully for state representative against an incumbent in west Travis County.\n\nNow, Downton is running for the Texas Senate District 24 seat, which Troy Fraser will vacate at the end of his term.\n\nDownton considers illegal immigration, water and education some of the most important issues at a state level.\n\nHe mentioned concerns that entities downstream of District 24 are attempting to take water from users upstream.\n\nOn immigration, Downton encouraged the enforcement of E-verify to prevent businesses from employing illegal immigrants.\n\nHe also advocates eliminating sanctuary cities, in which local government prevents the enforcement of federal immigration law.\n\nThe candidate said those are steps that can be taken at the state level, while he still believes the federal government should do more to address illegal immigration.\n\nDownton said a wall on the border should be considered as one of several options to address the influx of illegal aliens.\n\nOn another issue, Downton voiced his support for parents to have school choice. He also favors more options in curriculum, adding that he wants the next generation to have the same opportunity his generation has.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a 6-year-old, and he\u2019s in a lot of ways my motivation for working,\u201d Downton said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all [solution].\u201d\n\nDownton is concerned that many students are graduating unprepared for the workforce. The candidate said schools should offer technical training in addition to college preparation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to try to force every student to go to college,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Salado resident added that property taxes \u2013 a major source of funding for schools \u2013 are too high.\n\n\u201cI think the fairest way to tax [is] an end-user consumption tax,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMy first choice is to cut taxes as much as possible.\u201d\n\nHe also favors reducing business regulations, which he said lead to a stagnant economy and a lack of new jobs.\n\n\u201cSmall business is really the backbone of the Texas economy,\u201d Downton said.\n\nThe candidate has overseen two businesses of different scale and size. Platinum Diagnostic Imaging had nine employees; Little River Health Care has about 900 employees, including about 150 physicians.\n\nDownton originally is from upstate New York. After he received an MBA from Vanderbilt University, the University of Texas School of Law offered him a scholarship.\n\n\u201c[I] came down here, fell in love with the state, fell in love with the people,\u201d he said.\n\nDownton practiced with international law firms and also served as general counsel to the Texas House of Representatives.\n\nIn 2011, he defended the Texas Legislature\u2019s redistricting maps in trials in San Antonio, Washington, D.C. and before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in court ever since,\u201d he said.\n\nDownton said while other candidates talk about their conservative stances, he has a unique record of defending his positions in court against the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat and my business background make me a great candidate for this district,\u201d he added.\n\nDownton voiced his support for the right to bear arms and conservative social values.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Second Amendment advocate,\u201d he said, adding that current Texas gun laws are, overall, in a good state.\n\nThe State Senate hopeful also said he is \u201cnot in favor of telling the police how to do their job in regard to all aspects [including] their safety...\u201d\n\nIn discussing social issues, Downton said, \u201cI\u2019m a very staunch pro-life advocate, and I think Texas needs to be leading the fight to protect life.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to continue to challenge Supreme Court precedence ...Roe v. Wade was one of the worst decisions in history,\u201d he added.\n\nIn response to the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, Downton said Texas probably needs additional legislation to affirm the right of individuals and clergy to practice their religion.\n\n\u201cMarriage is a religious issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Downton said his \u201cbiggest personal message\u201d is \u201cI\u2019m not running for myself. I\u2019m running for our next generation. We need to ensure we elect the right leaders to go to Austin and represent our values.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Lampasas Dispatch Record", "description": "Ryan Downton became motivated to run for office after seeing the effects of federal government action on his business.\nDownton, a Republican from Salado, is president of Little River Health Care in Temple, a hospital and provider network.", "title": "Business leader runs for Texas Senate District 24", "headline": "Business leader runs for Texas Senate District 24", "image": "http://www.lampasasdispatchrecord.com/sites/www.lampasasdispatchrecord.com/files/images/2015-11-17/3p1.jpg", "url": "http://www.lampasasdispatchrecord.com/news/2015-11-17/Front_Page/Business_leader_runs_for_Texas_Senate_District_24.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ourhometowninc", "image": "http://www.lampasasdispatchrecord.com/sites/www.lampasasdispatchrecord.com/files/images/2015-11-17/3p1.jpg", "description": "Ryan Downton became motivated to run for office after seeing the effects of federal government action on his business.\nDownton, a Republican from Salado, is president of Little River Health Care in Temple, a hospital and provider network.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Business leader runs for Texas Senate District 24"}}, "article_summary": "Business leader runs for Texas Senate District 24By JEFF LOWE Staff WriterRyan Downton became motivated to run for office after seeing the effects of federal government action on his business.\nNow, Downton is running for the Texas Senate District 24 seat, which Troy Fraser will vacate at the end of his term.\n\u201cThat and my business background make me a great candidate for this district,\u201d he added.\nHe mentioned concerns that entities downstream of District 24 are attempting to take water from users upstream.\n\u201cSmall business is really the backbone of the Texas economy,\u201d Downton said."}
