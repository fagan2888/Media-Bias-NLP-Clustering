BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — When Belgium needed a final push to stay in the World Cup, off went Eden Hazard — off to the bench that is. The player touted to become one of the defining figures in the tournament never was a match for Argentina’s Lionel Messi in Saturday’s quarterfinal match, and never an inspiring leader to his team.

While Messi left the pitch his fists shaking in celebration and encouraging the tens of thousands of Argentina fans after the 1-0 win, Hazard stood with hands to his side, forlorn and alone.

Substituted in the closing stages of the match, the Chelsea playmaker had rarely showed any positive emotions during the tournament and four victories for Belgium.
