Right? (Photo: a katz/Shutterstock)\n\nChances are you heard some blatantly untrue statements during last night\u2019s debate. It\u2019s a cynical, manipulative strategy, but it works: Psychological studies have consistently shown that oft-repeated statements are more likely to be perceived as true, regardless of their actual veracity.\n\nSince this \u201cIllusory Truth Effect\u201d was first noted in the late 1970s, it has been widely assumed that this ploy is effective only on people unfamiliar with the issue in question. Knowledge of the subject matter will lead people to dismiss the lie and distrust the liar, one might assume.\n\nBut a newly published study reports that\u2019s not necessarily true: Even those of us with a solid grasp of the issue at hand are susceptible to this sort of misinformation.\n\n\u201cReading a statement like \u2018A sari is the name of the short plaid skirt worn by Scots\u2019 increased participants\u2019 later belief that it was true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results of two experiments suggest that people sometimes fail to bring their knowledge to bear\u201d when evaluating a statement, a research team led by Vanderbilt University psychologist Lisa Fazio writes in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. Rather, we rely on \u201cfluency\u201d \u2014 the ease or difficulty of comprehending a piece of information.\n\nStatements you\u2019ve heard many times are easier to process, and this ease leads people \u201cto the sometimes false conclusion that they are more truthful,\u201d the researchers write. Their key \u2014 and disheartening \u2014 revelation is that they found examples of this unfortunate dynamic \u201ceven when participants knew better.\u201d\n\nThe first of their experiments featured 40 Duke University undergraduates. Each was presented with a series of statements \u2014 some true, some false. Half of these referred to pieces of common knowledge, making falsehoods relatively easy to spot; the others featured relatively obscure facts (or \u201cfacts\u201d), making the discrimination process somewhat trickier.\n\nAfterwards, participants were given a set of 176 statements \u2014 some of which were repeats from the aforementioned first phase of the experiment \u2014 and asked to label each on a scale of one (\u201cdefinitely false\u201d) to six (\u201cdefinitely true\u201d).\n\nFinally, participants answered 176 multiple-choice questions to assess their actual knowledge of the statements they had rated. For instance, they were asked \u201cWhat is the largest ocean on Earth?\u201d and given three options: Pacific (true), Atlantic (the false answer they had previously been exposed to), or Don\u2019t Know.\n\nThe researchers found that repeated falsehoods were more likely to be accepted as accurate, \u201cregardless of whether stored knowledge could have been used to direct a contradiction.\u201d To put it more bluntly: \u201cRepetition increased perceived truthfulness, even for contradictions of well-known facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cReading a statement like \u2018A sari is the name of the short plaid skirt worn by Scots\u2019 increased participants\u2019 later belief that it was true,\u201d Fazio and her colleagues write, \u201ceven if they could correctly answer the question \u2018What is the name of the short pleated skirt worn by Scots?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat finding kilt me.\n\nThe second experiment was a simplified version of the first. This time, the participants (40 different Duke undergrads) judged statements as \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cuntrue,\u201d rather than using a six-point scale. The researchers found the illusory-truth effect once again emerged, even for common-knowledge subjects where falsehoods should have been easy to detect.\n\nSo before you declare that Obamacare is a disaster (it\u2019s actually working well) or vaccines cause cancer (they don\u2019t), consider how that notion got into your head, and whether it aligns with what you actually know. If there\u2019s some question, check it out with an actual expert.\n\nRepeating a falsehood won\u2019t make it true, but it may make you think it is true.\n\nFindings is a daily column by Pacific Standard staff writer Tom Jacobs, who scours the psychological-research journals to discover new insights into human behavior, ranging from the origins of our political beliefs to the cultivation of creativity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Tom Jacobs \u00b6\n\nChances are you heard some blatantly untrue statements during last night\u2019s debate.
