With 122 remaining, though, it\u2019s unlikely he will close the facility by the time his term ends.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is only going to be in office for two more years. You can never predict what his successor may do,\u201d said David Remes, a human rights lawyer who represents 18 Guantanamo detainees. \u201cThe policy is only as firm as the president who adopted it.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama asked Congress last week to approve a three-year authorization to take military action against the Islamic State, meaning it will cover the first year of the next president\u2019s term. The draft specifically called for repealing the 2002 authorization but didn\u2019t touch the 2001 authorization, even though Mr. Obama said it needs to be repealed or revised.\n\nA revision, however, would set up a tricky legal battle over the fate of the detainees still at the prison.\n\nShoon Murray, a professor at American University who wrote \u201cThe Terror Authorization: The History and Politics of the 2001 AUMF,\u201d said the 2002 authorization doesn\u2019t affect Guantanamo because none of the detainees was captured on the battlefield in Iraq. All were caught as part of the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the broader war on terrorism, which are part of the 2001 authorization.\n\n\u201cGuantanamo Bay is certainly a difficult issue. It\u2019s something you\u2019d have to address if you repealed 2001 AUMF,\u201d Ms. Murray said.\n\nTwo Democratic senators introduced a bill last week that would sunset the 2001 authorization in three years. Sens. Christopher Murphy of Connecticut and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland said the authorization from more than a decade ago \u201cdid not authorize a perpetual war.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Cardin said the bill \u201callows sufficient time, three years, for the president and Congress to find a sustainable solution that will allow Gitmo to close its doors.\u201d\n\nMs. Murray said there isn\u2019t any precedent for what would happen to detainees if the 2001 authorization is repealed because the resolution is the strongest case for continued detention.\n\nMr. Remes said it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will take any prisoners while battling the Islamic State because a large U.S. ground presence isn\u2019t expected and allied armies in the region probably won\u2019t hand over detainees to Americans.\n\nIf prisoners of war are taken, Mr. Remes said, the administration likely will try them in U.S. courts on federal criminal charges. Mr. Obama has said he won\u2019t send any more prisoners to Guantanamo.\n\n\u201cWith or without the authorization, he could claim the power to send captives to Guantanamo, but I think that this administration has rejected that model for any number of reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that the circumstances that gave rise to Guantanamo are very unlikely to occur, and Guantanamo is likely to prove to have been a one-off.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have resisted the president\u2019s promise to close the prison, saying enemies should not be released while the country is at war. They say released detainees could rejoin the fight and American troops could face militants they\u2019ve already captured.\n\nAsked whether another war authorization would strengthen this argument, Mr. Remes said a bigger threat to closing the prison is a bill from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican, that passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.\n\nThe bill would essentially end all transfers during the remaining years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency by tightening transfer rules, ending all transfers to Yemen, extending a ban on transfers to the U.S. and prohibiting any transfer of medium- and high-risk detainees.\n\nMs. Ayotte and other Republican sponsors have said that, especially in the wake of terrorist attacks in Europe, it\u2019s irresponsible to empty the prison without a clear strategy of ensuring that the detainees don\u2019t hurt Americans or allies after their release.\n\nShe said she was told that the bill could get a vote in the full Senate soon. No Democrats supported the legislation in committee.\n\nThough the president has vowed to veto the bill if it passes, \u201cI think if it goes through as a free-standing bill, that is a credible threat,\u201d Mr. Remes said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The push for a new war authorization to fight the Islamic State group does nothing to change the 2001 fight against al Qaeda, leaving the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open and meaning President Obama's successor could refill the prison he has rapidly been emptying.", "Author": "Jacqueline Klimas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The push for a new war authorization to fight the Islamic State group does nothing to change the 2001 fight against al Qaeda, leaving the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open and meaning President Obama\u2019s successor could refill the prison he has rapidly been emptying.", "title": "Obama leaves al Qaeda war resolution intact, keeping Guantanamo open", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/17/obama-leaves-al-qaeda-war-resolution-intact-keepin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/17/2_172015_ap538177495858201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/17/2_172015_ap538177495858201.jpg", "title": "Obama leaves al Qaeda war resolution intact, keeping Guantanamo open", "description": "The push for a new war authorization to fight the Islamic State group does nothing to change the 2001 fight against al Qaeda, leaving the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open and meaning Presiden", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, David Remes, Barack Obama, Shoon Murray"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08cd\"", "article_summary": "You can never predict what his successor may do,\u201d said David Remes, a human rights lawyer who represents 18 Guantanamo detainees.\nThe draft specifically called for repealing the 2002 authorization but didn\u2019t touch the 2001 authorization, even though Mr. Obama said it needs to be repealed or revised.\nIf prisoners of war are taken, Mr. Remes said, the administration likely will try them in U.S. courts on federal criminal charges.\nMr. Obama has said he won\u2019t send any more prisoners to Guantanamo.\nAll were caught as part of the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the broader war on terrorism, which are part of the 2001 authorization."}
