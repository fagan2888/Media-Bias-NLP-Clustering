A sergeant eventually came to the cell and cut the inmate down.\n\nOthers cited by Mitchell included a deputy who brought a large knife into a jail pod to cut food, and another deputy who was fired for turning off the lights and allowing inmates to watch music videos on a department computer.\n\nMitchell sent the letter Wednesday to the City Council, Mayor Michael Hancock, the sheriff reform executive steering committee and several other public officials. The Denver Post obtained a copy.\n\nIn addition, the seven-member Citizen Oversight Board wrote a letter and signed a resolution in support of Mitchell\u2019s findings.\n\nThe board\u2019s letter and resolution also criticized the sheriff\u2019s department and Denver Police Department for failing to provide the monitor with full access to records.\n\nThe oversight board\u2019s members called for a new city ordinance that would require those departments to hand over more documents to the independent monitor.\n\nMitchell addressed his letter to Councilman Paul Lopez, chairman of the safety and well-being committee and a member of the sheriff reform committee. The letter is a response to the council\u2019s oral and written requests for his input on the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s ongoing troubles, Mitchell wrote.\n\nLopez said he had requested Mitchell\u2019s insight into the ongoing problems with excessive force and wanted to learn whether some problems could be addressed through city ordinances, including one that would force the police and sheriff\u2019s departments to hand over more documents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a loud statement,\u201d Lopez said of the resolution. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the Office of the Independent Monitor would not have access to those documents. That\u2019s what the citizens of Denver expect for his office.\u201d\n\nStephanie O\u2019Malley, executive director of Denver\u2019s safety department, said she was not surprised by Mitchell\u2019s findings. All of them have been raised by various people as the city attempts to reform its sheriff\u2019s department.\n\n\u201cI find no disagreement in any of the things he has observed,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\n\nThe monitor\u2019s observations will be included in a report given to the private consulting firm eventually hired to lead the reform, she said.\n\nAs for providing more documents to the monitor\u2019s office, O\u2019Malley said, \u201cI understand his desire, but there are legal considerations that have to be taken into account.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s letter identified eight areas that need attention. Some suggestions would require money and time to address, such as examining the role that inmate mental illness plays inside jail walls.\n\nOthers, however, could be addressed more quickly.\n\nFor example, the sheriff\u2019s department retains footage from its security cameras for only 30 days, including in cases of excessive force, unless a complaint is filed, Mitchell wrote.\n\nBut inmates often wait until they are released to file complaints about excessive force because they fear retaliation. By then, the video is gone. He cited at least one recent case that was compromised because video had been deleted.\n\n\u201cBecause there currently is no requirement that video of all uses of force be preserved beyond thirty days, video is sometimes deleted by the time the inmate actually files his/her complaint,\u201d the letter said.\n\nAs for the problem of sergeants who don\u2019t actively walk the cell blocks, Mitchell said it was a serious problem at the Downtown Detention Center.\n\nThe primary responsibility of sergeants is to supervise deputies and keep their fingers on the pulse of the inmate population. At the downtown jail, deputies often are left alone with large groups of inmates for hours at a time. As a result, problems flare up, Mitchell wrote.\n\n\u201cContact between sergeants and deputies is one of the primary ways that a jail is able to set, convey and reinforce its performance expectations to deputies,\u201d the letter said.\n\nMitchell said he interviewed several deputies and sergeants who agreed with his finding.\n\n\u201cThese sergeants, and others, expressed frustration with these limitations, noting that they would be actively supervising deputies if not for the burden of managing the shift roster and completing associated paperwork,\u201d the letter said.\n\nOther remarks made by the independent monitor:\n\n\u2022 Deputies should fill out more detailed use-of-force reports. And sergeants should speak with inmates or witnesses, view video footage or review medical records when assessing use-of-force reports.\n\n\u2022 An electronic system that accounts for deputies making their required rounds through cells should measure whether the rounds were comprehensive or whether deputies simply walked through.\n\n\u2022 A computerized system designed to alert supervisors to problems with individual deputies should be expanded to track inmate complaints and lawsuits.\n\n\u2022 The disciplinary process takes too long, and penalties for inappropriate force should be strengthened to discourage misconduct.\n\n\u2022 Deputies are not certified peace officers, but they are granted limited law enforcement powers. However, the department\u2019s policy is confusing and needs revising. As a result, some deputies have exceeded their limited powers and gotten into trouble.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Too much paperwork, not enough oversight at Denver jail, monitor says", "title": "Too much paperwork, not enough oversight at Denver jail, monitor says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/10/too-much-paperwork-not-enough-oversight-at-denver-jail-monitor-says/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140910__20140910__taekwondo-kickp1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140910__20140910__taekwondo-kickp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-10T19:57:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:40:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Jail"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce44a\"", "article_summary": "The board\u2019s letter and resolution also criticized the sheriff\u2019s department and Denver Police Department for failing to provide the monitor with full access to records.\nAll of them have been raised by various people as the city attempts to reform its sheriff\u2019s department.\nDenver Sheriff Department sergeants often fail to check on deputies guarding inmates as they juggle paperwork and fill vacancies in upcoming shifts, according to a letter by city Independent Monitor Nick Mitchell.\nThe lack of oversight leads to problems with deputy misconduct, including excessive force, Mitchell wrote in a 15-page letter outlining problems he has found while monitoring deputy conduct.\nIn addition, the seven-member Citizen Oversight Board wrote a letter and signed a resolution in support of Mitchell\u2019s findings."}
