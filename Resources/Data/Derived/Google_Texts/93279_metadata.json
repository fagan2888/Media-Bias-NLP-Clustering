The informant would meet Schomaker to give him the refunded cash, the affidavit says.\n\nThe informant told investigators Schomaker was the source of bogus receipts and bar codes for six other people, the document says.\n\nDetective George D. Moffett arranged for the informant to have a recorded telephone conversation with Schomaker, during which they discussed future meetings and the scheme, the affidavit says. The informant met Schomaker on two occasions, and was wearing a recording device, the document says.\n\nAt the first meeting, Schomaker discussed making the fraudulent bar codes that he would give to the informant at a second meeting, the affidavit says.\n\nAt that meeting, which was not at the Palm Harbor house, he gave the informant three fraudulent Wal-Mart receipts and 14 fraudulent bar codes, all designed to defraud the retail giant, the affidavit says. On the back of the fraudulent bar codes, Schomaker jotted down the merchandise to which the bar codes were to be attached, the document says.\n\nSchomaker used an application on his cell phone to scan the bar code to make sure it would scan properly at Wal-Mart, reflecting the bogus lower price, the affidavit says. Some did not scan properly, and Schomaker told the informant to meet him at the house, where he would print new bar codes, the affidavit says.\n\nA Wal-Mart investigator confirmed that the receipts and bar codes sheriff's investigators collected are fraudulent, the affidavit says.\n\nsthompson@tampatrib.com.
