With due diligence in mind, small businesses are weeding out the myths and focusing on what\u2019s possible for employers and their teams.\n\nHere are some facts small business owners need to know about health insurance reimbursement in 2016:\n\nHealth insurance reimbursements are still compliant, if set up correctly.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of buzz about a modification to the Affordable Care Act that will penalize employers who reimburse employees for individual non-group health plans \u2014 to the tune of $100 a day or $36,500 per year. However, Section 105 Defined Contribution Plans which are structured as group plans and meet applicable regulations remain fully compliant and offer a tax-free benefit.\n\nSmall business employers are able to make tax-free payroll reimbursements through a Section 105 Pure Defined Contribution Health Plan. This type of plan can reimburse health insurance premiums up to a certain monthly amount. You may also hear this referred to as a Healthcare Reimbursement Plan (HRP).\n\nPayroll reimbursements are different than payroll deductions.\n\nAs opposed to a payroll deduction \u2014 the removal of dollars from a paycheck \u2014 a payroll reimbursement is the addition of dollars to a paycheck. When a small business reimburses employees through a Section 105 Pure Defined Contribution Health Plan, gross salaries are unaffected.\n\nThe employer adds the dollars that have been approved for employees' qualified insurance premiums to their paychecks using a nontaxable line item. It\u2019s also called a \"tax-free addition\" or \"negative deduction.\u201d\n\nWith rising insurance costs, employees are looking for support.\n\nHigh-deductible health plans and rising premiums are major trends in health insurance. Many employers are shifting expenses to employees with increased deductibles and surcharges for insuring a spouse.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation's 2015 Employer Health Benefits Survey, the average deductible for workers who have plans with deductibles nearly doubled in the past decade, from $584 in 2006 to $1,318 in 2015.\n\nMany small businesses are inviting their employees to sign up for individual medical policies through the Health Insurance Marketplace, as part of a Defined Contribution Health Plan with payroll reimbursements.\n\nEmployees are finding this system valuable, as individual health insurance plans cost 20 percent less than traditional group health insurance, on average. Also, premium tax credits that are available to eligible employees through the Marketplace provide additional savings.\n\nReimbursement levels tailored to individual or family needs.\n\nSmall businesses can set reimbursement levels, based on family status or job criteria, that make the most sense to both the employer and staff members, who receive a monthly allowance that accrues in their healthcare balances.\n\nIn conjunction with employees choosing their individual insurance polices in the Marketplace, right-sized reimbursement levels that are chosen at the company level provide optimal customization of health benefits.\n\nSmall businesses are seeing results \u2014 and responding.\n\nCompany-provided health insurance reimbursements are a cost-effective way to offer health benefits to small business employees \u2014 in a time when rising costs are a major concern. Employers are responding, as it\u2019s estimated that 60 percent of small businesses will adopt individual health insurance and premium reimbursement solutions by 2017.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs healthcare costs and insurance policy premiums rise in unison, health insurance reimbursements as part of Section 105 Defined Contribution Plans have emerged as cost-effective solutions that both employers and employees embrace.\n\nWhat questions do you have about health insurance reimbursements?", "article_metadata": {"description": "As healthcare costs and insurance premiums rise, there is important information small business owners need to know about health insurance reimbursement.", "generator": "HubSpot", "author": "Zane Benefits", "og": {"url": "https://www.zanebenefits.com/blog/what-small-business-owners-need-to-know-about-health-insurance-reimbursement", "image": "https://www.zanebenefits.com/hubfs/38_what-small-business-owners-need-to-know-about-small-business-health-ins-reimbursement.png#keepProtocol", "type": "article", "description": "As healthcare costs and insurance premiums rise, there is important information small business owners need to know about health insurance reimbursement.", "title": "What Small Business Owners Need to Know About Health Insurance Reimbursement"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.zanebenefits.com", "description": "As healthcare costs and insurance premiums rise, there is important information small business owners need to know about health insurance reimbursement.", "title": "What Small Business Owners Need to Know About Health Insurance Reimbursement", "image": "https://www.zanebenefits.com/hubfs/38_what-small-business-owners-need-to-know-about-small-business-health-ins-reimbursement.png#keepProtocol", "site": "@ZaneBenefits", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "256E88F12993108A589354994D3B732D", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here are some facts small business owners need to know about health insurance reimbursement in 2016:Health insurance reimbursements are still compliant, if set up correctly.\nEmployees are finding this system valuable, as individual health insurance plans cost 20 percent less than traditional group health insurance, on average.\nHigh-deductible health plans and rising premiums are major trends in health insurance.\nCompany-provided health insurance reimbursements are a cost-effective way to offer health benefits to small business employees \u2014 in a time when rising costs are a major concern.\nFrom TV news stories to Internet articles and simple word of mouth, misconceptions and falsehoods muddy the waters of small business health insurance plans on a regular basis."}
