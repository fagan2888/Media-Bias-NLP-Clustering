Throughout the summer, author Dan Libman interviewed voters in their neighborhood bars, asking about their political concerns ahead of the election. After a beer or two they opened up about Obamacare, the economy and redistricting. Now, with `last call' looming -- at the bars and the polls -- Dan asked the regulars what issues they want the candidates to address. Read the peoples' opinions in Dan's essay below. And don't forget: Vote responsibly.\n\nThe novelist Richard Powers lived for a time among us, and set one of his books, Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, in DeKalb. Reflecting on his home town, the character Artie sullenly thinks, \u201cWith as little as DeKalb, Illinois, had to offer\u2014nothing except for being the place where barbed wire was invented\u2014there was nevertheless a stretch of fourteen days in fall where no better place on Earth existed.\u201d Clearly written of a time before Cindy Crawford announced her presence to the world.\n\nI heartily endorse the part celebrating a Midwest autumn. You know the drill: painted gourds, corn mazes, cider donuts, all while the humidity and bugs have finally abated. And it was during this salubrious autumn of the soul when I engaged in some of the most spirited political conversations of the election. For example with Andy, whom I met at Fatty\u2019s. He says one of the \u201cbigger issues\u201d he\u2019s paying attention to is the legalization of marijuana.\n\n\u201cI think the state government should look deeply and realize that Colorado and Washington are going to benefit greatly from the legalization of marijuana,\" he said. \"I think it\u2019s a way for states to tax as much as they wish in order to try and decrease the deficit that our state clearly has right now. Huge deficit.\n\n\"If there is any way for us to try and close that gap,this is one option to look at. I think it would be nice if Illinois could lead the way in this, much like Colorado and Washington. It would be beneficial to our state.\u201d\n\nJust down the street in DeKalb\u2019s Irish bar O\u2019Leary\u2019s I walked in on Ty, Ross and Steve already engaged in a long-running political conversation: a weekly afternoon suds-enhanced colloquy. Ty started by filling me in on one of his pet topics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too many tradesman I know who are and willing to work -- and even willing to work for less than union wages -- that will get things done, but the work is not out there. We need a public works program,\" Ty asserted. \"People who complain about taxes have to understand that someone paid for their education, someone paid for their kid\u2019s education. You have to pay it forward. It\u2019s part of the system and, if you don\u2019t do it, there is no civilized society and it doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s what made America great and, if you keep playing with it, America is going to be third world.\u201d\n\nHis drinking buddy Steve had more corporeal concerns. \u201cEbola. Just the reality that somebody\u2019s going to cough in a plane and it\u2019s going to spread around the world.\u201d\n\nI asked Steve what he wanted to hear the politicians say about Ebola, and he told me simply, \u201cThat they have a plan. And it doesn\u2019t seem like they do.\u201d\n\nIllinois\u2019s great city up north -- second city to The Second City -- Rockford has also appeared in several works of literature. To Saul Bellow, Rockford represented an unjaded, unsophisticated ear, a counterpoint to the desire-crippled Eugene Henderson, who finds himself toward the end of Henderson the Rain King, on an airplane reeling after an African adventure. \u201cThe stewardess offered me a magazine to calm me down.... She was from Rockford, Illinois.\u201d And Henderson adds wistfully, \u201cEvery twenty years or so, the Earth renews itself in young maidens.\u201d\n\nI found that same spirit of genuine renewal in many of the political conversations I had in Rockford, for example, with a young couple at the Prairie Street Brewhouse.\n\n\u201cMaybe something that would change Rockford for the better,\u201d the wife began. \u201cEnhancing downtown, making it a better place.\u201d\n\nHer husband explained, \u201cWe don\u2019t live too far from downtown here. And the overall feeling of the downtown is not the place to go or to be. And I think that I would want to see that change. Places like this. Places that will bring people in. That whole hotel thing that they\u2019re going to go after would bring more people into the downtown and make it more of a destination rather than an eyesore.\u201d\n\nI found Dave and Tom down the road at Carlyle, the oldest of Rockford\u2019s currently operating microbreweries. Union guys both, we tucked into our Humulus IPAs and I asked Dave what he was hoping to hear from the politicians.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, he said. \u201cI just wish they would work together. I\u2019m tired of the fighting.\u201d\n\nHis drinking companion Tom jumped in. \u201cGet something done in Congress, you know? More bipartisanship.\u201d\n\nI asked Tom if he had any issues he was paying close attention to. \u201cI\u2019m a retired iron worker. I\u2019m for the labor movement,\" he said. \"I think these people out there vying for the minimum wage ... How can a young person make it on that $7.75 hour wage any more? I don\u2019t blame them.\n\n\"I think we're going to have a revolution and demand higher wages. It\u2019s just not right, you just can\u2019t live on those wages they pay now with the expense of everything. You can\u2019t make a living on that wage if you\u2019ve got double kids and driving a car.\u201d\n\nBack down in DeKalb, a conversation about the fast food workers with Marcia had a different tenor.\n\n\u201cI think people that are working at McDonald\u2019s, they should be working for minimum wage,\" Marcia said. \"Go get some training, go do something to get a better job. But that\u2019s a step in the right direction for them to kind of spur them on to do something.\u201d\n\nLo these many months of gazing at pressed-tin ceiling and the bottoms of too many pint glasses, all while talking to the men and women who work, vote and drink here in northern Illinois, I have to say I come away buoyed about the future. The poll results may not be exactly what I hope for in November, but the voters behind those results are engaged, serious, and paying attention. They are exactly what I hoped to find when I set out on this adventure.\n\nAnyone who says Americans have become apathetic about the political process should spend an evening hopping around the saloons with me. In fact, you probably should do that anyway.\n\n-- Dan Libman\n\nDan Libman is an NIU faculty member and craft beer aficionado.
