The Broncos will begin their postseason Sunday, Jan. 17 at 2:40 p.m. at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

The AFC will run through Denver after the Broncos’ 27-20 win over San Diego Sunday.

They will host the Pittsburgh Steelers, if they beat the Cincinnati Bengals, or the winner of the Kansas City Chiefs-Houston Texans matchup if the Bengals win.

A limited amount of tickets will go on sale Monday at 12 p.m. MT. Tickets will be available at all Ticketmaster locations by calling 1-800-745-3000 or visiting ticketmaster.com.

Tickets won’t be available at the Broncos Ticket Office until Tuesday (at the slim chance that there are still some left).

Prices range from $80-$230 for reserve seats and $275-$450 for club seats. There is a limit of four tickets per household.



Tickets will only be available to customers with a billing address in the Rocky Mountain region, which includes Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Western Kansas.

All the Broncos’ playoff games can be viewed on CBS, including the Super Bowl, if the Broncos make it that far.

If the Broncos win their opening round game, they would host the AFC Championship on Sunday Jan. 24 at 1:05 p.m. MT.
