Sunny Leone today said it was a dream come true for her to meet Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan at the special screening of Kaizad Gustad's 'Jackpot' in Mumbai.

Sunny, who was here to promote her Hindi film 'Jackpot',told reporters, "It (meeting Shahrukh) was a dream come true. I am a fan of Bollywood and those you have been watching on screen for years, happen to meet you, you feel extremely nice.They are so down to earth and humble."

On Naseeruddin Shah, who is cast opposite her in the film,she said it was a dream to act opposite the veteran actor, who commands immense respect in Bollywood.

"Working with Mr Naseer is a dream for me. You learn a lot on and off camera; how he conducts himself; how he acts on

camera. You learn as a new actor and new actress," she said.

"Hopefully people would say, yes Sunny you did a better job acting in this movie than your first one. For obvious reasons that you know your first movie you are nervous facing the camera but this film was extremely comfortable."

The 32-year-old Indo-Canadia adult film star, who made her return to India with reality show 'Bigg Boss', is hoping that people would like her performance in 'Jackpot'.

She said she is learning things about India and Bollywood,which is completely different from Hollywood.

"I have learnt so much over the last three years. It is almost like going to school again. I am learning Hindi, learning to dance and learning all these little things about this industry, how it works. It's completely different than Hollywood. I have been told how Katrina Kaif also learnt them all, slowly but surely," she added.

Indian-origin Sunny was born in Canada. She later moved to the US with her family. She was 19 when she ventured into the world of adult films. She made her Bollywood film debut

with 'Jism 2'.
