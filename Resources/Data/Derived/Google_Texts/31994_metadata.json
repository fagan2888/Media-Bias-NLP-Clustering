Her pandering is so outrageously and obviously false it makes no sense. \u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 11, 2016\n\nThere is no possible reason for an American child of six years old to have to know what abortion is....None. \u2014 Colonel (@laurakfillault) February 11, 2016\n\n@StevenErtelt @SOcean5 6 y/o's are more concerned with Sunday school snacks- I call bullshit \u2014 bee kay (@beekaytulsa) February 11, 2016\n\nHow does Chelsea get away w/saying crazy stuff like this? She also discussed Bush tax cuts as towers fell on 9/11. https://t.co/zTsWwZvg4f \u2014 Karol Markowicz (@karol) February 11, 2016\n\nTwo possibilities: 1) she's a bold-faced liar, or 2) she was a really creepy & depraved 6 year old. https://t.co/zE7GwjvQc5 \u2014 Sarah Rumpf (@rumpfshaker) February 11, 2016\n\nNow, while I'm not a Baptist and I've never been to church in Arkansas, but as someone who helped teach C.C.D. classes to kindergarteners at my parish for two years while I was in high school, I am positive that nothing involving abortion was ever mentioned to my students in my classroom. It's not appropriate to discuss abortion to someone who is that young, and that topic should be saved for someone who is more mature and able to understand what is happening. Further, most 6-year-olds I taught were far more concerned with coloring than social issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Umm..05/27/2016 8:14:20AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Umm.", "title": "Chelsea Clinton: I Left the Church at Age Six Over Abortion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/02/11/chelsea-clinton-i-left-the-church-at-age-six-over-abortion-n2118129", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/355/bce284e3-6561-405f-9207-608b8535e60f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Umm.", "title": "Chelsea Clinton: I Left the Church at Age Six Over Abortion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/02/11/chelsea-clinton-i-left-the-church-at-age-six-over-abortion-n2118129", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/355/bce284e3-6561-405f-9207-608b8535e60f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Chelsea Clinton: I Left the Church at Age Six Over Abortion, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and current Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said in an interview at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser that she left the Baptist church because she was not happy that she was told about abortion when she was a 6-year-old.\n\u201cI was raised in a Methodist church and I left the Baptist church before my dad did, because I didn\u2019t know why they were talking to me about abortion when I was 6 in Sunday school \u2014 that\u2019s a true story.\u201d \u201cMy mother is very deeply a person of faith,\u201d Chelsea said.\nthat they question our faith,\u2019 said Chelsea.\n\u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) February 11, 2016There is no possible reason for an American child of six years old to have to know what abortion is....None.\nhttps://t.co/zE7GwjvQc5 \u2014 Sarah Rumpf (@rumpfshaker) February 11, 2016Now, while I'm not a Baptist and I've never been to church in Arkansas, but as someone who helped teach C.C.D."}
