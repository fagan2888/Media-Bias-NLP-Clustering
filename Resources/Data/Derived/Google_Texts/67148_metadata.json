The Rockies rookie, called up with so much pomp and promise in June to make his major-league debut, finally made his second start. And he began to confront his expectations.\n\nButler, back to basics with a heavy sampling of two-seam fastballs, allowed just one Arizona batter to reach second base in the first four innings. He left after six innings having given up only one earned run and five hits.\n\nBetween Butler\u2019s second big-league start and LaTroy Hakwins\u2019 997th to finish the game, the Rockies ran to a 5-1 victory over the hapless Diamondbacks.\n\n\u201cThat guy\u2019s great,\u201d the 23-year-old Butler said of the 41-year-old Hawkins. \u201cHe told me earlier to shut up and sit down and get ready.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies won a fifth consecutive game after losing seven in a row. And, with seven games remaining, Colorado (64-91) is now two games ahead of Arizona (62-93), which has the worst record in the National League.\n\nThe Rockies are rolling \u2014 too little, too late for a team that fell to last place in the NL West on July 18. But it\u2019s the perfect time for Butler\u2019s second chance.\n\nThe rookie right-hander jumped up from the Double-A Tulsa Drillers on June 6 to start against the Dodgers at Coors Field. It was a forgettable experience \u2014 Butler gave up six runs on 10 hits over 5 innings. He lost. His ERA started at 10.13.\n\nWorse yet, Butler fell to the disabled list the following day with a muscle strain in his right armpit. He eventually ended up back in the Texas League.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies beat Arizona Diamondbacks 5-1, Sept. 20, 2014\n\n\u201cI just want Eddie to be himself,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\n\nOn Saturday, Butler gave up a line-drive single to Ender Inciarte to open the game, then retired seven of the next eight. He forced Jake Lamb into a inning-capping 4-6-3 double play to end the second.\n\nAnd Lamb\u2019s home run in the fifth, after Butler\u2019s first strikeout, of Chris Owings, was the only run the Diamondbacks would get. He forced a 5-4-3 double play to end the sixth.\n\nButler finished with one strikeout, one walk \u2014 and one major-league win, his first. His ERA is now 5.56.\n\n\u201cI was definitely keeping it simple,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe attacked a lot of guys in.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies made it possible for Butler to pitch mostly stress-free. They\u2019ve scored 53 runs in their past five games after Corey Dickerson\u2019s triple in the first inning off Trevor Cahill scored Justin Morneau. And Dickerson\u2019s solo home run in the fifth gave them a 5-1 lead.\n\nMorneau doubled and scored twice. Charlie Blackmon tripled. Rafael Ynoa, the rookie third baseman, playing for a sick Nolan Arenado, also doubled.\n\n\u201cThey did a lot of swinging today, putting up five runs early,\u201d Butler said.\n\nFootnotes. The Rockies have homered in 21 consecutive games, their longest streak since 32 in a row in 1999. Dickerson\u2019s home run was his 24th, a team high. \u2026 Morneau went 2-for-4 to raise his batting average to .318. He was tied with Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Harrison for the National League lead before the Pirates faced Milwaukee. \u2026 Arizona reliever Oliver Perez threw four strikeouts in the seventh inning, just the 44th time that\u2019s happened since 1998. Morneau struck out to start the inning, but got to first on a wild pitch.\n\nNick Groke: twitter.com/nickgroke or ngroke@denverpost.com\n\nLooking ahead\n\n\n\nD-backs\u2019 Wade Miley (8-11, 4.17 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Christian Bergman (2-4, 5.56), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 630 AM\n\nThe Rockies are now on a six-man pitching rotation to end the season after Eddie Butler was activated and inserted Saturday. That leaves Bergman to pitch the home finale on an extra day of rest. Bergman lost in his last start, to the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he struck out a career-high seven batters after striking out only one in his previous two starts combined. Against Miley, Rockies catcher Wilin Rosario is hitting .474 this season with two homers and three doubles.\n\nMonday: Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (6-10, 4.19 ERA) at Padres\u2019 Eric Stults (7-17, 4.59), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (14-11, 4.14) at Padres\u2019 TBA, 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (0-5, 4.91) at Padres\u2019 TBA, 7:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eddie Butler gets first win as Rockies roll past Arizona", "title": "Eddie Butler gets first win as Rockies roll past Arizona", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/20/eddie-butler-gets-first-win-as-rockies-roll-past-arizona/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140920_051311_eddie-butler.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140920_051311_eddie-butler.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-20T17:11:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:37:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Colorado Rockies beat Arizona Diamondbacks 5-1, Sept. 20, 2014\u201cI just want Eddie to be himself,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\nAnd, with seven games remaining, Colorado (64-91) is now two games ahead of Arizona (62-93), which has the worst record in the National League.\nThe Rockies rookie, called up with so much pomp and promise in June to make his major-league debut, finally made his second start.\nBetween Butler\u2019s second big-league start and LaTroy Hakwins\u2019 997th to finish the game, the Rockies ran to a 5-1 victory over the hapless Diamondbacks.\nButler, back to basics with a heavy sampling of two-seam fastballs, allowed just one Arizona batter to reach second base in the first four innings."}
