TALLAHASSEE â€” Nearly half the counties in Florida, including Orange, Osceola and Volusia, have a high percentage of adults without health insurance, according to new estimates released last week by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Twenty-nine of 67 counties have many working-age adults without insurance, according to 2014 data from the bureau. The counties, largely located in Central and South Florida, have uninsured rates of at least 20 percent or higher.

The urban counties of Miami-Dade and Broward are on the list, with Miami-Dade at 25.1 percent or higher.

DeSoto, a rural county in the state's interior, had the highest estimated uninsured rate at 30.8 percent.

St. John's, in northeast Florida, has an estimated 13.2 percent uninsured rate. St. Augustine is the largest and best-known city in the county.

Over the past few years, Florida's Republican legislature has rejected efforts to expand Medicaid eligibility.
