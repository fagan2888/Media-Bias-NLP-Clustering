To the north, the sky turned dark and a cool pre-storm breeze kicked up as the sounds of distant thunder began to roll in.\n\nA waitress at the Natalka coffee shop on Prospekt Lenina smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only a storm. Not artillery.\u201d\n\nAfter a nearly five-month-long standoff, combined Russian-separatist forces announced on July 2 that they had pulled back from their positions in the embattled seaside town of Shyrokyne. Yet in nearby Mariupol, a city that has lived with war on its doorstep for more than a year, many residents are reluctant to believe that peace may be on the horizon.\n\n\u201cI hope, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Olga Murza, 23, manager of the Natalka coffee shop. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of the fighting. People feel bad and lots of people have depression. We can hear the fighting every morning and every evening, and we don\u2019t know when it will end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation is very bad,\u201d said Andriy Viktorovich, a 27-year-old bartender. \u201cSometimes when the explosions are close and the windows shake I get scared. It\u2019s a crazy situation. Hope? I have little left.\u201d\n\nA July 3 post on the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Battalion Facebook page, which was attributed to the unit\u2019s leader and Ukrainian MP Andriy Biletskiy, stated: \u201cThe enemy has left Shyrokyne. Shyrokyne is Ukraine!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have paid a price\u2014more than 60 KIA\u2019s and 200 WIA\u2019s,\u201d the post continued. \u201cAnd there is less speculation about (a possible) invasion of Mariupol.\u201d\n\nOn July 2, a separatist representative to the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination announced the Shyrokyne withdraw. The Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination, which comprises representatives from Ukraine, Russia, separatist forces and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was created to administer the September 2014 cease-fire and remained in place after the Feb. 12 truce.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine visited Shyrokyne on July 2 and confirmed the separatist withdrawal. In an earlier report, released on June 27, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced that no civilians were left living in Shyrokyne, which had a pre-war population of 1,347, and that 80 percent of its structures had been destroyed by the fighting.\n\nSince July 2, the fighting around Mariupol has waned, leaving soldiers and civilians wondering what will happen next.\n\nUkrainian soldiers deployed to defend Mariupol largely view the combined Russian-separatist fallback with suspicion. According to Ukrainian soldiers in the area, the retreat was a tactical move to limit casualties or consolidate forces for a later offensive.\n\n\u201cThe city is a zone of no control,\u201d said Paul Moroz, a soldier with the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Battalion (recently upgraded to battalion from regiment), who is deployed to the area.\n\n\u201cWe are still occupying our positions on the hill and waiting for the separatists to come back,\u201d he added. \u201cThe separatists have pulled back to a hill, and Shyrokyne is free of separatists, but they can come back anytime.\u201d\n\nUkrainian forces are mainly deployed along Shyrokyne\u2019s beach and on a hill that overlooks the town to the east in the direction of Mariupol. Ukrainian troops on the hillside location live in a network of trenches, while soldiers along the coast mostly occupy abandoned homes and other buildings to shelter from artillery and sniper fire.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian military reports, combined Russian-separatist forces have abandoned vulnerable positions in the town center to limit casualties, but still currently have artillery and infantry positioned two kilometers away and on higher ground.\n\nIf Ukrainian forces moved into Shyrokyne\u2019s town center they would be vulnerable to artillery fire. The separatist fallback, therefore, has made Shyrokyne a ghost town with neither side willing to venture into no man\u2019s land.\n\n\u201cOccupying the city itself would be ineffective because we would be shelled,\u201d Moroz said. \u201cAnd their infantry is only two kilometers from the city, and they can come back any minute.\u201d\n\nAnother Azov Battalion soldier called Shyrokyne a \u201ccatastrophic wasteland.\u201d\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recently urged Ukrainian and separatist forces to jointly work to clear Shyrokyne of mines and booby-traps, and some officials in Kyiv have suggested establishing Shyrokyne as a demilitarized zone.\n\nUkrainian troops deployed to the area, however, pushed back against the idea of demilitarizing Shyrokyne or cooperating with the separatists. Some soldiers claim the combined Russian-separatist forces may be concentrating manpower and equipment for an assault in another direction, possibly from positions to the north of Mariupol near Volnovakha in an attempt to encircle and cut off the city.\n\nThe Ukrainian Dnipro-1 Battalion recently released drone footage documenting the build up of a combined Russian-separatist base, including nine Russian T-72 tanks, near the village of Sontseve, about 40 miles northeast of Mariupol and along one of two main roads connecting the city to the separatist stronghold of Donetsk.\n\nWith the growing threat of a combined Russian-separatist offensive from the north, Ukrainian forces consider defending Shyrokyne to be a critical bulwark to protect Mariupol\u2019s eastern flank and also deny a high ground from which to shell Ukrainian checkpoints on the eastern side of the city.\n\nAs of July 6, Ukrainian forces in Shyrokyne have held their positions. Five-day front-line rotations, divided between different National Guard Battalions, continue as before and no significant redeployment of equipment or personnel has been observed.\n\nFor the residents in Mariupol, the lull in fighting is a respite from the constant sounds of war that have tainted life in this city for more than a year. Heavy fighting in August and September 2014, which included tank battles on the city\u2019s periphery, and a Jan. 24, 2015 Grad rocket attack on a residential neighborhood spurred many to flee.\n\nAnd since February, the sounds of heavy weapons from the front lines, which are about 10 miles east of Mariupol\u2019s eastern limit, have become part of the normal background din. Those who remained have adjusted to life lived under the constant threat of attack. And while some see the combined Russian-separatist fallback as a positive move, many doubt whether it is a true bellwether for peace.\n\n\u201cFuture? What future? I have no money, and I can barely afford to survive,\u201d Viktorovich said. \u201cThe war has ruined everything. I\u2019m young, and I feel like I have no future. But what can I do? I have to learn to live on a couple dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOne indication of the evolving security situation in Mariupol is the pervasive military presence, which is markedly different than it was in March and April, when soldiers inside the city center were still an uncommon sight. It is also much different than in September 2014, when the first cease-fire was signed. At that time the Ukrainian military restricted troop movements in the city to nighttime to limit interaction with civilians.\n\nDowntown hotel lobbies and restaurants, which have been near empty for months, are now filled with Ukrainian soldiers on leave or pass. At the Hotel Spartak in central Mariupol, groups of soldiers prop their loaded Kalashnikovs up against the walls as they eat omelettes and drink coffee at the breakfast buffet.\n\nIn the evening at a nearby restaurant on Prospekt Lenina, a line of painted camouflage SUVs is parked out front and the restaurant is filled with soldiers eating steaks. There is a nearly constant stream of military vehicles up and down Prospekt Lenina, the city\u2019s main thoroughfare.\n\nThe city\u2019s civilians have also acclimated. While many residents are privately concerned about the war, life goes on. The city\u2019s parks are filled with people, and beds of neatly planted flowers are blooming. Cafes and coffee shops are open.\n\nThe downtown movie theater is showing \u201cTerminator Genisys\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d told in Russian. Mothers push baby carriages on the sidewalks, and city benches are crowded with babushkas.\n\n\u201cPeople have lived with this for one year, and they have adapted,\u201d Murza said. \u201cYou can get used to the shooting and the explosions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I feel like my life has stopped,\u201d she added. Murza speaks fluent English and graduated last year from Mariupol State University with a degree in management and hospitality.\n\n\u201cI want peace because I have ideas and hopes for my future. I want to live my life and start a family, and I can\u2019t do anything because I don\u2019t know what will happen in a month or a year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Shyrokyne back in Ukrainian control, Mariupol breathes a skeptical sigh of relief", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With Shyrokyne back in Ukrainian control, Mariupol breathes a skeptical sigh of relief", "title": "Ukraine Wins Back City, But War Remains Close", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Uneasy-Peace.png", "updated_time": "2015-07-09T10:04:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1H5t5gr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "With Shyrokyne back in Ukrainian control, Mariupol breathes a skeptical sigh of relief", "title": "Ukraine Wins Back City, But War Remains Close", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Uneasy-Peace.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-07-06T21:03:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-09T10:04:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Mariupol, Shyrokyne"}, "article_summary": "And while some see the combined Russian-separatist fallback as a positive move, many doubt whether it is a true bellwether for peace.\nDowntown hotel lobbies and restaurants, which have been near empty for months, are now filled with Ukrainian soldiers on leave or pass.\nUkrainian soldiers deployed to defend Mariupol largely view the combined Russian-separatist fallback with suspicion.\nAccording to Ukrainian soldiers in the area, the retreat was a tactical move to limit casualties or consolidate forces for a later offensive.\nIf Ukrainian forces moved into Shyrokyne\u2019s town center they would be vulnerable to artillery fire."}
