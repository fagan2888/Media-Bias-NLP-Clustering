They might make us giggle, but they can also help us learn.\n\nHow to do it?\n\n1) Forget the Labels\n\nThere\u2019s actually a lot to like about this beautiful video which uses the Olympic rings to show different variables about the continents that participate in the games\u2013from overall population to the number of McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\n\nThe first glaring issue? It has no labels to tell us which ring is which.\n\nTo make matters worse, there are six continents and only 5 rings. That means two of these continents are lumped together, which really skews any meaningful data (I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s the Americas). The title doesn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s not in the same order as the rings they represent. My best guess: Blue=Oceania, Yellow=Africa, Black=Europe, Green=Asia, and Red=Americas.\n\n2) Display the Data in Reverse\n\nIf you took a quick glance at this line chart showing the number of gun deaths in Florida after the state enacted its \u201cstand your ground\u201d law in 2005, you could easily assume it showed deaths going down.\n\nSadly, you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nFor some inexplicable reason, the creator of the chart decided to make it upside down to how we usually view them. If you\u2019re going to break from tradition (not to mention phrases like numbers \u201cgoing up\u201d), there better be a very good reason.\n\n3) Hide the Data Inside Meaningless Designs\n\nWhere to even start with this visualization from the Nightly News? There\u2019s data in here somewhere\u2026 but it\u2019s cut to shreds behind a meaningless map of the U.S.\n\nTake the purple \u201cAsian\u201d data for example. You get that something\u2019s happening up in Washington in 1960, but the data is somehow lost in Canada half-way through, only to reappear back in Maine.\n\nWhoever created this area chart (if it can even be called that) must have realized some error when they didn\u2019t have anywhere to place percentages for \u201cOther\u201d.\n\nOr if that wasn\u2019t bad enough\u2026 there\u2019s always this graphic on poop. Besides the multi-color gross-out factor, there isn\u2019t any reason to put a big turd on this page. It isn\u2019t a pie chart. It isn\u2019t an area chart. It\u2019s just shit.\n\n4) Hide the Data with Too Many Variables\n\nCan you figure out what\u2019s going on in this heat map? Neither can we. There are so many layers of information piled on top of each other, and hues so close together they\u2019re totally indecipherable. Select colors appropriately.\n\n5) Start Your Bar Charts Anywhere Above Zero\n\nIt looks like losing Bush tax cuts is going to more than quadruple taxes!! Oh no! People must hate Obamacare because they missed their enrollment goals by more than half!\n\nOh Fox News\u2026 where do we start? Perhaps starting the Y-axis at zero on these bar charts would help us understand the real story behind the numbers? It\u2019s almost like they want to tell a different story\u2026\n\n6) Use a Pie Chart That Doesn\u2019t Add Up to 100\n\nMore failure gold from Fox News here. It appears they don\u2019t know how a pie chart works. You know: one pie divided into portions of 100%.\n\nI do wish real pie worked like this. Can I have three 60% portions please?\n\nWant to make sure your visualizations don\u2019t fail?
