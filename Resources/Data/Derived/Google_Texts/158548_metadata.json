Obviously, there was quite a bit of blood loss, mainly from the facial lacerations.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve gotten from the doctors has been positive.\u201d\n\nCrane, a native of Seattle who is in his first year as a professional cyclist, had been scrambling through the caravan to rejoin the main group of riders after a small crash that required him to change bicycles. Shortly after, several vehicles came to an abrupt stop, and Crane crashed through the back windshield of a Team Cannondale car, a Cannondale spokeswoman said.\n\nBeamon didn\u2019t assign blame to either Crane or the drivers.\n\n\u201cHe had been in the caravan a bit longer than normal,\u201d Beamon said. \u201cWe were hitting a pretty windy section, and as he was coming back in the caravan, there was a stoppage. Either he didn\u2019t react to it quick enough or \u2026 I don\u2019t exactly know how it happened.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: 2014 USA Pro Challenge, Final Stage\n\nWATCH: Alex Howes won the final stage of the USA Pro Challenge\n\nRace officials initially received an erroneous report of a fatality and considered canceling the race out of respect for Crane and the other riders, Shawn Hunter, the race\u2019s CEO, told The Denver Post.\n\n\u201cThe initial report that got to us was devastating,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cWhen something like that happens, our first thoughts and actions go toward the athlete, his family and his team.\u201d\n\nHeavy crosswinds had been blowing along Colorado 93, where the race had proceeded after leaving Boulder. The Colorado State Patrol closed the highway to investigate the incident.\n\n\u201cIan\u2019s one of our most promising riders,\u201d said teammate Ben Jacques-Mayne, who won the King of the Mountain (top climber) jersey at the Pro Challenge. \u201cHe\u2019s proven his caliber and quality as a rider. We were planning to ride for him today, and to hear that he\u2019s gone out, it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nCyclists almost always need to ride through the caravan of team cars \u2014 which hold sports directors, food, water and race mechanics \u2014 after stopping, usually for a mechanical failure such as a flat tire. Drivers of team cars, many of whom are former cyclists with extensive experience, frequently honk their horns to alert cars ahead of them that riders are moving through the caravan.\n\n\u201cIt is a crazy environment back there,\u201d Beamon said. \u201cEach driver has two eyes, not 20 like he needs. Each rider is always motivated to get back to the bunch and dealing with a lot of conditions. It\u2019s always a treacherous environment, but it\u2019s remarkable how few crashes there are.\u201d\n\nDenver Post staff writer John Meyer contributed to this report.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cyclist Ian Crane in stable condition after crashing through rear window", "title": "Cyclist Ian Crane in stable condition after crashing through rear window", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/24/cyclist-ian-crane-in-stable-condition-after-crashing-through-rear-window/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__cyclingp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__cyclingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T17:55:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:42:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "article_summary": "Ian Crane, a 24-year-old cyclist for American team Jamis-Hagens Berman, crashed through the rear window of another team\u2019s vehicle Sunday while making his way through the caravan around the 19-mile mark of Stage 7 of the USA Pro Challenge.\nIt\u2019s always a treacherous environment, but it\u2019s remarkable how few crashes there are.\u201dDenver Post staff writer John Meyer contributed to this report.\nHe was in stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries but remained sedated at St. Anthony Hospital\u2019s trauma unit in Lakewood after being airlifted from the course, the team said.\n\u201cWe were hitting a pretty windy section, and as he was coming back in the caravan, there was a stoppage.\nDrivers of team cars, many of whom are former cyclists with extensive experience, frequently honk their horns to alert cars ahead of them that riders are moving through the caravan."}
