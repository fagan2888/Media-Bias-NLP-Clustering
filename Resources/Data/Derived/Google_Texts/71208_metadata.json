UnitedHealthcare enrolled 795,000 consumers as of March 31, and the company expects to see that number decline to 650,000 by the end of 2016.\n\nHemsley warned in November that UnitedHealthcare was considering leaving the marketplaces after reporting it lost money from its exchange coverage. Now, with participation from other big market players in flux with mergers and acquisitions, consumers across the country could face fewer choices when signing up for health insurance during the 2017 open enrollment period.\n\n\u201cI think the consensus has been that it\u2019s not going to have a significant impact on consumers,\u201d Chris Sloan, a senior manager at Avalere Health, told The Daily Signal. \u201cNow, that depends on who you are as a consumer. But in states where they pull out, you\u2019re going to have to switch plans and actively shop. When you go from two [insurers] to one, you notice.\u201d\n\nWith UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision to leave 26 exchanges, consumers in the affected states could find themselves with only one option when searching for coverage for 2017.\n\nAccording to an analysis conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure could lead to a drop from two insurers to one in 29 percent of the 1,855 counties where the company sold coverage.\n\nAdditionally, the insurer\u2019s exit could have a significant impact on consumer choice in seven states\u2014Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee\u2014where more than half of the counties in each of those states will experience a drop from two insurers to one insurer participating in the exchanges, the organization found.\n\nIn Lee and Collier Counties in Florida, for example, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure means consumers in those two counties may soon only be able to choose plans sold by Florida Blue, part of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.\n\nAdditionally, in both Kansas and Oklahoma, all exchange enrollees could be left with only one insurer to select coverage from should UnitedHealthcare decide to exit those exchanges. Sloan said:\n\nFor consumers, when your health plan pulls out, you have the potential to see disruptions in continuative care. If United pulls out and you go into the Blues or Aetna, there\u2019s a chance that your doctor isn\u2019t in the network or there\u2019s a chance that they don\u2019t cover your drugs. The biggest message for consumers is if they were in a United plan that\u2019s leaving, they are going to have to take a very proactive approach to their coverage and make sure what they\u2019re enrolling in next covers their drugs, has their provider in network, and things like that.\n\nSloan said that counties likely to be most affected by UnitedHealthcare\u2019s exit\u2014particularly those that could see a drop in insurers from two to one\u2014are in rural areas. Limited choice in those counties is common, as carriers often decide not to set up networks there, he continued.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be places where you go from you as a consumer having a choice and now you don\u2019t, and then it will be incumbent on some of the states and the federal government to figure out ways to incent health plans to play into those areas,\u201d Sloan said.\n\nWhile UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure from Obamacare\u2019s exchanges could impact consumers who were previously enrolled in coverage through the insurer, Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, said it\u2019s not only UnitedHeathcare\u2019s exit that\u2019s going to affect consumer choice.\n\nMergers are currently in the works for two pairs of large insurers: Aetna toacquire Humana and Anthem to take over Cigna. If the mergers are approved, exchanges selling coverage from those four companies and UnitedHealthcare last year would see yet another drop in choice.\n\n\u201cUnited isn\u2019t the only one who is going away,\u201d Haislmaier told The Daily Signal. \u201cBetween exits and consolidations, you\u2019ll see fewer competing carriers.\u201d\n\nThough UnitedHealthcare\u2019s exit from Obamacare\u2019s exchanges is likely to influence consumer choice, Haislmaier said it\u2019s unclear whether UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure will impact the price of premiums for carriers continuing to sell on the exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less clear regarding the premiums,\u201d Haislmaier said. \u201cWhat I think is going to have more of an impact on premiums is the plan design. The pattern that I\u2019m seeing and what is behind United\u2019s move is that insurers for exchange coverage have to offer restricted or narrowed networks. If they\u2019re not set up to do that, then this isn\u2019t a good market.\u201d\n\nPages", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Another nail in the coffin for Obama's biggest domestic 'achievement'?", "dcterms.title": "A Warning: What UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Decision to Ditch Obamacare Means", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "\u00a91991\u20132014 The National Interest", "og": {"url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/warning-what-unitedhealthcares-decision-ditch-obamacare-15955", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/16165724194_ac7cd945a6_b_1.jpg", "site_name": "The National Interest", "description": "Another nail in the coffin for Obama's biggest domestic 'achievement'?", "title": "A Warning: What UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Decision to Ditch Obamacare Means"}, "dcterms.subject": "Security, , Obamacare, Health Care, Politics, Economics, Health, UnitedHealthcare", "abstract": "Another nail in the coffin for Obama's biggest domestic 'achievement'?", "description": "Another nail in the coffin for Obama's biggest domestic 'achievement'?", "robots": "follow, index", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "revisit-after": "1 day", "dcterms.creator": "Melissa Quinn", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Security, , Obamacare, Health Care, Politics, Economics, Health, UnitedHealthcare", "dcterms.publisher": "The Center for the National Interest", "twitter": {"description": "Another nail in the coffin for Obama's biggest domestic 'achievement'?", "title": "A Warning: What UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Decision to Ditch Obamacare Means", "url": "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/warning-what-unitedhealthcares-decision-ditch-obamacare-15955", "image": "http://nationalinterest.org/files/main_images/16165724194_ac7cd945a6_b_1.jpg", "site": "@thenatlinterest", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Security, , Obamacare, Health Care, Politics, Economics, Health, UnitedHealthcare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0f2\"", "article_summary": "In the wake of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision to exit Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces in 2017, consumers purchasing coverage on the exchanges may have fewer choices and less competition.\nTo date, the insurer is pulling out of 26 of the 34 exchanges it offered coverage on last year.\nWhen you go from two [insurers] to one, you notice.\u201dWith UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision to leave 26 exchanges, consumers in the affected states could find themselves with only one option when searching for coverage for 2017.\nHemsley warned in November that UnitedHealthcare was considering leaving the marketplaces after reporting it lost money from its exchange coverage.\nIf the mergers are approved, exchanges selling coverage from those four companies and UnitedHealthcare last year would see yet another drop in choice."}
