The Hill notes that conservatives in the House are plotting yet another bound-to-fail coup against John Boehner over the Speaker\u2019s unwillingness to hold government funding hostage until Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal subsidies are nixed. The right-wing House Freedom Caucus has announced that it won\u2019t back any bill that retains funding for Planned Parenthood, and if Boehner tries to move ahead with funding the government over their objections, then they\u2019ll set in motion the conspiracy to boot him from the leadership.\n\nBoehner\u2019s allies don\u2019t seem too concerned, but they\u2019re nonetheless piqued at the House Freedom Caucus for stirring up this trouble and undermining Boehner\u2019s authority. House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes talked to The Hill and offered a characteristically blunt assessment of the Republican insurgents:\n\nAnd House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who is part of Boehner\u2019s close-knit circle, attempted to turn the tables on members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, denouncing them as \u201cright-wing Marxists\u201d who have empowered House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) by undermining Boehner. \u201cThe right-wing Marxists have teamed up with Pelosi. They\u2019re the ones who always team up with Pelosi. They are the Pelosi Republicans,\u201d an infuriated Nunes said in an interview. \u201cThe Freedom Caucus is an arm of Pelosi.\u201d\n\nNunes is known for his colorful and creative insults, and he has little tolerance for these shutdown antics. In 2013 he described the Republican lawmakers responsible for the Obamacare shutdown fight as \u201clemmings with suicide vests.\u201d But aside from the self-contradictory \u201cright-wing Marxists\u201d jab, he\u2019s largely correct about what the House Freedom Caucus is accomplishing with the Planned Parenthood crusade \u2013 they\u2019re handing the Democratic opposition power that it wouldn\u2019t otherwise enjoy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An influential Republican whacks his conservative colleagues as de facto allies of Nancy Pelosi.
