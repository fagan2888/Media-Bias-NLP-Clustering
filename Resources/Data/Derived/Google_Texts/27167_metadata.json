The LAPD probationary officer, Henry Solis, is the person of interest in the fatal shooting of Salome Rodriguez of Ontario. The shooting took place in Pomona, around 3:30 a.m. around third and main. Police do not have much information about the homicide and are unsure as to whether the two men knew each other. The LAPD is, however, working hard to locate Solis for questioning.\n\nHenry Solis joined the LAPD in June of 2014. According to Cmdr. Andrew Smith of the LAPD, Solis was assigned to the Devonshire Division in the San Fernando Valley in November, after graduating from the academy. Smith said that Solis\u2019s history with the department was unremarkable. According to sources, graduates of the academy are usually placed in as probationary officers. Solis was a rookie probationary officer of the LAPD.\n\nThe LAPD began looking for Solis when he did not show up for work on Saturday morning. It was not until later that the LAPD got work from the Pomona police that Solis was the person of interest in their homicide case. Pomona police stated that it was reported that Solis and the victim, Rodriguez were seen in a physical altercation.\n\nRodriguez, a 23-year-old male, was found on Saturday morning after police received reports of gun shots heard. They reported to the scene to find Rodriguez with a gun shot wound in his lower torso and immediately rushed him to the USC Medical Center. It was there that he later died from his injuries. Pomona police later identified the victim and received news of the supposed physical altercation between the victim and Solis. But police have no other information regarding the events and are stating that it is too early to comment on the case.\n\nThe LAPD and Pomona police are now working to locate Solis for questioning. In their statement to reporters the LAPD said that they were cooperating fully with Pomona police to help solve the case. The police departments stated that Solis is probably aware that they want to talk to him. So far, Solis is only a person of interest and not the prime suspect, due to lack of sufficient evidence.\n\nThe LAPD is asking for help from the public to locate Solis. They stated that Solis was not on duty at the time of the homicide, but has not returned to work. The LAPD has released details about Solis that they hope will help them locate him. They put out details such as his height, five feet, nine inches tall, his weight of 185 pounds, and the make and model of his car which is a gray 2013 Volkswagen Jetta. Police also released his license plate number, 7FAS527, in hopes that someone will be able to report on his whereabouts.\n\nUntil the LAPD or Pomona Police are able to gather more information about the event, Officer Solis is the only person of interest in the shooting of a 23-year-old male. Police are asking for anyone with information to come forward and call (909) 620-2085. Informants can also call Crime Stoppers to give anonymous tips.\n\nBy Crystal Boulware\n\nSources:\n\nLos Angeles Time\n\nKTLA\n\nThe Sun\n\nPhoto Source:\n\nWickedVT \u2013 Creativecommons Flickr License\n\nKTLA\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "A rookie Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer is wanted for the shooting of a 23-year-old male.
