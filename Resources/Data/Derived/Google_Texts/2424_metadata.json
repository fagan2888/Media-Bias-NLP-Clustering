Perhaps foremost among these well-liked slices of Obamacare is the law\u2019s provision barring insurance companies from discriminating against people based on pre-existing conditions. It used to be that a health insurer could jack up your premiums or deny you coverage altogether based solely on your health history. The Affordable Care Act put an end to that as part of its coverage mandate, and now people who most desperately need access to health care can get it.\n\nFor Republicans, this popular policy is unadulterated Bolshevism. They recoil at the idea of the government regulating the insurance industry in this way, and they argue that there is a solution for guaranteeing sick people can get covered that is better than simply guaranteeing they can get covered. This better way is found within the inscrutable magicks of the free market.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is himself an ardent devotee of finding free-market solutions to literally every problem, and he also happens to be the person in charge of developing the House GOP\u2019s long-awaited Obamacare replacement. This week, the Speaker gave us all a preview of what we can expect to see in the Republicans\u2019 health reform plan, and he specifically addressed the issue of pre-existing conditions and how they can be dealt with in a way that doesn\u2019t involve government regulation. Here\u2019s what he said, according to Reuters:\n\n\u201cLess than 10 percent of people under 65 are what we call people with pre-existing conditions, who are really kind of uninsurable,\u201d Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told a student audience at Georgetown University. \u201cLet\u2019s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage, so that they can get affordable coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cYou dramatically lower the price for everybody else. You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition.\u201d\n\nHigh-risk pools! If you were at all concerned that the Republican Obamacare alternative would embrace any new thinking or policy innovations, this should set your mind at ease. High-risk pools have been a staple of Republican health care policy proposals for a long time now, and enthusiasm for them hasn\u2019t diminished despite the fact that they\u2019re a terrible policy.\n\nThe way high-risk pools work is that if you\u2019re one of the \u201creally kind of uninsurable people\u201d Paul Ryan talks about who can\u2019t get otherwise insured because of your medical history, you apply for coverage through a high-risk pool where you\u2019ll pay higher premiums and cover more out-of-pocket costs than you would expect to in the normal insurance market. \u201cIn addition to these high premiums,\u201d the Commonwealth Fund explains, \u201cenrollees in state-based high-risk pools faced annual deductibles as high as $25,000 and annual coverage limits as low as $75,000.\u201d In dispassionate economic terms, this makes sense: your health care needs are more expensive, so you pay more than a healthy person would. But if you\u2019re a sick low-income person who can\u2019t really afford insurance to begin with, shunting you off into a high-risk pool wouldn\u2019t do you any good.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan wants to eliminate a popular Obamacare provision and replace it with an expensive, useless pipe dream", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paul Ryan wants to eliminate a popular Obamacare provision and replace it with an expensive, useless pipe dream", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s health care fraud: The speaker previews the GOP\u2019s lousy Obamacare replacement", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/29/paul_ryans_health_care_fraud_the_speaker_previews_the_gops_lousy_obamacare_replacement/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/obama_ryan2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Ryan wants to eliminate a popular Obamacare provision and replace it with an expensive, useless pipe dream", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/obama_ryan2.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s health care fraud: The speaker previews the GOP\u2019s lousy Obamacare replacement", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s health care fraud: The speaker previews the GOP\u2019s lousy Obamacare replacement", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Congress, Healthcare Reform, House Republicans, Obamacare, Paul Ryan, Pre-existing conditions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act put an end to that as part of its coverage mandate, and now people who most desperately need access to health care can get it.\n\u201cLet\u2019s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage, so that they can get affordable coverage,\u201d he said.\nYou make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition.\u201dHigh-risk pools!\nHigh-risk pools have been a staple of Republican health care policy proposals for a long time now, and enthusiasm for them hasn\u2019t diminished despite the fact that they\u2019re a terrible policy.\nIt used to be that a health insurer could jack up your premiums or deny you coverage altogether based solely on your health history."}
