An 18-year-old Union student told officers she was passing the Stonegate Apartments at 7:45 a.m. on Jan. 29 when a male between 16-18 years old started following her.

When she walked through a shopping complex on the north side of 9000 East 71st Street, he grabbed her and forced her into a retention area behind the complex. He then sexually assaulted her and tried to rob her, according to a news bulletin issued by police. The girl went home and called police.

Three other assaults in which Williams is a suspect include:

November 17, 2013: Sugarberry Apartments, located at 10900 E. 61st Street. First-degree burglary and assault and battery.

He is expected to be booked into the Tulsa County jail on the complaints stemming from all four incidents.
