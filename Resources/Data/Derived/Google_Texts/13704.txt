A Citrus County ophthalmologist is in federal court after government officials discovered that he violated the terms of his visa, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

According to authorities, doctor Ashish Sanon, born in India and a naturalized citizen of Canada, has been operating a full medical practice as a self-employed doctor for more than a decade, though his visa only allowed him to teach or conduct research, the Times reports.

Sanon is expected to enter a formal guilty plea on Oct. 27, according to the Times.
