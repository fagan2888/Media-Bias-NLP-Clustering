For example, Massachusetts health insurance reform required all adults to purchase health insurance by July 1, 2007.\n\nThis patient population extends beyond those who are directly admitted to the ICU. Many patients who have been admitted to a less intense level of care for other illnesses require subsequent ICU stays, as well as following elective procedures, including some cardiac and endovascular operations and cancer surgeries.\n\nThe study examined hospital discharge records of patients aged 18-64, comparing ICU utilization in Massachusetts to four states that did not enact health insurance reform: New York, Washington, Nebraska, and North Carolina. The comparison states were chosen because they overlap Massachusetts in population demographics while also being broadly representative of the United States as a whole.\n\nIn addition to discovering no significant changes in adjusted ICU admission rates, the study found no significant changes in discharge destination e.g., to a nursing home, or in-hospital ICU-patient mortality rates between Massachusetts and the non-reform states (although this latter association was dependent on the comparison states chosen in the analysis).\n\n\u201cGreater access to care allows for better preventive care, which may reduce ICU admissions and ultimately an individual\u2019s risk of death in the ICU,\u201d said Sarah M. Lyon, M.D., MSCE, a pulmonary medicine specialist in the division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cIndividuals with insurance may also be more likely to come to us earlier in the course of their illness when their acute illness severity is lower.\u201d\n\nThe care of patients with critical illness now accounts for between 16.9 percent and 38.4 percent of total hospital costs. As the population ages, critical care costs are also expected to grow. Thus, balancing patients\u2019 need for critical care with the available resources is a policy challenge. However, the findings of the Penn study suggest that health insurance expansion may not exacerbate the projected shortage of critical care beds and providers.\n\n\u201cOur study provides evidence that expanding access to health insurance may not appreciably inflate ICU utilization through greater demand,\u201d said Colin R. Cooke, M.D., M.Sc., from the U-M Medical School and Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation and the study's senior author. \u201cOur results suggest that policymakers and health systems leaders should consider continuing to focus on improving the efficient use of existing resources.\u201d Cooke is an assistant professor in the Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine division of the Medical School's Department of Internal Medicine.\n\nWhile the study found no difference in mortality rates between ICU patients in Massachusetts and the four non-reform states, it determined that ICU-patient mortality rates remained the same in Massachusetts after health care reform was enacted -- confounding expectations that earlier access to care might lower ICU death rates.\n\nAlthough previous studies demonstrated that lack of health insurance is associated with increased mortality in critical illness, it could be that lack of health insurance may coincide with other socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment or underemployment and poverty, and that acquiring health insurance does not counteract the negative impact of these factors.\n\nAdditionally, according to a recent study of Medicaid expansion, reductions in adjusted all-cause mortality were not apparent until five years after the policy change. It is thus possible that in the timeframe examined in the Penn-led study, which ended 29 months after mandatory insurance began in Massachusetts, reform had not had sufficient time to improve rates of preventable ICU mortality through improved access to primary and preventable medical services; longer follow-up may be necessary to see a change in these rates.\n\nFinally, the study\u2019s post-reform period coincided with the financial recession beginning in 2008. Population changes in healthcare utilization in response to economic hardship may have mitigated potential benefits of acquiring health insurance.\n\n\u201cWhile what happened in one state does not necessarily mean the rest of the nation will follow, it\u2019s important to use whatever data are available to anticipate and plan for what might occur under national health care reform,\u201d said Lyon.\n\nIn addition to Lyon and Cooke, co-authors are David A.
