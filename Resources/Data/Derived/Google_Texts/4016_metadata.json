This figure has increased from 66 percent in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of U.S. adults who see corruption as pervasive has never been less than a majority in the past decade, which has had no shortage of controversies from the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s firings of U.S. attorneys to the IRS scandal,\u201d Gallup reported.\n\nA Monday report from Gallup\u2019s Andrew Dugan said 49 percent of Americans believe the government regulates business too much. Another poll reported by Gallup\u2019s Frank Newport on Monday said 49 percent of Americans say the government poses \u201can immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.\u201d\n\nThese reports have certain implications about the state of American politics and where they are headed.\n\nNewport\u2019s report about the American people\u2019s opinion on the government\u2019s threat to freedom, for instance, noted a switch in the partisan view of the government as a threat. Whereas the majority of those polled who said they believe the government was a threat to liberty under Bush\u2019s administration were democrats, the current majority of those who view the government in that way are Republican or Republican leaning.\n\nThe fact that over the last 10 years the American people have had such a consistent level of distrust toward the government could indicate that the issue of highest priority for most Americans is the government itself.\n\n\u201cFrom the people\u2019s perspective, then, a focus on the appropriate role for government should be at the forefront of the nation\u2019s continuing political discourse,\u201d Newport said in his report.\n\nAs for Dugan\u2019s report, the implications are more nuanced. Dugan said that while half of Americans polled believe there is too much regulation of business, only 21 percent say the government regulates business too little.\n\nWhile the polls show that a majority of Americans distrust their government, Gallup says there is a positive takeaway. One of the reports noted that poll participants\u2019 willingness to criticize their government demonstrated the American people\u2019s belief in the free press and that they are safe to freely criticize their governing authorities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American people\u2019s trust in government is the lowest it has been in the last 10 years, according to three Gallup polls released over the past week.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The American people\u2019s trust in government is the lowest it has been in the last 10 years, according to three Gallup polls released over the past week.", "title": "Gallup: Americans Increasingly View Government as Corrupt, Threat to Their Freedom", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150923_GovtTrust.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-23T18:28:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FbPCx3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The American people\u2019s trust in government is the lowest it has been in the last 10 years, according to three Gallup polls released over the past week.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150923_GovtTrust.jpg"}, "title": "Gallup: Americans Increasingly View Government as Corrupt, Threat to Their Freedom", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "cronyism,president", "published_time": "2015-09-23T17:57:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T18:28:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gallup, poll, government, trust, regulation, corruption"}, "article_summary": "Newport\u2019s report about the American people\u2019s opinion on the government\u2019s threat to freedom, for instance, noted a switch in the partisan view of the government as a threat.\nA Monday report from Gallup\u2019s Andrew Dugan said 49 percent of Americans believe the government regulates business too much.\nWhile the polls show that a majority of Americans distrust their government, Gallup says there is a positive takeaway.\nThe American people\u2019s trust in government is the lowest it has been in the last 10 years, according to three Gallup polls released recently.\nThe polls measured the population\u2019s opinions on government corruption, government regulation of business, and whether the government poses an immediate threat to personal liberties."}
