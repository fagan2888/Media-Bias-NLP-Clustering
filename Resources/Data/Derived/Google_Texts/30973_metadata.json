So are some state insurance regulators.\n\nAn Associated Press survey found examples coast to coast. Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is excluded by five out of eight insurers in Washington\u2019s insurance exchange. MD Anderson Cancer Center says it\u2019s in less than half of the plans in the Houston area. Memorial Sloan-Kettering is included by two of nine insurers in New York City and has out-of-network agreements with two more.\n\nIn all, only four of 19 nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers that responded to AP\u2019s survey said patients have access through all the insurance companies in their states\u2019 exchanges.\n\nNot too long ago insurance companies would have been vying to offer access to renowned cancer centers, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the market research firm Avalere Health. Now the focus is on costs.\n\n\u201cThis is a marked deterioration of access to the premier cancer centers for people who are signing up for these plans,\u201d Mendelson said.\n\nThose patients may not be able get the most advanced treatment, including clinical trials of new medications.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another problem: it\u2019s not easy for consumers shopping online in the new insurance markets to tell if top-level institutions are included in a plan. That takes additional digging by the people applying.\n\n\u201cThe challenges of this are going to become evident \u2026 as cancer cases start to arrive,\u201d said Norman Hubbard, executive vice president of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.\n\nBefore President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, a cancer diagnosis could make you uninsurable. Now, insurers can\u2019t turn away people with health problems or charge them more. Lifetime dollar limits on policies, once a financial trap-door for cancer patients, are also banned.\n\nThe new obstacles are more subtle.\n\nTo keep premiums low, insurers have designed narrow networks of hospitals and doctors. The government-subsidized private plans on the exchanges typically offer less choice than Medicare or employer plans.\n\nBy not including a top cancer center an insurer can cut costs. It may also shield itself from risk, delivering an implicit message to cancer survivors or people with a strong family history of the disease that they should look elsewhere.\n\nFor now, the issue seems to be limited to the new insurance exchanges. But it could become a concern for Americans with job-based coverage, too, if employers turn to narrow networks.\n\nThe AP surveyed 23 institutions around the country that are part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Two additional institutions that joined this week were not included in the survey.\n\nCancer network members are leading hospitals that combine the latest clinical research and knowledge with a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. They say that patients in their care have better-than-average survival rates. The unique role of cancer centers is recognized under Medicare. Several are exempt from its hospital payment system, instituted to control costs.\n\nAP asked the centers how many insurance companies in their state\u2019s exchange included them as a network provider.\n\nOf the 19 that responded, four reported access through all insurers: the Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C., and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. One caveat: Some insurers did not include these cancer centers on certain low-cost plans.\n\nTwo centers had special circumstances. The best known is St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis. Treatment there is free as long as children have a referral.\n\nFor the remaining 13, the gaps were evident.\n\nIn Buffalo, N.Y., Roswell Park Cancer Institute is included by five of seven insurers in its region. But statewide, the picture is much different: Roswell Park is not included by 11 of 16 insurers. Dr. Willie Underwood, associate professor of surgical oncology at the teaching hospital, says that\u2019s a problem.\n\n\u201cOverall, when you look at the Affordable Care Act, it improves access to cancer care,\u201d said Underwood. \u201cWhen it comes down to the exchanges, there are some concerns that we have. That is not being critical, that is being intelligent. There are some things we should talk about \u2026 before they start becoming a problem.\u201d\n\nMelanie Lapidus, vice president for managed care at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, home to Siteman Cancer Center, said she doesn\u2019t think patients realize the exchanges offer a more restrictive kind of private insurance.\n\nLapidus cited Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which includes Siteman in many of its plans outside the Missouri exchange, but none within the exchange.\n\n\u201cWe have had many people say to us, \u2018I picked Anthem because you guys are always in their products, and I assumed you would be in their exchange products\u2019,\u201d Lapidus said. \u201cIt\u2019s still hard to tell who is in network and who is not.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Anthem said its network was based on research involving thousands of consumers and businesses. \u201cWhat we learned was that people are willing to make trade-offs in order to have access to affordable health care,\u201d the company said. \u201cOur provider networks reflect this.\u201d\n\nHuntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City is included by five of six Utah insurers, but Mark Zenger, who manages the center\u2019s negotiations with insurance companies, said he\u2019s concerned about getting left out by Humana, a major carrier.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about the potential to have these Humana exchange members seek treatment and have no other option,\u201d said Zenger.\n\nHumana spokesman Tom Noland said patients can have access to Huntsman for complex procedures, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSome state insurance regulators see a problem.\n\n\u201cI want insurers to be able to innovate and come up with new product designs,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, insurance commissioner for Washington state. \u201cAt the same time, there is a requirement for regulators like myself to be vigilant to make sure there aren\u2019t unreasonable compromises.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration says it has notified insurers that their networks will get closer scrutiny for next year in the 36 states served by the federal exchange. Cancer care will be a priority, it says.\n\nRicardo Alonso-Zaldivar,\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of America\u2019s best cancer hospitals are off-limits to many of the people now signing up for coverage under the nation\u2019s new health care program.", "og": {"description": "Some of America\u2019s best cancer hospitals are off-limits to many of the people now signing up for coverage under the nation\u2019s new health care program.", "title": "Concerns mount about cancer centers under Obama's health care law", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20140318-concerns-mount-about-cancer-centers-under-obama-s-health-care-law.ece", "image": {"width": 4908, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140318-health_overhaul_top_cancer_centers_36597977-1-.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_TOP_CANCER_CENTERS_36597977+%281%29.JPG", "height": 2454}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-03-18T23:46:41Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-03-18T23:46:26Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Concerns mount about cancer centers under Obama's health care law\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/health-and-fitness/health/20140318-concerns-mount-about-cancer-centers-under-obama-s-health-care-law.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140318-health_overhaul_top_cancer_centers_36597977-1-.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_TOP_CANCER_CENTERS_36597977+%281%29.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1527734\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-18T23:46:26Z\", \"section\": \"Health\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140318-health_overhaul_top_cancer_centers_36597977-1-.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/HEALTH_OVERHAUL_TOP_CANCER_CENTERS_36597977+%281%29.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-03-18T23:46:26Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda249\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe challenges of this are going to become evident \u2026 as cancer cases start to arrive,\u201d said Norman Hubbard, executive vice president of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.\n\u201cOverall, when you look at the Affordable Care Act, it improves access to cancer care,\u201d said Underwood.\nMD Anderson Cancer Center says it\u2019s in less than half of the plans in the Houston area.\nOf the 19 that responded, four reported access through all insurers: the Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C., and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance is excluded by five out of eight insurers in Washington\u2019s insurance exchange."}
