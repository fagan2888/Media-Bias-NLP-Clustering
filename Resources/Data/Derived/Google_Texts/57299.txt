With a recent poll showing him in a dead heat with incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, former Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Scott Brown may be considering a bid to unseat her."If I can play a role, I'm going to play a role, whether it's in public office or behind the scenes or just challenging people" as a Fox News contributor, the Republican said Tuesday on Fox News Channel's "Your World with Neil Cavuto." Cavuto tried to nail Brown down on whether he plans to challenge Shaheen â€“ or make a bid for president in 2016.Brown wouldn't take the bait, saying he is focusing on family at the moment. A month ago he moved to New Hampshire, where he said he has "long and strong ties." His mother and sister live there, as do several aunts and uncles.Cavuto noted the similarity to Mitt Romney, who moved to Massachusetts from his native Michigan and became governor. He was the 2012 GOP presidential nominee.Brown laughed that off, but media outlets such as Power Line blog have noted Shaheen's lost luster since voting for the Affordable Care Act.A recent Purple Strategies poll showed Shaheen and Brown both with 44 percent support of likely voters in a theoretical contest.Newsmax previously reported that Brown has revamped his old campaign website and formed a political action committee.
