Police say an HIV-positive Virginia man knowingly exposed two women to the virus.

Daniel Cleaves of Richmond was arrested earlier this month on seven charges of transferring HIV to the woman after meeting her at downtown Bethesda bar in July. Police say the 28-year-old Cleaves had unprotected sex with her seven times over a three-day period.

The woman told police she found medical tests in Cleaves' backpack saying he was HIV-positive, and that he later sent her text messages saying he wasn't a bad person but had made a mistake. He's facing seven counts in relation to that case.

Another woman has since come forward, and Cleaves is facing two additional counts.

Cleaves has been accused in several sexual assaults in the Richmond and Virginia Beach area, according to NBC12. Many of the victims said they blacked out or had medicated themselves before Cleaves allegedly assaulted them.

None of the victims indicated whether Cleaves had disclosed his HIV status, NBC12 reports.

Cleaves posted bond and is awaiting his next court date. No attorney is listed for him in court records.

Police are looking into whether Cleaves has had unprotected sex with other women.
