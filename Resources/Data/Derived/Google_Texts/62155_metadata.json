Cortese, emeritus president and CEO of the Mayo Clinic, and Foundation Professor and director of the Healthcare Delivery and Policy ProgramThe program is part of the College of Health Solutions. at ASU.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve ignored the fact that we should be paying attention to the way care is provided and outcomes over time. Redesigning the delivery system today is something that we are probably way behind in dealing with, and the problem is urgent.\u201d\n\nCortese was joined by fellow panelist Sir Malcolm Grant, the founding chairman of National Health System England (NHS), which provides health care for approximately 60 million and employs close to 5 million people.\n\n\n\nAbout 100 people gather at the Desert Botanical Garden for the Z\u00f3calo Public Square conversation April 6 in Phoenix.

Photos by Charlie Leight/ASU Now\n\nThe pair spoke in front of a crowd of approximately 100 people at Desert Botanical Garden about America\u2019s health-care system, the challenges it faces in the 21st century, and whether we should consider another model or partnering with other countries to create an international system.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I like about Z\u00f3calo is that they are unafraid about taking on the biggest issues, the big topics and the really complicated things that other people run away from,\u201d Crow said. \u201cBoth of these gentleman have been thinking about the issues that seem to get lost in the political rhetoric, in the day-to-day economic discussions that are going on today.\n\nCrow added that of the 30 or so leading economies in the world, the United States spends more per capita on health by a factor of two than any other country and has a net health outcome in the bottom five.\n\n\u201cWe have lower levels of life span and more problematic health outcomes,\u201d Crow said. \u201cMany countries are spending less than half of what we are and getting equal or greater outcomes than we are.\u201d\n\nGrant said Britain\u2019s nationalized system was started in 1948 by the Labor Party, who believed the best way to provide security for their entire population was a system paid for through taxation and payroll deduction. He said that although it did and still does have the best of intentions and has had fairly good health outcomes, that system is no longer working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a model that\u2019s totally taxable but really creaking under the pressure of what we can afford to provide,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWe are a single payer that provides for hospitals directed by the government. But it\u2019s a fragmented system that\u2019s not very coherent \u2026 we\u2019re entering a stage of hysteria, and we know we\u2019ve got to make a change.\u201d\n\nThe hysteria was felt on Tuesday when the NHS suffered its third junior doctor\u2019s strike of the year \u2014 doctors with 10 years or less of service \u2014 disrupting operations, treatment and service to thousands of patients. On April 26-27, junior doctors plan to strike again, refusing to staff their departments as well as emergency surgery and intensive care.\n\n\n\nMalcolm Grant (center) shares about the negative realities of Britain\u2019s nationalized health system with (left) ASU President Michael Crow and Denis A. Cortese.\n\nCortese said before anything drastic like that happens on our side of the pond, he thinks the States should consider adopting a government-sponsored insurance program like that in the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, which offers insurance to all but is administered through private insurance companies.\n\n\u201cYou hear about fraud in Medicare all the time, but when\u2019s the last time you heard about any fraud in private insurance?\u201d Cortese said. \u201cThey\u2019re efficient, they\u2019ll weed out the fraud and waste and can still make money.\u201d\n\nCortese said he\u2019s not talking about socializing health-care delivery but about a carefully crafted five-point system that includes national coverage to everyone, has the option for a higher level of care, is market-based and offers means-tested support from the government.\n\nMany already contend that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 mandates that all Americans possess health insurance and requires private insurance companies to offer certain kinds of coverage, Cortese said. But the act has failed in many regards, chiefly in insuring all Americans.\n\n\u201cEven if the Affordable Care Act works perfectly by 2025, we\u2019ll still have 31 million people uninsured,\u201d Cortese said. \u201cOur federal government should have a national strategy and make a commitment to getting everybody insured.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s good news. Although the current system is broken, says Cortese, it can be fixed.\n\n\u201cWe already have a system in place that like in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,\u201d Cortese said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very efficient system and is run well. It\u2019s a great model.\n\n\u201cThe problem is our leaders do not understand the difference between governance and managing. Governing means oversight, making sure goals and expectations are met and holding people accountable. We can get this done, so let\u2019s do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Having medical coverage for all Americans has in recent years been touted as a national priority.
