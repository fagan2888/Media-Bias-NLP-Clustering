Burwell case, which could come before the end of the week.\n\nBut leaders in most Republican-led states stood pat while criticizing the law that provided the subsidies for being written in a way that could take them away if the court rules that only states with their own health insurance exchanges are eligible.\n\nIn Kansas, where Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers, 70 GOP legislators recently signed a letter stating they would not establish a state-based exchange and urging Congress to \u201creconsider or re-examine Obamacare.\u201d\n\nA statement released Monday from Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook and Rep. Dan Hawkins, who head the Legislature\u2019s health committees, went further, urging Congress to repeal the law entirely.\n\n\u201cThe people of Kansas didn\u2019t write this law, they didn\u2019t want this law, and they\u2019re tired of having to pay for this law,\u201d said Pilcher-Cook, a Republican from Shawnee. \u201cObamacare is nothing more than Washington telling us how to buy health care, and if Congress won\u2019t stand up for our citizens, I will. We will not spend one more penny fixing Congress\u2019 mistakes, whether that means rejecting Medicaid expansion or a state exchange.\u201d\n\nAbout 77,000 Kansans receive federal subsidies for insurance through healthcare.gov that could disappear depending on how the justices rule.\n\nThe joint statement from Hawkins and Pilcher-Cook states that \u201cif the Justices invalidate the subsidies, states will once again be pressured to implement Obamacare by establishing a state-based exchange,\u201d but Kansas will not relent.\n\nContingency plans\n\nThirty-four states use the federal insurance exchange, healthcare.gov; the rest, as well as the District of Columbia, retain some control over their exchanges.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s administration got permission from the federal government to continue using the federal exchange at healthcare.gov while taking other steps to make it a state-partnership exchange.\n\nRon Ruman, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, said that plan will shield the subsidies that about 380,000 Pennsylvanians use to buy health insurance while saving the state the startup costs that quickly ballooned in other states that established their own exchanges.\n\n\u201cOur role essentially would be approving the (exchange) plans, which is something we do with many of our other insurance plans anyway,\u201d Ruman said.\n\nAdditionally, Pennsylvania would take over certain administrative functions like running a call center and a consumer education program. It also would take the role of levying a fee on insurance plans sold on the exchange \u2014 currently 3.5 percent \u2014 and then remit some of that money to the federal government for use of healthcare.gov.\n\nRuman said those are contingency plans in case the U.S. Supreme Court rules for the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell. If the court doesn\u2019t, Pennsylvania would maintain the status quo and allow residents to use healthcare.gov under full federal administration.\n\n\u201cRight now we really are dependent on what the court would say initially,\u201d Ruman said. \u201cOur goal and our plan is to, if need be, have this up and running by open enrollment November 1.\u201d\n\nJim Grant, spokesman for the Delaware Department for Health and Social Services, said that state\u2019s plan is much the same but with different starting points. Delaware already had a \u201cpartnership exchange\u201d in which it used healthcare.gov but handled consumer outreach, customer assistance and plan certification.\n\nThe only difference in the new plan, he said, would be the state of Delaware taking responsibility for levying the exchange fee and remitting some of the proceeds to the federal government for use of healthcare.gov.\n\nArkansas began plans to transition to a state exchange under Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe. Under his successor, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, those plans have been put on hold pending the King v. Burwell decision. The state has conditional federal approval to make the transition, but not until 2017, according to the original timeline.\n\nKansas awaits ruling\n\nClark Shultz, legislative liaison for the Kansas Insurance Department, said Kansas Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer has been in talks with state legislators and the Kansas congressional delegation about how to respond to the King v. Burwell ruling.\n\nShultz said continuing to use healthcare.gov but taking over some administrative responsibilities could be \u201ca viable solution in states where the Legislature would adopt that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose you could make the case that if you do that, that\u2019s a state declaring that the federal exchange is going to be their state exchange,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the (legal) battle, I suppose. Now does that fulfill the obligations? You know, we don\u2019t know what the court is going to say.\u201d\n\nWhile much of the attention about the upcoming decision has focused on its effects on consumers losing subsidies, Shultz said Selzer also has been in talks with insurance company leaders about what it could mean to their industry.\n\nInsurance companies are concerned that if a decision immediately invalidates subsidies, it could cause healthy Kansans to stop paying their suddenly unsubsidized premiums. That would leave insurers still on the hook for sick clients\u2019 medical bills without the benefit of a larger premium pool to diffuse risk.\n\nThe insurance companies would not be able to adjust their premiums until the next open enrollment period.\n\nThe implications of that worst-case scenario for the insurance industry could spur Congress to extend the ACA subsidies at least through the end of the year and possibly until after the 2016 election.\n\nRepublicans leaders in both chambers and the all-Republican Kansas congressional delegation have hinted at a short-term extension while Congress works to dismantle the law and replace it with something more to the GOP\u2019s liking.\n\nShultz said the insurance department will adjust to the court ruling when it comes down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect the consumer, and Commissioner Selzer has truly tried to make that his issue in his talks with others and trying to be there to offer alternatives as conditions allow,\u201d Shultz said.\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "With a U.S. Supreme Court decision on Affordable Care Act subsidies looming, state preparations again have exposed deep political divides over the federal", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/feds-grant-flexibility-other-states-kansas-awaits-ruling-subsidies", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201506/screen_shot_2015-06-23_at_11.12.06_am.png", "type": "article", "description": "With a U.S. Supreme Court decision on Affordable Care Act subsidies looming, state preparations again have exposed deep political divides over the federal", "title": "Feds Grant Flexibility To Other States As Kansas Awaits Ruling On Subsidies"}, "story_id": 416862950, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Andy Marso", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Feds Grant Flexibility To Other States As Kansas Awaits Ruling On Subsidies"}, "nid": 75073, "datePublished": "2015-06-23", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Digital Post, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 1176, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Kansas awaits rulingClark Shultz, legislative liaison for the Kansas Insurance Department, said Kansas Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer has been in talks with state legislators and the Kansas congressional delegation about how to respond to the King v.
