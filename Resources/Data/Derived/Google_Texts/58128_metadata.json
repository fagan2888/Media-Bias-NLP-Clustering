But she says Kansas is still experiencing high levels of poverty that don\u2019t reflect the nation\u2019s economic recovery.\n\n\u201cI hesitate to call it good news,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though we do appear to be moving in the right direction, we are still well above pre-recession levels, at 17.72 percent, and surrounding states are making progress faster than we are.\u201d\n\nCotsoradis says Kansas had a child poverty rate of about 15 percent prior to the recession.\n\n\u201cPre-recession levels of poverty is what we would be looking for, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing in the release of this year\u2019s report,\u201d she says. \u201cThis certainly goes well beyond the current (Gov. Sam Brownback) administration. This is a trend we\u2019ve been watching in Kansas for more than a decade.\u201d\n\nBut Cotsoradis worries about recent changes in the state\u2019s eligibility rules for programs intended to help families living in poverty. She said Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and child care assistance have seen significant declines in participation. Those reductions are inconsistent with the poverty levels Kansas is experiencing, she said, and could be damaging to the state\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe actually want those kids to be accessing child care assistance,\u201d Cotsoradis says. \u201cWe want those families to be accessing temporary assistance. We want children growing up in poverty to have access to Early Head Start and Head Start, because we know those are the things that make the difference \u2014 that really change the trajectory of a child\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nAdditional highlights from the 2015 Kansas Kids Count report:\n\nOn-time child immunization rates show signs of improvement after a significant drop in recent years. However, the Kansas immunization rate is down 3.3 percent over the last five years.\n\nEnrollment in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program increased to 55,469 Kansas children, up 3,845 children since 2010.\n\nThe Kansas Kids Count report analyzes child trends at the state and county levels, and includes data for every county in the state. It is a follow-up look at the national Kids Count Databook released in the summer by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "An annual report on child well-being in Kansas shows some positive trends, but they\u2019re overshadowed by persistent problems.
