Armed with twin majorities in Congress, the GOP has scheduled votes that would chip away at the health overhaul.\n\nDuring the speech, Speaker John A. Boehner released an analysis that said Obamacare\u2019s mandates are killing jobs and slashing hours for middle-class Americans.\n\n\u201cAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare,\u201d added freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, Iowa Republican, in prepared remarks for the GOP rebuttal. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\u201d\n\nObamacare is under threat from more than the Republican-led Congress.\n\nBy June, the Supreme Court will rule on whether the IRS unlawfully extended the law\u2019s subsidies to customers on the federal exchange.\n\nChallengers say the Affordable Care Act\u2019s text reserved the subsidies to people who use exchanges \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d which they understand to be the exchanges set up by 13 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe Obama administration says Congress intended make the subsidies available to Americans no matter where they live.\n\nMichael Cannon, a health policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute who developed the legal underpinning for the challenge, had called on Mr. Obama to warn federal exchange customers about the potential fallout from the case.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to put an end to the deception, tonight,\u201d Mr. Cannon wrote Tuesday in a blog post for Forbes. \u201cHe needs to warn HealthCare.gov enrollees about the risks inherent in their coverage, so they have time to prepare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This time, President Obama got his signature domestic achievement out of the way early.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "This time, President Obama got his signature domestic achievement out of the way early.", "title": "Obamacare plays a bit role in State of the Union, even as it looms large in GOP agenda", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/20/obamacare-plays-bit-role-state-union-even-it-looms/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/20/us-politics-state_of_the_union-obama_rix20_2dd3302017bc457ca8c954e4e83fc0cf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/20/us-politics-state_of_the_union-obama_rix20_2dd3302017bc457ca8c954e4e83fc0cf.jpg", "title": "Obamacare plays a bit role in State of the Union, even as it looms lar", "description": "This time, President Obama got his signature domestic achievement out of the way early.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Congress, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf004\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMore of our people are insured than ever before,\u201d Mr. Obama told Congress in the opening lines of his State of the Union address.\nFrom there, Mr. Obama promoted ways to offer an affordable college education, fight climate change and fight terrorism.\nArmed with twin majorities in Congress, the GOP has scheduled votes that would chip away at the health overhaul.\nIf Congress tries to touch the Affordable Care Act or other achievements, he said, it will earn his veto.\nThe Obama administration says Congress intended make the subsidies available to Americans no matter where they live."}
