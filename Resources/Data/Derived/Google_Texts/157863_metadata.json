Will take place on August 16th at Whittier Middle School from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon. In order to receive supplies, the child must be present, accompanied by an adult, and must have one form of identification, such as a Social Security Card, birth certificate, or passport.\n\nWe'll hear more about how this program is benefiting families tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News at 10.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Walmart and the Banquet are teaming up to gather school supplies for low-income families.
