They are inspiring thousands to join them. Their intolerance, vicious tactics and growing power seem to have inspired others, as well.\n\nAfter years of claiming the science is settled and unprecedented manmade catastrophes are occurring right now, Climate Crisis, Inc. is increasingly desperate. Polls put climate change at the bottom of every list of public concerns. China and India refuse to cut energy production or emissions. Real-world weather and climate totally contradict their dire models and forecasts. Expensive, subsidized, environmentally harmful renewable energy makes little sense in world freshly awash in cheap, accessible oil, gas and coal.\n\nPerhaps worse, Congress is in Republican control, and in 23 months the White House and Executive Branch could also shift dramatically away from the Freezing-Jobless-in-the-Dark Side of the Force.\n\nClimate Crisis industrialists are also fed up with constant carping, criticism and questions from growing numbers of experts who will not kowtow to their End of Days theology. Once seemingly near, their dream of ruling a hydrocarbon-free world of \u201csustainably\u201d lower living standards become more remote every week. Extremist factions had dreamed of a global climatist caliphate and want vengeance.\n\nSo borrowing from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton mentor Saul Alinsky\u2019s book, Rules for Radicals, they have gone on the attack: Pick a target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. A good tactic is one your people enjoy. A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions. They\u2019ve also borrowed from the Islamic State playbook: Silence your enemies.\n\nLed by Greenpeace associate Kert Davies, this Climatist Jihad wing of the climate chaos movement has launched a well funded, carefully choreographed vendetta of character assassination and destruction, vilifying dangerous manmade climate change \u201cdeniers\u201d and trying to destroy their careers. Their Big Green, Big Government and media allies are either actively complicit, rooting from the sidelines or silent.\n\nInstead of bullets, bombs and beheadings, they use double standards, Greenpeace FOIA demands, letters from Senator Ed Markey and Congressman Raul Grijalva, threats of lost funding and jobs, and constant intimidation and harassment. Submit, recant, admit your guilt, renounce your nature-rules-climate faith, Climatist Jihadis tell climate realists. Or suffer the consequences, which might even include IRS, EPA and Fish & Wildlife Service swat teams bursting through your doors, as they did with Gibson Guitars.\n\nTheir first target was Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics scientist Wei-Hock \u201cWillie\u201d Soon. Working closely with Greenpeace\u2019s Climate Investigations Center, the Boston Globe and New York Times alleged that Dr. Soon received $1.25 million from the fossil fuel industry, but failed to disclose those funds when his scientific papers were published and falsely claimed he had no conflict of interest.\n\nThe charges are bogus. The Harvard-Smithsonian had full knowledge of Dr. Soon\u2019s research financing and took 40% of the grant money off the top: some $500,000! The details are all public records, and Dr. Soon has a solid track record of going where his careful and extensive research takes him \u2013 regardless of where the money comes from. Not a scrap of evidence suggests that he falsified or fabricated data or conclusions, or twisted his science to satisfy research sponsors, on any of the numerous topics he has studied.\n\nHe has received incredible flak from environmentalist pressure groups, media outlets and even his own university \u2013 and has courageously stood behind his research, analyses, and findings, which continue to withstand intense scientific scrutiny. Harvard-Smithsonian recently said it \u201cdoes not support Dr. Soon\u2019s conclusions on climate change,\u201d and Harvard Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor Daniel Schrag averred that Soon\u2019s approach to finding global average temperatures was perhaps not \u201cas honest as other approaches.\u201d But they offer not a scintilla of evidence to support their allegations of inaccuracy and dishonesty, and give him no opportunity to respond.\n\nIndeed, one of the most prominent aspects of the climate imbroglio is the steadfast refusal of alarmist scientists to discuss or debate their findings with experts who argue that extensive, powerful natural forces \u2013 not human carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 drive Earth\u2019s climate and weather. \u201cManmade disaster\u201d proponents also refuse to divulge raw data, computer codes and other secretive work that is often paid for with taxpayer money and is always used to justify laws, treaties, regulations, mandates and subsidies that stifle economic growth, kill jobs and reduce living standards.\n\nDr. Soon is not the only target. The Climate Jihadists are also going after Robert Balling, Matt Briggs, John Christy, Judith Curry, Tom Harris, Steven Hayward, David Legates, Richard Lindzen, and Roger Pielke, Jr. More are sure to follow, because their work eviscerates climate cataclysm claims and raises serious questions about the accuracy, credibility, integrity, and sanctity of alarmist science.\n\nClimate Crisis, Inc. wants a monopoly over the issue. Its members focus almost exclusively on alleged human causes of climate change and extreme weather events \u2013 and would love to see skeptics silenced. Crisis proponents will not even attend scientific conferences where skeptics discuss natural causes and alarmists have opportunities to defend their hypotheses, models, and evidence. (Perhaps the FCC needs to investigate this monopoly and issue \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d rules to ensure honest and balanced discussion.)\n\nIt fits a depressing pattern: of the White House, Democrats and liberals shutting down debate, permitting no amendments, conducting business behind closed doors, not allowing anyone to read proposed laws and regulations, rarely even recognizing that there are differing views \u2013 on ObamaCare, ObamaNetCare, IRS harassment of conservative donors and groups, PM Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress, or climate change.\n\nThe Climate Crisis industry thrives on tens of billions of dollars annually, for one-sided climate research, drilling and fracking studies, renewable energy projects and other programs, all based on dubious claims that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions threaten climate stability and planetary survival.\n\nBusinesses, job holders and consumers pay the huge costs of complying with the resultant regulations and soaring energy costs. Taxpayers pay for much of the research and propaganda that drives the rulemaking. Russia and hard-left foundations have also contributed billions to the process; and government unions, environmental pressure groups and renewable energy companies give generously to researchers and to politicians who keep the alarmist research programs, regulatory processes, mandates, and subsidies alive.\n\nAll of this raises another elephantine issue. If a couple million dollars over a decade\u2019s time creates near-criminal conflict-of-interest and disclosure problems for skeptic/realist scientists, what effects do billions of dollars in research money have on alarmist researchers and their universities and institutions?\n\nFew, if any, alarmist researchers have disclosed that their work was funded by government agencies, companies, foundations and others with enormous financial, policy, political and other interests in their work, ensuring that their conclusions support manmade factors and debunk natural causes. Many of those researchers have signed statements that their research and papers involved no conflicts, knowing they would not get these grants, if their outcomes did not reflect the sponsors\u2019 interests and perspectives.\n\nMoreover, ClimateGate, IPCC revelations and other investigations have revealed extensive and troubling incidents of manipulated data, faulty models, wild exaggerations, broken hockey sticks, and completely baseless claims about hottest years, disappearing glaciers, coastal flooding, and other \u201ccrises.\u201d And those claims severely impact our energy costs, jobs, living standards, economic growth, and freedoms.\n\nWe need to end the double standards \u2013 and investigate the alarmist researchers and institutions.\n\nOr perhaps better yet, let us instead have that all-out, open, robust debate that climate realists have long sought \u2013 and alarmists have refused to join. Equal government and other money for all research. All cards and evidence on the table. No more hiding data and codes. Answer all questions, no matter how tough or inconvenient. And let honest science decide what our energy and economic futures will be.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nPaul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (www.CFACT.org), author of Eco-Imperialism: Green power \u2013 Black death, and coauthor of Cracking Big Green: Saving the world from the Save-the-Earth money machine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/03/climatist-jihad/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/climate-heresy.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Climatist Jihad?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c0a\"", "article_summary": "After years of claiming the science is settled and unprecedented manmade catastrophes are occurring right now, Climate Crisis, Inc. is increasingly desperate.\nClimate Crisis industrialists are also fed up with constant carping, criticism and questions from growing numbers of experts who will not kowtow to their End of Days theology.\nClimate Crisis, Inc. wants a monopoly over the issue.\nWe need to end the double standards \u2013 and investigate the alarmist researchers and institutions.\nExpensive, subsidized, environmentally harmful renewable energy makes little sense in world freshly awash in cheap, accessible oil, gas and coal."}
