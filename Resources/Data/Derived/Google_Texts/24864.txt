HONG KONG--The Nikkei Hong Kong Purchasing Managers Index contracted further to 46.4 in December from 46.6 in November, signaling a continued deterioration in the city's business conditions amid China's economic slowdown, index compiler Markit Group Ltd. said Wednesday.

The December PMI was dragged down by a sharp drop in new orders amid weak demand in China, while inventories of inputs fall at their fastest rate since early 2009, Markit said. A PMI reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below that points to a contraction.

"Hong Kong's private sector had a disappointing end to 2015," Markit economist Annabel Fiddes said, noting sharp reductions in both purchasing activity and inventories in December showed that companies do not expect a growth rebound in the immediate future.

The reading had been released as the HSBC Hong Kong PMI until June 2015, when HSBC and Markit Economics ended their tie-up. Markit said on June 29 that Nikkei would assume sponsorship of the Hong Kong survey and nine others.

The PMI is derived from indexes that measure changes in output, new orders, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of goods purchased. A reading above 50 indicates the economy is expanding.

The PMI is usually issued during the first working week of every month for the previous month's data. It is based on a survey of 300 companies.
