A woman who was a passenger on a motorcycle died and two riders were injured Saturday when a pair of motorcyclists collided on Interstate 70 near Idaho Springs.

The accident happened at 4:31 p.m., said Colorado State Patrol Trooper Tim Sutherland.

The motorcyclists were headed east in the center lane of the road when they passed a slower moving vehicle near mile marker 244.7.

One of the bikes passed the vehicle on the left, and the other on the right.

“When they merged back together the hit each other,” Sutherland said.

All three were thrown from the two Harley Davidson motorcycles. A 47-year-old rider suffered serious injuries, and a 46-year-old rider had moderate injuries.

All three were taken to St. Anthony Central Hospital, where a 35-year-old woman was pronounced dead.

Alcohol is suspected as a contributing factor in the accident.

Identifications are being withheld pending notification of next of kin, Sutherland said.
