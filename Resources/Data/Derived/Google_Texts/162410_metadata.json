He did not give an exact number.\n\n\u201cOur people are using boats to survey the river for any dead bodies. But here at the scene we are calling off the search as there are no more bodies inside the ferry,\u201d Ferdousi said.\n\nUp to 140 passengers were thought to be on the ferry when it capsized Sunday afternoon after being hit by a cargo vessel in the Padma River, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Dhaka. The river is one of Bangladesh\u2019s largest.\n\nFerry accidents are common in the South Asian nation, which is crisscrossed by more than 130 rivers.\n\nA salvage ship pulled the ferry, the M.L. Mosta, to the surface from about 6 meters (20 feet) of water.\n\nRescuers recovered 48 bodies on Sunday and another 22 on Monday, according to police.\n\nInspector Zihad Mia, who was overseeing the rescue operation, said it was not known how many passengers were missing and how many survived. Ferries in Bangladesh usually do not have formal passenger lists.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear picture about how many were exactly on the ferry when it sank,\u201d Mia said.\n\nJewel Mia, an official from the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, told reporters that up to 140 people were thought to be on the ferry when it sank.\n\nA passenger who survived said many people were inside the vessel when it sank. \u201cThe passengers who were on the deck survived, but many who were inside were trapped,\u201d Hafizur Rahman Sheikh was quoted as saying by the Prothom Alo newspaper.\n\nSheikh said the cargo vessel hit the middle of the ferry.\n\nThe Ministry of Shipping said it has ordered an investigation.\n\nFerry disasters in Bangladesh are often attributed to overcrowding and poor safety standards.\n\nLast August, a ferry with an official capacity of 85 passengers was carrying more than 200 when it capsized on the Padma River near Dhaka, leaving more than 100 people dead or missing. The ferry\u2019s owner was arrested on charges of culpable homicide, unauthorized operation and overloading.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The death toll from a weekend ferry disaster in central Bangladesh rose to 70 on Monday, as divers finished their search after the vessel was lifted to the surface and towed to shore.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The death toll from a weekend ferry disaster in central Bangladesh rose to 70 on Monday, as divers finished their search after the vessel was lifted to the surface and towed to shore.", "title": "Bangladesh ferry disaster: Death toll rises to at least 70", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/23/bangladesh-ferry-disaster-death-toll-rises-least-7/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/23/APTOPIX_Bangladesh_Ferry_Capsize.JPEG-0b9a9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/23/APTOPIX_Bangladesh_Ferry_Capsize.JPEG-0b9a9.jpg", "description": "The death toll from a weekend ferry disaster in central Bangladesh rose to 70 on Monday, as divers finished their search after the vessel was lifted to the surface and towed to shore.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bangladesh ferry disaster: Death toll rises to at least 70"}, "Author": "Julhas Alam", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Bangladesh, Dhaka, Rasheda Ferdousi"}, "article_summary": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) \u2014 The death toll from a weekend ferry disaster in central Bangladesh rose to 70 on Monday, as divers finished their search after the vessel was lifted to the surface and towed to shore.\nBut here at the scene we are calling off the search as there are no more bodies inside the ferry,\u201d Ferdousi said.\nFerry disasters in Bangladesh are often attributed to overcrowding and poor safety standards.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear picture about how many were exactly on the ferry when it sank,\u201d Mia said.\nJewel Mia, an official from the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, told reporters that up to 140 people were thought to be on the ferry when it sank."}
