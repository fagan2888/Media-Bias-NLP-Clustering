Well, the wolf is no longer at the door America, the beast has moved into our living rooms, and he is ravenously hungry and doesn\u2019t give a damn what is on the authorized menu.\u201d\n\nNugent concludes the essay by saying it is time to rid America of \u201cvampire wolves,\u201d writing \u201c[v]ampire wolves be gone. It is now or never, America.
