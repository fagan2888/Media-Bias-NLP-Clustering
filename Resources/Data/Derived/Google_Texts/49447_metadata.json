These small, battery-powered devices heat a nicotine-containing liquid, producing an inhalable vapor that provides smokers with the nicotine buzz they crave. Because they do not produce the tar, arsenic and other carcinogens that come from burning tobacco, they have been heralded as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes, and even as a smoking cessation method.\n\nBut it turns out the two kinds of cigarettes aren\u2019t so different from each other at all\u2014particularly when it comes to who is selling them.\n\nOver the last year, Big Tobacco has made major inroads into the $3 billion e-cigarette market with major companies like Altria and Reynolds American releasing their own e-cig brands. At the same time, they have taken on an unlikely role as champions for public health. Industry leaders have been lobbying hard for any negative health effects of e-cigarettes to be publicized and for people to switch over to this purportedly less-harmful smoking alternative. This week, the CEOs of Reynolds and Lorillard, two of the country\u2019s largest tobacco companies, urged the FDA to move faster to regulate the burgeoning industry, citing concerns that e-cig users were relying on cheap, low-quality products purchased online and imported from China.\n\nThat\u2019s right: the leaders of an industry that sells a product that kills some 480,000 Americans every year are now in a panic to warn consumers about the health risks of smoking. It is a remarkable about-face. So what\u2019s in it for them?\n\nA recent New York Times article helped shed some light on their motives. In what they claim is a grand gesture of corporate responsibility, major tobacco companies are slapping their e-cigarette packages with lengthy health warnings that are much stronger than anything found on their other tobacco products. One such warning, from Altria, maker of Marlboros and MarkTen electronic cigarettes, runs more than 100 words and reads in part: \u201cNicotine is addictive and habit-forming, and is very toxic by inhalation, in contact with the skin, or if swallowed.\u201d The warnings advise the dangers of smoking for children, women who are pregnant, those who take medications for depression or asthma, or who have high blood pressure or diabetes. They explicitly say that e-cigarettes are not a means of quitting smoking. It seems, then, that Big Tobacco is trying to play the e-cig game both ways. They want to capitalize on this growing market by pushing for stringent FDA regulations that would drive their smaller competitors out of business, but they also want to avoid cutting too deeply into their profits from traditional cigarettes by telling people there is no real benefit to going electronic.\n\nBecause they are so new, there has been no long-term, conclusive research on the health effects of electronic cigarettes. Some studies have found that e-cigs can help people quit; others say the exact opposite. Many individual e-cigarette users have come forward with success stories about using the product to quit traditional cigarettes, but all of this evidence is anecdotal. More worryingly, researchers at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York found that some e-cigs contain low levels of carcinogens. According to Allan M. Brandt, a Harvard professor of the history of medicine who is quoted in the Times piece, these warning labels fit into a long tobacco industry tradition of misleading consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly effective and duplicitous practice in inventing additional new uncertainties and, at the same time, appearing to be cooperative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Needless to say, the industry's motives for warning people about the dangers of e-cigarettes are hardly pure", "title": "Suddenly Big Tobacco is deeply concerned about your health", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Needless to say, the industry's motives for warning people about the dangers of e-cigarettes are hardly pure", "title": "Suddenly Big Tobacco is deeply concerned about your health", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/04/since_when_did_big_tobacco_care_about_your_health_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/03/smoking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Needless to say, the industry's motives for warning people about the dangers of e-cigarettes are hardly pure", "title": "Suddenly Big Tobacco is deeply concerned about your health", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/03/smoking.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allegra Kirkland", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Big Tobacco, Health, public health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e09\"", "article_summary": "Because they are so new, there has been no long-term, conclusive research on the health effects of electronic cigarettes.\nAccording to Allan M.
