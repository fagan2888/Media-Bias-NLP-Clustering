A bipartisan bill that would bolster telehealth across Colorado by preventing insurance plans from requiring in-person care to patients when it can be appropriately provided remotely passed the House Wednesday.

The bill, which now moves to the Senate, would expand current state law on telehealth â€” care delivered remotely via computers, cameras, smartphones and other devices. Insurance companies can require in-person health care delivery, as a condition of coverage, for patients residing in counties with more than 150,000 residents.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Perry Buck, R-Windsor, and Rep. Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, would remove population restrictions effective Jan. 1, 2017.

If passed, the bill would preclude health plans from requiring in-person care if consulting, monitoring and other care could be administered effectively at a distance. It would prevent plans from reimbursing providers who deliver telehealth on a different basis than for in-person care. Health plans could not charge different deductibles, co-payments or co-insurance amounts or set different annual or lifetime dollar maximums.
