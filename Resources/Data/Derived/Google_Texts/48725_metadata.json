Just to ensure that their new location couldn\u2019t get any more \u201cPortlandia\u201d if it tried, the new Whole Foods location will also feature a music section strictly for vinyl records.\n\nOh, and for \u201creclaimed vinyl jewelry,\u201d whatever that means.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted Brooklyn to feel like this was their store,\u201d a Whole Foods spokesman told New York Daily News.
