Convicted in WikiLeaks case, Chelsea Manning uses time behind bars to draft anti-spying bill

One of the country’s best-known leakers of classified government information has been using some of her time behind bars to draft a bill that would curtail U.S. spying powers.

Convicted in a high-profile military secrets case involving material provided to WikiLeaks, former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning revealed the draft legislation (PDF) in a Medium post on Tuesday.

Among other provisions, it calls for the abolition of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court, and would transfer that court’s cases to the rest of the federal court system, which traditionally has fewer secrecy provisions, the Hill reports.

Manning further details her concerns in an op-ed piece published by the Guardian.

If introduced, the bill is an unlikely prospect for passage in either the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives, predicts the Hill.
