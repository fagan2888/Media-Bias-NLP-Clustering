Trump maintains his lead over the other GOP candidates in seven states, though Ted Cruz did win in Kansas. Trump\u2019s rally in Florida had its usual occurrences: protesters ejected, Trump making promises that he will \u201cGet it done,\u201d and believe it or not, he had his supporters raise their right hands in a Hitler-salute-type fashion, and recite a pledge that, no matter what, they will vote for Donald Trump. Is he for real? And moreover, are these supporters for real? Truthfully, the whole campaign is beginning to transition from the ridiculous to the sublime.\n\nTrump supporters hurting protesters\n\nIf you look back over the current Presidency, you\u2019ll notice that Obama has met resistance from the Republicans with the introduction of every new policy. They\u2019ve opposed big ideas like the Affordable Care Act, though thousands of Americans have gained the ability to obtain healthcare and screenings. They\u2019ve also opposed small things like the fist-bump that Obama shared with his wife in recognition of his win. The Republicans spent his whole first term trying to prove that he was neither Christian nor American, and the list goes on and on. But somehow, Trump has gotten away with such acts as claiming that Latinos bring drugs and crime to the states, and more recently, he encouraged his followers to escort protesters out of his rallies, explaining that if they hurt them he would \u201cdefend them in court.\u201d Trump added that when protesters are \u201cswinging and punching, it is amazing to watch.\u201d How can it be that a person who hurls racial epithets and publically defends his penis size be the favored choice of Americans to represent them? The only conclusion is the scariest one: he is saying what these people are thinking.\n\nRomney and McCain speak out\n\nThere is hope, though. Finally, an established Republican, Mitt Romney, has come out publically against Donald Trump. In his opinion, \u201cHe\u2019s playing the American public for suckers and he has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president,\u201d he added. More importantly, Romney is not the only former Presidential candidate to speak up against Trump. John McCain strongly denounced Mr. Trump as a candidate who was ignorant of foreign policy and has made \u201cdangerous\u201d pronouncements on national security. Of course, The Donald was quick with a Trump-ism, and called him a \u201cfailed candidate,\u201d \u201cchoke artist,\u201d and \u201closer\u201d for his loss to President Obama in 2012.\n\nLawsuit may take Trump down\n\nIt remains to be seen how these comments will affect Trump's campaign. Apparently, Donald is being sued by New York\u2019s Attorney General, Eric T. Schneiderman. Scheiderman\u2019s suit is based on his claim that Trump University was fraudulent. He says that Trump \u201cbilked\u201d students of more than $40,000, collectively, according to Rick Rojas of The New York Times. It is promising that Trump has recently lost two states, and if Kasich wins Michigan and Ohio, he could be in trouble. It just may be that the vulgar remarks are beginning to take a toll on Trump\u2019s credibility.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Election 2016,Democrats vs Republicans", "author": "Blasting News", "og": {"site_name": "Blasting News", "description": "With right hands held high the only thing missing was the goose step march", "title": "Trump followers swear to vote for him", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/opinion/2016/03/trump-followers-swear-to-vote-for-him-00825099.html", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://static.blastingnews.com/media/photogallery/2016/3/7/main/the-donald-still-leading-the-pack-wikimedia_631597.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 347}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With right hands held high the only thing missing was the goose step march...", "title": "Trump followers swear to vote for him", "url": "http://goo.gl/SBm7nr", "image": "http://static.blastingnews.com/media/photogallery/2016/3/7/main/the-donald-still-leading-the-pack-wikimedia_631597.jpg", "creator": "@BlastingNews", "site": "@BlastingNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "follow", "revisit-after": "1 weeks", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956}, "Googlebot-News": "noindex, nofollow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With right hands held high the only thing missing was the goose step march"}, "article_summary": "Finally, an established Republican, Mitt Romney, has come out publically against Donald Trump.\nTrump supporters hurting protestersIf you look back over the current Presidency, you\u2019ll notice that Obama has met resistance from the Republicans with the introduction of every new policy.\nTrump maintains his lead over the other GOP candidates in seven states, though Ted Cruz did win in Kansas.\nHe says that Trump \u201cbilked\u201d students of more than $40,000, collectively, according to Rick Rojas of The New York Times.\nIt is promising that Trump has recently lost two states, and if Kasich wins Michigan and Ohio, he could be in trouble."}
