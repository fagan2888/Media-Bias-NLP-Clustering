Barnett on the grounds of the Army installation.\n\n\u201cThis life sentence is a just punishment for the brutal murder Smith committed at Fort Knox,\u201d U.S. Attorney John Kuhn said in a news release. \"And because Smith will not ever be paroled, we have ensured the public\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nSmith had previously admitted that four days before killing Barnett, he robbed, shot and killed James Dillingham in Toledo, Ohio. It is believed Barnett was present during the murder, and that shortly after the crime, they fled in Smith's van. He had previously lived and worked near Fort Knox.\n\nDuring the trip to Kentucky, Smith murdered Barnett because she witnessed the Dillingham murder and could tell the police about it, the news release said. When Smith\u2019s van broke down, the pair hitchhiked and were dropped off near Fort Knox.\n\nSmith and Barnett walked about a quarter of a mile down a service road off the main highway, into a wooded area, where Smith first attempted to break Barnett\u2019s neck and then beat her on the head with a tree branch until he knew she was dead, the release said.\n\nSmith left Barnett\u2019s body in the woods and eventually traveled to Tennessee where he was arrested in Nashville. In March 2006, Smith was convicted of Dillingham's murder and sentenced to 32 years in prison.\n\nIn late 2010, Smith spoke with his former parole officer, Dan Van Vorhis, who asked Smith what happened to Barnett. Over the course of several recorded conversations, Smith explained to Van Vorhis the details of her murder.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1p7FVJt", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A murderer convicted in Toledo, Ohio was sentenced to life without parole in federal court in Louisville for killing a woman at Fort Knox in 2005.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "A murderer convicted in Toledo, Ohio was sentenced to life without parole in federal court in Louisville for killing a woman at Fort Knox in 2005.", "title": "Life without parole for Ft.
