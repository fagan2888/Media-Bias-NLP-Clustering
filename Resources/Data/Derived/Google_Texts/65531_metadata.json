Jay Nixon\u2019s office for signage.\n\nAt the same time, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that demonstrators flooded the Missouri Capitol to protest the state\u2019s failure to expand its Medicaid program, which provides subsidized health coverage to low-income people under the Affordable Care Act (yes, the one for humans.)\n\nThe awkward timing was not lost on state lawmakers.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ryan Silvey of Kansas City questioned\n\nWhy lawmakers were so quick to approve \u201cObamacow\u201d while refusing to expand coverage to low-income people under Medicaid expansion. Silvey is a rare Republican who supports expanding Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program, according to the Associated Press.\n\nRelated: States of Health: Winners & Losers in Medicaid\n\n\u201cI kinda jokingly refer to it as \u2018Obamacows\u2019 because it was the Farm Bill of 2014 that created this insurance program. Yet, what we can\u2019t do is have or don\u2019t seem to have a larger policy debate on providing assistance to taxpayers and individual in the state that are not going to be part of this dairy assistance. I can\u2019t help myself but to point it out,\u201d Silvey said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use state tax dollars to pay for 70 percent of a federal insurance program created by the Obama administration, for cows.\u201d\n\nWhile it may seem like a reasonable parallel, it\u2019s important to note that the dairy assistance program is estimated to cost the state about $4.7 million next year\u2014in contrast, Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion would come with a $1 billion price tag for the state, PolticoMo noted.\n\nUnder Medicaid expansion, the federal government fully finances state programs until 2017\u2014after that states cover 10 percent of their tab. So far, 28 states have expanded their programs, while 22 have opted not to, citing cost as their primary reason.\n\nStill, many states that haven\u2019t expanded are discussing how to do so in a cost-effective way.\n\nThey\u2019ll likely be debating this until the cows come home.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Moooo-ve over Obamacare.", "title": "Missouri Approves Affordable Cow Act", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/21/Missouri-Approves-Affordable-Cow-Act", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03212015_Cow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/21/Missouri-Approves-Affordable-Cow-Act", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03212015_Cow.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Moooo-ve over Obamacare.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe35a6\"", "article_summary": "Related: Medicaid Expansion Cheaper Than Expected: CBOThe cleverly nicknamed \u201cAffordable Cow Act\u201d is intended to beef up Missouri\u2019s struggling dairy industry by expanding farmers\u2019 access to affordable dairy cow coverage.\nUnder Medicaid expansion, the federal government fully finances state programs until 2017\u2014after that states cover 10 percent of their tab.\nThe same group of state lawmakers that have staunchly opposed expanding insurance coverage to low-income people under Medicaid expansion just unanimously approved a measure that subsidizes dairy cow insurance for farmers.\nSilvey is a rare Republican who supports expanding Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program, according to the Associated Press.\nRepublican Sen.
