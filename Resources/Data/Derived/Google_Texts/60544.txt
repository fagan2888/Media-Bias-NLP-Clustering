Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund chairman Jenny Beth Martin says the country can’t wait eight years to balance its budget, as GOP 2016 candidate John Kasich’s plan offers.

“Yesterday, Ohio Governor John Kasich raised one of the most critical issues to the future of our nation: the need to balance our federal budget and erase the deficit,” Martin said in a statement Friday. “Unfortunately, Governor Kasich’s plan would wait a full eight years to finally bring our books into balance and that isn’t good enough for American families.”

Kasich said Thursday that his plan calls for cutting taxes for individuals and businesses and balancing the federal budget in eight years, as the Wall Street Journal reports.

“Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund supports the Penny Plan, which would balance the budget and end the deficit in five years,” Martin continued.
