Yes, it turns out non-millennials read and purchase books, too.\n\nHere are some year-end fiction recommendations from Denver Post staffers. We hope you enjoy them.\n\n\u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d by Kent Haruf (Knopf)\n\nHis gift for using simple but rich language and small-town settings to illuminate universal truths helped make Kent Haruf a literary treasure. The Colorado author\u2019s final novel tells the poignant story of a man and women who lost their spouses but find new bonds as they talk, holding hands, in bed at night. \u2014 Suzanne Brown\n\n\u201cCity On Fire\u201d by Garth Risk Hallberg (Knopf)\n\nFor a little more than 900 pages, Hallberg bends time and space to tell a story that crosses classes, cultures and generations. From chapter to chapter, the point of view shifts between a dozen central characters, and subsections can cover a day or a decade. But \u201cCity on Fire\u201d is rooted in late 1970s New York City, where the lives of those characters become tangled in messy, deadly and brutally human ways. \u2014 Ashley Dean\n\n\u201cPurity\u201d by Jonathan Franzen (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nWhether you love him or just love to complain about him, Franzen is back with a hefty (some would say bloated) tome that takes on love and lust, murder, identity and even cyber security. The whirlwind starts with a young woman\u2019s quest to find her father, who she hopes can pay off her student loan debt. \u2014 Jenn Fields\n\n\u201cBright Lines\u201d by Tanwi Nandini Islam (Penguin)\n\nThe house at 111 Cambridge Place in Brooklyn in Islam\u2019s debut novel feels like a cut-away set in an intimate theater, against which love stories, anti-love stories, weed stories and war stories play out. \u201cBright Lines\u201d captures the exhilaration of not knowing who you are in New York, and also of knowing who you\u2019re not. \u2014 Dave Burdick\n\n\u201cThe Japanese Lover\u201d by Isabel Allende (Atria Books)\n\nAllende masterfully writes of two San Francisco families \u2014 one Jewish, one Japanese \u2014 twined by love and World War II. This relatively short novel follows a 70-year arc of artist Alma Belasco\u2019s life as she navigates rapidly evolving racial, political and gender politics with good humor \u2014 and a generous dose of magical realism. \u2014 Dana Coffield\n\n\u201cDisgruntled\u201d by Asali Solomon (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nThe coming-of-age story of a Philadelphia girl beginning in the \u201980s, \u201cDisgruntled\u201d follows her life trying to navigate the diverging paths blazed by her parents, two radical black intellectuals. There are so many ways to not fit in. \u2014 DB\n\n\u201cSaint Cole\u201d by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics)\n\nFormer Denverite and current alt-comics hero Van Sciver delivers his most bracing and personal work yet in the story of a young man whose dumb decisions make his bad life far, far worse. Funny, sad and often revelatory in its ability to capture all-too-real situations and characters. \u2014 John Wenzel\n\n\u201cThe Cartel\u201d by Don Winslow (Knopf)\n\nJoaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, leader of the Sinaloa cartel, made his second escape from a Mexican jail just three weeks after \u201cThe Cartel\u201d was published, with one of its characters based on Guzman. This best-selling crime novel is a riveting tale that closely mirrors the reality of America\u2019s long war on drugs. Winslow spent 15 years researching and writing \u201cThe Cartel\u201d and its predecessor, \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d and together they give full immersion into a shadowy world often in the headlines. \u2014 Colleen O\u2019Connor\n\n\u201cMy Documents\u201d by Alejandro Zambrano (McSweeney\u2019s)\n\nThe characters in this short-story collection embody a pervasive loneliness. They often say and do the wrong thing. Some of the stories would be painful to read \u2014 for hitting so close to home \u2014 but Zambra\u2019s sharp wit cuts into the existential angst, reminding us that dark humor makes a dark night of the soul more bearable. \u2014 JF\n\n\u201cThe Turner House\u201d by Angela Flournoy (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)\n\nWith the matriarch of a family of 13 siblings in failing health, those who remain close enough to their empty childhood home \u2014 in a nearly abandoned East Side Detroit neighborhood \u2014 must hash out what to do with the house. Between nostalgia, fraud, secrets and an old ghost, there are as many competing, confounding, unappealing ways forward for the Turners as for their city. \u2014 DB\n\n\u201cThe Joy of Killing\u201d by Harry N. MacLean (Counterpoint)\n\nA dark, compelling literary work, this marks the fictional debut of Denver true-crime writer Mac Lean. He combines an eerie night in a deserted house with the recollection of a teenage sexual encounter on a train, in a story that explores the lure of violence. The mystery repels and haunts. \u2014 Sandra Dallas\n\n\u201cThe Sellout\u201d by Paul Beatty (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nNone are spared in this thoroughly irreverent satire about a man who was born to a mad social scientist who performed race-based experiments on him, grew up in the Los Angeles \u201cagrarian ghetto\u201d of Dickens attending meetings of the Dum Dum Donuts Intellectuals and lands in the Supreme Court after reinstituting segregation in the local high school. \u2014 JF\n\n\u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d by Paula Hawkins (Riverhead Books)\n\nShe\u2019s a pathetic, depressed drunk by night. Each morning, she stares out the window for glimpses of truth as her commuter train passes the home she once shared with a man who\u2019s now married to another woman. But is life really as idyllic as it seems on that neat block? Twists and turns keep the pages flying. \u2014 SB\n\n\u201cConfession of the Lionness\u201d by Mia Couto (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nIn rural Mozambique, a young girl has every reason to want to change her world, but little agency, in stark contrast to the lionness terrorizing her village. Mozambican magical realist Couto shifts between the perspectives of his sometimes-broad characters to provide a fuller picture of the myth woven here. \u2014 DB\n\n\u201cLoving Day\u201d by Mat Johnson (Spiegel & Grau)\n\nWarren returns home to Philadelphia, where he inherits his father\u2019s crumbling mansion amid urban blight and learns he has a teenage daughter. He\u2019s forced to deal with questions of identity when daughter Tal, against his wishes, insists on attending high school at the M\u00e9lange Center for Multiracial Life. \u2014 JF", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Best fiction books 2015: One of these 15 books has your name on it", "title": "Best fiction books 2015: One of these 15 books has your name on it", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/best-fiction-books-2015-one-of-these-15-books-has-your-name-on-it/", "image": {"width": 231, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__BN20151129_E2_BNBK29BESTBOOKSfiction10.jpg", "height": 346}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__BN20151129_E2_BNBK29BESTBOOKSfiction10.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T12:16:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:29:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a7a\"", "article_summary": "Here are some year-end fiction recommendations from Denver Post staffers.\n\u2014 DB\u201cThe Joy of Killing\u201d by Harry N.
