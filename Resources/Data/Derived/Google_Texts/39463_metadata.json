It's gone from about 20 percent in 2013 to 13 percent in the first quarter of this year (chart at top right). This matches the Gallup data that we get quarterly, which shows a drop from about 18 percent to 12 percent (chart at bottom right). Note that the Gallup numbers are about 2 points lower across the board because Gallup surveys everyone over 18, including seniors on Medicare, who are 100 percent covered. The CDC counts only adults aged 18-64.\n\nEither way, this comes to about 16 million adults who now have health insurance who were previously uncovered. And the number would be even higher if so many red states weren't refusing to expand Medicaid.\n\nAnd the cost of all this? About $70 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That's roughly $4,000 per person.
