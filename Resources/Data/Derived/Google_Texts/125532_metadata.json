Govindaraju, who is in charge of the Weather Monitoring Cell at the Organic Farm Research Centre of University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) at Nagenahalli, attributed the rains to the arrival of the north-east monsoon. \u201cWet weather with drizzle and moderate rain will continue at least till Tuesday,\u201d he told The Hindu.\n\nMeanwhile, the Meteorological Centre in Bangalore said that the south-west monsoon had withdrawn from the remaining parts of Karnataka on October 18. \u201cSimultaneously, the north-east monsoon has commenced over Tamil Nadu, Kerala and adjoining areas of south Andhra Pradesh and south-interior Karnataka,\u201d the Meteorological Centre said.\n\nThe Met Centre has also predicted heavy rain over Chamarajanagar, Mysore, Mandya and Kodagu districts of south-interior Karnataka, besides Dakshina Kannada in coastal Karnataka. The Met Centre has predicted 17 mm of rainfall in Mysore on Monday and 15 mm of rainfall on Tuesday.\n\nThe rain is expected to help revive standing crops on more than 30,000 hectares of land in the rain-fed areas of six out of the seven taluks in the district, which had been damaged by the dry spell during June and July this year. According to the Agriculture Department, crops had been damaged in most taluks in the district, except T. Narsipur, which is a largely irrigated belt.\n\nThe prediction of rain, however, is likely to delay the road repair work that the Mysore City Corporation (MCC) had planned to take up in the city. Many arterial roads in different parts of the city are in a deplorable condition and civic authorities are waiting for the rainy season to pass to begin work, said an official of the MCC.\n\nKeywords: rain", "article_metadata": {"description": "C.
