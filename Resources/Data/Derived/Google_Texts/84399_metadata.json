All those years of \u201cbuilding partner capacity,\u201d to train, equip, fund, strengthen and professionalize the militaries of Middle East dictators and kingdoms, are about to pay off.\n\nThe unthinkable immolation of Jordanian pilot First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh has ignited Arab outrage against a terrorist group that arguably has never been seen. Almost immediately after ISIS released their gruesome video of his death, Jordan\u2019s Army spokesman promised a \u201cearth-shaking and decisive\u201d retaliatory response. And the world overnight focused on this: it took less than 12 hours for Jordan to exact revenge executions of two terrorists, Sajida al-Rishawi, whose suicide-bomb vest failed to explode in a 2005 attack on an Amman hotel, and Ziad al-Karbouli, of al-Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Muted Response to the ISIS and Ukraine Crises\n\nBut the real revenge is what\u2019s yet to come. Jordan\u2019s military, with a $1.5 billion budget, has over 1,300 tanks and nearly 250 aircraft, according to one recent accounting, ready to fight the next great land war that has never come. Jordanian officials announced Wednesday increased air strikes against ISIS are on the way. More notable, perhaps, are Jordan\u2019s special operations capabilities, designed specifically for this kind of fight. Jordan boasts some of the most elite special operation forces in the world, who for years have fought alongside American operators, having been trained, equipped and paid for in part by the U.S. Indeed, Jordan is home to one of the world\u2019s premier counterterrorism proving grounds, the King Abdullah Special Operations Training Center. Opened in 2009, a wave of top U.S. brass toured the impressive center, which was built exactly for this purpose. It has mock buildings, airliners, and streets where elite teams from around the globe come to practice counterterrorism missions, from hijackings to hostage rescue.\n\nObama\u2019s fiscal 2016 budget request released on Monday includes $350 million in foreign military financing for Jordan. That\u2019s $300 million in the base budget and $50 million in the Overseas Contingency Operations war account, in addition to $3.8 million for military training. The funds, in part, pay for Jordan to handle \u201ccounterterrorism and asymmetric threats,\u201d border security and to better establish \u201cinteroperability with the United States to participate in coalition operations including operations to counter ISIL.\u201d\n\nThe legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan is that the Pentagon wants to build up foreign militaries to fight their own fights. In Jordan,U.S. military and intelligence officials long ago found key brothers in arms.\n\nSome of the questions gripping Middle East watchers back in Washington now are: How will King Abdullah II unleash his military forces against ISIS? What revenge is coming? Will it be it covert, overt, unilateral, coalition, with or without the blessings of the Pentagon, CIA, Mossad or other Western agencies that have been battling terrorism in the Middle East mostly in the shadows, until now?\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nAl-Kasasbeh\u2019s death comes exactly as Washington\u2019s impatience with President Barack Obama is boiling over. Despite Obama\u2019s pained pleas for patience to not rush American troops in to a messy conflict, his critics have had enough of the administration\u2019s slow-churning and twisting strategy to destroy the Islamic State, or ISIS, but not defeat Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad, by using a too-careful mix of overt air strikes and covert operations neither the American public nor U.S. enemies can appreciate.\n\n\u201cLet there be no doubt: We still do not have a viable strategy to counter ISIL, and if you are not winning in war, you are losing,\u201d said Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., at the top of Ash Carter\u2019s confirmation hearing on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., three days earlier, said 10,000U.S. ground troops were needed to do the job. But voices on all sides continue to hope for other countries to shoulder the burden. FOX News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren this weekend called on Obama to convene a \u201cwar summit\u201d of states, to demand greater military participation from others.\n\nPerhaps the answer Washington was hoping for will come from Amman.\n\nRelated: The Three Hidden Messages Behind ISIS\u2019s Bloody Rampages\n\n\u201cThe blood of martyr [Moaz al-Kasasbeh] will not be in vain and the response of Jordan and its army after what happened to our dear son will be severe,\u201d Abdullah said, in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground,\u201d Jordanian state media reported Abdullah saying in an earlier meeting, as well.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a collaborative effort between coalition members to intensify efforts to stop extremism and terrorism to undermine, degrade and eventually finish Daesh,\u201d said spokesman Mohammad al-Momani, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe bloodthirsty statements from Jordanian leaders came with remarkably strong backing by Muslim religious authorities across the region. Why? Clerics took particular issue with ISISburning someone to death with fire. What they ask, in return, may not be much easier to stomach. Egypt\u2019s grand sheikh of Al-Azhar, Ahmed al-Tayeb, called for al-Kasasbeh killers to be \u201ckilled, or crucified, or [have] their hands and legs cut off.\u201d Similar outcries came from top clerics in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, but the underlying criticism of ISIS\u2019s latest barbaric act was the same. \u201cThis method has turned society against them,\u201dsaid Abu Sayaf, who is Jordanian.\n\nRelated: ISIS May Be Executing Its Own Fighters\n\nMcCain gave full-throated support of the U.S. Senate to Abdullah on Wednesday, promising to ask Obama for the same. \u201cAmerica has no greater ally in the fight against terrorism than Jordan. And, as we made clear to King Abdullah in our meeting yesterday, this committee\u2019s immediate concern is to ensure Jordan has all of the equipment and resources necessary to continue taking the fight directly to ISIL.\u201d\n\nCarter told the Senate that the president\u2019s plan is to defeat ISIS on both sides of the border with Iraq and Syria. How? By building up Iraqi troops on one side of the border, and with Syrian rebel and regional forces on the other.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good. But look out. Here comes Abdullah. Here comes Jordan.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Defense One.\n\nRead more at Defense One:\n\nHere's What You'll Find on the Fighter Jet of 2030\n\nIgnore the Pundits: US-Israeli Security Relations Are Stronger Than Ever\n\nThe Pentagon's Weapon Wish Lists Could Disappear", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This is the moment the Pentagon has\u00a0been waiting for.", "title": "Jordan\u2019s Revenge and the Arab World\u2019s ISIS Awakening", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/06/Jordan-s-Revenge-and-Arab-World-s-ISIS-Awakening", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Jordan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/06/Jordan-s-Revenge-and-Arab-World-s-ISIS-Awakening", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Jordan.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This is the moment the Pentagon has\u00a0been waiting for.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8836\"", "article_summary": "Related: Obama\u2019s Muted Response to the ISIS and Ukraine CrisesBut the real revenge is what\u2019s yet to come.\nIndeed, Jordan is home to one of the world\u2019s premier counterterrorism proving grounds, the King Abdullah Special Operations Training Center.\nAlmost immediately after ISIS released their gruesome video of his death, Jordan\u2019s Army spokesman promised a \u201cearth-shaking and decisive\u201d retaliatory response.\nThat\u2019s $300 million in the base budget and $50 million in the Overseas Contingency Operations war account, in addition to $3.8 million for military training.\nMore notable, perhaps, are Jordan\u2019s special operations capabilities, designed specifically for this kind of fight."}
