Bernie Sanders\u2019 home turf of Burlington Thursday evening to rally conservative supporters and make a wisecrack about Sanders\u2019 long-shot campaign for the Democratic nomination.\n\nTrump at one point gleefully recalled that Sanders allowed two Black Lives Matter activists to interrupt him during a public appearance and take control of the microphone. \u201cOh, would I love to run against Bernie,\u201d Trump said, while a crowd of well over 1,400 cheered. \u201cIt would be a dream come true.\u201d\n\nRelated: Clinton Facing a Long Fight as Sanders\u2019 Fundraising Soars\n\nBut before the night was out, the high flying Trump got another taste of \u201cThe Bern.\u201d Sanders, the former Burlington mayor, once again lashed out at Trump as a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and a political handmaiden to millionaires and billionaires like himself.\u201d\n\nNoting that he does better in hypothetical general election matchups with Trump than Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, Sanders responded to Trump in a conference call with members of the progressive Democracy for America that it \u201cwould be a dream come true for me as well\u201d and that \u201cI would love, love, love to run against Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's not just this man's arrogance,\u201d Sanders said in describing Trump\u2019s vulnerability in a general election campaign. \u201cIt's not just his bigotry. It's not just the demagoguery that he expresses in trying to divide us up -- telling us that Latinos that are coming into this country from Mexico are rapists, criminals, and drug dealers. Or his anti-Muslim tirades. It\u2019s that this is a guy\u2026who thinks that a $7.25 minimum wage is just fine, we don't have to raise the minimum wage. In a Republican debate, he said that, 'Well, wages in America are just too high.' Well, that's a great shock to millions of people trying to get by on $10 an hour.\u201d\n\nSanders unloaded on Trump last night in a way that Hillary Clinton may not be able to do for a while because of Trump\u2019s effective exploitation of former President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings and past sex scandals.\n\nHillary Clinton leads Sanders roughly 2 to 1 in recent national polls, although her lead is much smaller in Iowa and New Hampshire. Nonetheless, Sanders raised considerable campaign contributions last year ($73 million to Clinton\u2019s $112 million) and he continues to draw large crowds of enthusiastic supporters.\n\nRelated: Al Qaeda Is Using Donald Trump\u2019s Comments to Recruit Terrorists ... and He\u2019s Ok with That\n\nAccording to a Dec. 22 Quinnipiac University poll, if the general election were held today, Sanders would beat Trump by 13 points, 51 percent to 38 percent, while Clinton would top Trump by just seven points, 47 percent to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cI think we would stand a chance of beating him by more,\u201d Sanders told his supporters last night.\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who thinks that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese in order to impact American manufacturing,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhere he comes up with these ideas, I have no idea, but every other day there is one or another absurd idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I have to also say \u2013 and I don\u2019t like saying this about people, you know there are people who disagree with me that I respect, there are conservatives that I regard as friends,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this guy, I have to say, really is a pathological liar. He just says things that are outrageous \u2013 that have no basis in fact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump invaded Vermont Sen.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Tells Vermont Voters: Trump Is a Pathological Liar", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Bernie-Sanders-Tells-Vermont-Voters-Trump-Pathological-Liar", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/bernie_sanders_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Bernie-Sanders-Tells-Vermont-Voters-Trump-Pathological-Liar", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/bernie_sanders_0.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump invaded Vermont Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump invaded Vermont Sen.
