Game Rewind\u2019s Season Plus costs $24.99.\n\nThe new service targets fans looking to watch replays or games outside of their home markets. Games played on Sunday mornings and afternoons will be available on-demand after all the 4 p.m. ET Sunday telecasts have concluded.\n\nSunday night, Monday night, Thursday and Saturday games will be viewable after each one ends on broadcast television. Game Pass will not air the playoffs or Super Bowl live.\n\nGame Pass will have tools such as a \u201cScores On/Off\u2019\u2019 option for viewers who won\u2019t know the outcome of a game, 30-minute condensed versions of entire games and full replays of every game since 2009 in HD.\n\nFans will be able to analyze games like a pro using exclusive end zone and All-22 angles and fast forward and rewind games with a DVR control.\n\nGame Pass will have no effect on the NFL\u2019s deal with Direct TV for live game streaming, which also will be available on more devices for the upcoming game season.\n\nThe new Game Pass service will mark the first time the NFL has provided access to entire games on Apple TV. Currently, its NFL Now channel on Apple TV has football news, historic videos and game highlights but not entire matchups.\n\nGame Pass will be available to customers in the United States, Mexico, Bermuda, Antigua, the Bahamas and U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Guam.\n\nGet Free Updates!
