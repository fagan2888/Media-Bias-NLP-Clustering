Demand was in excess of $5 billion, with more than 200 institutional investors and private banks in the U.S., Asia, Europe and South America participating.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to be notified when we launch the new WSJ Frontiers weekly email newsletter\n\n\u201cThe process was carried out successfully and favorable to Ecuador,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nThe sale marks a milestone for the Correa government, which had come to rely heavily on financing from China since it defaulted on $3.2 billion in global bonds in 2008, with Mr. Correa at the time calling the debt burden illegal and illegitimate. A year later, Ecuador bought back 93% of the defaulted debt at 35 cents on the dollar.\n\nIn April, Mr. Correa had anticipated that Ecuador would issue $700 million in bonds in its return to capital markets.\n\nIn preparing the way for the return, Mr. Correa recently gave the green light to the International Monetary Fund to resume annual reviews of the economy.\n\nThe 2008 default virtually shut the Andean country off from capital markets, but opened the door for China, which has become its biggest lender.\n\nAccording to unofficial data, since 2009 China has committed at least $12 billion in funding for Ecuador, which many economists consider too much for an economy of Ecuador\u2019s size. Part of the financing has been backed with presales of crude oil.\n\n\u201cOne of the bottlenecks for all nations is funding,\u201d President Correa said in a recent meeting with foreign reporters. \u201cIf we can go to cheaper financing, and diversify funding sources, it would be foolish not to do so.\u201d\n\nEcuador is negotiating with China loans worth about $9 billion for the Refineria del Pacifico oil refinery, one of the government\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure projects. As part of the deal, which is expected to be signed by September, China National Petroleum Corp. will take a 30% stake in the project.\n\nOfficial data show that between 2007, when President Correa took office, and 2013, public investment has amounted to about $34 billion, well more than the $6 billion invested between 1998 and 2006.\n\nFor 2014, the government is planning $7.26 billion in public investments. The total investment goal through 2017 is $47.6 billion. This year\u2019s budget calls for spending of $34.3 billion, including a deficit of $4.94 billion.\n\nMr. Correa, who is in his third term and could seek a fourth in 2017 if lawmakers change the constitution, is betting on public investment to maintain economic growth. The World Bank predicts Ecuador\u2019s economy will expand 4.3% this year, among the best growth rates in Latin America\u2014but lower than growth of 4.5% in 2013 and 5.1% in 2012.\n\nThe Guayaquil-based economic newsletter Weekly Analysis said the growth strategy has been accompanied by a spectacular 88% rise in the price of oil, which went from $50.75 per barrel in 2006 to $95.36 in 2013, and contributed to a significant rise in government revenue.\n\nRead the full story at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Six years after default, Ecuador made a successful return to international capital markets Tuesday as the government of President Rafael Correa seeks to broaden its sources of funding for the ambitious public investment programs it hopes will develop domestic industries.", "title": "Investors Cheer Ecuador\u2019s Return to International Markets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/18/investors-cheer-ecuadors-return-to-international-markets/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH664_fronti_P_20140618095301.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Investors Cheer Ecuador\u2019s Return to International Markets", "description": "Six years after default, Ecuador made a successful return to international capital markets Tuesday as the government of President Rafael Correa seeks to broaden its sources of funding for the ambitious public investment programs it hopes will develop domestic industries.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Mercedes Alvaro", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Six years after default, Ecuador made a successful return to international capital markets Tuesday as the government of President Rafael Correa seeks to broaden its sources of funding for the ambitious public investment programs it hopes will develop domestic industries.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-18T13:49:27-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/18/investors-cheer-ecuadors-return-to-international-markets/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-819", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Six years after default, Ecuador made a successful return to international capital markets Tuesday as the government of President Rafael Correa seeks to broaden its sources of funding for the ambitious public investment programs it hopes will develop domestic industries.", "title": "Investors Cheer Ecuador\u2019s Return to International Markets", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/18/investors-cheer-ecuadors-return-to-international-markets/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH664_fronti_P_20140618095301.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-819", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-18T13:57:16-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6c9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the bottlenecks for all nations is funding,\u201d President Correa said in a recent meeting with foreign reporters.\nIn April, Mr. Correa had anticipated that Ecuador would issue $700 million in bonds in its return to capital markets.\nIn preparing the way for the return, Mr. Correa recently gave the green light to the International Monetary Fund to resume annual reviews of the economy.\nDemand was in excess of $5 billion, with more than 200 institutional investors and private banks in the U.S., Asia, Europe and South America participating.\nEcuador sold $2 billion in 10-year bonds at a yield of 7.95%, the Finance Ministry said."}
