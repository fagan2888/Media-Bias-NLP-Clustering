The autonomous vehicles are able to protect high-value units.\n\nThe ship protection technology originated in NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER).\n\nA recent exercise on the James River near Fort Eustis, Virginia, demonstrated the game-changing technology, the defense website Military.com reported Tuesday.\n\nSEE ALSO: Drones from the deep: Pentagon develops ocean-floor attack robots\n\n\u201cWhen we look at autonomous swarm, we\u2019re not talking about a single vessel. We\u2019re talking about multiple-multiple vessels that can be in a defensive posture and then when called upon can then become offensive, surround an adversary and let them know that you are coming no closer to our ship,\u201d Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder, chief of Naval research, told the Office of Naval Research on Oct. 4.\n\n\u201cBut of course, if an adversarial threat decides to come closer we can give them another warning or potentially we can say, \u2018You\u2019ve come too close. We are now going to destroy your vessel,\u2019 \u201d he added.\n\nThe Navy is excited about the new technology because it can be installed upon existing vessels.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go out and purchase a new vessel. You take any of these vessels out here that the Navy already has, we unman them, we put the system on it \u2014 you put the eyes and ears depending on what kind of mission you want to do, on the vessel \u2014 and then let it go do its mission, said Rick Simon, director of Robotics, Spatial Integrated Systems, said in an interview with the Office of Naval research.\n\nThe U.S. Navy believes if drone swarming technology existed in Oct. 2000, then the USS Cole bombing that killed 17 sailors and injured 39 others would not have happened.\n\n\u201cIf we had this capability there on that day, I\u2019m sure it would have saved that ship,\u201d Adm. Klunder, chief of naval research, said in a recent teleconference with reporters, Military.com reported. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever want to see that happen again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Navy has announced a breakthrough in drone \"swarming\" technology that will allow unmanned ships to sense the environment and react to threats.
