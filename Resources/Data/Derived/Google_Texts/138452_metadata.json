(The print version follows on Christmas Eve.)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t include meals I had while traveling, or at home, or even ones I enjoyed at Front Range restaurants I\u2019ve reviewed in previous years. This is purely about the top dishes I had at restaurants I reviewed in the past 12 months.\n\nIt was a tough list to whittle down, and there were a couple of finalists that were bested, narrowly, by competing plates on the same menu. Two cases in point:\n\n\n\nOne of the dishes I named in this year\u2019s best-of list was the squash salad at Argyll Whisky Beer in Denver\u2019s Uptown neighborhood. But it narrowly beat out that restaurant\u2019s own lamb burger, which is hands down one of the best burgers I\u2019ve had in ages. It came on a toasted brioche roll with crispy lettuce, tzatziki sauce and a sweet-tart tomato jam. Yowzer.\n\nAnother close race: The spring pea brodo with hen egg at Bistro Barb\u00e8s in Park Hill that edged the main course that followed it, a moist crispy-skinned seabass over ratatouille and a salad of Israeli cous-cous and Beluga lentils.\n\nCheck out this photo. When a dish this lovely is a runner-up in its own restaurant, you\u2019ll see why 2014 was a great year in dining in the Denver area:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Argyll,Bistro Barbes,Denver Post best dishes 2014", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/12/22/thoughts-12-best-dishes-ate-2014-runners-division/", "site_name": "The Den", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/12/lambburger-495x371.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "A few thoughts on the 12 best dishes I ate in 2014, runners-up division"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "A few thoughts on the 12 best dishes I ate in 2014, runners-up division", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2014/12/22/thoughts-12-best-dishes-ate-2014-runners-division/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2014/12/lambburger-495x371.jpg", "creator": "@williamporterdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "As The Denver Post's restaurant critic, I had a tough time narrowing the list of the 12 best dishes I had in 2014.
