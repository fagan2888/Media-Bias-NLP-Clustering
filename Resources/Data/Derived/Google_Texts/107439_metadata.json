David Vitter said Wednesday he will not lift his hold on President Obama\u2019s pick to lead the federal personnel office because the agency continues to let members of Congress use an Obamacare exchange while receiving a generous employer subsidy, an option that regular Americans don\u2019t have.\n\nAnd he believes that Congress, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, has been \u201cfully complicit in this fraud.\u201d\n\nMr. Vitter, Louisiana Republican, has been on a one-man crusade since late 2013 to shed light on how Congress dealt with an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that required members of Congress and their official staffers to buy insurance on the law\u2019s health exchanges.\n\nThe administration \u2014through the Office of Personnel Management \u2014decided in 2013 that if they used the D.C. small-business exchange, they could still get their employer subsidies to cover premiums. Regular Americans who buy plans through the exchange are restricted from having employers contribute to their premiums.\n\nOutraged by the carve-out, Mr. Vitter used his senatorial privileges to place a hold on acting OPM Director Beth F. Cobert\u2019s nomination because he still doesn\u2019t understand why Congress was granted small-business status to use the D.C. exchange for employers of 50 or fewer workers, even though it employs thousands.\n\nMr. Vitter\u2019s office released applications from House and Senate personnel offices that attest they \u201cemploy 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees,\u201d though the names of employees who signed the forms are redacted.\n\n\u201cThis is an outrageous act of fraud,\u201d Mr. Vitter said in a letter to fellow senators. \u201cAnd the OPM rule is patently illegal. It\u2019s all exactly the sort of Washington insider self-dealing that Americans are so sick and tired of.\u201d\n\nHe said he cannot lift his hold on Ms. Cobert because she has supported the OPM rule and \u201chas indicated that she would continue to do so if confirmed.\u201d\n\nOPM has defended the rule, saying it made sense to use a SHOP to administer what amounted to an employer-based contribution to members\u2019 health care, while shepherding members into an exchange as required by Obamacare.\n\nThe agency said it picked D.C.\u2019s portal simply because Congress is located in the District.\n\nBut Mr. Vitter said the language and intent of the Obamacare amendment \u201cwere crystal-clear: Congress should live under the same laws it passes on everyone else, in this case those Americans on the Obamacare exchange.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
