Perhaps camps could even be provided for the purpose. And what you need to do to help people realize their dream is to free them from the government\u2019s neo-Marxist welfare teat. And what greater waste of human potential is there than the enslavement of getting help with food and healthcare? Luckily Dr. Carson can explain for us why welfare and food stamps that helped him as a child were the good kind of welfare and food stamps, as opposed to the moocher 47 percent freeloader kind you get today.\n\nWhen you rob someone of their incentive to go out there and improve themselves, you are not doing them any favors. When you take somebody and pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, you poor little thing. \u2026 Let me give you housing subsidies, let me give you free health care because you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 What would be much more empowering is to use our intellect and our resources to give those people a way up and out.\n\nIt\u2019s so true \u2014 once you get on government assistance, your will to earn your own keep is sapped forever. Yr. Doktor Zoom was on unemployment once, and look at him now \u2014 writing dick jokes for money. Or look at Dr. Ben Carson, who despite being born into poverty, was miraculously untainted by the government assistance that his mother received, as Reading is For Snobs points out: \u201cfor some strange reason, the evil welfare system didn\u2019t seem to destroy the incentive for his own mother to go out and make things better for her and her family\u201d:\n\nNo doubt, Mother Carson deserves tremendous credit, but \u2014 in the words of a political sound bite from the last presidential election \u2014 she didn\u2019t do it alone. Carson, in his book, tells how his grades improved tremendously when a government program provided him with free eyeglasses because he could barely see. Not only that, in \u201cGifted Hands\u201d we read this nugget: \u201cBy the time I reached ninth grade, mother had made such strides that she received nothing but food stamps. She couldn\u2019t have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\u201d\n\nNow hold on just a darn second here. Carson got free Government Glasses, and his mom received government largesse well beyond food stamps, which were the last step that helped her become independent? Why, that sounds disturbingly neo-Marxist! Happily, a Politico profile explains the difference between Good Poors like Ben Carson\u2019s mother, and Lazy Takers like everyone who is enslaved by today\u2019s big government programs that keep getting cut back year after year:\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see Carson\u2019s own upbringing coming into view here. He grew up in meager surroundings in Detroit and Boston, in a family that made use of public assistance programs like food stamps. The culture was different then, Carson insists. \u201cI think there was a time when people were not proud of taking handouts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were more people who did have that drive and determination. You do what you have to do.\u201d\n\nYou see, the chief difference is that Carson\u2019s mom felt appropriately ashamed of being poor, whereas no one today is publicly shamed enough. This is why it\u2019s so very important to drug test welfare recipients and inspect their shopping carts for illicit crab legs. Back then, poor people (especially Ben Carson\u2019s mother) were better than they are now, because handwaving magic Great Society Obamacare free market good old days, just like it\u2019s cool that Paul Ryan is a self-made man who supported himself with his father\u2019s Social Security benefits that he earned on his own, and Craig T Nelson never got a handout from anyone when he was on welfare and food stamps:\n\nIt seems they just don\u2019t make poor people like they used to, that\u2019s the problem.\n\n[Reading is for Snobs]\n\nFollow Doktor Zoom on Twitter.
