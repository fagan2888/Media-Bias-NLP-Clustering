Stephen Colbert took a nice little nap during his Comedy Central show, “The Colbert Report,” on Wednesday night, lulled to sleep by the official who was supposed to serve as the Obama administration’s point man against attacks regarding Obamacare’s impact on the economy.

Colbert remarked on the findings of the Congressional Budget Office’s recent report on the impact of the Affordable Care Act, which found that the new law would lower full-time employment by 2.3 million workers. While some Democrats hailed the findings as encouraging for reducing “job lock,” the Comedy Central host criticized the Obama administration for its dull response to Republican attacks.

“Nobody believed me when I said Obamacare was a job killer, and now it is,” Colbert said Wednesday night. “It’s only a matter of time before they roll out the death panels and the elder catapults.”

But have no fear, Obama supporters, Colbert told his audience. The president was prepared to unleash his “economic nerd patrol” to dispel all fears, namely Jason Furman, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who gave a dull and boring explanation of the CBO’s findings — that lulled Colbert to sleep.

“Sure, what Professor Lunesta said is technically true. Obamacare gives people healthcare options allowing them to work less if they choose. But what looks better on a bumber sticker?” the Comedy Central host asked.

He then flashed to two options: One from the GOP slamming Obamacare for shrinking the work force, and another from Democrats giving a long-winded explanation as to why 2.3 million Americans no longer need to work.

While some Republicans argued the CBO’s findings showed a loss of 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) clarified that instead, 2.3 million Americans would choose not to work, as they have guaranteed healthcare.
