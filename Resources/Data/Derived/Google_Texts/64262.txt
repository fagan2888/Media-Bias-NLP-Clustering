TOKYO (AP) — An investigation published by an international coalition of more than 100 media outlets, based on 11.5 million records of offshore holdings, details how politicians, celebrities and other famous people use banks, law firms and offshore shell companies to hide their assets.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, said an anonymous source provided internal documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca, one of the world’s biggest creators of shell companies. Ramon Fonseca, a co-founder of Mossack Fonseca, said the documents were obtained illegally by hacking but confirmed that many of them were real. He denied his firm has engaged in any wrongdoing.

This is a look at offshore accounts and how they are used:

WHAT ARE OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS?

Offshore bank accounts and other financial dealings in another country can be used to evade regulatory oversight or tax obligations. Often, companies or individuals use shell companies, initially incorporated without significant assets or operations, to disguise ownership or other information about the funds involved.

WHERE ARE MOST OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS?

Panama, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda are among more than a dozen small, low-tax locations that specialize in handling business services and investments of non-resident companies.

LEGITIMATE USES FOR OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS:

Companies or trusts can be set up in offshore locations for legitimate uses such as business finance, mergers and acquisitions and estate or tax planning, according to the global money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force.
