Healthcare Interactive Inc., a Glenwood-based health technology company, has received $3.4 million in venture capital funding, bringing total funding from investors to $11.8 million.

The add-on funding was led by the Maryland Venture Fund, with additional participation from existing investors Grotech Ventures and Harbert Management Corp., the company said Thursday.

The company's cloud-based Healthspace platform is used by employers and health systems for online enrollment, incentive management and wellness activities, all designed to help attract and retain employees. The platform also links to fitness and medical devices as well as laboratory, EMR, medical and pharmacy data.

The latest investment will help the company expand into new markets with population health management programs designed to lower risk, control health care costs and support compliance with the Affordable Care Act.

"We... believe that our financial partners' commitment further validates the significant growth opportunities ahead for HCIactive," said CEO Henry Cha.
