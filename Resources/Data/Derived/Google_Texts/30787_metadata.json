John Kasich appeared pleased as he spoke to the media after the first Republican presidential debate in Cleveland.\n\nAs he heads back next week to campaign in New Hampshire, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has a tailwind from his performance in the national Republican candidate debate Thursday night in Cleveland that was viewed by some 23 million people.\n\nWhile none of the 10 candidates is thought to have committed a fatal faux pas during the two-hour political panel broadcast on Fox News, nor have national political commentators crowned a victor.\n\nMr. Kasich, who went into the debate with the lowest poll numbers and the least name recognition, won positive reviews in what amounted to a national debut.\n\nEd Lee, writer of the \u201cDebate Coach\u201d column for CNN, wrote, \u201cKasich was fantastic. He was confident throughout the debate. While it felt like the other candidates were in a race to one-up each other, Kasich came across as refreshingly real and authentic.\u201d\n\nMr. Lee said Mr. Kasich\u2019s position of simultaneously opposing gay marriage and respecting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would be \u201cwell received across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect Kasich\u2019s poll numbers to skyrocket after this performance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe debate lineup, selected based on poll numbers, was real estate developer Donald Trump, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, physician Ben Carson, Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, along with Mr. Kasich.\n\nMr. Kasich, 63, scored the third-most minutes on camera in the debate, behind real estate magnate Donald Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nIn his five answers to questions and his closing statement, Mr. Kasich touted his claimed successes as governor of Ohio, justified his support of expanding Medicaid to cover more low-income people, accepted same-sex marriage, and told viewers twice that his father was a mailman.\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of the weekly political newspaper Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said, \u201cas a candidate who has a little bit of a less conservative profile he\u2019s pretty well positioned to become a media favorite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor sometimes comes off as brash and cocky. He\u2019s a guy who sometimes will commit unforced errors and he did not commit any unforced errors last night. It\u2019s a tribute to him and to whoever prepared him for the campaign,\u201d Mr. Kondik said.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll on July 30 found that 70 percent of voters didn\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion.\n\nNext was physician Ben Carson, who was not known by 57 percent of voters.\n\nBy comparison, only 15 percent did not know Governor Bush well enough to have an opinion.\n\nThe next round of opinion polls will show whether Mr. Kasich\u2019s performance clicked with Republican debate-viewers. Mr. Kasich, who has made about half a dozen trips to the early-primary state of New Hampshire, heads back there Tuesday.\n\nJon Stainbrook, the Lucas County Republican chairman, attended the debate and also the Kasich debate party at the Harry Buffalo, a bar-restaurant, next to the Quicken Loans Arena. Mr. Stainbrook said the governor visited the party briefly after the debate but before some scheduled media appearances and was beaming.\n\n\u201cHe spoke for like two minutes. I\u2019ve never seen the governor happier. He was grinning ear to ear. He was so happy with his performance,\u201d Mr. Stainbrook said.\n\nHe enthused that Mr. Kasich got huge applause from the largely Ohio crowd, which may have impressed TV viewers.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza noted the home team effect:\n\n\u201cThe Ohio governor came across as reasonable, conservative, and just different enough in the first 60 (or so) minutes of the debate. It helped him that the crowd in Cleveland was ready to jump out of their chairs at his every utterance,\u201d Mr. Cillizza wrote.\n\nHe thought Mr. Kasich faded in the second half.\n\nJeff Broxmeyer, a political science professor at the University of Toledo, said he didn\u2019t think any candidate outright won the debate, but that each were achieving goals particular to them.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kasich, it was a question of whether he would even make it into the debate, how he would engage other candidates, such as Donald Trump. That was a success for him,\u201d Mr. Broxmeyer said. \u201cI think he was successful in putting himself up as an alternative, sort of mainstream establishment candidate if Jeb Bush falters.\u201d\n\nMr. Kasich fielded five questions and gave a closing statement during the two-hour debate.\n\nThe first question was about his decision to expand Medicaid coverage to include more low-income people in Ohio, which some Republicans believe amounts to an expansion of government and an embrace of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Kasich\u2019s answer included a reference to helping drug-addicted people get out of prison and restart a productive life.\n\nThe second question was about Mr. Trump. Mr. Kasich started out by suggesting the other candidates could learn from his outspokenness because it touches a public nerve. He quickly converted the question into an opportunity to talk about balancing the federal budget, reforming the military, and balancing Ohio\u2019s budget with a $2 billion surplus.\n\nThe third question was how he would counter the rhetoric of Democrat Hillary Clinton who would categorize Republicans as supporting the wealthy while she supports the middle class, women, and minorities.\n\nMr. Kasich\u2019s answer was to achieve economic growth and then reach out to \u201cthose in the shadows \u2014 the people who don\u2019t seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don\u2019t have a chance to move up.\u201d\n\nHis fourth question was to explain his opposition to same-sex marriage. Mr. Kasich said he has a \u201ctraditional\u201d view of marriage, but, \u201cif one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them.\u201d\n\nThe fifth question was about God, to which Mr. Kasich said that God wants America to be strong.\n\nIn his closing statement, Mr. Kasich rehashed his biography in the public and private sectors, including asserting that, \u201cI inherited a state that was on the brink of dying ... and people have hope again in Ohio.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find an obvious winner or loser,\u201d said Mr. Kondik, a former Ohio news reporter who is researching a book on presidential politics in Ohio. \u201cIt was an entertaining debate. [Millions of] people watched, which would be the biggest primary debate viewership for either party ever. I thought Fox and the Ohio Republican Party put on a very good show and the moderators were pretty good.\u201d\n\nContact Tom Troy: tomtroy@theblade.com or 419-724-6058 or on Twitter @TomFTroy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2015/08/07/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z_cT/n7john-Kasich.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By TOM TROY <br>BLADE POLITICS WRITER", "description": "As he heads back next week to campaign in New Hampshire, Ohio Gov.
