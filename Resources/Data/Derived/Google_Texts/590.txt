Rewind 70 years ago. It is May 8, 1945, and Germany has just surrendered. World War II is over in Europe.

The day, formally now referred to as “Victory in Europe Day” or “V-E Day,” marks the acceptance of Nazi Germany’s surrender to the Allies of World War II. Today, we join with countries across the world in celebration of victory. We honor the men and women who served and the innocent people who lost their lives to Adolf Hitler’s regime.

These pictures take a look back at the special moments of relief, pride and joy around the world, 70 years ago.
