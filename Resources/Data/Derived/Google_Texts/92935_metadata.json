Filipinos and part-Filipinos represent the state\u2019s second-largest ethnic group and a growing part of the voting population. They will play a key role when the legislature convenes in a special session on Oct. 28 to discuss a measure that, if approved, would allow gay couples to get wedding licenses starting Nov. 18.\n\nHawaii, New Jersey and Illinois are the new battlegrounds for gay-rights advocates emboldened by a landmark Supreme Court ruling in June that struck down a U.S. law that denied federal marriage benefits to same-sex married couples.\n\nCongress passed that statute, known as the Defense of Marriage Act, in reaction to a historic 1993 decision by the Hawaii Supreme Court that found that excluding same-sex couples from marriage was discrimination.\n\nGay Backlash\n\nThe finding launched a worldwide debate about gay nuptials. It also led to a backlash in which Hawaii and 34 other states banned same-sex marriage, while 13 and the District of Columbia allow it.\n\n\u201cI was relieved,\u201d Genora Dancel, 53, an electronics technician who is part Filipino and was a plaintiff in the Hawaii case, said of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s DOMA ruling. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to come full circle here now.\u201d\n\nTwenty years after the Hawaii high court made history, Governor Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, said it\u2019s time for the most diverse state in America to allow gays to wed.\n\n\u201cWith my bill, we\u2019ve taken into account the experience of other states and the legal conclusions that have been reached,\u201d said Abercrombie, 75, who is up for re-election in 2014. \u201cMarriage has economic and social and psychological consequences and equity is something I believe is a constitutional principle.\u201d\n\nAbercrombie Bill\n\nAbercrombie caucused with House members recently to discuss a bill he introduced last month, \u201cThe Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013.\u201d Democrats dominate Hawaii\u2019s legislature, 24-1 in the Senate and 44-7 in the House.\n\nA group of Democrats, including several in the Filipino caucus, proposed a measure earlier this year to keep marriages as they are, restricted to a man and a woman. The bill, as well as gay-marriage legislation, wasn\u2019t brought up for a vote before lawmakers adjourned May 7.\n\nReligious leaders question the state\u2019s interest in legislating marriage, suggesting that lawmakers instead put the issue to voters by placing a same-sex marriage initiative on the ballot.\n\n\u201cA lawsuit could be filed to say they don\u2019t have the constitutional authority,\u201d said James Hochberg, an attorney and president of Honolulu-based Hawaii Family Advocates. \u201cThis is a huge political liability for everyone in the Hawaiian legislature.\u201d\n\nChurch Ceremonies\n\nChurches are concerned that they would be required to let same-sex couples use their facilities for marriage ceremonies, Hochberg said. The proposed bill would allow religious institutions to opt out in certain circumstances.\n\nDiffering religious beliefs between generations of tight-knit Roman Catholic Filipino families are indicative of why the islands continue to debate same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really generational,\u201d said Amy Agbayani, director of the office of Student Equity, Excellence & Diversity at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Near her office on campus, orange and black parking signs blink \u201cMove with Aloha.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the only Filipino on the brochure when we debated the constitutional amendment in 1998,\u201d she said, adding the leaflet had pictures of prominent leaders from various ethnic groups under the logo \u201cProtect our Constitution.\u201d \u201cIt was really hard to get any other Filipino leaders to come out in support.\u201d\n\nReligious Exemption\n\nSince then, several Filipino lawmakers in this island chain where rainbows adorn license plates changed their minds about same-sex marriage as they watched other states adopt such laws. They emphasize that a religious exemption is essential.\n\n\u201cAs someone born and raised as a Catholic, that influenced my vote,\u201d said State Senator Will Espero, a Democrat who voted against a civil-unions bill when it was first introduced in 2010. He voted for a similar measure Abercrombie signed into law in 2011.\n\n\u201cI feel same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness for all,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Filipinos are Roman Catholics and I\u2019m hoping, with the bishop\u2019s letter, more will start to think about it.\u201d\n\nIn an Aug. 22 letter, Bishop of Honolulu Larry Silva urged Catholics to contact their legislators.\n\n\u201cTo discriminate between heterosexual and same-sex couples regarding marriage is not, despite the hype on the streets, unjust discrimination,\u201d wrote Silva.\n\nSpousal Benefits\n\n\u201cIf same-sex couples are given the legal right to marry under the pretense that discrimination that excludes them from marriage is unjust, why would people who prefer several spouses at the same time not be afforded the same right?\u201d Silva said. \u201cWhy would there be discrimination against those who decide to marry their mother or father, brother or sister, so that they can gain spousal benefits for them?\u201d\n\nGay Filipino Catholics decried the letter and joined Espero in pointing out recent comments by Pope Francis that he wouldn\u2019t judge someone who is gay if they seek God.\n\n\u201cWe have a bishop saying there\u2019s just discrimination,\u201d said Gene Corpuz, 55, who sits on the board of Dignity Honolulu, an organization for gay Catholics. \u201cHawaii was the first state to legalize abortion, the first state to pass the equal-rights amendment and we were on the forefront of this issue before it was co-opted by the religious right.\u201d\n\nBlazing Saddles\n\nAdvocates with Hawaii United for Marriage recently asked Corpuz and members of the gay and lesbian Blazing Saddles Country Western Dance Club to fill out postcards to legislators as they practiced the \u201cHalf Past Nothing\u201d line dance in Honolulu.\n\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June, the coalition has amassed the support of faith groups, businesses, the islands\u2019 Congressional delegation and unions, including Unite Here Local 5, whose membership is 60 percent Filipino.\n\n\u201cFilipinos improved their lot in Hawaii by being part of the multiethnic union movement,\u201d said Agbayani, who is active with Local 5. \u201cThat union movement hasn\u2019t always been supportive of gay rights.\u201d\n\nReligious organizations are also working to build momentum. Hawaii Family Advocates enlisted CitizenLink, a Colorado Springs, Colorado-based affiliate of Focus on the Family, to poll about 49,000 people by telephone. Asked whether they believed marriage should be between a man and a woman, 63 percent of about 21,000 respondents said yes, 23 percent said no and the rest were undecided, Hochberg said.\n\nMajority Support\n\nHawaii United for Marriage released a poll by Honolulu-based QMark Research on Aug. 8 that showed 54 percent of 442 people favored allowing gays to marry, 31 percent were opposed. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.7 percent.\n\nIdeology aside, not enough attention is paid to the economics of same-sex marriage, said Abercrombie. He cited a July study by Sumner LaCroix, of the University of Hawaii, that showed the state may lose as much as $217 million in visitor spending through 2016 if it doesn\u2019t allow gay nuptials.\n\nMore tourism would boost the fortunes of Filipinos who \u201care the backbone of the service industry, which is the No. 1 industry in Hawaii,\u201d said the University of Hawaii\u2019s Agbayani.\n\nSome Hawaiians who work with tourists oppose same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cAlthough I truly respect gays and lesbians in the community, same-sex marriage just doesn\u2019t conform to family values,\u201d said Evelyn D. Basnillo, a real estate broker in Kapaa, Kauai, who was born in the Philippines. \u201cTherefore, I am strongly against this bill.\u201d\n\nRetirees that flee the mainland winters, who own homes in Kekaha, where roosters compete with cars for space on the road, are among parishioners at Bulatao\u2019s methodist congregation, said the Reverend Tyler Kaufmann.\n\n\u201cWe want to change bureaucratic laws against marriage equality,\u201d said Kaufmann, 26, who is from Elkhorn, Nebraska and has a green turtle tattooed on his left bicep. \u201cI want us to be in the pono -- I want us to be in the right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jennifer Oldham", "twitter": {"description": "From the westernmost town in Kauai, where his parents emigrated from the Philippines and found work on a sugar plantation, Jose Bulatao Jr. e-mailed Filipino state legislators urging them to approve same-sex marriage.", "title": "Hawaii Filipinos Test Norms as Gay Marriage Gains in Community", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-16/hawaii-filipinos-test-norms-as-gay-marriage-gains-in-community", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iF61oP8F1Zcs/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Jennifer Oldham", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "United Methodist Church,Family,Supreme Court,Neil Abercrombie,Hawaii", "news_keywords": "United Methodist Church,Family,Supreme Court,Neil Abercrombie,Hawaii", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-16/hawaii-filipinos-test-norms-as-gay-marriage-gains-in-community", "parsely-title": "Hawaii Filipinos Test Norms as Gay Marriage Gains in Community", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-16T04:01:00.005Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "From the westernmost town in Kauai, where his parents emigrated from the Philippines and found work on a sugar plantation, Jose Bulatao Jr. e-mailed Filipino state legislators urging them to approve same-sex marriage.", "parsely-tags": "United Methodist Church,Family,Supreme Court,Neil Abercrombie,Hawaii,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2013-09-16T04:01:00.005Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "From the westernmost town in Kauai, where his parents emigrated from the Philippines and found work on a sugar plantation, Jose Bulatao Jr. e-mailed Filipino state legislators urging them to approve same-sex marriage.", "title": "Hawaii Filipinos Test Norms as Gay Marriage Gains in Community", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-16/hawaii-filipinos-test-norms-as-gay-marriage-gains-in-community", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iF61oP8F1Zcs/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "From the westernmost town in Kauai, where his parents emigrated from the Philippines and found work on a sugar plantation, Jose Bulatao Jr. e-mailed Filipino state legislators urging them to approve same-sex marriage."}, "parsely-post-id": "MT19MF1A74E901", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iF61oP8F1Zcs/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf647\"", "article_summary": "Hawaii Family Advocates enlisted CitizenLink, a Colorado Springs, Colorado-based affiliate of Focus on the Family, to poll about 49,000 people by telephone.\nThe debate over same-sex marriage in Hawaii hinges in part on persuading Filipinos like those in the majority in Bulatao\u2019s church that it\u2019s an idea worthy of their support.\nIdeology aside, not enough attention is paid to the economics of same-sex marriage, said Abercrombie.\n\u201cTo discriminate between heterosexual and same-sex couples regarding marriage is not, despite the hype on the streets, unjust discrimination,\u201d wrote Silva.\n\u201cA lawsuit could be filed to say they don\u2019t have the constitutional authority,\u201d said James Hochberg, an attorney and president of Honolulu-based Hawaii Family Advocates."}
