Insurers request big rate hikes, citing coming Medicaid changes



Two insurance carriers on the Obamacare exchange are attributing proposed double-digit premium increases to next year’s private-market alterations to the New Hampshire Medicaid program.



Minuteman Health Inc. — which entered the New Hampshire exchange market this year with the lowest premiums — has requested rate increases ranging from 42 to 51 percent for next year, according to healthcare.gov, the online exchange established by the Affordable Care Act.

..

Maine Community Health Options asked for premium increases between 19 and 22 percent.



Both companies attributed their proposed increases in part to the Premium Assistance Program, the name for the Medicaid expansion program that is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1. A compromise between Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and Senate Republicans, the program will send Medicaid recipients to the exchange and give them Medicaid dollars to pay for their coverage.

Medicaid patients are low-income people who often have spotty health care histories, and the expansion provides mental health and addiction recovery services that some of them have had little access to.

..

Maine Community estimated that claims from the Medicaid patients will be 61 percent higher than its current risk pool, according to a statement filed with healthcare.gov.



Tom Policelli, the chief executive of Minuteman, said his actuaries had similar numbers when they worked out the proposed increase.

..

“It’s a different population. You’re mixing two different groups of people,” said Policelli, who stressed that actuarial numbers covering the Medicaid population continue to be refined.



“We’re all scrambling, looking at the data,” he said.

..

In a statement, Hassan’s spokesman stressed that regulators must approve premium increases. Spokesman William Hinkle also said rates should drop as Medicaid patients enter the exchange.



“As the expansion population moves to private coverage on the marketplace, it will help encourage more competition that will help improve affordability and increase choices for all New Hampshire citizens,” Hinkle wrote.

..

Both Policelli and ACA advocates stressed that the proposed rates are an early filing.



“These specific rates will be subject to vigorous rate review and revision and the final rates consumers will see this fall will reflect the breadth of choice and competition in the marketplace,” said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

..

On July 15, carriers can alter their proposal, Policelli said.



“In our own view, it is always easier to go down than go up, so we started up,” he said.



In a statement, the free-market advocacy group Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire said working families face stagnant wages, and the rate hikes could send them into a tailspin.

..

“The proposed Obamacare rate hikes for 2016 in New Hampshire clearly tear apart any notion that the Affordable Care Act is affordable,” said Greg Moore, state director for the group.



New Hampshire has five carriers who offer health insurance through the exchange. Healthcare.gov lists only those that seek double-digit increases.

..

Colin Manning, a spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross, said he couldn’t discuss Anthem’s proposed rates for competitive reasons.



But he said Anthem rates were essentially flat for 2015, and the company will continue to provide stability to the market.

..

“I’m not going to comment on the rate filing of another carrier, but through our responsible approach we’ve been able to offer realistic rates and stability to the market,” Manning said.



As of the end of March, 45,600 New Hampshire residents were enrolled in a plan through the exchange, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. About 66 percent received subsidies to help pay their premiums, one of the lowest percentages in the country, the centers said.

..

The Massachusetts-based Minuteman entered the New Hampshire market in 2015 with significantly low rates. For example, its silver plan premiums for a 50-year-old non-smoker were $304 and $317 a month; Anthem was $368; Harvard Pilgrim, $383.
