Manning backed up Helton at quarterback in 1994. The two have been backing each other ever since.\n\nReached Sunday, Helton praised Manning\u2019s career after the five-time NFL MVP decided to walk away.\n\nStatements from John Elway, Gary Kubiak, Joe Ellis on Manning\u2019s retirement\n\n\u201cPeyton is quality in every aspect of his life. His work ethic, achievements, the ability to overcome obstacles, leadership and friendship. He has never done anything halfway,\u201d Helton said. \u201cTo me he represents the pinnacle of excellence on and off the field. I am thrilled he\u2019s walking away a champion.\u201d\n\nManning and Helton remained close after the two went their separate ways. Helton forged a 17-year major league career as the most accomplished player in Colorado Rockies history. Manning carved out an 18-year career that leaves him in the conversation as the greatest of all time. Even as Manning became an iconic athlete, his friendship with Helton remained unchanged. He joined Helton at Cincinnati\u2019s Riverfront Stadium for batting practice early in his NFL career, and later did the same at Coors Field.\n\nAfter retiring following the 2013 season, Helton made a point to visit Manning during Broncos training camp, quipping, \u201cHow many times in my life is my good friend going to be Denver\u2019s quarterback?\u201d\n\nHelton saw a side of Manning most don\u2019t \u2014 his dry wit and desire to help others without fanfare.\n\n\u201cWe have all watched his athletic ability and knowledge of the game. It\u2019s amazing. As someone who knows him personally, that\u2019s how he approaches everything: to achieve excellence,\u201d said Helton, who spent time with Manning hunting in the offseason over the past several years. \u201cHe deserves to be celebrated for all he has accomplished in his career. On top of that, he\u2019s a good guy who invests in others. I wish nothing but success in his life after the NFL.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
