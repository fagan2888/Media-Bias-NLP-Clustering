Quite famously, Governor Kasich agreed to ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in Ohio. This is his latest defense:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nLook at Medicaid expansion. Do you know how many people are yelling at me? I go out to events where people yell at me. You know what I tell \u2019em? \u2026 I say, there\u2019s a book. It\u2019s got a new part and an old part; they put it together, it\u2019s a remarkable book. If you don\u2019t have one, I\u2019ll buy you one. It talks about how we treat the poor. Sometimes you just have to lead.\n\nApparently, ObamaCare critics have missed that part in the Bible where Jesus calls on us to expand an already-deadly federal welfare state that destroys the human spirit, breaks up the family, and creates generational dependence.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to argue with Brother Kasich, but I must have missed the part where the Christian thing to do is to use the punitive power of The State to force your personal Christian values on others.\n\nThis is not the first time Kasich\u2019s lorded his superior Christianity over the rest of us selfish sinners. He made this argument back in 2013:\n\nKasich continued: \u201cI had a conversation with one of the members of the legislature the other day. I said, \u2018I respect the fact that you believe in small government. I do, too. I also know that you\u2019re a person of faith.\n\n\u2018Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Kasich currently enjoys 3.1% national support. In a recent NBC News poll, Kasich dropped from 12% to just 6% in New Hampshire.\n\nUndoubtedly there is some tri-level strategy involved in Kasich\u2019s decision to win the Republican nomination through a cynical political decision to expand the slavery of the Welfare State and attack the Christianity of those who disagree.\n\nKasich sounds like a theocrat and a tad loony.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Kasich Rips ObamaCare Critics For Not Understanding the Bible", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "John Kasich Rips ObamaCare Critics For Not Understanding the Bible", "title": "John Kasich Rips ObamaCare Critics For Not Understanding the Bible - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4717, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/ap_john-kasich-_ap-photo1.jpg", "height": 3190}, "updated_time": "2015-10-06T11:40:26-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2015/10/06/johns-kasich-rips-obamacare-critics-for-not-understanding-the-bible/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Kasich Rips ObamaCare Critics For Not Understanding the Bible", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/ap_john-kasich-_ap-photo1.jpg", "title": "John Kasich Rips ObamaCare Critics For Not Understanding the Bible - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bible, Gov.
