Maybe that\u2019s because 2015 was so horrendous. Or maybe I\u2019m just an optimistic guy. While still trying to figure it out, here are a few not entirely serious predictions for the coming year:\n\n\u2022\n\nColoradans choose to allow beer and wine sales in supermarkets while voting down anti-fracking measures because we suspect that the word \u201cprivate\u201d in the phrase \u201cprivate property\u201d is supposed to mean something. Tears are shed in Boulder and Aspen, but the world does not end.\n\n\u2022 The Colorado election for U.S. Senate, featuring a not-very-well-known Republican against incumbent Sen. Michael \u201cWho?\u201d Bennet, goes to a recount following massive spending by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to defend its most vulnerable member. The final result gives Colorado two Republican senators for the first time in more than a decade. We learn that Bennet is, in fact, a hologram controlled by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n\u2022 Donald Trump drops out of the presidential race and says that his whole campaign was a bet with fellow Manhattan billionaire liberal Michael Bloomberg about whether Trump could really fool gullible Republicans into thinking he had suddenly become a conservative and that a man who traffics in exaggerations and insults, and learns about national security issues from \u201cthe shows,\u201d could be a good standard-bearer for the GOP. Former Trump supporters show remarkably little embarrassment.\n\n\u2022\n\nMarco Rubio defeats Hillary Clinton in the November election after Clinton is unable to turn her vaunted \u201cexperience\u201d into a positive while Rubio effectively reminds voters that Clinton is, to a degree, remarkable even for a politician, a failure and a fibber. Clinton becomes an adjunct professor of political science at Columbia University, her first course being Collecting Frequent Flier Miles as a Public Servant.\n\n\u2022 The Denver Broncos defeat the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship (after Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski is ejected in what becomes known as Shoelacegate) but lose the Super Bowl to the Arizona Cardinals, 34-23.\n\n\u2022 Peyton Manning announces his retirement while the Broncos sign quarterback Brock Osweiler to a four-year, $33 million contract. Manning founds Sore Feet Arch Supports and hires \u201cPapa John\u201d Schnatter to be his national spokesman: \u201cWe pizza guys are on our feet all day. From the CEO to the guy putting on the pepperoni, we can\u2019t afford to go on restaurant injured reserve!\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Colorado Rockies go .500 for the first time since 2010, but nobody notices. After a profanity-laced tirade in French upon being served yet another undercooked duck \u2026 l\u2019orange, Colorado Avalanche coach Patrick Roy moves back to his hometown of Quebec City. The team goes with him and becomes the Quebec Quadrilaterals, surely the squarest name in sports.\n\nI wish you all a happy, healthy and successful 2016.\n\nKaminsky is host of \u201cThe Ross Kaminsky Show\u201d weekday mornings on 630 KHOW.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kaminsky: What the new year will bring", "title": "Kaminsky: What the new year will bring", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/31/kaminsky-what-the-new-year-will-bring/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151231__OP03KAMINSKYp1.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151231__OP03KAMINSKYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-31T13:06:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:36:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The final result gives Colorado two Republican senators for the first time in more than a decade.\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.\n\u2022 Peyton Manning announces his retirement while the Broncos sign quarterback Brock Osweiler to a four-year, $33 million contract.\nClinton becomes an adjunct professor of political science at Columbia University, her first course being Collecting Frequent Flier Miles as a Public Servant.\nThe team goes with him and becomes the Quebec Quadrilaterals, surely the squarest name in sports."}
