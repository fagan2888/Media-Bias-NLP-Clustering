But first: Checking in on the Obama administration's cancer initiative.\n\nSTATUS CHECK ON THE CANCER 'MOON SHOT' \u2014 The White House announced its bid to cure cancer 99 days ago. Not surprisingly, we haven't cured cancer yet. So what has the task force accomplished?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPULSE pulls out three early achievements:\n\n\u00b7 Built momentum for cancer research: Vice President Joe Biden's nationwide campaign has elevated the issue and raised new questions about funding and solutions. (More on that below.)\n\n\u00b7 Encouraged private funding: Biden last month touted Michael Bloomberg and Sidney Kimmel's combined $100 million gift to Johns Hopkins as evidence that his task force is \"facilitating cooperation between government, the private sector, academia and philanthropy.\"\n\n\u00b7 Fostered brainstorming: An all-star panel is working on recommendations to deliver to Obama by the end of the year.\n\nIt's hard to grade the White House when the initiative isn't even 100 days old; politics and science both take time. \"One needs to be modest about these things,\" oncologist and former White House adviser Zeke Emanuel tells PULSE, urging patience. \"Even if that's antithetical to how people like to talk about them.\"\n\nBut on the administration's trip to the moon, \"momentum\" and \"brainstorming\" alone won't even get them to Cape Canaveral. Facebook billionaire Sean Parker arguably has done more on his own to advance cancer care in the past seven days by gifting $250 million to catalyze immunotherapy research.\n\nAnd time is of the essence. While every president wants to be the one to end cancer, there's no guarantee that this effort continues post-Biden and Obama. Right now, the White House is trying to both build and launch a historic rocket \u2014 and Inauguration Day 2017 is just 275 days away.\n\nHOW TO MAXIMIZE THE WHITE HOUSE's CANCER DOLLARS \u2014 The administration should be hailed for potentially infusing hundreds of millions of dollars into cancer research, Bruce Zetter and Lara Maggs of Boston Children's Hospital write in a POLITICO op-ed. \"But it is also an opportunity to target these new funds at the most deadly forms of cancer \u2014 something the current funding streams fail to do.\"\n\n\u2014 Funding out of balance? Zetter and Maggs point out that three hard-to-treat cancers \u2014 lung, colorectal and pancreatic \u2014 caused 42 percent of all 2013 U.S. cancer deaths, yet received only 14 percent of the National Cancer Institute's budget that year. Meanwhile, no cancer gets more funding than breast cancer, which, perhaps not coincidentally, continues to dwindle as a cause of mortality.\n\nRead their op-ed: http://politi.co/1VidZzP\n\nHEAR FROM BIDEN TODAY \u2014 The vice president will deliver remarks on the cancer initiative at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting. Here's a link to the livestream, which is scheduled to start at 1:15 p.m.\n\nWELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE \u2014 Where I'm still convinced that MACRA is one of the best health care acronyms to say \u2014 and if you don't agree, you're a PDUFA. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nWith help from Darius Tahir (@DariusTahir) and Rachana Pradhan (@RachanaDixit).\n\nCLARIFICATION TO TUESDAY PULSE \u2014 Yesterday's issue suggested that CMS is proposing to eliminate the Two-Midnight Rule. However, the agency's new inpatient payment proposal just eliminates the rule's planned reimbursement cut for providers in Fiscal Year 2017 and retroactively rescinds the cut's effects in previous years.\n\nHOW TO THINK ABOUT UNITEDHEALTH's OBAMACARE DROPOUT \u2014 The nation's largest insurer made it official Tuesday: It's essentially washing its hands of the Obamacare exchanges and will quit most of the 34 state markets where it participated last year.\n\n\"It's a big nothing-burger in terms of market impact,\" insurance industry consultant John Gorman told POLITICO's Paul Demko. \"But symbolically and politically it's huge.\" More from Paul: http://politico.pro/23YeNv7\n\n\u2014 What Republicans are saying: It's another sign that the ACA is broken. \"It\u2019s clear the health insurance companies that helped pass Obamacare want nothing to do with it now that they\u2019re losing money and can\u2019t get the taxpayer-funded bailout that was tucked deep into the law,\" Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Where United's pulling out. Bloomberg's Zach Tracer flags 16 states where the insurer is quitting the market, including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. See his chart: http://bit.ly/1NkKxX9\n\n\u2014 A different way to think about United's earnings. The nation's biggest insurer on Tuesday said that 44 percent of its quarterly revenue came from its Optum consulting and analytics unit. It's the latest reminder that United's business model is increasingly diversified \u2014 and that its profits aren't necessarily powered by providing insurance.\n\nLIFE EXPECTANCY FOR WHITE AMERICANS DECLINES \u2014 Striking new CDC data posted today finds that life expectancy slightly declined for White Americans in 2014, even as it continued to rise for other ethnic groups. The likely culprit: Rising drug overdoses and suicides among working-class Whites, as a growing number of researchers have documented.\n\nSee the CDC report: http://1.usa.gov/1ri8mFs\n\nAverage life expectancy at birth in 2014\n\n\u00b7 Whites: 78.8 years, down 0.1 from 2013\n\n\u00b7 Blacks: 75.6 years, up 0.1\n\n\u00b7 Hispanics: 81.8 years, up 0.2\n\nHOUSE E&C TAKES UP OPIOID PACKAGE TODAY \u2014 The committee at 1:30 p.m. will begin mark-up on 12 separate bills intended to be the counterpart to the Senate's CARA legislation. Details.\n\nMeanwhile: One in three opioid prescriptions is being abused. That's according to a new Castlight Health analysis of nearly 1 million patients\u2019 data, drawn from employer-claims data.\n\nThe digital health company reviewed its data set to flag the heaviest opioid users \u2014 defined as receiving an opioid prescription from four or more providers between 2011 and 2015, or receiving more than 90 days\u2019 supply of opioids at once \u2014 and found about 4.5 percent of patients in its sample fit the bill.\n\nCastlight also determined that opioid misusers cost their employers about twice as much as non-misusers, and that Baby Boomers were four times as likely as millennials to misuse opioids.\n\nSee Castlight's report: http://bit.ly/1WElbFS\n\n\u2014 States with medical marijuana laws have lower opioid abuse rates. According to Castlight, 2.8 percent of people abuse their opioid prescriptions in states that permit medical marijuana versus 5.4 percent of people in states where medical marijuana is prohibited. Researchers have previously suggested that increasing access to medical marijuana could reduce opioid misuse.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Expand seniors\u2019 access to prescription drugs. Right now Medicare drug plans force patients to make long trips for medication or to pay more to use their longtime pharmacy. Let Medicare beneficiaries choose the pharmacy that\u2019s best for them.

Rob Portman for working to curb addiction in the state.\n\nSee Portman's ad: http://bit.ly/1U69OWx\n\n\u2014 GOP's growing focus on drug epidemic. The new ad, which is part of the Portman's campaign's ongoing six-figure online ad buy, follows similar efforts from other endangered Senate Republicans. Sen. Pat Toomey released his own ad last week that touted how he's fought the heroin epidemic in Pennsylvania.\n\nNEW HEALTH LEGISLATION TAKING EFFECT \u2014 The president on Tuesday signed several health bills into law, including legislation that\n\n\u2014 Reauthorized the Older Americans Act, which provides grant programs for the elderly. \"Because of the Older Americans Act, neighborhoods and organizations across the country are able to continue to draw upon the wealth of knowledge that comes only with life experience,\" said HHS Assistant Secretary for Aging Kathy Greenlee.\n\n\u2014 Added Zika virus to the FDA's priority review voucher program, which is intended to fast-track treatments for Zika virus. \"This legislation will help researchers find a faster treatment or cure for the Zika virus that causes heartbreaking birth defects,\" Senate HELP Chair Lamar Alexander said in a statement.\n\nWILL MEDICAID PAY OVERTIME? \u2014 It\u2019s not just the business lobby that\u2019s protesting the Labor Department\u2019s pending rule on overtime pay. Health providers that rely on Medicaid for most of their funding say the rule \u2014 which is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks \u2014 is unworkable unless they get more government money to cover the mandated wage hike, Pro\u2019s Marianne LeVine and Rachana Pradhan report.\n\nThe health care groups argue that they\u2019re hamstrung because their funding comes mostly from the government. Yet many proponents of the overtime rule question the fairness of treating disability service providers any differently than other industries (the industry has made similar arguments when protesting state efforts to increase the minimum wage for hourly workers).\n\nRead the story here: http://politico.pro/22N4rvF\n\nCMS RELEASES MEDICAL ADVANTAGE QUALITY DATA FOR MINORITIES \u2014 \u201cThis is the first time that CMS has released Medicare Advantage data stratified by race and ethnicity,\u201d said Cara James, director of the CMS Office of Minority Health. \u201cWhile these data do not tell us why differences exist, they show where we have problems and can help spur efforts to understand what can be done to reduce or eliminate these differences.\" See more: http://go.cms.gov/1SsiPH2\n\nHOW MUCH PHYSICIANS ARE WORTH \u2014 About 49 percent of male physicians reported a net worth of $1 million or more, compared to just one-third of female physicians, according to a Medscape analysis out this morning.\n\nThe report finds that, as expected, net worth is a function of age:\n\n\u00b7 About 36 percent of physicians age 55 and older had a net worth greater than $2 million\n\n\u00b7 Only 4 percent of physicians age 28 and younger had a net worth greater than $1 million\n\nMedscape's report also busts some gender myths in medicine, finding that while male physicians may choose more lucrative specialties than their female counterparts, both genders make similar decisions with their personal finances.\n\nSee Medscape's report: http://wb.md/1MH9ADC\n\nHOUSE APROPS COMMITTEE CLEARS FDA FUNDING BILL \u2014 The committee approved a $21.3 billion FDA-agricultural bill on Tuesday, rejecting attempts by Democrats to include the White House's request for $1.9 billion in new Zika funding and killing Democratic bids to remove FDA-focused policy riders. More for Pros: http://politico.pro/1StTXSt\n\nHOUSE PANEL GOES AFTER TISSUE COMPANY, ABORTION PROVIDER \u2014 Congressional Republicans say they have evidence that suggests an unnamed abortion provider and an unnamed fetal tissue company may have run afoul of federal laws that ban them from profiting from handling fetal tissue.\n\n\"Anytime Congress sees something that is violation of law, it behooves us to get in there and look at that,\" Marsha Blackburn, the chair of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, told Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn. More for Pros: http://politico.pro/23IVJ7t\n\nMICHIGAN's AG TO FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES OVER FLINT CRISIS TODAY \u2014 Bill Schuette will announce felony and misdemeanor charges against as many as four people involved in the city's toxic water crisis, the Detroit Free Press reports. More charges are expected to come, and more context from the Free Press: http://on.freep.com/1NAquyF\n\nHOW TO AVOID THE NEXT FLINT? \u2014 Michelle Obama and health advocates have been urging kids to drink more water as an alternative to sugary drinks \u2014 but the federal government has done almost nothing to ensure that the water in schools' taps is free from toxic pollutants, POLITICO's Helena Bottemiller Evich reports. http://politico.pro/1Sjn6KB\n\nTHE PUBLIC WANTS MORE BIOSECURITY FUNDING \u2014 That's according to a new survey conducted by the Alliance for Biosecurity, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense and Trust for America\u2019s Health. About 88 percent of respondents were in favor of Congress increasing the biosecurity budget to fight diseases like Ebola and Zika, and 61 percent were surprised to learn that preparedness-funds are experiencing a shortfall.\n\nSee the polling data: http://bit.ly/1qYenqp\n\nAROUND TOWN \u2014 Steve Easterday will join the National Committee for Quality Assurance as Vice President, Quality Solutions Group, on April 25. Easterday's previous stops include Intelliven and Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\n\u2014 CVS Health promoted Mike Ayotte to vice president of state and local government affairs and Ann Walker to senior director of federal government affairs.\n\nAROUND THE NATION \u2014 Obamacare analyst Charles Gaba is going to be tracking a new data set: His poll numbers. The web designer-turned-policy pundit announced that he's running for Oakland County Commissioner as a Democrat in Michigan.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Rachana Pradhan\n\nDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton is sending two top aides to Puerto Rico to learn more about Zika, Reuters reports. http://reut.rs/1SicfAw\n\nVeterans getting health care through the VA still can face long waits, the Washington Post reports. http://wapo.st/22MBhg5\n\nAlso in the Post, Laurie McGinley writes how immunotherapy drugs are being increasingly used to combat different types of cancer. http://wapo.st/26d0h4L\n\nNew York insurer EmblemHealth will lay off nearly 8 percent of its employees, Dan Goldberg reports. http://politi.co/1SYF6JP\n\nNIH is halting some research amid safety concerns, according to NPR. http://n.pr/1SRLFh8\n\nThe Wall Street Journal delves into the science of making friends. http://on.wsj.com/1pfseau\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Many Medicare drug plans effectively require the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies that are inconvenient for patients. That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
