The Weldon Amendment blocks government agencies receiving federal funds from discriminating against any health care entity for not covering abortions.\n\nThe only recourse for victims seeking protection under the Weldon Amendment is to file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. In late August and early September that is exactly what two Catholic universities and seven churches in California did.\n\nBut to date HHS has taken no action, and the violation is ongoing.\n\nBecause the Obama administration has failed to enforce the Weldon amendment, pro-life leaders have pressed to enact the Abortion NonDiscrimination Act, which would make the Weldon amendment permanent and offer judicial recourse for victims impacted by the violation.\n\nPro-lifers in Congress tried to insert ANDA into the Continuing Resolution Omnibus appropriations bill, i.e., CROmnibus, which will fund the government through September 2015 (except DHS, which is only funded until March, so the GOP can revisit Obama\u2019s immigration executive order after the new legislative session begins, at which point Republicans will control both houses).\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nBut with many Republicans opposing CROmnibus for other reasons, it needs Democrat votes to pass and must also pass the Democrat-run Senate.\n\nSince both parties are loathe to risk shutting down the government over the budget, pro-lifers behind the scenes were instead able to squeeze verbiage into the Explanatory Statement noting the complaints and directing the HHS Secretary to take action.\n\nThis is a step toward obtaining relief for the victims of the California mandate and warning other states considering similar action (like Washington) Congress takes the Weldon Amendment seriously. It reads:\n\nHealthcare Provider Complaints. Legislation appropriating funding for the Department of Health and Human Services has carried a general provision relating to health care providers since fiscal year 2005 (Division H, Section 507(d) of Public Law 113-76). Complaints regarding reported violations of these provisions have been filed with the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary is directed to respond to these complaints expeditiously in accordance with final rule 45 CFR Part 88 published in Federal Register Vol. 76 No. 36.\n\nWhat this does is put the HHS Secretary (and other states that might want to follow California\u2019s lead) on notice that Weldon is a law that Congress \u2013 including the Appropriators \u2013 take very seriously.\n\nHHS now has a little time to actually enforce Weldon, but the next appropriations cycle starts in a few months, and this language shows that Congress is not going to let California\u2019s action\u2019s slide.\n\nA source on the Hill noted in an email, \u201cA LOT of work went into pulling this off, and I was actually impressed that they got the report language in.\u201d Again, Democrats as well as Republicans had to agree to this language before it was inserted.\n\nPro-lifers in Congress will still work to pass ANDA next year easier without Harry Reid blocking everything.\n\nPro-lifers were also able to add an Explanatory Statement noting the shroud of secrecy surrounding Obamacare-approved insurance plans that cover abortions and directing the HHS Secretary to provide transparency.\n\nThe explanatory statement agreed to by both Republicans and Democrats calls for transparency BEFORE enrollment\u2026 huge.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that pro-lifers care only about transparency, the explanatory statement gives them opportunities to address the issue of abortion coverage under Obamacare. This is no fix for sure, but it\u2019s a move in the right direction.\n\nAdditional information on CROmnibus for pro-life budget wonks:\n\nFunding for the UNFPA remains the same as FY14: $35 million\n\nFunding for International Family Planning/Population Control Activities remains the same as FY14: not less than $575 million\n\nTitle X Family Planning Program remains the same as FY14: $286 million\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Jill Stanek fought to stop \u201clive birth abortions\u201d after witnessing one as an RN at Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, Illinois. That led to the Born Alive Infants Protection Act legislation, signed by President Bush, that would ensure that proper medical care be given to unborn children who survive botched abortion attempts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans: Obama Admin Ignoring How California Churches Forced to Fund Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "You\u2019ll recall\u00a0that in August the California Department of Managed Health Care\u00a0issued a mandate requiring all insurance issuers to immediately add\u00a0surgical", "title": "Republicans: Obama Admin Ignoring How California Churches Forced to Fund Abortions", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/12/10/republicans-obama-admin-ignoring-how-california-churches-forced-to-fund-abortions/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/barackobama10.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "republicans: obama admin ignoring how california churches forced to fund abortions", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda68c\"", "article_summary": "The Weldon Amendment blocks government agencies receiving federal funds from discriminating against any health care entity for not covering abortions.\nBecause the Obama administration has failed to enforce the Weldon amendment, pro-life leaders have pressed to enact the Abortion NonDiscrimination Act, which would make the Weldon amendment permanent and offer judicial recourse for victims impacted by the violation.\nThis was a violation of the decade-old Weldon Amendment, one of several pro-life riders included in appropriations bills every year.\nIn late August and early September that is exactly what two Catholic universities and seven churches in California did.\nYou\u2019ll recall that in August the California Department of Managed Health Care issued a mandate requiring all insurance issuers to immediately add surgical and RU-486 abortion coverage to their plans, even those for nonprofit religious institutions and churches."}
