(Provided Photo)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \u2014 An Indiana Congressman was the butt of the joke on a recent episode of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central.\n\nRep. Larry Bucshon, R-8th District, is a Republican who thinks comedian John Stewart is funny, according to spokesman Nick McGee. But McGee wasn\u2019t laughing when he said the Congressman was not available to talk about Stewart\u2019s jokes and that he\u2019s focused on other things.\n\nRep. Bucshon is a serious man who delivered a stern message to Democrats and the president in a GOP Address on Labor Day weekend.\n\n\u201cPut aside politics and do what Americans do every day,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a medical doctor who has worked to improve the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the status quo,\u201d he said in April.\n\nBut on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d host John Stewart used a committee exchange between Bucshon and White House Science Adviser John Holdren to make fun of the Congressman for challenging new air quality regulations to address global warming.\n\nMcGee accused Stewart of \u201ccherry picking quotes out of context to further the comedy narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf all the climatologists who depend on the climate changing to keep themselves publishing articles,\u201d said Bucshon in a video clip used on the show, \u201cyes, I could read that but I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nStewart mimicked him by saying, \u201cI do not believe the scientists because it is their profession not their hobby.\u201d The audience laughed.\n\nAnd just to prove how serious the Congressman is, his spokesman said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that they didn\u2019t show Dr. Bucshon\u2019s request that the EPA come to southwest Indiana to discuss these new regulations with Hoosiers.\u201d\n\nThe biggest reason that none of this is funny to Congressman Bucshon is the fact he represents a lot of people who work in the coal industry and new regulations could put them out of business.\n\nHe wants voters to know that \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d is not a news program.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Indiana Congressman was the butt of the joke on a recent episode of \"The Daily Show\" on Comedy Central.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488524387", "og": {"site_name": "WISH-TV", "description": "An Indiana Congressman was the butt of the joke on a recent episode of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central.", "title": "\u2018The Daily Show\u2019 tests Rep.
