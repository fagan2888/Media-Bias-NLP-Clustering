A 51-year-old woman was struck and killed by a vehicle Friday night as she and her husband crossed Fourth Street near Sunken Gardens in St. Petersburg, police said.

Drivers in the median-side lane stopped as Julie and James Vanderbleek, of St. Petersburg, stepped into the crosswalk at 7:18 p.m. on the 1900 block of northbound Fourth Street.

However, Adam W. Graves, 22, of St. Petersburg, driving in the curb-side lane, did not see the pedestrians in time, police said.

James Vanderbleek observed Graves’ 2005 Chrysler Pacific and ran to the curb and was not hit, police said. As Graves swerved to the left, Julie Vanderbleek doubled back toward the median and ran into the vehicle’s path, police said.

She was struck, thrown to the pavement and sustained head and internal injuries. She was later prounouced dead at Bayfront Health St. Petersburg, police said.

There was no mention by police of charges against the driver.
