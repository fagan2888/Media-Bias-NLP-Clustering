A 17-year-old girl was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of threatening to shoot people at Camarillo High School, officials said.

The teen posted a tweet on Twitter late Monday in which "she basically said she was going to shoot up the school," said Capt. John Reilly, a spokesman for the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.

A juvenile saw the threat online about 7 a.m. Tuesday and reported it to police, said sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian. Camarillo High students also saw the tweet and reported it to authorities, Reilly said.

The girl, who is not a Camarillo High student, was arrested late Tuesday morning in the Oxnard/Port Hueneme area, officials said.

The Sheriff's Office increased patrols at Camarillo High on Tuesday, but classes were held as scheduled, authorities said.

Further information was not yet available.
