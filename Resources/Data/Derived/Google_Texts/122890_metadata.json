Please take time to read the 34 page issue which explains not only the results (a likely gain of nine Republicans in the Senate, at least 12 in the House, and massive gains in state houses and governor ships) but why.\n\nPresident Obama is\u2026.President Obama. He neither accepts any responsibility for his party\u2019s devastating defeats, plans any alternative strategy (such as treating Republicans as worthy opponents with whom he must work), nor (given the first two) grasps that his party is scared to death the defeats of the last two off-year elections may be not outliers but symptomatic of what is yet to come.\n\nFirst, the 800 pound elephant in the room: the new enrollment period for ObamaCare. To quote the highlights of a story by Gallup\u2019s Justin McCarthy\n\nAmericans\u2019 approval of Affordable Care Act [ObamaCare]now at 37%\n\nApproval among independents and nonwhites each fell six points\n\nSince its 2012 peak, approval has been lower than disapproval\n\nPut another way, 51% disapprove. And that\u2019s before people realize that when they sign up again, they likely will find that their premiums have gone up again!\n\nThe holy grail of politics is independents. You would expect that only 8% of Republicans approve while 74% of Democrats approve but how about among independents? Approval is at a pitiful 33%.\n\nPart of McCarthy\u2019s amusing \u201cbottom line\u201d is this:\n\nThe percentage of Americans who approve of the law represents a new numerical low, which could indicate a loss of faith in the law amid the aftermath of the 2014 midterms.\n\nNo kidding?\n\nThe other intriguing story comes from POLITICO, which is ordinarily enthusiastically supportive of Obama. In the latest of a series of downer stories (for Democrats), Edward-Isaac Dovere\u2019s column is titled, \u201cDemocrats to Obama: You broke our party, now fix it.\u201d\n\nIt is a litany of complaints including even Donna Brazile! For Democrats, virtually all of whom are pro-abortion, the lead is terrifying:\n\nEnough, Donna Brazile told White House political director David Simas the day after the midterms.\n\nDemocrats are in worse shape than when President Barack Obama came into office \u2014 the number of seats they have in Congress, the number of governors, a party approval rating that\u2019s fallen behind Republicans for the first time in recent history, enthusiasm, energy. The White House, Brazile said when she came to meet with Simas, has got to focus for the next two years on getting the party into better shape, and Obama\u2019s the best and most effective person to get out the message.\n\nThe basic problem is the same as it has always been: Mr. Obama is far to the left of the American electorate. Determined to solidify \u201chis legacy,\u201d he is likely to further ruin his party\u2019s prospects.\n\nTo expect a man in love with own voice (and concerned about his \u201cplace in history\u201d) to worry about fellow Democrats (many of whom have had, at best, a frosty relationship with the President) is, if not preposterous, highly unlikely.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacaregraph3-300x190.png"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2840\"", "article_summary": "You would expect that only 8% of Republicans approve while 74% of Democrats approve but how about among independents?\nPresident Obama is\u2026.President Obama.\nFor Democrats, virtually all of whom are pro-abortion, the lead is terrifying:Enough, Donna Brazile told White House political director David Simas the day after the midterms.\nThe basic problem is the same as it has always been: Mr. Obama is far to the left of the American electorate.\nAnd that\u2019s before people realize that when they sign up again, they likely will find that their premiums have gone up again!"}
