But most Americans now want to change America back.\n\nWASHINGTON, September 5, 2015 \u2212 In 2008, presidential candidate Barack Obama promised to fundamentally change America. He promised fairness for everyone, especially those at the bottom of the economic ladder. He promised to provide health care coverage to all Americans. He promised to fix an economy that was in a severe recession and do it in such a way to ensure that every working American could earn a living wage. He promised to end the US involvement in wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan. And he promised to protect the environment.\n\nAfter almost 7 years of Obama\u2019s leadership, let\u2019s look at America today.\n\nHe supporters would say he has done well, despite having a Congress that, after his first two years, has allegedly tried to block his every move. They claim he brought the economy out of deep recession and reversed the steep and ongoing massive monthly loss of American jobs. He passed the Affordable Care Act, which has provided health insurance for about 11 million Americans and forced virtually all companies to provide at least some health care coverage for all of their workers, including those that work just 30 hours per week.\n\nObama raised the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts while encouraging individual states and municipalities to do the same. He ended the war in Iraq and has scheduled an end to the war in Afghanistan. He implanted a wide range of environmental regulations while finally encouraging the Chinese to take a serious look at this problem within the next 15 years. He provided additional income maintenance programs by increasing welfare and food stamp eligibility.\n\nHe supporters would conclude that his economic policies are working. What\u2019s happening in the Middle East is not his fault while he appears to be successful in getting an agreement to harness Iran\u2019s nuclear program. And he has improved the environment.\n\nTo the silent majority, this view by Obama\u2019s supporters appears to be unrealistic and biased toward select groups at the expense of the majority that sees things quite differently.\n\nThey see that Obama has indeed fundamentally changed American. The change is not what was expected, however, and is contrary to the principles that made America great, which explains why current presidential candidates find wide appeal with a \u201cmake America great\u201d message.\n\nDespite vigorous protestations to the contrary, the economy is still terrible in 2015, fully six years after we reached the alleged bottom of the Great Recession. At this point, we haven\u2019t seen a period of sustained economic growth in this country in almost a decade.\n\nObama\u2019s policies have placed such heavy burdens on the business community that moving forward is extremely difficult. Added environmental and other business regulations, higher costs for unskilled workers, added costs from the Affordable Care Act, financing difficulties from the Dodd/Frank bill (which has essentially cut off loans with some degree of business risk) and higher taxes on marginal income, dividends and capital gains, have all resulted in a stubbornly stagnant economy.\n\nLater this month, Congress will have to deal with raising the more than $18 trillion public debt ceiling, which increased by $7 trillion under Obama alone.\n\nAlmost 94 million adult Americans are not willing or able to work. Many find it is beneficial to collect funds from various Obama programs rather than seek employment. Even though Obama\u2019s economy has created about 5 million jobs in the past two years, the total number of Americans employed today is only about 2 million more than the number before the recession.\n\nBy raising the capital gains tax from 15% to 23.8% investors find they have less after-tax capital to re-invest back into the economy. With less labor and less capital it is no wonder the economy has averaged just above a 2% growth rate during Obama\u2019s terms. The average grow rate following the 1982 recession was 4 \u00bd%.\n\nWhile Obama provided taxpayer-funded health care coverage for 11 million previous uninsured people, tens of millions have experienced higher premiums, higher co-pays, higher deductibles and a loss of long time doctor/patient relationships. After all somebody has to pay for all of those government subsidies. This is an example of Obama\u2019s policies that benefit a small group of wealthy companies and individuals at the expense of the silent majority.\n\nIn the area of foreign affairs, Obama\u2019s foreign policy is yet another disaster. By not leaving a residual force in Iraq (like the 28,000 troop residual force stationed in Korea), he allowed ISIS to develop and move into the vacuum, which succeeded in turning the Middle East into a powder keg that\u2019s ready to blow.\n\nAdd in a terrible agreement with Iran that the majority of Congress will vote to disapprove, and we have a world that is unstable and threatening. In this area, the situation today could hardly be worse. But it will likely worsen once Iran is free to spend hundreds of billions of dollar on unsanctioned, sophisticated offensive weapons.\n\nObama has indeed fundamentally changed America. No longer are we a powerful economic machine, growing through innovation and entrepreneurship. No longer are we a world power that every other country was well aware they could not challenge. No longer are we a nation of people who will accept individual responsibility and only ask for help when it\u2019s absolutely needed. No longer are we a nation that welcomes healthy debate instead of the deceptive and ultimately divisive rhetoric we hear from our elected leaders.\n\nIn short, it seems we are no longer \u201cthe land of the free and the home of the brave.\u201d\n\nObama has fundamentally changed America.
