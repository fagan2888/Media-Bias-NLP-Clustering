Saw Mill-Backed Janus Acquires Steel Storage Europe

The steel-door manufacturer has been backed by the PE firm since 2013

Saw Mill Capital LLC-backed Janus International Group LLC has acquired Steel Storage Europe Ltd. for an undisclosed amount.

Steel Storage, headquartered in Twickenham, England, manufactures, supplies and installs self-storage systems in Europe.

Temple, Georgia-based Janus made the acquisition through its subsidiary, Janus International U.K. Ltd. The businesses manufacture roll-up doors and self-storage products. The deal helps strengthen Janus' global reach. The business has eight U.S. locations, the U.K. business and a joint venture in Mexico.

Janus completed a dividend recapitalization in conjunction with the acquisition.

The company is backed by Briarcliff Manor, New York-based private equity firm Saw Mill, which bought it in December 2013. Last March, the firm agreed to sell Jason Inc., the parent company to a group of manufacturing businesses, for $539 million.
