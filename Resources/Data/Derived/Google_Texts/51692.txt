(Newser) â€“ Because flaunting her butt to the world twice in as many days apparently wasn't extreme enough, Miley Cyrus took to Twitter Wednesday to tell this charming story:

"Just called this paparazzi a C***. So before he makes breaking 'news' out if it. Ill just say it. Ha-Ha #C***"

Her version, of course, did not include the asterisks. As for the aforementioned butt-flaunting (er, twerking) at the VMAs, Cyrus discussed it earlier this week.

"Me and Robin [Thicke,] the whole time said, 'You know we're about to make history right now,'" she says in an interview obtained by MTV, though she doesn't explain what was so history-making about their performance. "Madonna's done it. Britney's done it. Every VMA performance, that's what you're looking for; you're wanting to make history." (Meanwhile, Radar reports that her twerking could have an unfortunate consequence.)
