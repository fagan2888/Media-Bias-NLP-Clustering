Hobby Lobby, the Affordable Care Act, and the Constitution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m for marriage equality \u2014 having filed many briefs supporting challenges to restrictive state laws \u2014 but I have no problem with Indiana\u2019s new religious-freedom law. And neither should progressives.\n\nAfter all, would you want Unitarians to work the audio equipment at a Southern Baptist revival? Would you force a Jewish printer to produce anti-Semitic flyers? Would you require Muslim butchers to serve pork ribs?\n\nThe Supreme Court said in 1990 that the First Amendment doesn\u2019t grant exemptions from generally applicable laws, so religious objectors have to seek relief from the legislature. Accordingly, a near-unanimous Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure that laws and other government actions only burden religious exercise where absolutely necessary to achieve a compelling goal.\n\n\n\nTwenty states have followed suit \u2014 including Illinois, with the support of state Senator Barack Obama \u2014 plus courts in 11 other states interpreted state constitutions to provide similar protections. So mark me unimpressed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s tweeted disappointment that \u201cthis new Indiana law can happen in America today.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the American Civil Liberties Union and other progressive groups long supported these laws, which have been used to protect religious practices involving hallucinogenic substances, animal sacrifices, eagle feathers, and symbolic daggers \u2014 but not discrimination in hiring employees or serving customers.\n\nNone of these laws, at either the federal or state levels, have ever allowed exemptions from anti-discrimination laws. Indiana isn\u2019t even one of the 21 states that prohibit employers from discriminating based on sexual orientation, so there\u2019s no exemption to be granted here.\n\nSome who protest the new law point to its explicit application to disputes between private parties. But most courts \u2014 including the most progressive federal appellate court in the nation, the California-based Ninth Circuit \u2014 have interpreted the federal RFRA in this manner too. And that makes sense: If someone invokes a law to force you to do something, your objection would be to that law, without which there would be no burden on your religious exercise.\n\nBut again, never has a RFRA allowed a private party to discriminate against gays (or anyone else) in employment, service, housing, or any other scenario in the parade of horribles raised by opponents of Indiana\u2019s law.\n\nBut really this debate is all a misunderstanding \u2014 by both sides \u2014 of the difference between government and private action.\n\nProgressives are right that states must extend official recognition to same-sex couples \u2014 though I don\u2019t see a need for government involvement in marriage in the first place \u2014 but egregiously seek to bend the will of private citizens who have religious differences from the prevailing viewpoint. Conservatives are wrong to oppose giving state marriage licenses to same-sex couples but correctly argue that people should be free to live their lives according to their consciences.\n\nWe\u2019re all born free and equal under the law. That means that we may associate with anyone who wishes to associate with us, and also to decline to associate. While governments must treat everyone equally, individuals should be able to make their own decisions on whom to do business with and how \u2014 on religious grounds or otherwise. Those who disagree with those choices can take their custom elsewhere and encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe prototypical scenario that the Indiana law is meant to prevent is the case of that New Mexico wedding photographer who was fined for declining to work a same-sex commitment ceremony. Note however that she lost despite New Mexico\u2019s RFRA, and her stronger argument was based on her First Amendment freedom of expression (which the Supreme Court alas refused to hear).\n\nFor that matter, gay photographers shouldn\u2019t be forced to work fundamentalist celebrations, blacks shouldn\u2019t be forced to work KKK rallies, and environmentalists shouldn\u2019t be forced to work job fairs in logging communities. This isn\u2019t the Jim Crow South; there are plenty of wedding vendors who would be willing to do business regardless of sexual orientation, and no state is enforcing segregation laws.\n\nMoreover, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to have someone who can\u2019t in good faith (literally) support your wedding work it. It must be the desire to narrow the rules of the game such that private institutions are allowed to continue operating only as long as they follow a prescribed list of mores.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that strike you as reactionary and illiberal? If progressives support tolerance and respect for diversity, they should support Indiana\u2019s law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Would you force a Jewish printer to produce anti-Semitic flyers?", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Would you force a Jewish printer to produce anti-Semitic flyers?", "title": "Real Progressives Should Support Indiana\u2019s Law", "url": "http://time.com/3768734/progressives-indiana-law-religious-freedom/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/indiana-sticker.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/indiana-sticker.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Would you force a Jewish printer to produce anti-Semitic flyers?", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Real Progressives Should Support Indiana\u2019s Law"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "progressives, indiana, religious freedom, mike pence"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cca\"", "article_summary": "If progressives support tolerance and respect for diversity, they should support Indiana\u2019s law.\nI\u2019m for marriage equality \u2014 having filed many briefs supporting challenges to restrictive state laws \u2014 but I have no problem with Indiana\u2019s new religious-freedom law.\nMoreover, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to have someone who can\u2019t in good faith (literally) support your wedding work it.\nTwenty states have followed suit \u2014 including Illinois, with the support of state Senator Barack Obama \u2014 plus courts in 11 other states interpreted state constitutions to provide similar protections.\nNone of these laws, at either the federal or state levels, have ever allowed exemptions from anti-discrimination laws."}
