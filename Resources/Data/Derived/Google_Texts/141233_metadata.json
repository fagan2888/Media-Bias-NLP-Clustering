The assailant went after that man, but when the victim stood, he tackled her. \u201cHe got on top of her and he had a knife,\u201d the woman said.\n\nPolice came moments later and the \u201cguy was still trying to hurt her,\u201d said the woman, who watched from her window.\n\nPolice pulled the suspect off the victim and he continued to wave the knife, she said. They told the suspect to put his weapon down two times before firing on him, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was horrifying to see that poor woman run and try to get away from that horrible person,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a waste of life. All he had to do was put down the knife.\u201d\n\nBenita Palmer, another neighbor, said the couple had a fight a few weeks ago.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Neighbor witnessed fatal stabbing in Aurora", "title": "Neighbor witnessed fatal stabbing in Aurora", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/neighbor-witnessed-fatal-stabbing-in-aurora/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__aurora_officer_shootingp1-1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151212__aurora_officer_shootingp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T09:20:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:59:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A woman who turned down her television when she heard a disturbance outside her Aurora home witnessed the fatal stabbing of a neighbor on Saturday night.\nFamily members have identified the woman killed Saturday night as Mireya Ramirez, a mother of four, according to KMGH-Channel 7.\nThe woman who talked to The Denver Post said the victim was screaming for help, and another neighbor tried to distract her attacker by yelling.\n\u201cAnd (there was) a man on top of her punching and stabbing her.\u201dAurora police shot and killed the man when he refused to drop the knife, the woman said.\nAll he had to do was put down the knife.\u201dBenita Palmer, another neighbor, said the couple had a fight a few weeks ago."}
