Bush was asked about his position on a Senate immigration reform bill and, specifically, on offering citizenship to people brought to the United States as children -- commonly known as \u201cDreamers\u201d after failed legislation called the DREAM Act that would have granted many of them legal residency.\n\nRelated: DHS Funding Hits Obama\u2019s Immigration Wall\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt like the sins of the parents should be ascribed to the children,\u201d Bush says to the interviewer. \u201cIf the children always have to pay the price for the adults\u2019 decisions they make \u2013 How fair is that? So, for people that have no country to go back to, which are many of the Dreamers, it\u2019s ridiculous to think there shouldn\u2019t be some accelerated path to citizenship. The [immigration reform] bill gets close to that and I think that\u2019s great. And I think there is almost universal support for that.\u201d\n\nThe statement puts Bush squarely in opposition to the efforts of Capitol Hill Republicans. One of the explicit measures that House Republicans attached to the DHS funding bill they passed is a ban on using any appropriated funds implement the president\u2019s \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d program, known as DACA, which lifted the threat of deportation from illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democrats filibustered an attempt to open debate on the House bill, which President Obama has promised to veto. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is currently expected to order another vote on the same measure \u2013 possibly several more votes \u2013 this week.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a staunch foe of easing restrictions on immigration, railed against the president\u2019s \u201cradical, unlawful, unpopular amnesty agenda\u201d on the floor of the Senate, and said that Democratic proposals to introduce a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill would go nowhere.\n\nRelated: GOP Ready to Rumble on Obama\u2019s Tax and Spend Budget\n\nThe battle over DHS funding is one of increasing urgency, as funding for the agency is due to run out at the end of the month. In addition to managing U.S. border security, DHS has numerous other national security related functions.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday that Democrats are not averse to debating immigration policy, but object to debating \u201cwith a gun to our head.\u201d He called on Senate Republicans to pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill and to debate immigration law separately.\n\nThe revelation that Bush, at least in the past, supported accelerated citizenship for immigrants brought here illegally as minors is only the most recent signal that he doesn\u2019t share the animus much of the GOP base has toward illegal immigration. Last year he expressed sympathy for illegal immigrants entering the country in an effort to support their families. \u201cYes, they broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s an act of love.\u201d\n\nRelated: For Obama, It\u2019s Deficits as Far as the Eye Can See\n\nThe footage discussing Dreamers, which went live this morning, was posted by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic political action organization that specializes in tracking the public statements of Republican politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tracking footage from one of our trackers that attended this conference in Miami in 2013,\u201d said Ben Ray, the communications director for American Bridge. \u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on Jeb for quite a while now,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked if that meant that the organization expects to release more footage from other appearances by the former Florida governor, Ray said, \u201cWhere he\u2019s going to pander the way that he has on immigration, we\u2019re going to call him on it.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Republicans in Congress fight to prevent the President from suspending the deportation of some illegal immigrants, a Democratic activist group released footage of former Florida Gov.
