Though things were coming at him at warp speed, and though his staff was reduced to a skeleton crew, Hunt says none of his first foray into head coaching has felt like drinking from a fire hydrant.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d Hunt said.\n\nHe credits the remaining staff, who have all taken on added responsibility, for keeping things together over the last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of stuff, but it\u2019s manageable. I think when you put things in perspective, and you prioritize things and you have good people working with you \u2014 I\u2019ve got Noel Gillespie who has a wealth of experience, I\u2019ve got Patrick Mutombo, who is a quick study.\n\n\u201cOur new video guy \u2013 Brian Boyle \u2013 has been great, figuring it out on the fly. John Beckett has been great. Al Harrington and Corsley Edwards, they\u2019ve been my muscle. They bring a different edge. And then, the foreign guys, they lean on (Ognjen Stojakovic). So this really helps me as a coach. I don\u2019t feel overwhelmed or that there\u2019s so much coming at me at one time because my guys are catching a lot of that, and that helps.\u201d\n\nKeeping an eye on Hickson and Arthur. The Nuggets have two players that are being watched closely in the final two weeks of the season. J.J. Hickson and Darrell Arthur are champing at the bit to play more than they sit before the season is over, but each is dealing with an injury that could lead to shutting them down for the remainder of the season.\n\nArthur\u2019s injury is a right calf strain, but it has persisted and Arthur noted it was similar to what Clippers standout Jamal Crawford has gone through this season. Crawford missed 15 straight games going into Friday night\u2019s games. Arthur has missed four straight games and was forced to sit out of two others as well due to calf issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Hickson has simply dealt with the pain since after the All-Star break. It is soreness in his right knee, but playing on it can make it worse. The Nuggets training staff and strength staff has done a good job of keeping Hickson as healthy as possible, but the wear and tear of six months of basketball may dictate he watches much more than he plays \u2014 if he plays.\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Al Harrington,Brian Boyle,Corsley Edwards,Darrell Arthur,Denver,J.J.
