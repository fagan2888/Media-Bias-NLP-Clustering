Although he was denied a concealed-carry permit, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had what his adviser Glenn E. Smiley described as a veritable \u201carsenal\u201d at home.\n\nPhoto\n\nFar from being a digression from the principle of nonviolence, this willingness to defend oneself was heir to a long, proud tradition. Considering in 1850 what he believed to be the best response to the Fugitive Slave Act, Frederick Douglass proposed: \u201ca good revolver.\u201d\n\nThe first major ban on the open carrying of firearms \u2014 a Republican-led bill that was drafted after Black Panthers began hanging around the State Legislature in Sacramento with their guns on display \u2014 was signed in 1967 by none other than Gov. Ronald Reagan of California. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 was primarily a reaction to the scourge of \u201cSaturday night specials\u201d \u2014 cheap handguns owned by the poor and the black. The National Rifle Association opposed neither law.\n\nSo the fact that one of the seminal Second Amendment cases in American history is named for a black plaintiff is a beautiful and moving thing indeed. McDonald v. Chicago, argued in 2010, was brought by Otis McDonald, a 76-year-old black man tired of watching his neighborhood give way to crime and gang warfare. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Second Amendment applied not just to all people, but to the states as well as to the federal government, and that Chicago was therefore not permitted to prohibit Mr. McDonald from keeping a handgun for his defense.\n\nYet African-American activists typically refrain from involvement in the issue of gun rights. In October 2013, Shaneen Allen, 27, a black single mother of two, was arrested in New Jersey for carrying a firearm without a license (she was under the impression that her Pennsylvania concealed-carry permit was accepted across state lines), and threatened with a prison sentence of up to 11 years for her mistake.\n\nBut it was conservative publications, such as my own National Review, and the N.R.A. that came to her defense. The N.A.A.C.P. and the usual champions remained unusually quiet. (There was no news conference featuring the Rev. Al Sharpton.) They have been largely absent, too, from the case of Marissa Alexander, a black Florida woman given a 20-year sentence for firing a warning shot near her abusive husband.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s a problem of perception, an assumption that the Second Amendment is the province of whites, that cuts both ways. In 2009, as the first Tea Party rallies swept the country, Contessa Brewer of MSNBC showed a video of a man at an anti-Obamacare rally with a pistol on his hip and suggested that \u201cthere are questions about whether this has racial overtones ... white people showing up with guns.\u201d Later, it came out that the man in the video was actually black.\n\nAt least 15 percent of African-Americans report that they own guns \u2014 about the same rate as all other \u201cnonwhites.\u201d But as anybody who has attended an N.R.A. convention can attest, there is a gaping hole in the organization\u2019s membership. Look around the convention center and you will see plenty of women, a good number of Asians and Hispanics, and even a smattering of children. Blacks? Not so much.\n\nThis is a tremendous shame. It is one thing for the N.R.A. to celebrate black Second Amendment advocates such as its spokesman Colion Noir, and Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, but it is quite another for Wayne LaPierre to inveigh against \u201chome invaders, drug cartels, carjackers, knockout gamers, and rapers, and haters,\u201d and for the camera to then pan around a sea of white faces clapping in unison.\n\nMalcolm X may have a deservedly mixed reputation, but the famous photograph of him standing at the window, rifle in hand, insisting on black liberation \u201cby any means necessary,\u201d is about as American as it gets. It should be celebrated just like the \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d Gadsden flag. By not making that connection, the movement is losing touch with one of its greatest triumphs and forsaking a prime illustration of why its cause is so just and so crucial.\n\nIf supporters of the right to keep and bear arms want their pleas to be heard in their proper context, they might consider talking a little less about Valley Forge and a little more about Jim Crow \u2014 and attempting to fill their ranks with people who have known much more recently what tyranny really looks like.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141025143912, "twitter": {"description": "Why African-Americans and the National Rifle Association should be allies.", "title": "Do Black People Have Equal Gun Rights?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opinion/sunday/do-black-people-have-equal-gun-rights.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003196690"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/26/sunday-review/26GUNS/26GUNS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opinion/sunday/do-black-people-have-equal-gun-rights.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003196690", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opinion/sunday/do-black-people-have-equal-gun-rights.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Do Black People Have Equal Gun Rights?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "National Rifle Assn", "keywords": "Blacks,National Rifle Assn,Gun Control,King  Martin Luther Jr,Second Amendment (US Constitution),Civil Rights and Liberties", "news_keywords": "Blacks African-Americans", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Charles C.
