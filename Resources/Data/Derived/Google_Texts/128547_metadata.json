First, the concept of repaying $16.7 trillion in debt is not even a remote possibility over the next 100 years, even if the government had small surpluses. Then, because the country is running such large deficits, the national debt is increasing and getting worse\u2026much worse. In addition, the government is approximately $70 trillion in unfunded liabilities that have to be resolved.\u201d \u201cPray that the market for the national debt remains open so that the United States can keep borrowing to repay the money is previously borrowed and then will have to re-borrow to repay the money it just borrowed. There is no chance the market will not change its demeanor over the next 100 years.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Murray Holland\u2019s conclusion in his book, \u201cA Nation in the Red: The Government Debt Crisis and What We Can Do About it\u201d ($28.00, McGraw Hill). As a longtime book reviewer, I have read a growing stack of books warning about a financial collapse, but Holland\u2019s book is not only based in the actual debt, but is written in a manner that even a person who has no knowledge of this issue can understand.\n\nThe \u201cmarket\u201d Holland refers to is the market for America\u2019s treasury notes and bonds, issued to cover our on-going budget and the interest needed to pay prior borrowing. In sum, the nation is spending more and borrowing more than it can afford. It has been doing this for a long time and the warning signs are places like Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and other European nations that, following World War Two, embraced socialism. America did so even earlier during The Great Depression and the decades since the 1930s.\n\nHolland calls it a Debt Trap and conservatives know instinctively that the U.S. government is too large and too based in socialism to survive. \u201cThere are over 500 agencies and departments on the list and it does not even include all the agencies and departments created in the states under grant programs from the federal government.\u201d One can find the list here.\n\n\u201cThe list of social programs is long,\u201d writes Holland, \u201cbut the four major categories driving America into the Debt Trap are income security (Social Security, welfare, and other related programs), healthcare (Medicaid, Obamacare, and Medicare), education, and housing,\u201d noting that \u201cThese programs did not exist until after the Great Depression.\u201d They came about as the result of a Keynesian view that government spending would lift the economy out of its doldrums, but government spending does nothing to improve the economy. It sucks money out of the economy and, more specifically, out of the pockets of individual citizens and the business community.\n\nAmericans born during and after the Great Depression have had eighty years living in a nation whose economic system is capitalism, but whose governance is socialism.\n\nDespite nearly fifty years of a Cold War with the former Soviet Union (1945-1991), Americans have been blissfully ignored its intention of the communist intention to destroy capitalism and have accepted a vast matrix of social programs that now represent $70 trillion in unfunded financial liabilities. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, their plan \u201cto overwhelm America with debt, welfare, and entitlements\u2014in other words, to bankrupt America has continued unabated.\n\n\u201cThis will cause the collapse of America and the government could then turn to pure socialism,\u201d says Holland, noting that \u201cTheir scheme has been so well researched it has its own name: the Cloward-Piven strategy,\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in addition to the socialist nations of the European Union, communism is still alive and well in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba to name just a few nations. And yet, even Russia and China have adopted some capitalistic measures, while ensuring strong, totalitarian central governments.\n\nThe level of danger has increased exponentially with the election and reelection of President Barack Obama whose namesake legislation, Obamacare, is already having a catastrophic effect on the economy while putting all Americans at risk for the loss of healthcare from individual physicians and hospitals. The legislation was passed by a party-line vote by Democrats and opposed by every Republican in Congress. Obama spent the years since signing it lying about it. That\u2019s what Communists do.\n\nIt is what the vast bulk of the nation\u2019s print and broadcast media is doing are doing as well. They are little more than echo chambers for the torrent of lies that Obama administration is telling Americans about the economy.\n\n\u201cDuring the first few years of the Great Depression, almost 2,300 banks were closed, manufacturing fell 46 percent, and wholesale prices fell 32 percent. Today, the United States has a reported unemployment rate of around 8 percent. During the Great Depression, the unemployment rate hit 25 percent.\u201d With ninety million Americans unemployed, the figures cited by the federal government are a fiction.\n\nThe only thing that can save America is an increase in our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), selling more goods and services, enabling an increase in employment, coupled with a vast reduction in the enormous governmental regulation of business. The vast taxation of Americans needs to be reduced in order to permit them to retain and spend their earnings, make investments, start new businesses. The annual GDP is now less than what the nation earns.\n\nThe \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d is a totally communist concept and it is the intent of the Obama administration.\n\nThe future of the nation depends on the outcome of the 2014 midterm elections and control of Congress by as many conservative candidates and office-holders is essential. The RINOs, Republicans in name only, must be replaced.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend you purchase and read \u201cA Nation in the Red.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/the-financial-collapse-of-america/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/national-debt-clock_071102.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "The Financial Collapse of America"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, their plan \u201cto overwhelm America with debt, welfare, and entitlements\u2014in other words, to bankrupt America has continued unabated.\nAmerica did so even earlier during The Great Depression and the decades since the 1930s.\n\u201cDuring the first few years of the Great Depression, almost 2,300 banks were closed, manufacturing fell 46 percent, and wholesale prices fell 32 percent.\nDuring the Great Depression, the unemployment rate hit 25 percent.\u201d With ninety million Americans unemployed, the figures cited by the federal government are a fiction.\nAmericans born during and after the Great Depression have had eighty years living in a nation whose economic system is capitalism, but whose governance is socialism."}
