Pete Dugan, a TPD spokesman.\n\nThe incident took place in the 500 block of North Fourth Avenue near Brooklyn Pizza and Sky Bar, according to witnesses.\n\nThe intoxicated man said he didn't want to prosecute, but Dugan said discharging a weapon in city limits is illegal, regardless.\n\nPolice still need to get the other side of the story and have been continuing their investigation, Dugan said.\n\nFourth Avenue is just blocks away from the University of Arizona and is a popular nightlife destination for UA students. In August, a man was shot to death down the street at Maloney's on Fourth Avenue, a bar.\n\nThe most recent incident happened in the middle of the UA's annual Family Weekend and just two days after an altercation between students at Northern Arizona University escalated until one student allegedly shot four others, killing one of them.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
