But for two long decades, many have complained bitterly to each other.\n\nOn the radio\u2026 Higher physician reimbursement should improve access to health care and shorten appointment wait times for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThat\u2019s because an old and complex federal formula reimburses physicians here as if they were practicing in \u201crural\u201d areas, and assumes their costs of rent and staff are low, resembling those in Fresno or El Centro rather than Anaheim or Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe joke among doctors has been \u2018Look at all our cows,'\u201d quipped Dr. James Hay, a family practitioner in Encinitas and former California Medical Association president.\n\nDoctors regard these underpayments, alleged to be in the billions nationally, as a federal snub, with consequences to patient care. The lower rate has depressed the physician supply here, making access to care for Medicare patients tougher. In subtle ways, it has dissuaded some area physicians from accepting Medicare beneficiaries or expanding the number they see, they say.\n\nIt also has encouraged \u201cconcierge\u201d cash-only practices and lengthened wait times beneficiaries must endure for an appointment.\n\nNow, after a tempestuous 14-year fight and a $5 billion lawsuit that got as far as the U.S. Supreme Court, a congressionally approved fix will gradually increase doctors pay in San Diego County and 14 other California counties that were inappropriately classified. Starting Jan. 1, the new rule, embedded in the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, will pay them higher rates, more like doctors practicing in Orange County and other higher cost urban areas of the state.\n\nOther categories of health providers who bill Medicare, such as nurse practitioners, podiatrists and optometrists, may expect more money too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to have reimbursement that more closely approximates the cost of providing care instead of underpaying us as if we were El Centro,\u201d said Dr. Ted Mazer, a San Diego ear, nose and throat specialist who has been among the leaders in the fight to change Medicare\u2019s payment formula.\n\n\u201cAnd, because Medicare rates are followed by virtually all commercial payers here,\u201d rates from private insurance companies should rise too, he said.\n\nHigher payments \u201cwill help the viability of our practices, both in attracting new doctors as our older doctors age out, and our existing population grows older and needs more care,\u201d he said. And, \u201cit will put money on the table for people to buy new technologies (like electronic health record capabilities).\u201d\n\nNicknamed \u201cthe GPCI fix,\u201d the correction changes the geographic practice cost index formula Medicare uses to reflect regional physicians\u2019 costs, such as hiring office staff, paying rent and buying malpractice insurance in Medicare\u2019s 89 GPCI localities around the country.\n\nPinpointing a particular event that pushed Congress to make the change is difficult. In the end, Mazer said, it came down to \u201cjust good old politics of facts and timing,\u2019\u2019 the support of key elected officials on both sides of the aisle, and the physicians\u2019 persistence.\n\nElizabeth McNeil, the California Medical Association\u2019s vice president for federal government relations, estimated the GPCI fix will bring about $52 million a year more to California providers in these 15 counties that submit Part B Medicare claims, depending on inflation. San Diego County doctors who bill Medicare will get about half of that total.\n\nThe GPCI fix still won\u2019t bring San Diego County\u2019s pay up to Orange County\u2019s level, but it\u2019s a start.\n\n\u201cThat would have been nice,\u201d Mazer said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what was approved.\u201d\n\nAbout 7,000 San Diego County doctors will be affected, with increases of about 6 percent in increments over the next six years.\n\nMedicare Reimbursements by Procedure\n\nSource: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services | Credit: Leo Castaneda, inewsource\n\nFormer San Diego County Medical Society CEO Tom Gehring said the change ultimately will add $10,000 to the average doctor\u2019s annual payments in this county.\n\nTechnically, the new rule requires Medicare to move 15 counties from \u201clocality 99, rest of state\u201d or rural, to regions that use metropolitan statistical area costs to calculate payment. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Orange, Alameda, Solano, San Mateo, Ventura and Santa Clara counties have long had their own metropolitan formula, all of which pay more than locality 99, which covers all the other California counties.\n\nThe pay differences are significant. Today Medicare reimburses doctors in the so-called rural counties like San Diego $76.48 for a simple office visit for an established patient, while a few miles north, \u201curban\u201d Orange County doctors receive $82.19. For procedures, the differences are greater. San Diego gastroenterologists receive $548.57 for a colonoscopy with polyp removal, while in Orange County, the pay is $602.12. San Francisco and Los Angeles rates are even higher.\n\nIn fact, the eight currently \u201curban\u201d areas of the state all have higher reimbursement than San Diego County. For example, cystoscopy and treatment in transurethral surgery pays doctors in those eight areas on average 12 percent, or $34.95, more than it pays doctors in locality 99. A dilation of the esophagus pays 14 percent more.\n\nThe adjustment will come in increments; each year San Diego doctors will get one-sixth of the difference between the locality 99 rate and their new MSA rate until the full amount is reached in 2022.\n\nDespite the area\u2019s scenic beauty and weather as enticements, doctors here have long complained of the challenge in bringing new doctors to their practices. Interested partners think they\u2019ll be paid based on high Southern California costs of living, and they\u2019re surprised.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard to recruit in San Diego,\u201d said Dr. John LaFata, an internal medicine doctor whose six-physician Vista practice struggled to hire three internists in the last two years.\n\n\u201cI know hospitals have a hard time recruiting cardiologists, general and vascular surgeons and other surgical subspecialists because the cost of living is much higher here. People say, \u2018I can do much better in Iowa if I can tolerate the weather.\u2019 Much of that is due to (Medicare\u2019s) differential payment structure.\u201d\n\nDr. Vimal Nanavati, an Otay Lakes critical care cardiologist, said the pay increase will have \u201ca huge impact\u201d on physician practices. It will mean \u201cshorter wait times for patients,\u201d and doctors can spend more time with patients during appointments. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting paid less, you have to see more patients. Now, we can take more patients and take our time seeing them. Our practices will be easier to manage.\u201d\n\nDr. Sherry Franklin, a pediatric endocrinologist in Solana Beach who has some Medicare patients in her solo practice, called the GPCI fix \u201ca win-win for physicians and consumers. Physicians have earned the right to a raise. This will increase access for patients.\u201d\n\nFranklin said that over time, the pay increase will allow physicians to \u201cexpand the pool of Medicare patients they can afford to see.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, for commercial plans like Aetna that follow Medicare reimbursement, more money may translate to better contracts that increase the number of physicians in those plans\u2019 networks.\n\nOf course, when physician fees go up in Medicare, so will beneficiaries\u2019 20 percent co-pays under Part B. If Medicare increases a $100 payment to $106, for example, the beneficiary\u2019s co-pay goes from $20 to $21.20.\n\nLaFata doesn\u2019t think patients will notice, or if they do, that they will mind. He said many have supplemental Medicare plans that cover those co-payments. And those who don\u2019t will gladly pay the extra money. \u201cMany patients tell me they think we\u2019re underpaid anyway.\u201d\n\nHow did San Diego get labeled rural?\n\nIn the 1960s, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services established physician payment rules based on cost of practice formulas in 210 payment localities, adjusting for high cost areas such as New York City and Los Angeles. Back then, San Diego County was a much cheaper place to live and work.\n\nBut times changed; San Diego grew as did its costs. Yet when CMS updated GPCI regions in 1996, consolidating payment areas nationally from 210 to 89, it failed to reflect those shifts.\n\n\u2018\u201dAnd nobody was paying attention,\u201d said Dr. Larry de Ghetaldi, an emergency room physician in \u201crural\u201d Santa Cruz.\n\nExcept that de Ghetaldi was paying attention. In 2001, in his dual role as administrator of a surgical center and director of a medical group, he was surprised to see Medicare\u2019s wage and cost index paid Santa Cruz hospitals a lot more than the index it used to pay Santa Cruz doctors.\n\nDe Ghetaldi and CMA representatives took their beef to Tom Scully, then CMS administrator. \u201cWhy do you use a different set of maps to pay physicians than you do to pay hospitals?\u201d de Ghetaldi asked.\n\n\u201cThe answer was, \u2018We will look at it.\u2019 And the answer always was, \u2018We will look at it,'\u201d he said.\n\nJust up the road, doctors in adjacent Santa Clara County with similar costs and demographics receive pay that is 20 percent higher.\n\nGPCI kings and queens\n\nDe Ghetaldi, Mazer, McNeil, Santa Barbara gastroenterologist Edward Bentley, and Rochelle Dornatt, chief of staff for California Congressman Sam Farr, became obsessed with the issue. They called themselves \u201cthe GPCI kings and queens,\u201d de Ghetaldi said.\n\nThey made dozens of trips to Washington to plead with Medicare officials and lawmakers, but were frequently left waiting for appointments that were canceled or delayed. It was a frustrating time.\n\nDoctors in these counties will get higher Medicare reimbursement El Dorado\n\nMarin*\n\nMonterey\n\nPlacer\n\nRiverside\n\nSacramento\n\nSan Benito\n\nSan Bernardino\n\nSan Diego\n\nSan Joaquin\n\nSan Luis Obispo\n\nSanta Barbara\n\nSanta Cruz\n\nSonoma\n\nYolo *Marin County will move out of a locality it shares with Solano and Napa counties into its own region, resulting in more pay for Marin physicians.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, de Ghetaldi\u2019s brother Dario, a Millbrae attorney, filed a $3.2 billion lawsuit against the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of Mazer and seven \u201crural\u201d California counties, including San Diego. It was later amended to $5 billion, and was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nOne such trip was particularly exasperating, Mazer recalled. They were scheduled for a two-day meeting in Medicare\u2019s Baltimore headquarters. \u201cIt was like going to a military compound. They had mirrors to look under our car.\u201d\n\nBy mid-morning the group sensed \u201cabout as big of a stonewall as you could get,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cNo matter what we said, they couldn\u2019t possibly do it. We were simply asking that they shift physician pay to the system they used for hospitals, to the MSAs, so they wouldn\u2019t have two conflicting systems.\u201d\n\nSolution after solution was offered, Mazer said, but \u201cCMS just spit in our face and said, \u2018No, no.'\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seemed like the only way. It sought class-action status for 250 counties across the country that were in the same undervalued boat.\n\n\u201cIt questioned several administrators in several presidential administrations, and said publicly, you (CMS) guys knew what you were doing was wrong,\u201d Mazer said. \u201cYou knew how to fix it. But you just didn\u2019t want to fix it. Year after year, the problem kept compounding. And they hurt people in the process.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court refused to recognize the plaintiffs\u2019 class action standing and the lawsuit died. But the \u201dGPCI kings and queens\u201d did not give up.\n\nIn Baltimore, Medicare officials argued repeatedly that legally, they could only fix a state\u2019s GPCI disparities if each state\u2019s own doctors unanimously agreed to a statewide solution.\n\nThat\u2019s because the physician fee schedule has generally been a zero-sum game; one doctor\u2019s pay raise requires another\u2019s pay cut. So state medical societies would have to find their own rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul solution. And their decisions would have to be unanimous.\n\nPhysician groups dispute that is the law. But they tried that solution too.\n\nA near fistfight on the House floor\n\n\u201cI have four feet of shelf space full of nothing but GPCI files,\u201d said Dornatt, whose boss a decade ago introduced a bill that would resolve the problem just within California.\n\nAfter months of work, Farr, a Central Coast Democrat, had \u201clined up players on both sides,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCongressman Bill Thomas, (a Republican representing the Central Valley) who chaired the Ways and Means Committee, his staff was telling me, yes, we\u2019ll put it in. Just have Mr. Farr go to the floor and Mr. Thomas will sign off on it.\n\n\u201cBut when Mr. Farr went to the floor, Mr. Thomas refused to sign off on it and they almost had a fistfight,\u201d Dornatt said. Added Adam Russell, Farr\u2019s press representative, Farr \u201cmade a fist at Thomas he was so angry.\u201d\n\nThomas reneged in fear that physicians in his rural Central Valley district would be hurt by a new formula that took San Diego and other wealthier counties out of locality 99.\n\nSimilar urban/rural cost disparities exist in about 250 counties in other states, including Ohio, Georgia, Maryland and Texas. But efforts to make corrections in those states flamed out. Why? Because in California, there was data; the underpayments couldn\u2019t be ignored. Less so elsewhere, Gehring said.\n\n\u201cWe made the most noise about it,\u201d Dr. Larry de Ghetaldi said.\n\nOver the years, high level reports recognized and addressed the problem. The Urban Institute in 2004, the Government Accountability Office in 2005 and in 2007, CMS in 2008, the Institute of Medicine in 2011 and 2012, and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission in 2013.\n\nWho pays for the GPCI fix?\n\nThe GPCI fix law directs CMS to adjust certain overvalued procedures to more accurately reflect the actual work required for that service.\n\n\u201cThat means a payment cut\u201d affecting some physicians for some services across the country, McNeil said. Fine details will come with the Physician Fee Schedule rules for 2017 this summer.\n\nThe new law also protects rural counties that will remain in locality 99 from having their payments reduced when San Diego and the 14 other counties are reassigned next year.\n\nWhile he\u2019s grateful the fight is finally over, the GPCI fix will not return what doctors lost since 1996, Mazer lamented. And, he\u2019s \u201cstill ticked off\u201d the correction requires eight years to fully implement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a part of me that says, \u2018you guys ripped us off for years. You should give us something for that.\u2019 But it\u2019s done. We are where we are.\u201d\n\nIronically, he said, most doctors in counties like San Diego are unaware they\u2019ll see more money from Medicare. \u201cIt\u2019s taken so long to get here, and so long to implement. At least we\u2019re moving forward now, and CMS is now ready to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nWe'll let you know when big things happen.\n\nEmail address:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "San Diego news from inewsource", "description": "San Diego area doctors seldom complain to their patients about low Medicare pay.
