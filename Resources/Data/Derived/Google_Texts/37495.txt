A new form of help for those suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD, is available at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) according to army.mil.

The Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy, or VRET, program recreates the look, sounds and smell of a deployed environment to help revisit and cope with events having a profound affect on individuals.

So far about 30 individuals have been treated through the program that was donated to LRMC in October by the Wounded Warrior Project and according to Maj. (Dr.) Michael Valdovinos, chief of outpatient behavioral health there, results have been good.

“It’s an extremely effective treatment because it is a patient’s personalized reality that they learn to process, control and regulate,” Valdovinos said via army.mil. “Visual memory is powerful, and if I can use that to help patients create their own movie scene, then they can move into it to rewrite their own script.”
