CLEVELAND — The Browns say they are disappointed about a report that troubled wide receiver Josh Gordon has failed another drug test and could be facing a one-year NFL ban.

ESPN, citing anonymous sources, first reported Gordon’s failed test. Pro Football Talk said Gordon tested positive for alcohol.

In a statement on Sunday, the Browns declined further comment due to “the confidential nature of the NFL’s substance abuse policy.” The Browns said they have not been notified by the league of a failed test.

Gordon was suspended for 10 games last season for another violation of the league’s drug policy. He appeared in just five games and was suspended by the Browns for violating team rules before the season finale. The 23-year-old led the league with 1,646 yards receiving in 2013.

League spokesman Brian McCarthy and agent Drew Rosenhaus each declined comment.
