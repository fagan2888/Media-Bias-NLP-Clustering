The stakes are high. If our nominee does not win, Hillary Clinton\u2019s justices will control the Supreme Court for 30 years and we\u2019ll be stuck with Obamacare forever.\u201d\n\nHe went on to add, \u201cI have watched Marco up close. I have seen him take the lead in passing new laws to impose tough new sanctions on Hezbollah terrorists, and to get rid of incompetent managers who weren\u2019t doing their jobs to help veterans. He has proposed good new ideas for giving students more options for college. I am convinced he would be a strong and effective president of the United States.\u201d\n\nSenator Alexander was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2013.
