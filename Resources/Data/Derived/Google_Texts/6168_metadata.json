(ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMaryland insurance officials have approved premium rates for plans to be sold on the state\u2019s small-business health insurance marketplace, which will open at the start of next year, according to an announcement Tuesday.\n\nThirteen carriers have been approved to sell plans on the state\u2019s Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange, a new online insurance marketplace where employers with 50 or fewer workers will be able to compare and purchase plans for their companies and apply for small business tax credits.\n\nOne of the fundamental pieces of the Affordable Care Act, the new exchanges are being set up by 16 states and the District of Columbia and will include separate marketplaces for individuals and employers. States that opted out of establishing an exchange will instead rely on a new marketplace run by the federal government.\n\nIn a statement, Maryland Insurance Commissioner Therese M. Goldsmith said the state\u2019s rates \u201ccompare favorably\u201d to those approved in other states around the country.\n\nFor instance, the monthly premiums for a silver plan (which covers roughly 70 percent of the cost of care) for a 40-year-old non-smoker in Maryland will range from $208 to $435, depending on the insurance company, according to officials. In New York, the same type of individual would pay between $291 and $568 for a similar plan, and in the District, the premiums range from $248 to $408.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that, just like in our individual market, our rates for small businesses in Maryland will be among the lowest in the country,\u201d Joshua M. Sharfstein, chairman of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange board, said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nThe rates are on average slightly higher than the ones business owners in Maryland have been paying the last few years. Compared to the current rates offered by insurers signed up for the marketplace, the new rates range from 4.9 percent lower to 14.6 percent higher, continuing a slow but steady rate-hike for small employers.\n\n\u201cThese changes in rates are consistent with the year-over-year changes we have seen in Maryland\u2019s small group market in 2012 and 2013,\u201d Goldsmith said.\n\nSharfstein noted that the plans now cover minimum health benefits as required under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many offer more comprehensive benefits than plans in previous years.\n\nRelated: What you need to know when choosing a plan on the new exchanges\n\nLike other states, Maryland is erecting two different insurance marketplaces. The one for individuals is set to open on schedule on on Oct. 1. The rates announced today, on the other hand, cover the exchange for small businesses, which will not open for business until January.\n\nCoverage under those plans will take effect in March at the earliest.\n\nSharfstein said the state elected to postpone launching the small business exchange to give officials more time to ease the transition for employers, insurers and brokers.\n\n\u201cWe are focusing on optimizing our partnerships with people who have a lot of experience selling plans to small businesses, and we felt the extra time would be well spent,\u201d he said in an interview back in June.\n\nStill, that will delay some employers\u2019 access to tax credits authorized by the health care law, which have covered as much as 35 percent of the cost of health plans for the last three years for employers with fewer than 25 workers.\n\nNext year, those credits increase to as high as 50 percent of the cost of coverage\u2014however, the credits will only be available through the new SHOP exchanges.\n\nFollow J.D.
