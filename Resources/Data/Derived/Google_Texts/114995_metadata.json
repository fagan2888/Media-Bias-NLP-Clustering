Michele Bachmann (R., Minn.) knew the White House Christmas party this week would be her last chance as a member of Congress to speak directly to President Obama. She didn\u2019t waste the opportunity.\n\nDespite the objections of her family members, who didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, Bachmann said she wanted to give some \u201csubstantive comments\u201d to the president. She waited until pictures were taken and her family walked off the stage.\n\n\u201cI turned to the president and I said, something to the effect of, \u2018Mr. President, you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities, because if you don\u2019t, Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change,\u2019\u201d she told the Washington Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cAnd he got his condescending smile on his face and laughed at me and said, \u2018Well Michele, it\u2019s just not that easy.\u2019 And I said to him, \u2018No, Mr. President, you\u2019re the president, it will happen on your watch, and you\u2019ll have to answer to the world for this.\u2019 And that was it and then I left. Merry Christmas,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nThe retiring congresswoman and Republican firebrand sat down for a wide-ranging interview with the Free Beacon on Thursday to discuss national security issues, the latest spending fight on Capitol Hill, and her plans after leaving office. She said she will remain active and give plenty of speeches ahead of the 2016 election, when Republicans will aim to retake the White House for the first time in eight years.\n\nHer top national security concern is Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. Some experts have said that despite negotiations to curb Iran\u2019s program, which were recently extended for another seven months, the Islamic regime could still acquire enough weapon-grade uranium for a bomb in about two months.\n\nBachmann, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said she believes that Iran could procure a nuclear bomb in the next two years. Experts have told her that U.S. airstrikes could eliminate the nuclear program in about six to eight weeks, but that window begins to close by 2016.\n\nBudget cuts to the military, as well as the loss of intelligence from the CIA\u2019s scrapped interrogation program and the release of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, leaves the next president with fewer options to address Iran and the threat of Islamic terrorists, she said.\n\n\u201cIf we continue on this trajectory of hollowing out our military capacities, and in my opinion our intelligence capacities \u2026 then we are looking at a very horrific option, because how long does it take then to build back up, to get that capacity to take them out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOn foreign policy \u2026 you pay for the sins decades into the future,\u201d she added.\n\nOne of the last items Bachmann will vote on before she departs Washington is funding the government. The $1.1 trillion spending bill cleared a key procedural hurdle early Thursday by just two votes, but it was unclear whether the final measure would pass or if the House Republican leadership would need to introduce a short-term funding resolution to keep the government open.\n\nBachmann joined other conservative Republicans in criticizing the bill for not doing enough to stymie Obama\u2019s efforts on immigration. His recent executive order defers deportation for about 5 million illegal immigrants.\n\nObama\u2019s order will strain funding for social services in several states, Bachmann said, and is also a political calculation to ensure Democratic gains in the next election.\n\n\u201cI think the president is all smiles, [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi [(D., Calif.)] is all smiles, [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid [(D., Nev.)] is all smiles, because today\u2019s their 2016 insurance plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, and Republicans will pay for it; we will vote for it.\u201d\n\nBachmann has frequently sparred with the GOP leadership in the House throughout her four terms in Congress. While Obama \u201cgoes further and further left with each election,\u201d Republican leaders \u201ccontinually kick their base in the shins,\u201d she said.\n\nNow that Republicans have won their largest House majority in decades and recaptured the Senate majority, she advised freshmen lawmakers to \u201calways remember who you are when you come here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis town didn\u2019t give me my identity,\u201d she said, recounting that she used to listen to talk radio as a working mother and wonder \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with these knuckleheads\u201d who go to Washington and \u201ccompletely check their brains at the door.\u201d\n\nBachmann also urged incoming lawmakers to \u201cnever despise small beginnings.\u201d Just before the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010, she decided on a whim to call on Americans from across the country to come to Washington and express concerns directly to their representatives. More than 40,000 arrived in the capital. Pelosi shut her office doors and told her staff to go home.\n\nBachmann now plans to travel across the country, giving speeches and writing op-eds ahead of what she called a \u201cconsequential\u201d election in 2016. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will simply continue Obama\u2019s widely criticized domestic and foreign policies, Bachmann said. Republicans for their part need to ensure that they do not nominate a candidate who is \u201cchanging their stripes just for an election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we get a very bold conservative who has a strong identification of where they want to take the country, both economically and in terms of national security, we do have a chance to have a major course correction for America in the future,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Retiring congresswoman talks with Free Beacon about national security, spending fights, and her 2016 plans", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Rep.
