Not only was he sent home that day, he didn\u2019t work again for weeks. In one moment he was just a guy with a religion that most Americans had no strong opinions about. In the next, there were people who thought he was potentially dangerous because of what he believed.\n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of Muslims have gone through that and since then, every other day it seems like there\u2019s a story in the news about a Muslim blowing himself up, murdering innocent people or taking sex slaves. Ironically, most of the victims of these Muslims are other Muslims. So, if you\u2019re a peaceful Muslim who loves his country, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s easy to feel under siege.\n\nPersonally, I think most American Muslims are good people; they\u2019re anti-terrorist; they\u2019re anti-Sharia law and they want to raise their families in peace and pursue the American Dream just like everybody else. I condemn in the strongest of terms, not just hate crimes and harassment, but the smearing of all Muslims with the same brush. Every Muslim who seems like a nice guy isn\u2019t engaging in Taqiyya as he secretly plans to kill the infidels. Moreover, telling Muslims who mean us no harm that if they understood their own religion, they\u2019d be murdering the rest of us is one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nThat being said, switching gears, the second dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard is robotically repeating, \u201cIslam is a religion of peace,\u201d every time radical Muslims murder someone because of their religion. We know these radicals are murdering people because of their religion since they go out of their way to tell us this. You can certainly argue that groups like ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas and Boko Haram are misinterpreting Islam or perverting the Koran, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are Muslims who believe they\u2019re being faithful to their religion as they rape, murder, and enslave the innocent in the name of Allah.\n\nWorse yet, a significant minority of Muslims across the world agree with what they\u2019re doing.\n\nIt would be fair to say that ISIS is generally unpopular in the Muslim world, but it\u2019s just as fair to note that this still means that enormous numbers of Muslims back ISIS. In just 11 countries, there appears to be north of 60 million Muslims at a minimum who approve of an Islamic organization that\u2019s every bit as evil as the Nazis.\n\nAdditionally, while it\u2019s true that a relatively small number of Muslims are in favor of suicide bombing, those numbers can really add up. For example, 86% of American Muslims oppose suicide bombing. Should we be hailing those numbers even though it means roughly 460,000 American Muslims are okay with suicide bombing? Incidentally, the percentage of Muslims who are okay with suicide bombing goes up over the 25% mark in places like Afghanistan, Egypt, Bangladesh and the Palestinian territories.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sharia law, which is absolutely incompatible with Western democracy and civilized behavior; yet it\u2019s extremely popular across much of the Muslim world. Ninety nine percent of Muslims in Afghanistan, 91% in Iraq, 84% in Pakistan and 74% of Muslims in Egypt want Sharia to be the official law of their country.\n\nMoreover, look at what\u2019s happening in Europe right now. There are so many sexual assaults by Muslim migrants that they are actually putting classes in place to teach them that it\u2019s not okay to rape women.\n\nWhen he first arrived in Europe, Abdu Osman Kelifa, a Muslim asylum seeker from the Horn of Africa, was shocked to see women in skimpy clothes drinking alcohol and kissing in public. Back home, he said, only prostitutes do that, and in locally made movies couples \u201conly hug but never kiss.\u201d\n\nConfused, Mr. Kelifa volunteered to take part in a pioneering and, in some quarters, controversial program that seeks to prevent sexual and other violence by helping male immigrants from societies that are largely segregated or in which women show neither flesh nor public affection to adapt to more open European societies.\n\n...A course manual sets out a simple rule that all asylum seekers need to learn and follow: \u201cTo force someone into sex is not permitted in Norway, even when you are married to that person.\u201d\n\nIt skirts the issue of religious differences, noting that while Norway has long been largely Christian, it is \u201cnot religion that sets the laws\u201d and that, whatever a person\u2019s faith, \u201cthe rules and laws nevertheless have to be followed.\u201d\n\n\u2026In Denmark, lawmakers are pushing to have such sex education included in mandatory language classes for refugees. The German region of Bavaria, the main entry point to Germany for asylum seekers, is already experimenting with such classes at a shelter for teenage migrants in the town of Passau.\n\nThe ugly truth is that these problems are specific to Islam. If you bring 100,000 Muslims into your country, you\u2019re going to have more people who can\u2019t assimilate, more terrorist attacks and more rapes than you will if you bring in 100,000 Jews, Buddhists, Sikhs, Scientologists, Evangelical Christians, Mormons or Hindus.\n\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t mean all Muslims are bad. In fact, most Muslims pretty clearly aren\u2019t bad people. Unfortunately, we have proven to be completely incapable of telling \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslims from \u201cradicals.\u201d If you think our government\u2019s vetting can tell Muhammad, the freedom-loving entrepreneur who loves America from Muhammad the wannabe terrorist who dreams of blowing himself up in a synagogue or a day care one day, you\u2019re kidding yourself. So, when someone gets worried that we\u2019re going to let radical Muslims into our country, can we stop pretending that they\u2019re smearing moderates? A lot of moderate Muslims came here in the first place to get away from the crazies in their own religion; so why do we want to risk bringing those same crazies here by the thousands?\n\nBecause of our inability to screen out radicals, we\u2019d be better off doing anything and everything possible to cut back on the number of Muslims we allow to immigrate to our country. That doesn\u2019t mean an outright ban, which would be impossible to implement, but we should certainly try to minimize the number of refugees and immigrants we allow into our country from Muslim nations as much as possible.\n\nIf you want to dramatically cut the risk of having another 9/11 in the next few years and want to reduce the number of American women who will be raped, reducing the number of Muslims we allow to live in our country long-term would be the most effective thing we could do.\n\nIt all depends on how willing we are to deal with the world as it is as opposed to what we wish it would be. It\u2019s time to stop pretending that the problem is people pointing out that a significant minority of Muslims worldwide are radicalized and to start realistically dealing with the fact that a significant minority of Muslims worldwide are radicalized. With everything we know, we shouldn\u2019t need another 9/11 to convince us to start taking reasonable precautions with our immigration policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On 9/11, one of my roommates was a Turkish pilot.
