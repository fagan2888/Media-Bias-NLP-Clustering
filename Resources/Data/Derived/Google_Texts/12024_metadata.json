Prosecutors agreed to drop drug-possession and bail-violation charges against her.\n\nThe deal had allowed Rosales to be sentenced up to a maximum of 12 years in prison.\n\nThe Daily Sentinel reported that Rosales had cocaine and antidepressants in her system when she fell asleep at the wheel and hit Cho on Sept. 18 on her way to a court hearing in a drunken-driving case. Cho later died at the hospital.\n\nCho, a volunteer with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps Northwest in Washington, was riding to his hometown of Princeton, N.J., with another volunteer, John McGuin, to raise money to pay for the work of two future volunteers. Volunteers are encouraged to live simply on about $100 a month, and they set out to raise $2,400.\n\nRosales refused roadside sobriety tests and fell asleep in the back of a patrol car on her way to get a blood test at a hospital. Chief Deputy District Attorney Mark Hand told Judge Valerie Robison that when she was told that she had killed a man, Rosales cried but then quickly fell asleep again.\n\n\u201cShe fell asleep again while signing her name on a document,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic defender Matt Mulch said Rosales is getting mental health treatment three times a week and called her a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\n\nSome of Cho\u2019s supporters noted that she had misspelled his name in her recent written statements to the court.\n\n\u201cIf you take someone\u2019s life, you should try and spell their name correctly,\u201d friend Molly Geisler told the judge during the three-hour hearing.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Woman who struck, killed cross-country Jesuit cyclist gets 10 years", "title": "Woman who struck, killed cross-country Jesuit cyclist gets 10 years", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/26/woman-who-struck-killed-cross-country-jesuit-cyclist-gets-10-years/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-26T16:41:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-26T16:41:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cShe fell asleep again while signing her name on a document,\u201d he said.\nChief Deputy District Attorney Mark Hand told Judge Valerie Robison that when she was told that she had killed a man, Rosales cried but then quickly fell asleep again.\nTonie Rosales, 30, of Palisade learned her punishment Friday after pleading guilty to vehicular homicide in 25-year-old Eunjey Cho\u2019s death.\nRosales refused roadside sobriety tests and fell asleep in the back of a patrol car on her way to get a blood test at a hospital.\nGRAND JUNCTION \u2014 A woman who struck and killed a Jesuit volunteer on a cross-country bicycling trip in western Colorado last year has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after reaching a plea deal with prosecutors."}
