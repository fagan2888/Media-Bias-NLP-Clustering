A new report ranks the nation's most innovative healthcare providers in categories such as leadership, boundary-pushing and overall vision, with industry giants such as Kaiser Permanente in California and the Cleveland Clinic leading the field.

The report, compiled by market research firm Peer60, surveyed 336 C-suite healthcare executives, a mix of CEOs, chief financial officers, and chief information officers, on the top industry challenges and which organizations are on the cutting edge.

Respondents voted the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota as the most innovative provider overall, followed by Kaiser Permanente, the Cleveland Clinic, Geisinger Health in Pennsylvania, Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City and the Hospital Corporation of America based in Nashville, Tennessee. Meanwhile, Peer60 ranked Mayo Clinic as the top hospital for clinical innovation and testing the limits for quality of care, while Intermountain was ranked as number one for elite leadership and Geisinger came out on top for "most visionary."

The survey also polled respondents on healthcare innovators outside the hospital sector, with numerous respondents citing non-hospital companies as models for healthcare innovation, from Apple to CVS and Walmart. "At first glance, some of these responses appear to be comic relief, but anyone who truly follows the trends in healthcare from a global view is aware of Walmart's deliberate goals to entrench itself in healthcare by changing access to primary care," the report states. "This is just another testament to the size and scope of healthcare."

Peer60 polled respondents on the top challenges facing their healthcare organizations, and found that:

The transition to value-based reimbursement models, identified by 64 percent of respondents, was the number one concern

Coordinated care came in second, named as a top concern by 56 percent

Population health management came in third with 54 percent

Patient engagement was ranked in fourth place, named as a top concern by 48 percent

Nurse and physician shortages rounded out the top five, cited by 47 percent of respondents
