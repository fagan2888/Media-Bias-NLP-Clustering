On Monday, former Florida governor Jeb Bush released his most detailed statement to date on the issue.\n\nWhile it\u2019s an enforcement-heavy proposal, Bush doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of concession to the Trump \u201ckick them all out and let the good ones back in\u201d solution to the fact that an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently living in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Savior or Spoiler? What Happens if Joe Biden Runs Against Clinton\n\n\u201cWhile passions run high on this issue, there is no rational plan to deport millions of people that the American people would support,\u201d he said in a document posted on his campaign website and published on Medium.com. \u201cIt would disrupt communities and families and could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the campaign touts the proposal as Bush\u2019s \u201csix-point\u201d plan for dealing with immigration issues, but it\u2019s really a seven-point plan. The element of the proposal that doesn\u2019t get a number is Bush\u2019s suggestion that many of the 11 million undocumented currently in the U.S. be given a path to legal status.\n\n\u201cI believe that for those already in the country, we need to put in place a rigorous path that requires individuals to pass a thorough criminal background check, pay fines, pay taxes, learn English, obtain a provisional work permit and work, not receive federal government assistance, and over an extended period of time earn legal status,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is not dramatically different from what Bush has advocated in the past, and will, among a certain element of the GOP base, be criticized as \u201camnesty.\u201d But given his long record of advocating a path to legal status, Bush would have had a hard time maintaining credibility if he had flip-flopped on the issue.\n\nRelated: Trump Lowers Expectations About His Debating Skills\n\nHowever, the price of personal consistency is that Bush has delivered a plan that doesn\u2019t stand a chance in Congress, where a large segment of the House of Representatives will not accept anything that smacks of forgiveness toward people in the country illegally. His proposal tries to make up for his relative leniency with existing undocumented immigrants with detailed proposals to toughen border enforcement.\n\nBush proposes redeploying Border Patrol officers at \u201cforward operating bases\u201d close to the border to allow more rapid response to reports of illegal crossing. He calls for \u201ccontinuous surveillance\u201d of the border through the use of technology, including drones, which \u201ccan give our agents a fuller picture of the illegal activity that in turn will enable the country to better allocate resources on the border.\u201d\n\nHe also proposes investing in infrastructure near the border, including new roads and boat launch points, to give the Border Patrol faster and better access to the most remote areas they monitor.\n\nBush joins many across the political spectrum in calling for electronic verification of workers\u2019 legal status. The point of the E-Verify system is to reduce the incentive to come to the U.S. illegally by making it harder to find work. Bush also wants to crack down on visa overstays which, by some estimates, account for nearly half of the undocumented population.\n\nRelated: Why the 2016 Primary Race Is Exactly Like a Reality Show\n\nFinally, Bush makes the de rigeur call for a crackdown on so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d places where, in the minds of some, undocumented immigrants are allowed to run riot, endangering the population. The murder of a woman in San Francisco last month \u2013 with a generous boost from Donald Trump \u2013 became a symbol of the supposed problem of sanctuary cities. While there is reason to doubt that such cities are quite as bad at enforcing federal immigration law as Trump and others suggest, they are the flavor of the month, and Bush has signed on.\n\n\u201cWe should withhold federal law enforcement funds for cities that undermine federal immigration laws,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause it\u2019s campaign season, Bush ended his proposal by suggesting that the nation\u2019s inability to come to consensus on immigration reform in recent years is not just President Obama\u2019s fault, but is part of a plot to make life harder for Republicans.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has had six-and-a-half years to address our broken immigration system. Instead of leading the nation towards consensus, he has divided the country,\u201d Bush says. \u201cOne has to ask whether he is more interested in providing a wedge issue for his party than offering a solution for the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In his immigration proposal, Bush sticks to his guns on legal status, but offers red meat on \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d Oh, he also suggests that the failure of immigration reform is all part of President Obama\u2019s plan.", "title": "Why Jeb Bush\u2019s Pragmatic Immigration Plan Has No Chance of Passing in the House", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/03/Why-Jeb-Bush-s-Pragmatic-Immigration-Plan-Has-No-Chance-Passing-House", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/03/Why-Jeb-Bush-s-Pragmatic-Immigration-Plan-Has-No-Chance-Passing-House", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In his immigration proposal, Bush sticks to his guns on legal status, but offers red meat on \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d Oh, he also suggests that the failure of immigration reform is all part of President Obama\u2019s plan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe should withhold federal law enforcement funds for cities that undermine federal immigration laws,\u201d he said.\nInstead of leading the nation towards consensus, he has divided the country,\u201d Bush says.\n\u201cIt would disrupt communities and families and could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\u201dInterestingly, the campaign touts the proposal as Bush\u2019s \u201csix-point\u201d plan for dealing with immigration issues, but it\u2019s really a seven-point plan.\nOn Monday, former Florida governor Jeb Bush released his most detailed statement to date on the issue.\nHis proposal tries to make up for his relative leniency with existing undocumented immigrants with detailed proposals to toughen border enforcement."}
