Happy National Youth Enrollment Day! For weeks Obamacare advocates have been planning a final push to get young people covered, starting with today. Hundreds of events across the country will promote and serve as one-stop-shops for the exchanges. One problem: Healthcare.gov is down for enrollment. Due to a scheduled maintenance of Social Security data verification systems, users will be unable to sign up for insurance until 5 a.m. ET on Tuesday, when the outage ends.

Advocates planning events for today, including Americorps, the American Cancer Society, United Way, and Young Invincibles, say they found out about the outage just this week when the Department of Health and Human Services released the information to the public on Monday. Today was to be the deadline for insurance starting March 1, but officials have extended the deadline to Tuesday, February 18.
