The court found that the Obama administration\u2019s \u201caccommodation\u201d rule for religious organizations precluded Notre Dame from claiming its religious liberties were being violated.\n\nThe accommodation rule requires religious institutions, like Notre Dame, to notify the Department of Health and Human Services or their insurer of their objection to the contraception mandate. After their objection is certified by HHS, the health care insurer must then pay for the mandated coverage.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nNotre Dame, and other religious organizations, object to the mandate and the accommodation on the grounds that the health care plans their institutions are required to provide are still the means used to furnish abortion-inducing drugs, whether the institutions pay directly for that specific portion of the coverage or indirectly (through higher premiums, etc.).\n\nNotre Dame further argues that in order for them to follow the certification process required by HHS for the accommodation, they are still, in effect, giving the insurer the green light to provide the means to take a human life.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in reversing the 7th Circuit\u2019s decision, instructed the lower court to revisit the Notre Dame case in light of the high court\u2019s ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby last year. The circuit court ruled against Notre Dame prior to the Hobby Lobby decision. In that case, the Supreme Court decided that owners of closely-held private companies could not be required to provide abortion-inducing drugs if doing so ran contrary to their religious beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nGiven the high court\u2019s ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby to exempt business owners from the HHS mandate altogether, it seems very likely the justices will uphold Notre Dame\u2019s and other religious groups\u2019 right to be exempted, as well.\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s Vice President for Public Affairs Paul J. Brown said they are \u201cgratified\u201d by the Supreme Court\u2019s action. He said it allows them \u201cto seek relief\u201d from the policy. \u201cNotre Dame continues to challenge the federal mandate as an infringement on our fundamental right to the free exercise of our Catholic faith,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The circuit court had ruled against Notre Dame before the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision.", "author": "Randy DeSoto", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "The Supreme Court ruled...", "title": "The Supreme Court Just Did Something That Could Tear A Hole In Obama\u2019s Pet Project", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12172014_Obamas_Inquisitr.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-13T14:40:40-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/supreme-court-orders-lower-court-rehear-notre-dames-obamacare-cast/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The circuit court had ruled against Notre Dame before the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision.", "title": "The Supreme Court Just Did Something That Could Tear A Hole In Obama\u2019s Pet Project", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12172014_Obamas_Inquisitr.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-12T11:14:07-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Best Of The Week", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2015-03-12T11:14:07-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T14:40:40-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "notre dame, notre dame health care, notre dame contraception, notre dame obamacare, supreme court notre dame, supreme court orders 7th circuit to hear notre dame, notre dame 7th circuit, notre dame affordable care act, affordable care act, abortion, catholic church, hobby lobby, obamacare, supreme court, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement - story continues belowThe Supreme Court ruled Monday that the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals must rehear Notre Dame\u2019s religious liberty objections to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.\nLast year, the circuit court in Chicago upheld a lower federal court\u2019s ruling dismissing Notre Dame\u2019s suit.\nThe Supreme Court, in reversing the 7th Circuit\u2019s decision, instructed the lower court to revisit the Notre Dame case in light of the high court\u2019s ruling in Burwell v.
