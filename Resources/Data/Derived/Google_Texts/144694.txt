Health officials in Flagler County have reported its first case of leprosy in at least 15 years, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. According to health officials, the Flagler patient is an outdoorsman who was exposed to an armadillo -- which is the way most leprosy infections occur. This case follows reports of four cases of leprosy in neighboring Volusia County in recent months. Across Florida so far this year, nine cases have been reported, the News-Journal reports.
