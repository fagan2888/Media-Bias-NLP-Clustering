Asia has overtaken Europe as the world\u2019s biggest gas importer, accounting for 46 percent of global trade, according to the International Energy Agency, which cites Singapore as best-placed to be the hub for liquefied natural gas.\n\nThe country has the only LNG terminal in Asia that can reload cargoes from storage, allowing traders to store gas during low-consumption periods before selling them during peak demand seasons. It is Southeast Asia\u2019s largest receiving facility, with a capacity of 6 million metric tons a year.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chou Hui Hong", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-07/singapore-sees-lng-trading-hub-ambition-fulfilled-after-2018", "title": "Singapore Sees LNG Trading Hub Ambition Fulfilled After 2018", "description": "Singapore\u2019s political neutrality and English-speaking workforce will help the city-state become an Asian hub for LNG trading, according to the government.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Chou Hui Hong", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Singapore", "news_keywords": "Singapore", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-07/singapore-sees-lng-trading-hub-ambition-fulfilled-after-2018", "parsely-title": "Singapore Sees LNG Trading Hub Ambition Fulfilled After 2018", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-04-07T01:41:27.100Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Singapore\u2019s political neutrality and English-speaking workforce will help the city-state become an Asian hub for LNG trading, according to the government.", "parsely-tags": "Singapore,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-04-07T01:41:27.100Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-07/singapore-sees-lng-trading-hub-ambition-fulfilled-after-2018", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Singapore\u2019s political neutrality and English-speaking workforce will help the city-state become an Asian hub for LNG trading, according to the government.", "title": "Singapore Sees LNG Trading Hub Ambition Fulfilled After 2018"}, "fb": {"status": "Singapore\u2019s political neutrality and English-speaking workforce will help the city-state become an Asian hub for LNG trading, according to the government."}, "parsely-post-id": "N3G10V6TTDSQ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2a8\"", "article_summary": "Singapore\u2019s political neutrality and English-speaking workforce will help the city-state become an Asian hub for LNG trading, according to the government.\n\u201cSingapore will become a LNG trading hub within the next five to 10 years,\u201d Seah Moon Ming, chairman of government trade promotion agency IE Singapore, said in an interview on April 2.\nSingapore, Asia\u2019s oil-trading center, has spent S$1.7 billion ($1.4 billion) on its first LNG terminal.\nThe country has the only LNG terminal in Asia that can reload cargoes from storage, allowing traders to store gas during low-consumption periods before selling them during peak demand seasons.\nSingapore\u2019s location, financial system and common law system will also boost its chances of becoming a regional center, he said."}
