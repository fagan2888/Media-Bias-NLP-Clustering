(Photo: File photo)Buy Photo\n\nBe careful out there this weekend, Jersey Shore swimmers.\n\nMultiple water rescues, including one of a man near drowning in Avon, have been carried out Saturday. It seems rip currents have been keeping lifeguards busy.\n\nA 60-year-old man and another man were caught in a rip current off Garfield Avenue in Avon at about 10:15 a.m., said Tim Gallagher, borough administrator and beach supervisor.\n\nThe 60-year-old was unconscious by the time he was dragged ashore by lifeguards, who began immediately to perform CPR and other lifesaving techniques.\n\n\"After about five minutes or so, he started to respond, and by the time we got him on the ambulance he was responsive,\" Gallagher said.\n\nThe victim was taken by Avon First Aid and Rescue to Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, where he's going to be held overnight for observation.\n\nShortly after noon, a reported dozen people were pulled from the ocean at the southern end of Seaside Park. Only one person required any medical attention, according to the Ocean County Sheriff's Office, and that individual declined further treatment.\n\nAnother near-drowning was reported late this morning in Surf City, but police there couldn't provide any additional details, and it wasn't immediately clear if the incident involved the ocean.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Mount Holly predicted a moderate risk of rip currents today, which means \"that individuals planning to enter the surf should check with local beach patrols first. Be sure to swim within sight of a lifeguard, and never swim alone or at night.\"\n\nGallagher said today's rescues are a reminder to swim only on protected beaches and close to lifeguards.\n\n\u201cIf (the rescued man) was swimming after hours or at a beach with no lifeguards, he wouldn\u2019t have made it,\u201d he said.\n\nRuss Zimmer: 732-557-5748; razimmer@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1F7s1rH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Multiple water rescues, including a near drowning in Avon, have been carried out today.
