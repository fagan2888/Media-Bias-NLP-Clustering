It also supports unionization \u201cto ensure that all workers have access to benefits and protections in the workplace,\u201d the report states.\n\nAllyson Fredericksen, report author and policy analyst at the Alliance for a Just Society, states in a news release from the organization:\n\n\u201cThe answer to low wages is not expecting people to work a ridiculous number of hours, or to make severe cutbacks in basic necessities. Instead, the answer is to pay workers enough to ensure that full-time employment provides some measure of financial stability. Our research shows that\u2019s twice the current minimum wage in many states.\u201d\n\nIn Hawaii, which ranked last in the alliance\u2019s analysis of all 50 states, and Washington, D.C., a person would have to earn $21.44 per hour \u2014 or work more than 110 hours per week at minimum wage \u2014 to make a living wage.\n\nIn Arkansas, which ranked first, a person would have to earn $14.26 per hour, or work 76.1 hours per week at minimum wage.\n\nA living wage is harder for parents to come by than single people. The report states:\n\n\u201cNowhere in the country can a family with two children and two parents (who are both working) make ends meet if each working parent is paid less [than] $17.85 per hour.\u201d\n\nAre you surprised by this math?
