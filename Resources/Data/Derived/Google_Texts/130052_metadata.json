The government uses them, ostensibly for the fight against terrorism, to obtain personal information from Internet service providers, banks and other businesses that keep data on US citizens. NSLs come with a gag order that prevents companies from discussing them. Consequently, few members of the public are aware of them despite their proliferation in the ever-expanding surveillance state. A 2007 Justice Department report showed that the FBI issued nearly 200,000 NSLs between 2003 and 2006.\n\n\u201cThese letters \u2026 allow the FBI to secretly demand data about ordinary American citizens\u2019[s] private communications and Internet activity without any meaningful oversight or prior judicial review,\u201d says the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit digital-rights group.\n\nIn 2004, an NSL was issued to Calyx Internet Access, a now-defunct Internet service provider run by Nicholas Merrill. Instead of complying with the federal request for information \u2014 and the gag order \u2014 as was done by most Internet providers, such as Verizon and AT&T, Merrill chose to challenge the restriction on his constitutionally-protected free speech. For more than a decade, he sought the right to disclose the letter\u2019s contents and even its mere existence.\n\nA judge recently ruled in his favor in what is believed to be the first such victory for the recipient of an NSL. The decision means that the public is now on the verge of finding out what type of information businesses have been asked time and again to turn over to federal agents.\n\n\u201cCourts cannot, consistent with the First Amendment, simply accept the Government\u2019s assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk,\u201d Judge Victor Marrero said in his decision, referring to NSL gag orders limiting even discussion of a letter\u2019s receipt.\n\nThe EFF has been monitoring the FBI\u2019s use of NSLs for some time and won a court case in 2008. As a result, the FBI withdrew an NSL issued to the Internet Archive after two NSL-governing statutes were deemed unconstitutional.\n\nThe gag order associated with that NSL was partially removed, allowing for the discussion of the NSL\u2019s existence \u2014 but not which types of information had been requested. While the 2008 decision was a victory for privacy advocates, it was not as complete as this one.\n\nThe USA Freedom Act\n\nCalyx\u2019s win comes four months after Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which was signed by President Barack Obama on June 2. In addition to prohibiting bulk collection of US citizens\u2019s electronic data, the law also altered the language of the gag orders. Previously, the language constrained the discussion of NSLs so completely that recipients would have been in violation of the gag simply by approaching legal counsel for advice. With the passage of the legislation, recipients may now discuss the NSL with\n\n\u201c\u2026 those persons to whom disclosure is necessary in order to comply with the request; an attorney in order to obtain legal advice or assistance regarding the request; other persons as permitted by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the designee of the Director.\u201d\n\nHowever, the public may still have to wait to learn the specifics of the FBI\u2019s use of an NSL, for example which sites users visited. Although the FBI investigation that resulted in the 2004 NSL to Calyx Internet Access is officially over, Judge Marrero\u2019s decision continued Merrill\u2019s gag for 90 days to allow the government an opportunity to appeal. Such an appeal would further delay public access to the kind of information the Bureau was seeking about Internet users.\n\nJudge Rejects the old \u201cNational Security\u201d Argument\n\nWhat the judge rejected in the Calyx case was the FBI\u2019s argument that national security would be harmed by revealing the mere existence of an NSL. The government might appeal on the grounds that making public the types of information sought in NSLs would allow the targets of future investigations to better conceal their activities.\n\nBut if government investigators can order one person to provide information about another person while preventing the first person from disclosing what information they were asked to reveal or even talking about this order, the First Amendment protection of free speech stands in jeopardy. The final disposition of the Calyx case may offer a glimpse into the government\u2019s justification for using such constitutionally dubious means to \u201cfight terror.\u201d\n\nRelated front page panorama photo credit: Statue of Liberty (David Saddler / Flickr [CC BY 2.0])\n\nSpeak Truth To Power We are 100% reader funded.
