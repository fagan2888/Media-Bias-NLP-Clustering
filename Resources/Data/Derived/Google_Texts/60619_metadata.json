Because of the delay on all possible solutions, there likely will be extended enrollment caps at Brighton\u2019s two high schools and more of its elementary and middle schools for the next couple of years, he said.\n\nOfficials in the district estimate that it will be 3,000 seats short by 2018 without building another school. Denke said the bond and mill levy override would build a new high school, two additional elementary schools and finish construction of Brantner Elementary School, which opened in Thornton two years ago.\n\nThe public input process on the backup plan for alternate schedules began about a month ago. Teachers in the district suggested extended schedules, like having Prairie View and Brighton high schools open from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., and year-round calendars that would put younger students on different tracks throughout the full calendar year.\n\nMegan Mitchell: 202-954-2605, or mmitchell@denverpost.com\n\nTo attend\n\nParents of 27J students interested in attending the meeting and voting with the iClicker should RSVP to Kerrie Monti at kmonti@sd27j.org. Monti said so far, about 20 parents have registered for the meeting.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brighton school district to hold public meeting on year-round calendars", "title": "Brighton school district to hold public meeting on year-round calendars", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/02/brighton-school-district-to-hold-public-meeting-on-year-round-calendars/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140602__brighton_high_schoolp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140602__brighton_high_schoolp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-02T11:55:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:17:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce507\"", "article_summary": "School District 27J in Brighton is holding a public meeting to gauge parental support for a year-round calendar for elementary and middle school students and an extended-day schedule for high school students to widen options of addressing the district\u2019s mounting capacity crisis.\nDenke said the bond and mill levy override would build a new high school, two additional elementary schools and finish construction of Brantner Elementary School, which opened in Thornton two years ago.\nOfficials in the district estimate that it will be 3,000 seats short by 2018 without building another school.\nBecause of the limited number of iClickers, parents interested in voting must RSVP to the meeting.\nThe meeting is 6:30 p.m. June 4 at Prairie View High School at 12909 E. 120th Ave. An independent research company will host the meeting and poll 40 parents with iClicker voting devices about using alternate schedules."}
