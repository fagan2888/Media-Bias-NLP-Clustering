Many states define small businesses as having 50 or fewer employees.\n\nThe PACE Act received strong bipartisan support in Congress, with U.S. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) joining on as one of the main Senate sponsors of the bill.\n\n\u201cWith the PACE Act quickly signed into law, we have taken a great step forward in protecting small and midsize businesses from the harmful effects of Obamacare,\u201d Scott said in a statement.\n\nScott said he is still \u201ccommitted to a full repeal of the health care law, and will keep working to find solutions that put doctors and patients in charge \u2013 not the federal government.\u201d\n\nInsurers of small employers must provide 10 essential health benefits, whereas large group and self-insured plans do not have to offer those benefits. Small group insurers also have strict community rating rules, which require underwriters to only take into account age, geographic location, family composition and tobacco use when setting rates.\n\nStates still have the option to redefine small businesses to include up to 100 employees.\n\nWithout the change to the ACA, as many as 80 percent of businesses with 51-100 employees could have seen insurance rate increases, said Howard Einstein, a principal at Rosenfeld Einstein/Marsh & McLennan Agency in Greenville.\n\nEinstein said many midsize businesses didn\u2019t realize they would be affected by the change. \u201cMost of those groups were going to get clobbered and have humongous rate increases,\u201d he said.\n\nTo delay the rate increases, insurance companies were offering early renewal options that would postpone the new rates until 2017.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), another of the bill\u2019s main sponsors, said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that, in this instance, Congress rose above the partisan squabbling to make this improvement to the health care reform bill, and I hope it\u2019s a good omen for further cooperation.\u201d\n\nOne of those further reforms could be eliminating the controversial excise tax \u2013 also known as the Cadillac tax \u2013 on high-cost health plans.\n\nThe tax has come under increased criticism lately from Democrats. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made news last month when she came out against the tax. Her Democratic rival U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-N.Y.) is also against the tax.\n\nEinstein said the tax punishes people with a high number of claims or with good benefits. However, repealing the Cadillac tax could be difficult because it is one of the main ways to fund other provisions in the ACA, he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Upstate Business Journal", "description": "Last week President Barack Obama signed a rare change to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), stopping a federal mandate that insurers and business associations say would have raised insurance premiums on many businesses.", "title": "ACA change spares midsize businesses from rate increases - Upstate Business Journal", "url": "http://upstatebusinessjournal.com/news/aca-change-spares-midsize-businesses-from-rate-increases/", "image": "http://upstatebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Obama_signs_AffordableCareAct.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 12702529}, "twitter": {"domain": "Upstate Business Journal", "title": "ACA change spares midsize businesses from rate increases - Upstate Business Journal", "image": {"src": "http://upstatebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Obama_signs_AffordableCareAct.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Last week President Barack Obama signed a rare change to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), stopping a federal mandate that insurers and business associations say would have raised insurance premiums on many businesses."}}, "article_summary": "Many states define small businesses as having 50 or fewer employees.\nWithout the change to the ACA, as many as 80 percent of businesses with 51-100 employees could have seen insurance rate increases, said Howard Einstein, a principal at Rosenfeld Einstein/Marsh & McLennan Agency in Greenville.\nStates still have the option to redefine small businesses to include up to 100 employees.\nThe Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees (PACE) Act stopped the requirement that states redefine small employers as businesses having up to 100 employees.\nTo delay the rate increases, insurance companies were offering early renewal options that would postpone the new rates until 2017."}
