The agency acted \u201cin response to a rocket strike which landed approximately one mile\u201d from the airport. Jitters over the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine also probably led the agency to err on the side of caution when it comes to flights descending on the fields of battle.\n\nThe second 24-hour cancellation was cut short Wednesday night. \u201cBefore making this decision,\u201d the agency said in a release, \u201cFAA worked with its U.S. government counterparts to assess the security situation in Israel and carefully reviewed both significant new information and measures the Government of Israel is taking to mitigate potential risks to civil aviation.\u201d\n\nThe governmental ban had infuriated Israeli officials abroad as well as some of Israel\u2019s more strident domestic supporters. They cited the ban \u2014 also placed by most European countries\u2019 aviation regulators \u2014 as an overreaction that would have political ramifications in handing a victory to Hamas. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is bored and has the time and resources to do things like this, somehow got himself on a flight to Ben Gurion that arrived Wednesday morning solely to show \u201csolidarity with the Israeli people\u201d and \u201cthat it\u2019s safe to fly in and out.\u201d He added that \u201chalting flights here \u2013 when the airport is safe \u2013 hurts Israel and rewards Hamas for attacking Israel. Hamas wants to shut down the airport; we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d AIPAC offered a similarly political line in urging a lift of the ban: \u201cMoreover, we are concerned that it could have the unintended effect of encouraging terrorists to become even more committed to make civil aviation a target.\u201d\n\nAlso raging over this was Sen. Ted Cruz, last seen running border legislation in John Boehner\u2019s House of Representatives. Cruz released a statement in which he wrote, \u201cthe facts suggest that President Obama has just used a federal regulatory agency to launch an economic boycott on Israel, in order to try to force our ally to comply with his foreign-policy demands.\u201d Facts either say or don\u2019t say something, they don\u2019t \u201csuggest\u201d anything. And it\u2019s unclear what \u201cfacts\u201d he\u2019s working with here, aside from vague hand-waving about how Obama and John Kerry hate Israel.\n\nCruz went on Fox News later that night to expound with Sean Hannity:\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is the most anti-Israel administration this government has ever had,\u201d Cruz said. He asked why air traffic to Israel, rather than Pakistan, Yemen, or Ukraine was cut off. \u201cThe timing was at the exact moment Kerry was there trying to strong-arm Israel into stopping their efforts to shut down Hamas\u2019s rockets and tunnels,\u201d he continued. Essentially, Cruz argued, Obama was trying to choke off Israel\u2019s tourism industry until it consented to a Gaza cease-fire. When host Sean Hannity showed him video of a State Department spokesperson calling his accusations \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201coffensive,\u201d Cruz fired back, saying: \u201cWhat is ridiculous is the Obama Administration refusing to answer simple questions about whether this was dictated by politics.\u201d Never mind that, seconds earlier, the video showed the State spokesperson saying safety was the FAA\u2019s only consideration. Cruz announced that he\u2019d place a hold on all State Department nominees until he got the answers he wanted.
