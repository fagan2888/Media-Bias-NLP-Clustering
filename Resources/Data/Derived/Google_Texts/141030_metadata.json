The bad news, say advocates, is that many fragile people will be left with no way to get to appointments that might mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\u201cOften people have to go long distances, they feel lousy when treatment is over, and in some cases, it\u2019s to the point of being dangerous in providing their own transportation,\u201d said Jon Burkhardt, a consultant who has studied transportation for dialysis patients.\n\nThe pilot is part of a move by Medicare to require prior approvals for services and equipment associated with a high incidence of fraud, such as wheelchairs, chiropractic visits and plastic surgery. Officials said the three states were selected based on \u201chigh utilization and improper payment rates.\u201d\n\nIf cost savings are shown, the program is expected to be expanded nationally.\n\nThey\u2019re \u2026 creating a nightmare problem [for] the neediest patients.\n\nKate Kraemer, billing manager at Direct Bill Inc., which helps a Pennsylvania ambulance firm collect Medicare payments, said the demonstration will keep dialysis patients from being surprised by bills that are denied weeks after they receive the service. Those bills can range from $150 to $600 per roundtrip for three visits a week, whereas a non-ambulance trip can be as little as $25.\n\nBut Kraemer said the project doesn\u2019t do anything about the real problem \u2014 patients who don\u2019t qualify for reimbursed transportation, but who do not have friends or family to drive them and are too weak after a three-to-four hour dialysis session to drive themselves. Many cannot afford the cost of any form of transportation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re \u2026 creating a nightmare problem [for] the neediest patients,\u201d Kraemer said.\n\nSince Medicare doesn\u2019t cover non-medical transportation at all, some patients gamble that it will cover use of an ambulance \u2014 even when less expensive transportation might be more appropriate.\n\nA 2013 report by the Health and Human Services inspector general found that transports of renal disease patients to dialysis facilities increased by 1,436 percent in Pennsylvania between 2002 and 2011, by 1,129 percent in New Jersey and by 9,659 percent in South Carolina. Those figures compare to national growth rate of 269 percent.\n\nThat report didn\u2019t address the issue of fraudulent billing. But a 2010 inspector general report indicated that 20 percent of the agency\u2019s spending on nonemergency ambulance trips were improper because the ambulance company overbilled the program, or transported people who didn\u2019t need or qualify for the service.\n\nFor a patient to qualify for transportation to and from treatment under Medicare, they have to require the medical attention an ambulance provides \u2014 for instance, be confined to bed or need medical care like intravenous fluids during the trip.\n\nAmbulance providers can make 40 round trips during a 60-day period before having to submit another authorization request.\n\nMedicare doesn\u2019t pay for transportation for people who are simply too weak from treatment to drive themselves. Doctors often try to write orders for patients they think might need the service, though in many cases, the patient doesn\u2019t qualify for that level of care.\n\n\u201cSome patients who need and deserve to get the transports will find them delayed because some will get denied inappropriately,\u201d said John Howley, a New York lawyer who has worked on transportation healthcare issues. \u201cSome people will get hurt.\u201d\n\nAlaina Macia, the CEO of national transportation provider MTM Inc., based in Lake St. Louis, Mo., said that after the company implemented prior authorizations for people covered by commercial insurers, there were 10 percent to 20 percent fewer trips because people did not qualify.\n\n[See also: 1,450 hospitals penalized by Medicare.]\n\nMarsha Simon, president of healthcare consulting firm Simon & Co. in Washington, D.C., said the number of people with end-stage renal disease who need dialysis has grown \u2014 116,946 people received the diagnosis in 2010, bringing the total number of patients that year to 594,374. In 1980, about 60,000 people had an ESRD diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t get to appointments, they\u2019ll end up in the hospital at even greater costs to Medicare,\u201d Simon said. \u201cVirtually none of the claims qualify, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need help getting to and from\u201d appointments.\n\nTransport is available from some local governments, nonprofit groups and dialysis centers for people who don\u2019t qualify for non-emergency ambulance transportation. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer transportation to get to doctor appointments and treatments, but at most, those plans cover only 20 trips a year.\n\nScott Bogren, communications director of the Community Transportation Association of America, made up of public and private transportation and health entities, said the group will push for a transportation benefit in Medicare as awareness spreads about the costs of chronically ill patients missing critical appointments.\n\n\u201cOur concern for years has been that a lot of trips that aren\u2019t ideally provided in an ambulance are going in an ambulance because there\u2019s no other way to do it,\u201d Bogren said.\n\n\u201cIf something requires constant, routine transportation, the concern is that if you\u2019re not Medicaid eligible, how do you make that work?\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by Kaiser Health News with support from The SCAN Foundation.
