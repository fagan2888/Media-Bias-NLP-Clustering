SARASOTA â€” An "Old Florida Barbecue" is planned this weekend to benefit the Sarasota Adaptive Rowing Club.

The barbecue, to be held at the Casey Key Fish House, is planned from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Dec. 13. The event includes live music and a raffle.

Adaptive rowing, or para-rowing, allows athletes with physical handicaps to compete in rowing competitions under classifications that come with certain accommodations. The Sarasota Adaptive Rowing Club includes wounded service members, blind athletes and stroke survivors.

In June, the Herald-Tribune profiled Betsy Mitchell, a Sarasota resident and adaptive rower who represented the United States in the Henley Women's Regatta in England. Read her story here.
