I put the question to David Wasserman, who closely tracks House races and districts for the non-partisan Cook Political Report. His answer: Maybe, but only a minority of House Republicans would likely vote for it, and in any case, it is unlikely to get a vote in the House anytime soon \u2014 largely because of the makeup of the House GOP majority.\n\nThe most prominent proposed fix to the VRA is the bill offered by GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner and Dem Rep. John Conyers, which would restore some federal oversight over states and localities that take steps that reduce minority voting rights. In striking down the core of the the VRA on the grounds that its formula for determining federal monitoring is out of date due to racial progress, the Court called on Congress to set a new formula. But it hasn\u2019t acted to do so. Meanwhile, proponents of local voting restrictions immediately seized on the ruling to move forward with such initiatives, and voting rights advocates are still hopeful Congress will restore VRA protections, arguing that such restrictions disenfranchise minority voters.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely to happen. There\u2019s no incentive for House Republicans to act.\n\n\u201cA strong plurality of House Republicans are from the south, and their strategy has been to pack African Americans into one district across some southern states, and preserve every other district for themselves,\u201d Wasserman of the Cook Political report tells me. He adds that Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee each have one such black-heavy district, while North Carolina has two.\n\nSelma is a good example. It\u2019s in the Seventh Congressional District in Alabama, but as Wasserman notes, Republicans have \u201cdrawn every African American into the seventh district so they can have a six-to-one advantage [in the state].\u201d\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans are pretty happy with the status quo in the south \u2014 particularly the fact that packing African Americans has led to safe Republican surrounding districts,\u201d Wasserman continues. \u201cAny efforts to newly implement a pre-clearance regime could interfere with that status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans aren\u2019t going to bring something to the floor that is supported by 40 of them, but opposed by 200 of them,\u201d Wasserman says.\n\nAs E.J. Dionne notes today, voting rights is an area where Republicans can legitimately claim to have participated in historical, bipartisan reform. But 50 years later, such bipartisan action is unlikely.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\n* HOW SUPREME COURT COULD SIDE WITH OBAMACARE: It\u2019s good to see the New York Times has front-paged an article explaining that the conservative Justices could, and perhaps should, side with the government against the King v. Burwell lawsuit due to federalism concerns. The challengers\u2019 reading of the ACA would impose serious hidden consequences on the states without any clear warning, and the Justices should opt for an interpretation that doesn\u2019t raise such concerns:\n\nThe court often uses \u201cbasic principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution to resolve ambiguity in a federal statute,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in his opinion for the court in an unrelated case nine months ago\u2026.Justice Kennedy has long been a protector of the states. They need clear notice of the conditions attached to federal funds so they can \u201cguard against excessive federal intrusion into state affairs and be vigilant in policing the boundaries of federal power,\u201d he wrote in 1999.\n\nAs I\u2019ve reported, legal scholars believe Roberts and Kennedy may be susceptible to this argument, and that to side with the challengers, they would have to abandon previously stated principles. Of course, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that happening, given that this is the ACA we\u2019re talking about here.\n\n* JEB BUSH STICKS TO PUSH FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM: Over the weekend, the 2016 GOP presidential contenders appeared at an agricultural form in the crucial caucus state of Iowa, and Jeb Bush kept up his heresy on immigration:\n\n\u201cI think we need to fix this broken immigration system,\u201d Bush said. \u201cImmigrants that are here need to have a path to legalized status.\u201d Bush called for bringing immigrants who are in the country illegally \u201cout from the shadows\u201d by making them pay fines, learn English, hold jobs with provisional work permits and \u201cearn legalized status over the long haul,\u201d without receiving government assistance.\n\nOf course, the question remains whether Bush will call for achieving some kind of legal status concurrently with \u201csecuring the border,\u201d as opposed to agreeing we must accomplish the latter first. But still, it\u2019s good to see Bush forcing this discussion.\n\n* BUT REFORM IS PROBABLY DEAD IN NEW GOP CONGRESS: Politico reports that in the wake of the GOP cave on funding for Homeland Security, Republicans are not eager to take up any efforts to legislate on immigration on their own. As always, the excuse is that Obummer is to blame: \u201cif there was any question, Obama\u2019s executive actions, which are deeply despised by Republicans, likely extinguished any remaining prospects of this White House working with the GOP on immigration.\u201d\n\nWhatever. Democrats, with Obama\u2019s help, passed bipartisan reform through the Senate nearly two years ago; House Republicans have since refused to offer their own proposals. And as Republicans dithered throughout 2014, it was obvious reform would only get harder this year, not easier.\n\n* GET READY FOR MORE HOUSE GOP CHAOS: Speaking of the Homeland Security funding mess, this is only the beginning. Ashley Parker tallies up what Congress is facing in coming months, and reasonably asks whether there\u2019s any chance House Republicans can united on any of it:\n\nIn May, the Highway Trust Fund runs dry. In June, the charter for the federal Export-Import Bank ceases to exist. Then in October, across-the-board spending cuts return, the government runs out of money \u2014 and the Treasury bumps up against its borrowing limit.\n\nGreat! And so, if Congressional leaders had hoped to achieve something on tax reform and trade, you have to wonder whether there will even be time for anything other than sustained theatrics, division, and drama around the more fundamental things that have to get done.\n\n* QUOTE OF THE DAY, LUNATICS-RUNNING-THE-ASYLUM EDITION: Also in the above story, GOP Rep. Charlie Dent explains why House Republicans will continue to struggle to achieve consensus:\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have 218 votes to determine a bathroom break over here on our side. So how are we going to get 218 votes on transportation, or trade, or whatever the issue?\u201d\n\nSounds daunting! But there are plenty of Democrats in the House, too. Republicans will have to rely on them, one supposes!\n\n* AND THERE WON\u2019T BE ANY MEANINGFUL GOP \u2018FIX\u2019 TO OBAMACARE: The Hill also takes stock of all the looming must-pass stuff coming in Congress and the GOP divisions that will likely erupt around them, and adds:\n\nAmongst these deadlines, Republicans will have to find time to advance two of their biggest priorities: a replacement for ObamaCare, which will become more pressing if the Supreme Court strikes down the federal healthcare exchanges in 34 states, and tax reform. A senior Senate Republican aide said both initiatives are wending their way through the committee process. The aide predicted healthcare legislation will remain under wraps until closer to when the Supreme Court is expected to rule in King v. Burwell.\n\nMaybe. Or perhaps all this chatter of a contingency plan is merely designed to persuade the Justices that the consequences of an anti-ACA ruling won\u2019t be all that dire, thus making such a ruling more likely.
