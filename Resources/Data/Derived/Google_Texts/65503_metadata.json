The technology sends alerts through the PulsePoint App and has been online less than a week.\n\nWhen paramedics respond to an emergency call, they\u2019re often up against time. That\u2019s why JR Huebner is happy the PulsePoint App is now an option for people in Aberdeen.\n\n\u201cThe goal for us is to get people there as soon as possible, starting CPR with the hope that we can save more lives,\u201d Huebner said.\n\nPeople who know CPR and download the app on their smart phones can ask for alerts when someone near them in a public place needs CPR.\n\nWhen a 911 call comes in, technology at the dispatch center will track its location. Those within a quarter mile will get an alert, Huebner said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be great. Depending on how severe the attack or incident might be, a couple of minutes makes a huge difference,\u201d Gaylan Lang said.\n\nEven though he\u2019s an avid runner, Lang still needed a heart stint a few years ago. So he knows anyone could require CPR one day, even if they lead a healthy lifestyle. That\u2019s why he\u2019s hopeful the app will become popular with many people certified in CPR.\n\nHuebner says an ambulance response time in town with Aberdeen Fire and Rescue is three to five minutes. When someone\u2019s in cardiac arrest, he says, survival chances decrease ten percent for every minute that passes.\n\n\u201cThis just basically enhances our circle of responders that can get to the scene quicker,\u201d Huebner said.\n\nHuebner says about 100 people in the Aberdeen area downloaded the app within the first couple days of the technology being online. He\u2019s hopeful it will continue to expand.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Paramedics in Aberdeen are asking the public to help them save lives using a smart phone app. The dispatch center has technology that&rsquo;ll alert", "title": "Life-Saving App Promoted In Aberdeen", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/news/life-saving-app-promoted-in-aberdeen", "image": "http://assets.keloland.com/images/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/55518.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Paramedics in Aberdeen are asking the public to help them save lives using a smart phone app. The dispatch center has technology that&rsquo;ll alert"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec11\"", "article_summary": "Aberdeen, SDParamedics in Aberdeen are asking the public to help them save lives using a smart phone app.\nThat\u2019s why JR Huebner is happy the PulsePoint App is now an option for people in Aberdeen.\nThe technology sends alerts through the PulsePoint App and has been online less than a week.\nHuebner says about 100 people in the Aberdeen area downloaded the app within the first couple days of the technology being online.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s hopeful the app will become popular with many people certified in CPR."}
