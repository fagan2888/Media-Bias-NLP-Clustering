Krulick is running what many would consider a quixotic campaign \u2013 he\u2019s running against Republican U.S. Rep. John Mica, an established Congressman who\u2019s held his office for more than a decade. As if that weren\u2019t daunting enough, Krulick is doing it with no money and no party backing him.\n\n\u201cI raised just enough to get on the ballot,\u201d he says. \u201cI have no office, no staff, no money, but I\u2019m out here all the time, talking to people, holding my sign in traffic, and I enjoy the hell out of it. This is not the campaign I would have preferred, but it\u2019s the campaign I have. Can I win? Probably not.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not always the point for third-party candidates \u2013 those who put their names, money and reputations on the line to get their names and issues on the ballot. For some it\u2019s a legitimate attempt to get elected, despite the fact that most third-party candidates only receive a fraction of the vote, but for most, including Farid Khavari, a Miami businessman who\u2019s running as an independent in the gubernatorial race, it\u2019s more about sharing his ideas for improving the lives of Floridians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m spreading the seeds everywhere, planting the seeds and they will grow,\u201d Khavari says. \u201cAnd that is what I\u2019m doing. If I\u2019m elected, so much better, because I can do it and train people and get the right people in place and do it fast. If not, at least I have planted seeds.\u201d\n\nFollowing are some of the candidates who are trying to plant the seeds in Florida\u2019s 2014 races.\n\nFor continued elections coverage, see our Oct. 22 and 29 issues.\n\nClick on each candidate's name to visit his website.\n\nGovernor\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nParty: No party affiliation\n\nOpponents: Rick Scott, Republican (incumbent); Charlie Crist, Democrat; Adrian Wyllie, Libertarian; Farid Khavari, no party affiliation\n\n\n\nGlenn Burkett is a natural-health \u201cinnovator and educator\u201d who runs Glenn Burkett Wellness and Fitness in Fort Meyers and Naples.\n\nHe has never held public office, though he has run before. In 2005, he ran for governor as a Republican, and in 2012, he challenged U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in the Democratic primary.\n\nAt the moment, Burkett has no web presence for his campaign \u2013 his website, glennburkett.com, redirects to his business site, gb1com.com \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t appear to be doing much active campaigning. \u2013 Erin Sullivan\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nFarid Khavari (continued)\n\nParty: No party affiliation\n\nOpponents: Rick Scott, Republican (incumbent); Charlie Crist, Democrat; Adrian Wyllie, Libertarian; Glenn Burkett, no party affiliation\n\nPerhaps the candidate with the most intriguing backstory in this year\u2019s election is Farid Khavari, an Iranian-American who has lived in the United States since 1977. When asked about his motivation to run for office, he tells the story of his father, who was executed in Iran in 1980.\n\n\u201cMy father was executed after the revolution,\u201d Khavari says. \u201cWe are not Muslim, and they asked my father to denounce his religion. He would not do it, so they executed him. Then they went to my mother, and charged her for the bullet. They told her that if she would renounce her religion, she could keep her house. She would not. She walked out.\u201d\n\nLike his parents, Khavari refuses to accept ultimatums, and he\u2019s minces no words when it comes to expressing his opinions on issues that matter to voters.\n\nOn women\u2019s rights? \u201cI am especially disgusted when gray old men try to make laws to control women,\u201d he states on his website.\n\nOn marriage equality? \u201cI believe that a person has the right to love whom they wish. I believe that people have the right to marry whom they wish. I believe that discrimination against any person or group is wrong, and completely against most sacred traditions of America.\u201d\n\nOn medical marijuana? He supports it, and he thinks Amendment 2 is just the beginning.\n\nBut it\u2019s really on the economy and the environment that Khavari has much more to say: \u201cI know I can fix the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is the easiest thing in the world to do, if you know how to do it. And I know I can do it. And that is the reason I am running. I know I can fix the economy and put an end to people\u2019s suffering.\u201d\n\nKhavari believes we need to stop thinking in terms of \u201csupply side\u201d economics and deficit spending and think in terms of demand. He suggests that Florida focus on industries, such as solar power, where the state could become a leader in job creation and manufacturing. He also talks about creating products that help \u201churricane-proof\u201d houses, and other energy-saving endeavors that would help save people money, improve the environment and create what he calls \u201cSuperJobs\u201d \u2013 jobs that pay more than minimum wage.\n\nIf Khavari is so sure his plan could improve the economy and the lives of the state\u2019s residents, why doesn\u2019t he join a party and try to work from within the system to make improvements? Because, like his father and his mother, he refuses to compromise.\n\n\u201cWith certain things, I do not agree,\u201d he says. \u201cThe party dogmas \u2013 you have to be this way and that way and so on. And they think they have to tax people. I do not like taxes. We have to create jobs, middle class jobs in the private sector, to put people in a position where they can have good lives on their own.\u201d\n\nHe says he knows his candidacy is a long shot, but he thinks of it as a beginning: \u201cEvery reform starts with the first step,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I say and you say, \u2018Oh, this is a big problem, we are never going to get anywhere,\u2019 then we never will.\u201d \u2013 ES\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nParty: Libertarian\n\nOpponents: Rick Scott, Republican (incumbent); Charlie Crist, Democrat; Farid Khavari, no party affiliation; Glenn Burkett, no party affiliation\n\nOf all of the third-party candidates running for governor this year, Wyllie is the one who\u2019s receiving the most attention \u2013 and that is primarily because he recently sued to be allowed to be part of the gubernatorial debates that thus far have only been open to Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist. (On Tuesday, Oct. 14, a federal judge rejected Wyllie's suit requesting inclusion in the debate.)\n\nHis campaign thinks that is ludicrous.\n\n\u201cWe have been building momentum through grass roots for the past year and a half,\u201d says campaign manager Danielle Alexandre. \u201cBeing a third-party candidate, the media is always skeptical.\u201d\n\nUntil you reach a certain polling percentage, she says, the media (and debate organizers) tend to ignore third-party candidates; but you can\u2019t gain in the polls \u2013 or even make the polls \u2013 without attention being lavished on you by the media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle, and it\u2019s a Catch-22,\u201d she says, but Wyllie finally got a small break when a pollster from Quinnipiac finally agreed to include him in a recent poll.\n\n\u201cAnd he ended up polling at 9 percent, and everything snowballed from there,\" Alexandre says.\n\nWyllie still has to fight for inclusion, though \u2013 the major parties are generally invested in keeping third-party candidates out of the race because they tend to split the vote. Undecided voters, or voters who have qualms about their party\u2019s anointed candidate, may gravitate toward a Libertarian or independent because they like the message they\u2019re hearing \u2013 so, particularly in close races, third-party candidates can be seen as unwelcome competition, if not an actual threat in a contentious race.\n\nWyllie, who was born and raised in Dunedin, says he has a seven-point economic plan for the state, which includes dramatically cutting the state budget, reducing regulation on various industries and keeping the federal government out of Florida\u2019s economy. He is strong on gun rights, is in favor of choice in education, and would eliminate state marriage-licensing laws and leave it up to individuals and churches to determine how to handle the concept of marriage. As for social services, Alexandre says Wyllie believes in freeing up charities to be able to do more to get involved to help out in the community.\n\nFinally, she says, the most important thing the Wyllie campaign wants people to know: \u201cNobody owns your vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been voting out of fear for many years now,\u201d she says, \u201cand we\u2019ve been getting the same government every time. We have the current Republican governor against the former Republican governor, and people aren\u2019t happy with the jobs either of them has done. But in this race, you do have a third option.\u201d \u2013 ES\n\nAttorney General\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nParty: Libertarian\n\nOpponents: George Sheldon, Democrat; Pam Bondi, Republican (incumbent)\n\nPrior to the Oct. 6 televised attorney general debate between current Attorney General Pam Bondi, former assistant Attorney General George Sheldon and Libertarian outlier Bill Wohlsifer, there wasn\u2019t much information about this race\u2019s third-party option. In fact, it\u2019s been confirmed by someone close to one of those major party campaigns that Bondi would not participate in a debate with Sheldon unless Wohlsifer were there to help split the vote, or at least the impressions, with Sheldon\u2019s liberal positions.\n\nWohlsifer\u2019s performance, while at times refreshingly honest in that regular-guy way, wasn\u2019t as impressive as Bondi might have hoped. A down-the-line Libertarian, Wohlsifer seemed out of touch with most of the softball thematic lines drawn by the moderators \u2013 pill mills, marriage equality, the Affordable Care Act. He, as third-party candidates often do, played the armchair quarterback without offering much in the way of ideas about how the office of attorney general could be better used. (Wohlsifer\u2019s campaign did not return calls for this story.)\n\nBut there is a lot to like about Wohlsifer, at least according to the positions listed on his website. He\u2019s into water sovereignty \u2013 via a campaign called Hemp4Water \u2013 because, he says, industrial hemp would make for cleaner water. (He is also a supporter of medical marijuana, of course.) He\u2019s anti-fracking, pretty strong on rights restoration, typically Libertarian-likable on LGBT rights and likes to throw the term \u201ccivil liberties\u201d around when speaking about police.\n\nThings get a little hazier on gun rights (he thinks the open-carry laws in the state are too strict), labor\n\nunions (he\u2019s a \u201cstrong advocate for arbitration and mediation efforts,\u201d so, not so much for unions) and abortion (no mention of it on his site). But he also, like most Libertarians, is taking a stand against\n\nCommon Core in public education. Wohlsifer\u2019s big television moment might have raised his stakes in public recognition, but whether he is a \u201cviable candidate,\u201d as he stated in the debate, remains to be seen. \u2013 Billy Manes\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, District 7\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nParty: No party affiliation\n\nOpponents: U.S. Rep. John Mica, Republican (incumbent); Wesley Neuman, Democrat (has ceased campaigning but remains on the ballot)\n\nThis race is a bit unique, in that Wes Neuman, the Democratic challenger to incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. John Mica, has abruptly ceased campaigning. That leaves Krulick (who is a former freelancer for Orlando Weekly) as the only other active candidate in this race, even though Neuman\u2019s name will remain on the ballot.\n\n\u201cHe did the wrong thing by walking away,\u201d Krulick says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell his party, he didn\u2019t tell his supporters, he didn\u2019t tell anybody. \u2026 The Sentinel got in touch with him and confirmed that he was out of the race. I wish that he had the courage and the right thinking to take his name off the ballot.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t, which frustrates Krulick because it means that many voters will vote for Neuman simpley because he has a D after his mame. And Krulick, who\u2019s running independently but who is a registered Democrat who has volunteered time with the party, could have had some standing in this race if it weren\u2019t for Neuman. He tried to get the party to disavow Neuman, but that didn\u2019t work. So now Krulick is just out in the community, talking to people and hoping that he\u2019s motivating some of them to cast their vote for change, rather than for the initial after a person\u2019s name.\n\nKrulick says he thinks that the greatest threat to the United States (and Florida) right now is global warming. \u201cMica is a climate-change denier,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s a lackey for the fossil-fuels industry.\u201d\n\nKrulick has also long been an advocate for ending the war on drugs and for public financing for elections. \u201cWe have to get the money out of politics,\u201d he insists. \u201cWe\u2019ve ceded our ideals to the wealthy, and we need to raise the minimum wage and move to the next level of universal healthcare. We are the only industrialized nation that doesn\u2019t have it, and we spend the most per capita on healthcare, yet we are 17th in terms of services received.\u201d\n\nIf Krulick\u2019s message seems familiar, well, that\u2019s because it is: He\u2019s discussing the same frustrations that many in the progressive faction of the Democratic party have been expressing for well over a decade. And yet, in this race against Mica, there is no active Democrat on the ballot.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my fantasy,\u201d Krulick says, when asked how, if he were elected, he\u2019d manage to get things done as a party outsider in a Washington dominated by insiders. \u201cOn Nov. 5, after the votes are counted, there are 217 Democrats, 217 Republicans and me. That makes me the most powerful man in America for just one day.\n\nIf I get there, I will be a loud voice. Will whatever caucus I work with give me a big office? No, they\u2019ll probably give me a tiny office and banish me to some pointless committee. But there\u2019s still C-Span. There\u2019s still the bully pulpit. If there\u2019s room for the likes of Michele Bachmann to get up there and speak nonsense, then there\u2019s room there for Al Krulick to speak truth to power.\u201d \u2013 ES\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, District 9\n\nclick to enlarge\n\n\n\nParty: No party affiliation\n\nOpponents: Alan Grayson, Democrat (incumbent); Carol Platt, Republican; Leon Ray (write-in)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never run for office before, and I don\u2019t have plans to do so again,\u201d says Marko Milakovich, independent \u2013 extremely independent \u2013 hopeful for the District 9 seat currently held by outspoken Congressman Alan Grayson. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating because I am discriminated against by so many people and so many organizations because I\u2019m independent.\u201d\n\nWith a self-described campaign staff of \u201cmyself, my wife, my two sons and a homeless person,\u201d Milakovich will have a hard time standing up to Grayson\u2019s notorious national \u201cmoney bombs,\u201d but that\u2019s not keeping him from trying. On his website, Milakovich leads with a drawing of Alexander the Great, though he allows that his positions on issues are malleable given the presence of more information.\n\n\u201cI know that very few people will agree with all of my positions and values on the full range of topics,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut I am honest and believe it is important that you know my thinking. My viewpoints are developed based on my life-experiences and my knowledge-base on each topic. As I continue to experience more and acquire more information on each topic, my position on each topic may be modified and become more focused.\u201d\n\nFor instance, he says, he doesn\u2019t know enough about the \u201cbullet train\u201d to comment on it, even though he says he\u2019s an engineer. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go out and do some hard research,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very conservative,\u201d he adds, meaning that his positions on most issues \u2013 including marriage equality \u2013 aren\u2019t exactly nuanced: \u201cI am against same sex couples fighting to hijack that word. I believe that a \u2018civil union\u2019 between same-sex couples can provide all the same rights, privileges and obligations of a traditional \u2018married\u2019 couple. Why must same-sex couples be so divisive in wanting to use that word?\u201d\n\nAs a military veteran, he thinks that denial of gun rights to those with PTSD is discriminatory. Likewise, he thinks fracking is a good thing, the Affordable Care Act is a bad thing, increasing the minimum wage is dangerous and immigration reform means closing the borders completely.\n\nAsked to comment on his incumbent (and very liberal) competitor\u2019s handling of the position, he won\u2019t answer. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he says. \u201cI will not badmouth or discuss any other candidate, period. I\u2019m my own person. I don\u2019t like labels.\u201d \u2013 BM", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anybody on the ballot this season with more passion and frustration about the current state of affairs in politics than...", "title": "Florida\u2019s third party candidates face long odds | News | Orlando Weekly", "og": {"site_name": "Orlando Weekly", "description": "You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anybody on the ballot this season with more passion and frustration about the current state of affairs in politics than...", "title": "Florida\u2019s third party candidates face long odds", "url": "http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/floridas-third-party-candidates-face-long-odds/Content?oid=2241367", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media1.fdncms.com/orlando/imager/floridas-third-party-candidates-face-long/u/slideshow/2346533/1771528.jpg", "height": 381}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media1.fdncms.com/orlando/imager/floridas-third-party-candidates-face-long/u/slideshow/2346533/1771528.jpg"}, "description": "You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anybody on the ballot this season with more passion and frustration about the current state of affairs in politics than...", "site": "@orlandoweekly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Florida\u2019s third party candidates face long odds"}, "oid": 2241367, "fb": {"app_id": 1527160917534695}, "keywords": "News, Blog, Culture, Dining, Events", "google-site-verification": "s4GBlkstS6PKQwO_gDlOGL8jFPmeuL_d3m60wxOBQR0", "thumbnail": "http://media1.fdncms.com/orlando/imager/floridas-third-party-candidates-face-long/u/slideshow/2346533/1771528.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "news, blog, culture, dining, events"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd70a\"", "article_summary": "Probably not.\u201dBut that\u2019s not always the point for third-party candidates \u2013 those who put their names, money and reputations on the line to get their names and issues on the ballot.\nIf not, at least I have planted seeds.\u201dFollowing are some of the candidates who are trying to plant the seeds in Florida\u2019s 2014 races.\nWyllie still has to fight for inclusion, though \u2013 the major parties are generally invested in keeping third-party candidates out of the race because they tend to split the vote.\nHe, as third-party candidates often do, played the armchair quarterback without offering much in the way of ideas about how the office of attorney general could be better used.\nAs if that weren\u2019t daunting enough, Krulick is doing it with no money and no party backing him."}
