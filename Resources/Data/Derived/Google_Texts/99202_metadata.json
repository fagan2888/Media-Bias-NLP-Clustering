Investigators believe Gomez is traveling with her 16-year-old boyfriend, Spencer Linville, and two other male teens.\n\nThe four were allegedly riding in a stolen vehicle when officers chased them through Washington and Morgan counties. Officers found that vehicle abandoned in Weld County on Thursday.\n\nGomez was last seen near Roggen, shortly before the group allegedly stole a light blue Chrysler Town and Country minivan with Colorado license plate 876WZS.\n\nGomez is an insulin-dependent diabetic who takes insulin five times a day.\n\nHer medication was found in the stolen vehicle that was abandoned in Weld County.\n\nAuthorities requested an alert about the teenager because without her medication, she may begin to have seizures.\n\nGomez is about 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighs 150 pounds and has blue eyes. Police say her hair may now be black.\n\nInvestigators say the group may be en route to Riverside, Calif.\n\nAnyone with information about the teenagers is asked to call their local authorities.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado officials looking for 15-year-old runaway girl accused of crime spree", "title": "Colorado officials looking for 15-year-old runaway girl accused of crime spree", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/27/colorado-officials-looking-for-15-year-old-runaway-girl-accused-of-crime-spree/", "image": {"width": 492, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__breanna_gomezp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__breanna_gomezp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-27T07:38:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:16:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd159b\"", "article_summary": "The four were allegedly riding in a stolen vehicle when officers chased them through Washington and Morgan counties.\nHer medication was found in the stolen vehicle that was abandoned in Weld County.\nBreanna Gomez ran away from her home in Eau Claire, Wis., on Monday night, according to a news alert from the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nAuthorities are looking for a diabetic 15-year-old runaway girl from Wisconsin and her companions, accused of stealing two vehicles and leading police on a chase across two northeast Colorado counties.\nOfficers found that vehicle abandoned in Weld County on Thursday."}
