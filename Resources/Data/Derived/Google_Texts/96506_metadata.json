Her walk and housekeeping chores are the 68-year-old\u2019s only exercise, and her weight has remained stubbornly over 200 pounds for some time now.\n\n\u201cYou get to a certain point in your life and you say, \u2018What\u2019s the use?\u2019\u201d\n\nFor older adults, being mildly overweight causes little harm, physicians say. But too much weight is especially hazardous for an aging body: Obesity increases inflammation, exacerbates bone and muscle loss and significantly raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\n\nTo help the 13 million obese seniors in the U.S., the Affordable Care Act included a new Medicare benefit offering face-to-face weight-loss counseling in primary care doctors\u2019 offices. Doctors are paid to provide the service, which is free to obese patients , with no co-pay. But only 50,000 seniors participated in 2013, the latest year for which data is available.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s the perfect storm of several factors,\u201d says Dr. Scott Kahan, an obesity medicine specialist at George Washington University. Kahan says obese patients and doctors aren\u2019t aware of the benefit, and doctors who want to intervene are often reluctant to do so. It\u2019s a touchy subject to bring up, and some hold outmoded beliefs about weight problems and the elderly.\n\n\u201cIt used to be thought that older patients don\u2019t respond to treatment for obesity as well as younger patients,\u201d Kahan says. \u201cPeople assume that they couldn\u2019t exercise as much or for whatever reason they couldn\u2019t stick to diets as well. But we\u2019ve disproven that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, one study found two out of three older patients lost 5 percent or more of their initial weight and kept it off for two years.\n\nWeight loss specialists place the blame for poor awareness of the new benefit on the federal government\u2019s decision to limit counseling to primary care offices.\n\n\u201cThe problem with using only primary care providers,\u201d says Bonnie Modugno, a registered dietician in Santa Monica, California, \u201cis that they completely ruled out direct reimbursement for the population of providers who are uniquely qualified and experienced working with weight management. I think that was a big mistake.\u201d She was referring to registered dieticians like herself, as well as specialists such as endocrinologists, who might be managing a person\u2019s diabetes, and cardiologists, who monitor patients with heart disease. Both conditions can be caused by or made worse by excess weight.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Aging,Medicare,Syndicate,The Health Law", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "A little known part of Obamacare pays primary care doctors to help overweight seniors drop pounds and improve their health.
