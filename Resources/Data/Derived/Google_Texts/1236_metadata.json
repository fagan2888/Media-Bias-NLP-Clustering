(Photo: Corbis)\n\nThe latest census data released today (Sept. 16) shows that the percentage of people without health insurance was 10.4 percent lower than the number of uninsured in 2013.\n\nWhile 41.8 million, or 13.3 percent of Americans, were without health insurance in 2013, that number dropped to 33 million \u2014 10.4 percent of Americans \u2014 in 2014.\n\nThat\u2019s 8.8 million more people who have health insurance coverage year over year.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2013, the uninsured rate was relatively stable, despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In 2014, though, the uninsured rate sharply decreased, with the percentage of people with health insurance coverage in 2014 spiking to 89.6 percent.\n\n(Image: U.S. Census Bureau)\n\nThe 2014 numbers show that age is strongly associated with the likelihood that a person has health insurance. In 2014, 98.6 percent of adults aged 65 years or older had some type of health insurance during the year, compared with 93.8 percent of children and young people younger than 19, and 85.7 percent of working-age adults ages 19 to 64 years.\n\n(Image: U.S. Census Bureau)\n\n\n\nHowever, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that at least 27 million Americans will be uninsured every year for the next 10 years. And the stakes are high: A study in the American Journal of Public Health showed in a given year, there are 1,000 deaths for every 1 million people that are related to lack of insurance.\n\nWhat the Census Bureau report neglects to mention is that for some people, just because they have insurance doesn\u2019t mean they can afford to use it, due to high deductibles and co-pays, says Robert Zarr, MD, president of Physicians for a National Health Program.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem called underinsurance \u2014 when people have skimpy policies with high deductibles and copays, that leaves them with high out-of-pocket expenses for ealth care.\n\n\u201cA recent study by the Commonwealth Fund shows that about 31 million people who have health insurance \u2014 nearly a quarter of all insured non-elderly adults \u2014 are underinsured, nearly double the rate in 2003,\u201d Zarr says. \u201cOf these, 44 percent went without a doctor\u2019s visit, medical test, or prescription due to cost, while 51 percent had problems paying off medical bills or were paying off medical debt over time.\u201d\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just because you\u2019re insured doesn\u2019t mean you can afford health care, experts say.
