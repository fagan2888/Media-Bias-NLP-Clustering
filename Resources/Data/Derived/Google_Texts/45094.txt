The Boulder County Coroner's Office on Sunday identified a homeless man who was found dead early Saturday a short distance from the Pearl Street Mall as 27-year-old Daniel Kitlitz, of Boulder.

Kitlitz went to sleep Friday night behind 1425 Pearl St., in the north alley, according to Boulder police. When friends checked on him at about 6:45 a.m. Saturday, he was unresponsive, and his friends called for medical assistance. He was dead at the time emergency personnel reached him.

The coroner's office is still investigating the cause and manner of his death.

He is the fifth homeless person to be found dead in Boulder since the beginning of April.
