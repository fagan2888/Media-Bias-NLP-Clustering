Whether or not you agree with the Affordable Care Act politically, you might be wondering what your health insurance options will be under this new law, particularly if you don't get insurance from your employer.

Jessica Hembree, program officer at the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, and Sandy Praeger, Kansas insurance commissioner, join us to answer questions about the new health insurance marketplaces in Kansas and Missouri.

The marketplaces go live at healthcare.gov on October 1. Open enrollment closes March 31. Coverage can begin as soon as January 1.
