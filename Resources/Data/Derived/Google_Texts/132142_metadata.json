(By Chase Cook / Staff)\n\nPlaster's campaign strategy is similar to Hogan's: Focus on the economy.\n\nAnother thing that Plaster borrowed from the Hogan camp is the RV. The governor drove around in a black bus, bringing it with him to campaign stops and parking it at events.\n\nPlaster said he thought it was necessary when driving around District 3, a fragmented area stretching across the eastern portion of the state. The Annapolis resident said the RV was a personal purchase for business. It has been wrapped for the campaign.\n\nHe wouldn't disclose how much he paid for it. The inside has a leather interior with a small kitchen and a back office with extending walls.\n\n\"It was either (the RV) or making five campaign offices across the district,\" he said.\n\nWhile some of Plaster's strategies are similar to Hogan's, he isn't running for a seat that would have as direct an impact as the governor.\n\nLast week the governor announced the closure of the Baltimore City Detention Center, a long contentious state-operated facility with a history of corruption.\n\nA freshman representative, on the other hand, probably wouldn't be able to do much in the first year or so \u2014maybe even the in first term.\n\nPlaster is aware of this, admitting that he doesn't have any legislation drafted or even plans for legislation if elected. He touted Republican staples of small business support, jobs and fixing health care.\n\nHis style is similar to that of the other elected candidates who don't want to be career politicians.\n\nSet a philosophy and follow that.\n\n\"The issues I'm most passionate about are federal issues,\" Plaster said. \"It's about having a voice in Congress.\"\n\nHe also plans to focus on medical legislation, using his experience as an emergency room doctor and publisher of a medical journal. Plaster said doctors and business owners have been crunched under the Affordable Care Act and rising health care costs.\n\nOne such business owner is Jim Blankenship, Linthicum resident and owner of Blankenship Electric. Blankenship volunteers to drive the RV for Plaster, moving it around the district as the campaign ramps up.\n\nHe said Plaster has his support because he is \"sick\" of career politicians, and he believes the Republican would benefit his small business and others around the state.\n\n\"We don't need anymore career politicians,\" Blankenship said.\n\nWhere do you park it?\n\nPlaster's RV is large. So finding a place to park the beast can be a challenge. So far Plaster said he has moved the vehicle around the state, trying to get permission when leaving the RV overnight.\n\nHowever, he recently ran into a problem when the RV was parked on Lindale Middle School property in Linthicum. Campaigning is not allowed on school property except on sanctioned days.\n\nSince other cars used the property during off hours, Blankenship and Plaster thought it was OK to park the RV there. Once they learned of the complaint, Plaster said they moved the vehicle.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Another Maryland Republican candidate hops on the bus wagon", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Capital Gazette", "author": "Capital Gazette", "og": {"site_name": "capitalgazette.com", "description": "A black recreational vehicle has been rolling through Maryland's broken-winged pterodactyl district \u2014 otherwise known as District 3 \u2014 that some say is the nation's most gerrymandered.", "title": "Another Maryland Republican candidate hops on the bus wagon", "url": "http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ph-ac-cn-plaster-for-congress-0801-20150803-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55bf67c1/turbine/ph-ac-cn-plaster-for-congress-0801-20150803", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.10", "twitter": {"site": "@capgaznews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Maryland Mark Plaster Governor Larry Hogan Linthicum Anne Arundel County", "fb": {"page_id": 324858467568005, "app_id": 290392664473911}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-03", "Description": "A black RV has been rolling through Maryland's broken-winged pterodactyl district \u2014 otherwise known as the third district and some say most gerrymandered.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Maryland Mark Plaster Governor Larry Hogan Linthicum Anne Arundel County"}, "article_summary": "\"We will definitely see a strong number of Republican candidates in this election,\" said Diana Waterman, Maryland Republican chairwoman.\nHis style is similar to that of the other elected candidates who don't want to be career politicians.\n\"We don't need anymore career politicians,\" Blankenship said.\nMaryland Republican Party officials said they think there is more interest in conservative campaigns in Maryland, where Democrats have a 2-to-1 voter advantage.\nMark Plaster Campaign Bus By Chase Cook / Staff Harwood resident Dr. Mark Plaster sits in his RV Thursday while talking about his District 3 Congressional campaign."}
