You put a spell in someone\u2019s mind\u2026 it\u2019s a pretty effective thing.\u201d What determines if the spell cast is of a metal variety, or jazz, or rock, or country? A new study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America may have the answer.\n\nAccording to study researchers, our perception of music can be boiled down to nine elements: speed, rhythmic clarity, rhythmic complexity, articulation, dynamics, modality, overall pitch, harmony, and brightness (if it\u2019s dark or light). This rivals existing models used to predict an individual\u2019s preference for certain genres, which analyze audio signals, musical elements, musical genre, as well as resulting emotions: happy, sad, and tenderness. The nine elements at the center of the present study are also known as perceptual features, and it\u2019s these features researchers predict offer a better understanding of the music people like compared to computational models.\n\n\u201cGetting a group of people to agree on anything having to do with music is \u2014 as any DJ can attest \u2014 not easily done,\u201d the press release from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology prefaced. \u201cBut by focusing on nine key features of music, the team was able to find some commonalities in perception that could prove useful.\u201d\n\nThe team at KTH conducted an experiment on 20 people, in which they listened to 100 ringtones and 110 snippets of music featured in film. Then, participants rated what they heard based on the aforementioned perceptual features. Essentially, these features reflect how non-musicians try to understand what they\u2019re listening to, thus what they do or don\u2019t like. And for the most part, researchers found the focus on perceptual features generated more agreement among participants than traditional models.\n\n\u201cThe nine perceptual features work, and the test subjects\u2019 own references and cultural differences do not matter,\u201d lead study author Anders Friberg said. \u201cWe could take 20 new volunteers, and the result would be the same.\u201d\n\nFriberg is saying the reason traditional models don\u2019t often show musical commonalities is because non-musicians don\u2019t approach music the same way musicians do; music theory is lost on those who don\u2019t study it. For example, in this study, speed is one of the perceptual features. In musical theory, this is known as tempo, or the amount of notes in a given time. Non-musicians easily associated speed with movement, whereas they struggled to infer this from a word, like tempo.\n\nWhen music can be easily approached and understood, it's easier to see the commonalities otherwise muddied by musical jargon.\n\nSource: Friberg A, Schoonderwaldt E, Hedblad A, Fabiani M, Elowsson A.
