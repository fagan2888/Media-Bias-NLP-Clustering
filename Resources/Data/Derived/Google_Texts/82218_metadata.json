(Brandon Hopper/Daily Record)\n\nFlorence \u2014 A huge sigh of relief could be heard in Florence early Sunday.\n\nThe Colorado High School Activities Association released the 2A playoff brackets Sunday, and the Huskies were given the No. 14 seed. Florence (5-4) will travel to play No. 3 Strasburg (9-0) for a 1 p.m. game Saturday.\n\nThe two teams matched up in a thrilling first-round game last year in Florence, which the Huskies prevailed in.\n\n\"We'll trade spots,\" Huskies head coach Jeremy Nix said. \"They came here last year, we'll go over there this year.\n\n\"If I remember right, they had some really good kids. They've probably got the same kids back.\"\n\nNix said that he remembers from last year's playoff game that Strasburg did a lot of misdirection and was very disciplined.\n\n\"I'm sure they haven't changed much,\" he said.\n\n\"From the scores, it looks like they have a pretty dang good D, they don't allow a lot of points. We've got our work cut out for us.\"\n\nThe Tri-Peaks League sent four teams into the playoffs. League champion Lamar got the No. 4 seed and will host No. 13 Eaton. St. Mary's is the No. 10 seed and will travel to No. 7 Montezuma-Cortez, and La Junta, the league's runner-up is the bracket's No. 15 and will go to undefeated No. 2 Kent Denver.\n\nThe Florence-Strasburg winner will play the winner of the No. 6 Platte Valley-No. 11 Bennett game. If Platte Valley and Florence win, Florence would host that second-round game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn last year's Florence-Strasburg first-round playoff game, then-junior Erikk Wollman intercepted a pass in the endzone with four seconds left to preserve Florence's 26-20 win.\n\nAs the No. 8 seed in that game, the Huskies hosted the No. 9 Indians.\n\nFlorence hasn't missed the playoffs since 1997, which was Nix' senior year.\n\nBrandon Hopper: 719-276-7644, hopperb@canoncity dailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_26801198/florence-huskies-football-into-playoffs", "modificationDate": "2014-10-26T10:58:49-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1026/20141026_095610_3-DSC_7237-387_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By BRANDON HOPPER   hopperb@ canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "The Colorado High School Activities Association has released the Class 2A playoff football field, and the Florence Huskies are in it.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26801198:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-26T09:30:21-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_26801198/florence-huskies-football-into-playoffs", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1026/20141026_095610_3-DSC_7237-387.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Colorado High School Activities Association has released the Class 2A playoff football field, and the Florence Huskies are in it.", "title": "Florence Huskies football makes playoffs as 14 seed; to play undefeated Strasburg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "The Colorado High School Activities Association has released the Class 2A playoff football field, and the Florence Huskies are in it.", "title": "Florence Huskies football makes playoffs as 14 seed; to play undefeated Strasburg", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_26801198/florence-huskies-football-into-playoffs", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1026/20141026_095610_3-DSC_7237-387.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-26T09:30:21-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2014-11-09T08:30:21-0700", "sailthru.title": "Florence Huskies football makes playoffs as 14 seed; to play undefeated Strasburg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By BRANDON HOPPER", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1026/20141026_095610_3-DSC_7237-387.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-10-26T09:32:05-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfed6\"", "article_summary": "Lane Masar during the Florence Huskies' game against the Lamar Savages on Friday in Lamar.\nNix said that he remembers from last year's playoff game that Strasburg did a lot of misdirection and was very disciplined.\nThe two teams matched up in a thrilling first-round game last year in Florence, which the Huskies prevailed in.\nAdvertisementIn last year's Florence-Strasburg first-round playoff game, then-junior Erikk Wollman intercepted a pass in the endzone with four seconds left to preserve Florence's 26-20 win.\nIf Platte Valley and Florence win, Florence would host that second-round game."}
