(MIRROR) — American doctors have designed an advanced super computer which can predict the likelihood of a person’s death with almost 100% accuracy.

The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston has linked up all its poorly patients to the machine, which is said to be better at spotting illnesses than human doctors.

It is loaded with information about more than 250,000 people from the past 30 years, drawing on this data to make speedy diagnoses.

This speedy disease recognition could allow a quick cure, potentially saving lives as well as predicting patients’ imminent demise.
