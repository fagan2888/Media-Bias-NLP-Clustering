If you do not curently have health insurance, you have until Sunday to sign up for a plan- or pay a penalty.

Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, all Americans are required to have health insurance.

January 31 is the deadline to sign up for this year.

"All the plans have to cover some basic needs- prescription drug care, preventative care, hospital visits, mental health services,” said Chris Keck with Enroll America. “And it's important for folks to know that if they don't have health insurance in 2016, they're subject to a fine of either $695 or 2.5 percent of their income."

But free help is available through the weekend to help you and your family to decide which plan meets your needs, and get you registered.

"We're here to help them from Point A to Point Z,” said Noi Nanthavongdouangsy with Cognosante, contracted by the State to help people enroll. “We're state-certified and certified through the center of Medicaid and Medicare services as well. So we're federally certified to make sure that they have the smoothest experience possible."
