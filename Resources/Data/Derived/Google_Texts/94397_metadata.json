As presidential candidates look to portray themselves as Washington outsiders, the lobbying industry has emerged as a common, easy target.\n\nLobbying consistently ranks at the bottom of Gallup\u2019s survey of the most honest and ethical professions, highlighting voters\u2019 distaste for the industry. But lobbying firms rank high on the list of fundraising stops for presidential hopefuls. Earlier this year, Bush headlined fundraisers at lobby shop BGR Group and at the Washington offices of trade group National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. In May, several lobbyists hosted a \u201cMojitos with Marco\u201d fundraiser for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker courted K Street donors at an event organized by the American Beverage Association\u2019s Kevin Keane and BGR Group\u2019s Bob Wood.\n\nDespite raising millions from lobbyists, many 2016 presidential hopefuls are using a message that then-candidate Barack Obama used in 2008, decrying lobbyists and vowing not to be influenced by special interests. Obama\u2019s campaign, however, went a step farther and rejected lobbyist contributions, and later on, the president barred lobbyists from working for the administration (eventually, the ban was lifted for several lobbyists through a waiver). None of the candidates this time around has gone that far, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from using the Obama-esque rhetoric \u2014 even though many have ties to lobbyists.\n\n\u201cPower and money and political influence have left a lot of Americans lagging behind,\u201d said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in his announcement speech. Huckabee\u2019s daughter and campaign manager, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has worked for lobbying and consulting firm Tsamoutales Strategies.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley echoed the message in his kickoff address. \u201cPowerful, wealthy special interests here at home have used our government to create \u2014 in our own country \u2014 an economy that is leaving a majority of our people behind,\u201d he said. \u201cAn economy that has so concentrated wealth in the hands of the very few that it has taken opportunity from the homes of the many.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, former New York Gov. George Pataki has repeatedly called for lobbying reform. \u201cThe first thing I would do is ban members of Congress from ever lobbying,\u201d he said in May. \u201cIf you serve one day, you are banned, go home.\u201d\n\nEven Donald Trump singled out lobbyists in declaring his White House bid. \u201cSo I\u2019ve watched the politicians. \u2026 They will never make America great again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even have a chance. They\u2019re controlled fully \u2014 they\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s main holding company, Trump Organization, had four lobbying firms on retainer from 1998 to 2001. Trump himself has given $1.4 million in political contributions since 2008.\n\nBut as voters grow increasingly frustrated with Washington, turning their backs on their wealthy D.C. friends \u2014 at least on the stump \u2014 is a calculation many candidates have been willing to make.\n\n\u201cBashing lobbyists has always been very popular,\u201d said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for Public Citizen, a reform group that works on campaign finance and government ethics issues. \u201cIt has an inherent appeal to voters, but the hypocrisy this election is breathtaking.\u201d\n\nSeveral lobbyists who have actively raised money for presidential hopefuls said they\u2019ve become such predictable punching bags that the negative comments have no effect on their decisions about campaign donations, especially since no candidate has announced plans to shun lobbyists like the Obama campaign did.\n\nMany of those supporting Bush said they didn\u2019t notice the former governor\u2019s criticisms of the industry, even though they listened to his speech. Some also stressed that they\u2019re the \u201cwhite hat\u201d lobbyists and not the ones the candidates are calling out.\n\n\u201cA sound bite in a speech won\u2019t change anything,\u201d said Ron Kaufman, a Bush backer who is senior strategic adviser at McKenna Long & Aldridge and former senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign.\n\nBush\u2019s campaign, which appears to have the most K Street support among Republicans, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, however, has focused more on decrying political spending than lobbyists.\n\nWith her extensive Washington background, as a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, it is difficult for Clinton to position herself as a Beltway outsider without seeming disingenuous. Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s opponents from both parties say they are not certain she would crack down on special interests.\n\n\u201cI do have doubts that Hillary Clinton or any Republican out there will take on big-money special interests,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in April, citing that as one of the main reasons he was considering a White House bid. Sanders, who later announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination, has gathered momentum in recent early-state polls.\n\nBut, having learned her lesson from her previous bid, Clinton won\u2019t be defending lobbyists anytime soon.\n\nIn discussing her decision to accept lobbyists\u2019 contributions at a Chicago event in 2007, Clinton was booed when she said: \u201cA lot of those lobbyists, whether you like it or not, represent real Americans. They represent nurses, they represent social workers, yes, they represent corporations that employ a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAlso, in going negative on lobbyists, Clinton could risk comparisons to Obama. Several Democratic lobbyists, whose political fundraising was sidetracked during the Obama era, are expected to help Clinton\u2019s campaign and allied outside groups bring in $2 billion.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has a long history of taking on tough fights against special interests, whether or not they\u2019re donors to her campaigns,\u201d Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said when announcing that the campaign would accept contributions from lobbyists.\n\n\u201cShe strongly supports campaign finance reform and has voted for tough lobbying reform, but as long as Republican groups and candidates are going to spend millions attacking Hillary, we need the resources to fight back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Presidential candidates assail lobbyists but also willingly take cash from them.", "title": "Lobbyists: Easy target, easy touch", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/lobbyists-easy-target-easy-touch-119263.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/21/150621_jeb_bush_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,2016 Elections,Jeb Bush,Lobbying,White House,Martin O'Malley 2016,Martin O'Malley,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Presidential candidates assail lobbyists but also willingly take cash from them.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0210\"", "article_summary": "As presidential candidates look to portray themselves as Washington outsiders, the lobbying industry has emerged as a common, easy target.\nIt didn\u2019t matter that just days before, Bush had slammed the lobbying industry in his announcement speech.\nThey represent nurses, they represent social workers, yes, they represent corporations that employ a lot of people.\u201dAlso, in going negative on lobbyists, Clinton could risk comparisons to Obama.\nMeanwhile, Clinton\u2019s opponents from both parties say they are not certain she would crack down on special interests.\nDespite raising millions from lobbyists, many 2016 presidential hopefuls are using a message that then-candidate Barack Obama used in 2008, decrying lobbyists and vowing not to be influenced by special interests."}
