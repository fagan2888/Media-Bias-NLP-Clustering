The settlement was likely substantially less than that.\n\nThe settlement had been expected after U.S. District Judge John Antoon ruled against Adventist's motion to dismiss the suit. It had been scheduled for trial this month.\n\nThe plaintiffs Amanda Dittman, a bill-coding and reimbursement compliance officer, and Dr. Charlotte Elenberger, a radiologist, filed the suit in 2010.
