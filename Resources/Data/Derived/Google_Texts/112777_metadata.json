Coming on the heels of a major Trump victory in New York, and just days before he is expected to do very well in five more states that vote next Tuesday, the memo has a bit of a whistling-past-the-graveyard quality to it.\n\nThe release from the Our Principles PAC said, \u201cDespite Trump\u2019s victory in New York on Tuesday night, he still has a nearly impossible path to secure the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot. As a consequence, we are confident that there will be an open convention \u2013 and that Trump will not be the Republican nominee.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fearing Trump, More Republicans Are Skipping the Convention\n\nThe well-funded PAC has received million-dollar contributions from wealthy donors including TD Ameritrade founder J. Joe Ricketts, his wife Marlene Ricketts, hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer and investment banker Warren Stephens. Its primary mission appears to be taking down Donald Trump.\n\nUnfortunately for that effort, however, the PAC\u2019s assertions about Trump\u2019s current status in the race are not obviously correct.\n\nFor example, while Trump\u2019s path to a 1,237-delegate majority before the convention in July is not an easy one, it is far from \u201cnearly impossible.\u201d Various analysts have sketched out multiple potential routes to the majority. None is a completely clear path, but Trump has plainly made the decision to invest more money and to hire more competent personnel as the race nears the finish line.\n\nAnother problem with the Our Principles memo is the assumption that Trump arriving at the convention with less than 1,237 automatically translates into a contested convention -- that\u2019s contested in the sense of there being multiple ballots in the candidates\u2019 efforts to secure a majority.\n\nRelated: Does a Tamer Trump Risk Losing His Mojo?\n\nBut in Cleveland, many delegates will show up with no obligation to vote for any specific candidate. If Trump falls short of 1,237 bound delegates but come close, he and his campaign will have more than a month between the final primaries on June 7 and the convention to make his case to them, and as former Republican nominee Mitt Romney pointed out earlier this week, Trump has many means of persuasion at his disposal.\n\nOur Principles may have a lot of money, but the group can\u2019t buy its own reality. Stopping Donald Trump from securing a first-ballot nomination is far from being a done deal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A group opposing the candidacy of billionaire Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination says his path to a majority of delegates to the nominating convention is \u201cnearly impossible\u201d and that an open convention is a virtual certainty.
