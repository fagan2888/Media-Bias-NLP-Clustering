The responsibility is now firmly on providers to forge ahead in implementing the necessary actions that will allow them to compete in the new environment, no matter how difficult they may seem, Schreiner said.\n\n\u201cThere is a natural tension about what technology, services and advice to buy versus what to build internally,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause healthcare has to be continuously improved, it behooves organizations to have some infrastructure built within their four walls, along with workflow engineering and process standardization in order to improve outcomes and patient experience.\u201d\n\nValue of collaboration\n\nAs one of the healthcare industry\u2019s major group purchasing organizations, Charlotte, N.C.-based Premier has long touted the financial advantages of belonging to a collective.\n\nWithin the value-based purchasing context, providers can gain tremendous leverage with their VBP programs as part of a larger collaborative, said Richard Bankowitz, MD, chief medical officer for Premier.\n\n\u201cBy using a common set of measurements, everyone knows how the other is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe share best practices for 365 members to find pockets of excellence.\u201d\n\nThrough an initiative called QUEST, providers within the Premier collaborative have seen costs flatten and 62 percent have generated positive financial results within the value-based purchasing model, Bankowitz said. A recent Premier-Dartmouth study revealed that sharing best practices and benchmarking performance created improvements on several fronts, he said.\n\n\u201cWe focused on hospitals that got better quickly and what we found was they had leadership visibly involved, they used all the data and held people accountable,\u201d Bankowitz said. \u201cThey were able to establish a methodology of quality improvement.\u201d\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nProvider organizations that are not members of the Premier GPO can still participate in QUEST and other performance improvement programs, such as Quality Cycle Management, said Scott Pope, Pharm.D., vice president of quality and safety solutions.\n\n\u201cQCM dovetails into what is happening with QUEST,\u201d he said. \u201cIt opens up a culture, technology and way of doing business. It includes important elements of executive focus, tied back to revenue cycle management and brings in best practices in the same way, showing hospitals their metrics around value-based purchasing.\u201d\n\nBecause it has a dashboard view, QCM shows organizations their current performance and what they can expect if they keep everything the same, Pope said. Through a group-oriented approach, providers can more easily find the direction they are looking for and benefit from the security it provides, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t join QUEST, join something,\u201d Pope said. \u201cTake advantage of a learning environment.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/value-models-move-ahead-healthcare-many-organizations-getting-left-behind", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare%20cost%20-%20feature_1.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The most difficult challenges to value-based reimbursement reside within the cultural and operational sides of the business, and not technology, experts say.", "title": "As value models move ahead in healthcare, many organizations getting left behind"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare%20cost%20-%20feature_1.png"}, "title": "As value models move ahead in healthcare, many organizations getting left behind", "description": "The most difficult challenges to value-based reimbursement reside within the cultural and operational sides of the business, and not technology, experts say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "When viewing healthcare\u2019s transition to a value-based purchasing model, providers that haven\u2019t taken the critical steps forward may be intimidated and paralyzed with indecision because of all the moving parts involved.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "When viewing healthcare\u2019s transition to a value-based purchasing model, providers that haven\u2019t taken the critical steps forward may be intimidated and paralyzed with indecision because of all the moving parts involved.\nWithin the value-based purchasing context, providers can gain tremendous leverage with their VBP programs as part of a larger collaborative, said Richard Bankowitz, MD, chief medical officer for Premier.\n\u201cThere are more impactful foundational changes that need to happen in delivery systems to improve the cost of care and improve outcomes,\u201d Schreiner said.\nThe most difficult challenges to value-based reimbursement reside within the cultural and operational sides of the business, and not technology, experts say.\n\u201cThere is a natural tension about what technology, services and advice to buy versus what to build internally,\u201d he said."}
