But there are a couple of other big rulings. And we know court rulings at the Supreme Court are small, but the ones that are coming up on Monday are pretty important. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about that.\n\nMARCIA COYLE, THE NATIONAL LAW JOURNAL: Absolutely, Hari.\n\nThere are three cases that are left. There is a very important case involving the environment and the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate mercury emissions from electric power plant. In that case, it\u2019s a question of whether the EPA, the federal agency, should have considered the cost of its regulation before deciding whether to regulate the mercury emissions.\n\nThere\u2019s a second case that\u2019s very important in terms of how states \u2014 state legislatures, in particular, reapportion congressional districts. Arizona created an independent commission to do the redrawing of district lines following each census. And it did that because, as we\u2019ve seen all around the country, redistricting has become a very partisan effort in state legislatures.\n\nThe Arizona state legislature challenged the use of an independent commission, claiming that it violated the elections clause in the federal constitution, claims that that clause gives the authority, the right to state legislatures to redraw district lines.\n\nAnd, finally, the death penalty, which is never far from the Supreme Court\u2019s docket. This is a case involving lethal injection, and a particular drug, Midazolam, that was used by Oklahoma not too long ago, as a replacement drug for the drug in its three-drug protocol that is usually used to make someone unconscious while the other two drugs are administered.\n\nOklahoma used Midazolam, as a substitute, and we saw reports how far the drug really didn\u2019t make someone \u2014 make the death row inmate unconscious long enough for the other drugs to be administered. And in some cases, the execution lasted \u2014 one execution 20 minutes, in others the inmate was seen to gasp, and in another, the inmate actually talked and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nSo, a challenge has been brought to the use of that particular drug, and we will get a decision I believe on Monday as to whether that \u2014 the use of that drug is cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Looking back at the cases, just the high-profile cases, the Affordable Care Act and the gay marriage case, what was interesting was Chief Justice Roberts in his votes, one direction in one case, and another direction in the other case. He\u2019s really become one of the more surprising justices.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: If we take away anything from this particular term, it is that even though the court has a five-yesterday conservative majority, those five conservatives are not all the same, just as not all Democrats are the same or all Catholics are the same. They have different approaches to how they interpret statutes, how they read the Constitution. And we saw that play out in the health care case, as well as same-sex marriage.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, while these two cases might be win for liberal thought, liberal ideology, this doesn\u2019t make an entire season or an entire court.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: No, it doesn\u2019t, Hari, and I think we have to be cautious about labeling the court, OK, so now we\u2019ve had two liberal \u2014 huge liberal-leaning decisions. This is a liberal Supreme Court. I really believe that each term tells its own story, depending on the makeup of the cases, the mix of cases, that come to the court and end up on its docket.\n\nI can remember during the Rehnquist years that there were some terms that were left-leaning, other terms that were right-leaning. This term, the cases that came played out to the left side of the court.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right. Marcia Coyle from \u201cThe National Law Journal\u201d \u2014 thanks so much.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Oh, my pleasure, Hari.
