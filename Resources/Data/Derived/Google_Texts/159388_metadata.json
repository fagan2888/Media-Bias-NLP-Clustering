On the positive side, your Medicare costs are remaining stable and in some cases are coming down.\n\nRead on to learn more.\n\nSocial Security: You'll be getting (a little) more\n\nYou're getting a 1.5% raise this year, one of the smallest bumps since 1975.\n\nBut at least it's better than the zero increase seniors got in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe adjustment, which is based on the Consumer Price Index, will add about $19 to your monthly checks, bringing the average benefit to $1,294.\n\n\"Individuals have to really carefully watch how they spend their money and make some tough decisions,\" Laura Bos, manager of financial security at AARP, told the Daily News.\n\nPayroll taxes: some will see a bigger bite\n\nThe payroll tax - which funds Social Security - will remain at 6.2%. (The payroll tax holiday, which cut the Social Security tax in 2011 and 2012 to 4.2%, ended last year)\n\nBut the annual wage cap on the Social Security payroll tax - the amount of your salary that gets taxes - is going up to $117,000 from $113,700.\n\n\"It's the same percentage, on a slightly higher cap,\" Bos said.\n\nMedicare costs: Looking good\n\nMost people will pay be paying $104.90 a month in Part B premiums for their medical insurance, the same as in 2013. The Part B deductible will also remain flat at $147 per year.\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act you can tip your hat to more affordable drug coverage.\n\nThe donut hole - the gap in prescription drug coverage when individuals must pay for their drugs - is shrinking by $80, though many are likely to fall into it sooner this year.\n\nThe gap is going from $2,970 to $4,750 in 2013 to a smaller $2,850 to $4,550 in 2014.\n\nYou'll be getting a 28% discount on generic drugs this year, up from 21% in 2013.\n\n\"The prescription drug donut hole is closing,\" said Paula Muschler, operations manager for the Allsup Medicare Advisor plan selection service.\n\nThe average monthly premium for a Part D plan is going up by 5% to $39.90, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nKnow your limits on earnings from employment\n\nIf you plan to retire before the Social Security full retirement age - it's 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954 - you can't earn more than $15,480 a year from employment without losing $1 in benefits for every $2 you earn, said Bankrate.com.\n\nThe year you reach full retirement age, the limit on earnings before your actual birth date rises to $41,400.\n\nAfter the month you reach full retirement age, there is no limit on how much you can make while collecting Social Security checks, Bankrate said.\n\npfurman@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "PHYLLIS FURMAN", "twitter": {"description": "You\u2019re never too old to do some math, especially if you're planning to retire this year or are already in your golden years.
