Some world leaders and journalists seem to think so. For example, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah recently said at a news conference that \u201cwe are facing a Third World War against humanity,\u201d and that we must \u201cact fast to tackle the response to interconnected threats.\u201d Similarly, Roger Cohen at the New York Times wrote a poignant article in which he draws a number of parallels between the Syrian war and the beginning of World War I. And last September, Pope Francis visited a military cemetery in Italy and warned that \u201cperhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal, with crimes, massacres, destruction.\u201d\n\nThe idea that World War III has started isn\u2019t crazy \u2014 although neither is it obviously true. The fact is that the Syrian conflict is an international tangle of competing interests and strange alliances. Russia and Iran, for example, both support the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Meanwhile, the U.S. supports the Kurds and Syrian rebels fighting against al-Assad\u2019s forces. The U.S. is also leading a coalition of over 60 countries, and France recently started its own coalition to fight the Islamic State, as did Russia. Making matters even more complicated, Turkey is fighting against the Kurds, and the Syrian rebels are receiving additional help from Jordan, Turkey and the Gulf states.\n\nThese are just the state actors \u2014 there\u2019s also a number of nonstate entities engaged in this conflict. For example, the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah is on the side of Syria, Russia, and Iran, while the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra is fighting to topple Assad\u2019s regime and replace it with an Islamic government. There have also been numerous Shia militia roaming around Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led preemptive invasion, including the Mahdi Army and the Promised Day Brigade. According to the former director of the CIA, David Petraeus, such militias constitute an even greater longterm threat to the region than the Islamic State.\n\nAnd then, of course, pretty much everyone is at war with the Islamic State, which has grown into the largest and best-funded terrorist organization in human history. It now controls a huge area of real estate in Iraq and Syria (on which some 5 million people live), and has affiliates in countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Libya, and Nigeria. This juggernaut of terrorism has also attracted foreign fighters from countries as geographically distant as Denmark, Ireland, Australia, and the US. While its initial aim, after rising to prominence in 2014, was to establish a strong caliphate in Iraq and Syria, it recently expanded its strategy by bombing a Russian commercial plane over the Sinai Peninsula and perpetrating the Paris attacks that left 130 people dead.\n\nSo, this is clearly an international war \u2014 and a messy one at that. But it\u2019s not the first conflict of the sort since World War II. The Cold War involved countries from around the globe, divided into the Eastern and Western blocs, and the Korean War can be seen as a proxy war between the U.S. and China, backed by the UN and Soviet Union, respectively. Furthermore, the Second Congo War, which is sometimes dubbed the African World War, involved nine African nations and roughly twenty different militias. Our global village has witnessed multiple international confrontations in the seven decades since 1945. The Syrian war is just another in this series.\n\nBut there is something that makes the Syrian war unique. Whereas many of the conflicts after World War I were driven by differences in political and economic ideologies \u2014 think fascism, communism, and liberal democracy \u2014 the war in Syria involves several actors that appear to hold genuinely apocalyptic worldviews.\n\nThe Islamic State is perhaps the most obvious example. As the U.S. General Martin Dempsey noted during a 2014 press conference, the Islamic State is motivated by \u201can apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision\u201d according to which its current leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is the eighth of 12 caliphs in total before the world ends. It also believes that a grand battle \u2014 essentially Armageddon \u2014 between the Muslims and \u201cRomans,\u201d i.e., the Western forces, will soon occur in the small Syrian town of Dabiq. This is why the Islamic State \u201cfought ferociously\u201d for control of Dabiq in 2014, despite its military insignificance, and it\u2019s why the Islamic State named its online propaganda magazine Dabiq. Each issue of this magazine opens with the quote: \u201cThe spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify \u2014 by Allah\u2019s permission \u2014 until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.\u201d For the Islamic State, the Syrian war is one stage in an apocalyptic narrative that\u2019s unfolding before our very eyes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Apocalyptic worldviews and non-state actors make the wars in Syria and on terror all the more dangerous", "title": "Is this how World War III begins?
