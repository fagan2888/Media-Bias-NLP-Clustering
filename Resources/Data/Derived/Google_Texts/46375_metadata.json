It\u2019s that struggle that makes her so watchable, and that carries the movies.\n\nThat\u2019s good, because there\u2019s a lot that doesn\u2019t add up in the latest entry, \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,\u201d which adapts the first half of the third and final book in the enormously popular Hunger Games series of young adult novels.\n\nThe story picks up shortly after the second film left off: Katniss, after sabotaging the murderous games at the heart of her society\u2019s dystopian social order, has been whisked away by the resistance to a secret buried city: District 13, a low-lit, utilitarian bunker that looks like a cross between an airport, a dorm and a cafeteria.\n\nOnce there, she becomes the Mockingjay \u2014 a symbol of the rebellion, cast in propaganda films designed to spur on the resistance of the other districts, which are, for all practical purposes, slaves to the rich, elitist denizens of the Capitol.\n\nNewcomers will likely be lost, but even casual viewers may find themselves with nagging questions about the series\u2019 lore. The political and economic structures employed by the Capitol, led by the malevolent President Snow (a delightfully icy Donald Sutherland) to control the outer districts, never really make sense.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "My review of the third Hunger Games movie, from The Washington Times: Jennifer Lawrence&nbsp;is as much the hero of \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d as is her on-screen", "title": "Peter Suderman Reviews The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/11/21/peter-suderman-reviews-the-hunger-games", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_11/-lionsgate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "My review of\nthe third Hunger Games movie, from The Washington\nTimes:\n\nJennifer\nLawrence&nbsp;is as much the hero of \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d as is\nher on-screen alter ego Katniss Everdeen, the sullen, brave,\nself-obsessed, self-sacrificing protagonist at the center of the\nmovies.\nOn paper, the character doesn\u2019t make much sense,\nbut&nbsp;Ms.\nLawrence&nbsp;does a maste", "title": "Peter Suderman Reviews <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1</em>", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_11/-lionsgate.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Policy", "published_time": "2014-11-21T21:45:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd032\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s good, because there\u2019s a lot that doesn\u2019t add up in the latest entry, \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,\u201d which adapts the first half of the third and final book in the enormously popular Hunger Games series of young adult novels.\nMy review of the third Hunger Games movie, from The Washington Times:Jennifer Lawrence is as much the hero of \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d as is her on-screen alter ego Katniss Everdeen, the sullen, brave, self-obsessed, self-sacrificing protagonist at the center of the movies.\nOn paper, the character doesn\u2019t make much sense, but Ms. Lawrence does a masterful job of turning the script\u2019s creations into an unruly and fascinating character.\nIt\u2019s easy to accept those contradictions, even when they don\u2019t seem to add up, because Ms. Lawrence seems to be struggling with them as well, slowly coming to terms with the mess of who she is.\nNewcomers will likely be lost, but even casual viewers may find themselves with nagging questions about the series\u2019 lore."}
