Florida Rep Calls Texas 'Crazy' In ObamaCare Row

VIDEO: Florida Democrat Calls Texas "Crazy"

In what was a decidedly uncivil display, two sitting members of Congress engaged in a war between the states Monday night.

The row began over a discussion on whether the House should prepare a bill to repeal ObamaCare.

Republicans in the hearing had railed against Democrats for the unique, parliamentary methods used to pass ObamaCare five years ago. Democrats, however, countered that the current legislation to repeal ObamaCare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, hasn't been through a hearing or markup, the part of the process where they write the bill, in the new Congress.

That's when the ruckus began between Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., and Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas.

"I think what the American people would think is they don't want this (debate)," Hastings said. "I believe in your state ... which I believe is crazy to begin with --"

That remark prompted a banging of the gavel from Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., who was chairing the meeting of the House Rules Committee, telling Hastings that Burgess would be allowed to respond.

"I reclaimed my time," Hastings protested. "The time is mine."

Burgess interjected.

"He made a statement about my state," said the normally reserved congressman. "I will not sit here and listen to it."
