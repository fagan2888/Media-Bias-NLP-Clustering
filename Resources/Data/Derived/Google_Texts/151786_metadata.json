For two of the insurers, income increased despite slight losses in the number of members.\n\nMore Information Health plans by the numbers Plan Members Change REvenues change net income change from 2014 from 2014 from 2014 CDPHP 448,000 -1%$2.3B 5% $41.9M 213% MVP 700,000 none$2.9B none $42.3M 441% HealthNow 399,000 -7% $2.2B -8% $64.0M 221% Sources: Health insurers\n\n\"The hard work we've done, diversifying our product portfolio and reducing administrative costs by more than $30 million in two years, has had a significant impact on our bottom line,\" said Chris Del Vecchio, chief operating officer at Schenectady-based MVP Health Care.\n\nMVP earned $42.3 million on revenues of $2.9 billion, a 441 percent increase in net income when compared to the previous year's loss of $12.4 million.\n\nThe health insurer has in recent years increased its offerings through government programs, including through Medicaid and New York State of Health, the online market established under the federal Affordable Care Act. The insurer has also ventured into more contracts in which doctors and other providers are paid a set fee per month per member, rather than for each service provided.\n\nAlbany-based CDPHP earned $41.9 million on revenues of $2.3 billion last year, reversing a loss of $37.2 million in 2014, a 213 percent increase. Administrative costs have been reduced to historic lows, according to CDPHP CEO John Bennett.\n\nBennett reiterated a warning he has issued over the last several years.\n\n\"While we are pleased to have turned the corner, we are cautiously optimistic as the industry continues to battle substantial increases in state and federal regulations, as well as escalating costs, notably on the pharmaceutical and hospital side,\" Bennett said.\n\nHealthNow, the Buffalo-based parent of BlueShield of Northeastern New York of Latham, earned $64 million on revenue of $2.2 billion last year, reversing the previous year's loss of $53 million, a 221 percent increase.\n\nThe health insurer was able to improve its performance by raising some prices to reflect the real cost of policies, according to Jared Gross, HealthNow's senior vice president. That resulted in the loss of some members, especially in Medicare, which provides coverage primarily to seniors, who often require the most costly medical care.\n\nIn the Capital Region, another cost saver resulted from paying less to doctors and other providers, said Kirk Panneton, regional executive at BlueShield.\n\nThe insurer's previous agreements with doctors had been more generous than its competetitors, Panneton said.\n\nchughes@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5417", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Meeting their own predictions, area health insurers finished 2015 in the black, on the heels of a year or two of multimillion-dollar losses as they changed their operations to adjust to new rules established through the federal Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.  \"The hard work we've done, diversifying our product portfolio and reducing administrative costs by more than $30 million in two years, has had a significant impact on our bottom line,\" said Chris Del Vecchio, chief operating officer at Schenectady-based MVP Health Care.
