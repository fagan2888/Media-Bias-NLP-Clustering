It also applies to the much smaller group paying attention to Harvard Business School professor Ben Edelman, caught bullying small-business owners in the Boston area.\n\nIndeed, it would be funny in a pathetic sort of way, if it weren\u2019t so illustrative of our incredible shrinking elites and so instructive of the mind-set that progressives have developed over the past generation or so. Once, it took a Woodrow Wilson to believe he was smarter than the Founders and knew better than \u201caverage\u201d Americans how their constitutional system should operate. Now it takes merely a Jonathan Gruber, who won\u2019t admit under oath to Congress that he was paid millions of dollars to distort a clear understanding of Obamacare.\n\nSimilarly, what to make of a man privileged enough to attend Harvard University as an undergraduate, graduate student, and law student, and then to obtain a lifelong teaching position in Harvard Business School, and who then uses his legal training to squeeze a few measly dollars out of a family-run Chinese restaurant (and a sushi restaurant before that). Ben Edelman went full-lawyer on a takeout place over four whole dollars; the average associate-professor salary at Harvard is more than $120,000 a year (and probably more for HBS professors).

Being tenured at Harvard or called into the Oval Office gives one a sense of invulnerability and a presumption that the rules don\u2019t apply to you.\n\nAll this matters, not because these are the personal peccadillos of a few petty egomaniacs, but because these are the type of people forming the iron triangle of the government-corporate-academic elite in America today. Credentialism and pedigree (conferred often for holding the \u201cright\u201d opinions) get one invited into the fraternity of the socially powerful, which is a lifetime appointment, revocable only for making the type of stupid mistakes now bedeviling both Gruber and Edelman.\n\nWhich is why they both looked like deer in the headlights when caught. Who knows what actually went through Gruber\u2019s head when he spilled the beans and displayed the contempt he and Obamacare\u2019s crafters held for the American voter and our political process. But you can be sure he never thought twice that he would be held to account for his comments. After all, he had been the man in the room, possessed of far more knowledge than those not fortunate enough to see just how the political game was played.

Does anyone doubt that, absent the public dissemination of his e-mails, he would have pressed ahead in his quixotic attempt to receive triple \u201cdamages\u201d for incorrectly listed prices for egg fu yung or chicken chow mein?

The iPhone and Twitter are stripping away the thick walls that used to hide what was said and done in oak-paneled conference rooms or the hothouse of a Cambridge, Mass., apartment. This process is just beginning and will take time to gather enough steam to have an effect on our politics, but it is unstoppable.\n\nThe knowledge that nothing is private anymore may lead our great and powerful to have as little candor in private as they do in public.

One reason for the attitude of today\u2019s elites is that they are almost never held accountable for their opinions or utterances.
