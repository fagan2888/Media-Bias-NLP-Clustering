The production, led by director Peter Sellars, features singers who interact with each other on a minimalist set as they dramatize the last days of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re in a theater production,\u201d said Lincoln Center\u2019s artistic director, Jane Moss. \u201cIt does not remotely feel like a staged concert. I was so knocked out.\u201d\n\nMonika Rittershaus Mark Padmore as the Evangelist in the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s production of \u2018St. Matthew Passion.\u2019\n\nAfter seeing the production in 2010, she began talking to the Philharmonic about bringing it to New York, and it turned out the orchestra was scheduled to open Carnegie Hall\u2019s 2014-2015 season. The venue, however, is not big enough to contain this version of the \u201cPassion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a production that can be done in a concert hall,\u201d said Clive Gillinson, executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall. \u201cThis is a properly theatrically produced event.\u201d\n\nThis blockbuster version of the \u201cPassion\u201d can, however, fit within the Park Avenue Armory\u2019s 55,000-square-foot Wade Thompson Drill Hall. This production, created by Mr. Sellars, who also directed John Adams\u2019s 20th-century opera \u201cNixon in China\u201d met it came to the Metropolitan Opera in 2011, calls for singers and some orchestra members to walk around.\n\nIn some cases, they perform with dramatic movement on a round, central stage, with a few blocks as props. This makes it unlike most staged concerts, where soloists stand in one place.\n\nTo achieve the unusual staging requirements, organizers will build an arrangement of the orchestra\u2019s hall in Berlin\u2014\u201ca stage installation inspired by the Philharmonie,\u201d said Ms. Moss\u2014for the two-night event.\n\nMost of the lead roles will be sung by artists who performed this production already in Berlin, with the notable exception of Eric Owens, a critically lauded American baritone who sang the part of Alberich at the Met.\n\nFor the Carnegie Hall portion of the Philharmonic\u2019s series, the orchestra will perform on the first night with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The following concerts will include a complete cycle of Schumann symphonies and the U.S. premier of a new work of composer Georg Friedrich Haas, who was jointly commissioned by Carnegie Hall and the Philharmonic.\n\nThe full programming for the concerts and Carnegie Hall\u2019s 2014-2015 season will be announced in January.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Berlin Philharmonic will play Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d in New York next year, but it will likely feel right at home: a stage designed to reflect its hometown theater will be built within the Park Avenue Armory.", "title": "Berlin Philharmonic Plays \u2018Passion\u2019 in New York", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/09/berlin-philharmonic-plays-passion-in-new-york/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AS293_NYBERL_G_20131209133133.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Berlin Philharmonic Plays \u2018Passion\u2019 in New York", "description": "The Berlin Philharmonic will play Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d in New York next year, but it will likely feel right at home: a stage designed to reflect its hometown theater will be built within the Park Avenue Armory.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Pia Catton", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The Berlin Philharmonic will play Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d in New York next year, but it will likely feel right at home: a stage designed to reflect its hometown theater will be built within the Park Avenue Armory.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-09T21:00:39-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/09/berlin-philharmonic-plays-passion-in-new-york/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19285", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Berlin Philharmonic will play Bach\u2019s \u201cSt. Matthew Passion\u201d in New York next year, but it will likely feel right at home: a stage designed to reflect its hometown theater will be built within the Park Avenue Armory.", "title": "Berlin Philharmonic Plays \u2018Passion\u2019 in New York", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/12/09/berlin-philharmonic-plays-passion-in-new-york/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AS293_NYBERL_G_20131209133133.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19285", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-10T04:12:58-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb108\"", "article_summary": "Matthew Passion\u201d in New York next year, but it will likely feel right at home: a stage designed to reflect its hometown theater will be built within the Park Avenue Armory.\nThe following concerts will include a complete cycle of Schumann symphonies and the U.S. premier of a new work of composer Georg Friedrich Haas, who was jointly commissioned by Carnegie Hall and the Philharmonic.\n\u201cThis is a properly theatrically produced event.\u201dThis blockbuster version of the \u201cPassion\u201d can, however, fit within the Park Avenue Armory\u2019s 55,000-square-foot Wade Thompson Drill Hall.\nFor the Carnegie Hall portion of the Philharmonic\u2019s series, the orchestra will perform on the first night with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter.\nI was so knocked out.\u201dMonika Rittershaus Mark Padmore as the Evangelist in the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s production of \u2018St."}
