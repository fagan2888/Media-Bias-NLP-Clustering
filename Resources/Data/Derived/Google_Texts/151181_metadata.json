Since the ACA passed in 2009 various stages of proposals throughout the nation have ranged from single-payer like incarnations to more consumer driven approaches. States can begin applying for the waiver in 2017. But there are limits.\n\nAHIM Director Cheryl Smith Gardner told the committee and re-iterated afterward that for a waiver to be approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services certain conditions of coverage must be met.\n\n\u201cCoverage has to be budget neutral, has to be at least as comprehensive\u2026but there\u2019s wiggle room in what is comprehensive\u2026and you have to cover as least as many people as would have been covered under the ACA,\u201d said Smith Gardner.\n\nA 40 plus page report was compiled by AHIM and their consultant, Public Consulting Group, titled Section 1332 Waivers and the Future of Arkansas Healthcare Innovation and presented to the committee. The five year waivers allow major pillars of the ACA to be adjusted or all together removed as long as a state can prove it can use federal dollars as effectively. Eliminating the individual mandate, employer mandate, exchanges, subsidies, and a host of other changes could be possible, as long as certain coverage levels obtained by ACA policies and programs are maintained.\n\nRich Albertoni with PSC walked legislators through some of the major changes possible under a 1332 waiver and possible combinations with other waivers to the Medicaid program - like Arkansas used in 2013 to create the private option adaptation of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe way the boundaries are largely drawn right now is by income,\u201d said Albertoni. \u201cI think in Medicaid what we\u2019ve seen in the private option already is that health status or work readiness are also categories that could be useful ways to redefine these sorts of things. Maybe if folks are low income but are seeking jobs in the market they could be better served in the marketplace instead of through the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nState Senator David Sanders, the committee\u2019s co-chair, said what he characterizes as successes in the private option - Arkansas\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion - informs the direction the state should take when crafting a 1332 plan.\n\n\u201cSome of the things that we\u2019ve done through our premium assistance program, known as the private option, we\u2019ve proven some things that had yet to be proven. That is to say, that premium assistance has worked,\u201d said Sanders.\n\nThe Republican legislator said shifting more people covered under federally-run health plans to privately-run plans is a tenant for his vision of Arkansas healthcare under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI am very much in favor of a consumer based model. I fundamentally believe as a matter of policy we make the wrong decision when we tell poor people, you are going to be segregated into a Medicaid program and excluded from the private insurance markets. That has what has informed me since day one,\u201d said Sanders.\n\nBut he acknowledges there is work to be done both in terms of crafting a plan and building support by 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s settled for some in terms of the mode that we\u2019re going to provide for care,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cBut if you come to that place where you say coverage is important then you can have the debate about what level of coverage, and how much should it cost, and what can we do to drive down the cost and deliver quality care.\"\n\n\u201cI have some members from our Republican caucus that are actually arguing going back to a fee for service based system which was originally contemplated in the affordable care act and not to a premium assistance model which has been the iron-clad conservative proposal for decades,\u201d said Sanders.\n\nThe number of chairs filled by legislators by the meeting\u2019s end suggests disseminating the intricacies of uncharted state relationships with the federal healthcare apparatus among state legislators is a long-term task. All of it is on the pretense that the expanded population of people covered and receiving coverage support under the ACA receive and equitable level of care in a state crafted plan. For some Republicans in the committee like Rep. Josh Miller it has at least in the past been difficult to accept any continuation of the ACA.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "A section of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 called a 1332 waiver \u2013 is being hailed by one of the legislative architects of the private option and the director", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/state-customization-affordable-care-act-horizon", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201505/photo.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "A section of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 called a 1332 waiver \u2013 is being hailed by one of the legislative architects of the private option and the director", "title": "State Customization Of Affordable Care Act On Horizon"}, "story_id": 408364090, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarkauffman"}, "author": "Jacob Kauffman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "State Customization Of Affordable Care Act On Horizon"}, "nid": 41822, "datePublished": "2015-05-20", "keywords": "Arkansas Politics, Arkansas Healthcare", "wordCount": 954, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace Legislative Oversight Committee turned its attention on Wednesday to the \"State Innovation Waiver.\"\n\u201cSome of the things that we\u2019ve done through our premium assistance program, known as the private option, we\u2019ve proven some things that had yet to be proven.\nThe Republican legislator said shifting more people covered under federally-run health plans to privately-run plans is a tenant for his vision of Arkansas healthcare under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe number of chairs filled by legislators by the meeting\u2019s end suggests disseminating the intricacies of uncharted state relationships with the federal healthcare apparatus among state legislators is a long-term task.\nThe federal healthcare law allows states some flexibility through the 1332 waiver to use federal dollars to build alternative healthcare delivery systems."}
