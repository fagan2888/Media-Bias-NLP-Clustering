Adding insult to injury, they are being told that their healthcare is being terminated because of the law. This is just happening in my district; it\u2019s a trend we\u2019re seeing nationwide.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick followed up with a letter to President Obama expressing grave concerns about the Sesame Place situation, noting that the president promised that consumers that if they liked their existing coverage, they could keep it. Fitzpatrick also asked the president to postpone the individual mandate by one year inasmuch as he already postponed the employer mandate until 2015. Fitpatrick\u2019s letter said he continues to favor a repeal and replace for Obamacare because \u201cthe law is hurting real people in my district and around the country.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the healthcare exchange software \u201ccan\u2019t reliably determine how much people need to pay for coverage, according to insurance executives and people familiar with the program\u2026 \u2018There\u2019s a blanket acknowledgment that rates are being calculated incorrectly,\u2019 said one senior health-insurance executive who asked not to be named. \u201d The federal government paid a contractor $88 million to develop the software. The healthcare exchanges or marketplaces where uninsured persons will shop for coverage are supposed to be up and running in five days.\n\nAlthough the employer mandate as noted above has been postponed for one year, many employers around the country have put their hiring plans on the back burner, or have decided to downgrade workers into part-time status, to avoid the Obamacare mandate entirely that applies to companies with 50 or more full-time workers. Obamacare defines full-time work as 30 or more hours per week.\n\nInsurers have already warned of steep insurance premium increases flowing from Obamacare implementation. Some covered businesses have already reached the conclusion that it might be more cost effective to drop employee health coverage completely even for full-time workers and pay the Obamacare employer penalty instead when it kicks in.\n\n[Image via Featureflash / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obamacare implementation reportedly means that employees of a Sesame Street theme park -- including presumably whoever plays Big Bird there -- will lose", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Obamacare implementation reportedly means that employees of a Sesame Street theme park \u2014 including presumably whoever plays Big Bird there \u2014 will lose", "title": "Obamacare Cancels Big Bird\u2019s Health Insurance?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/969085/obamacare-cancels-big-birds-health-insurance/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Big-Bird-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-26T19:47:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-26T23:44:18+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Big-Bird-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-09-26T19:47:03+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,big bird,big bird health insurance,bucks county pennsylvania,congressman mike fitzpatrick,healthcare reform,seaworld,sesame place,sesame street,business", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Big-Bird-670x409.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Obamacare implementation reportedly means that employees of a Sesame Street theme park \u2014 including presumably whoever plays Big Bird there \u2014 will lose"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddea\"", "article_summary": "The company also announced, however, that it was ending health insurance coverage for part-time and seasonal employees in 2014 because the insurance plan does not comply with the Obamacare minimum coverage requirements..\nThe Obamacare implementation reportedly means that employees of a Sesame Street theme park \u2014 including presumably whoever plays Big Bird there \u2014 will lose their healthcare coverage and will be shifted to healthcare exchanges.\nInsurers have already warned of steep insurance premium increases flowing from Obamacare implementation.\nFitzpatrick also asked the president to postpone the individual mandate by one year inasmuch as he already postponed the employer mandate until 2015.\nThe healthcare exchanges or marketplaces where uninsured persons will shop for coverage are supposed to be up and running in five days."}
