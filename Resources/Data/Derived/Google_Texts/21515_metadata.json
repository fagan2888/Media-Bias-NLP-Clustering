Noting the corporations and Koch brothers arrayed against organized labor, Durazo paraphrased boxer Mike Tyson: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a plan until I hit \u2018em in the face.\u201d\n\nDiversity\n\nPrior to the convention\u2019s formal convening, about a thousand delegates, activists and allies gathered Sunday morning for a mini-conference on inclusion in the labor movement. Approval of three resolutions regarding diversity also made up the main business of the convention\u2019s opening session Sunday afternoon. In both venues, a slew of speakers emphasized twin themes. First, as AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler told delegates, that greater inclusion was not just \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d but rather, \u201cfor the labor movement to survive and thrive our leadership has to reflect the changing face of America.\u201d And second, in the words of outgoing Executive Vice-President Arlene Holt Baker, that \u201cwe\u2019ve come along way\u2026but none of us will say we\u2019ve come far enough.\u201d\n\nUnited Mineworkers of America President Cecil Roberts, who chaired the convention\u2019s Credentials Committee, announced in the afternoon session that a record-high 46 percent of the convention\u2019s delegates were women or people of color, up from 43 percent in 2009, and urged a standing ovation for the progress. (That figure means that 54 percent of this year\u2019s delegates are white men; research by UC Berkeley Labor Policy Specialist Steven Pitts suggests that about a third of all union members are white men.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/trumka_ap_fb_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Josh Eidelson", "description": "The Los Angeles gathering of the AFL-CIO included high-profile Democratic guests, soul-searching about diversity, and signs of a coming floor fight.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "The Los Angeles gathering of the AFL-CIO included high-profile Democratic guests, soul-searching about diversity, and signs of a coming floor fight.", "title": "What Counts as a Workers\u2019 Issue?
