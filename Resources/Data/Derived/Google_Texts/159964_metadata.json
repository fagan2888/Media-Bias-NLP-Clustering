In fear, she bought some life-ending drugs, and in July this year, she gave an account in these pages of the challenges of living with poison hidden behind the bags of salad in the fridge. That was about the time that Lord Falconer\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying received its second reading in the House of Lords.\n\nJo\u2019s health has deteriorated quickly since then. But though the time to use it must be close, the poison has never felt more out of reach.\n\nIs it fear that is stopping Jo from choosing to use the drugs, which once offered reassurance but now seem to ask for too much strength? Or has she found a different kind of succour \u2013 in the form of Annie Lister, an independent cancer and palliative care expert with 30 years\u2019 experience?\n\nWhen Annie first met Jo in late spring, Jo had a detailed plan for her death, and Annie had \u201ca long in the tooth\u201d palliative carer\u2019s belief that legalised assisted dying might be \u201cthe start of a slippery slope\u201d. After all, Annie\u2019s life\u2019s work has been to soothe difficult endings. But the intensity and intimacy of Jo and Annie\u2019s conversations have lifted the debate out of a moral maze and made it a matter of personal friendship. Over the past five months, Jo and Annie have travelled so far towards each other emotionally and intellectually that both have changed their minds about what makes a good death. While Annie has become more sympathetic to the idea of legalised assisted dying, Jo has chosen to confront the approach of death with palliative care. Both agree that legalised assisted dying would open up the debate and allow people in Jo\u2019s situation to speak openly with friends, family and carers.\n\nThese days, Jo says, the drugs \u201care not in my thinking\u201d. She is lying back in bed, hands above her head, now and then tousling her hair. Annie is sitting in a wicker chair beside the adjustable bed that has been installed in the lounge \u2013 a sign of how time has overtaken Jo\u2019s old worry that the stairs might complicate the journey from fridge to bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a drug I\u2019m not sure about. Doing it alone is almost performing an aggressive act. I can find my own way around it, but actually if I had to go to the fridge, my friends would be shitting themselves. I would be shitting myself. I\u2019m so weak. It requires too much fear. Too much from me emotionally. The poison has been an amazing companion. But once you get nearer to the real decision, it\u2019s like, OK, what is this? What am I supposed to do with it? Too much? Too little? I\u2019m a bit neurotic. It might kill me. Ridiculous!\u201d\n\nWhat has made the difference, Jo says, is \u201cAnnie\u2019s experience, her calmness. I\u2019m being accompanied. I\u2019m not alone. When I\u2019m in pain and I don\u2019t recognise it, and it\u2019s really strong, it panics me. I want Annie more and more to be here. I know she\u2019ll calm me quickly.\u201d One knee pokes up and lifts her fleece blanket like a sail.\n\n\u201cShe was full of fear when I met her,\u201d says Annie, \u201cfear of symptoms that couldn\u2019t be controlled.\u201d\n\nHas it felt challenging for Annie to care for someone who wants to anticipate the end, when her work is to manage symptoms until the end comes? \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t think the palliative care world really had to think of assisted dying so seriously as I have in respect of Jo,\u201d she says. \u201cPalliative care professionals have hidden behind the fact that it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nn July, five friends had agreed to be present when Jo chose to take the drugs. But as the months have passed, the thought of what\u2019s in the fridge has become more difficult for everyone.\n\n\u201cSo, I feel I really understand this now,\u201d Jo says quietly, her knees swaying under the blanket. \u201cYou really are on your own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s coming up more now,\u201d says Annie. \u201cJo\u2019s feeling that if she took that route, she would do it in isolation. What you\u2019ve expressed to me, Jo, is that there was a sense of relief from your friends when you told them you\u2019d chosen the option of palliative care. You said you felt that on the whole they were sighing with relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Of course, they\u2019d go there with me, but it was like \u2018Oh, good! Phew!\u2019 I\u2019m sure someone would be here, but it would be a sadder occasion.\u201d Jo shuts her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through moments where I\u2019ve thought: \u2018If I take the stuff in the fridge, have I failed Annie?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnnie has travelled to a point of great sympathy with, and affection for, Jo. Does she feel she could be there, at her side, if Jo wishes to end her life?\n\n\u201cThere is nothing professional to stop me being here, although I\u2019m clear that I wouldn\u2019t facilitate it,\u201d says Annie. \u201cAs a citizen ... I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. And maybe I hesitate to think about it, hoping that we will go a different way. I have to confess to feeling relief myself when Jo said she felt she could no longer take that option.\u201d\n\nThe drugs remain in the fridge, in the kitchen where the washing machine is whirring. The moment may have passed to take them. Or perhaps it has not. In July, Jo spoke of a line, when she would know the time had come. As the months have gone by, she feels \u201cless the need to draw a line\u201d. Maybe the line is behind her. Maybe it disappeared. Or maybe it retreats with passing time. Annie says when she met Jo, \u201cshe was much more aggressive with her activist views\u201d and now she \u201ctrusts the process of palliative care\u201d. Annie herself has not looked at the bottle, with its pictogram of a sheep\u2019s head, and its unsettling precaution: Uso veterinario.\n\n\u201cI have felt from the beginning,\u201d she says, \u201cthat if it was something Jo chose to do, that would be her choice, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to control it.\u201d\n\nWould she feel that she had failed her patient? \u201cI cannot honestly give an answer as to how it would feel in the event. I have a little worry that it may feel like a failure. I would need time, but I would know that I had given it my best shot to help her in this gentler, easier way for her, her friends and her family.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to know whether Jo\u2019s feelings towards the drugs have changed because she has care now that works for her in the way that the poison once worked \u2013 making her feel safe, offering control over the unknown she fears. Or how far her physical weakness \u2013 yesterday, she had to crawl up the stairs and she avoids moving \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to see how much weaker I\u2019ve got\u201d \u2013 has rendered unfeasible the exertion required to self-administer an illegal drug.\n\nIf assisted dying were legal, maybe an assisted death would be Jo\u2019s chosen course; and perhaps it is only the illegality, considered in her severely weakened state, that makes the choice so hard to contemplate. Jo remains a firm advocate of the legalisation of assisted dying, alongside excellent palliative care, her experience of which has mellowed her position. The drugs no longer appear to be what she wants.\n\n\u201cThey may not be,\u201d she says quickly, moving to sit up. \u201cBut maybe they are. Just you saying that makes me feel antsy.\u201d Their presence, if not their use, makes the future feel navigable.\n\n\u201cSometimes feeling drowsy and nodding off is a relief, because that\u2019s where I see I\u2019m going,\u201d Jo says. \u201cMy body is driving my thoughts now. I\u2019m just going to sleep more, drift off and die. And not really be aware. And that\u2019s OK. The beauty of what\u2019s in the fridge is that it is there if you change your mind.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jo Beecham died peacefully at home, in the company of friends, on 15 October 2014, a week after this interview took place. The drugs stayed in the fridge until her friends disposed of them safely.\n\n\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.
