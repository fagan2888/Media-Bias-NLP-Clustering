TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Tehran has confirmed that an Iranian general was among the seven killed in what the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group has described as an Israeli airstrike in Syria.

The confirmation came in a statement published on Monday on the website of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

It says Iranian Gen. Mohammad Ali Allahdadi was killed in Sunday’s strike in the Golan Heights, which also killed six Hezbollah fighters — including the son of a top Hezbollah operative assassinated in 2008 in Damascus.

The statement says Gen. Allahdadi was on assignment in Syria, giving “crucial advice” to Syrians fighting terrorists, a reference to Sunni rebels and Islamic extremists.

It says Allahdadi will be buried in the coming days.
