(FGA Action)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 More than three-quarters of Republican voters in four early primary states still oppose Obamacare and say they are much less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has implemented it or promoted its Medicaid expansion provision, according to a new poll released by FGA Action, a non-partisan public policy group.\n\n\u201cFive years after Obamacare was passed, GOP voters are still angry about it, and they are still ready to send pro-Obamacare candidates packing,\u201d Tarren Bragdon, the group\u2019s OCEO, explained.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is that there is not a whole lot of conversation about this among the presidential candidates even though this issue is front and center in people\u2019s minds,\u201d Bragdon told CNSNews.com a day before the second scheduled GOP debate.\n\n\u201cBut voters have very different priorities from what some candidates want them to be.\u201d\n\nBragdon said that Obamacare was a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the 2014 midterm elections and predicted it will likely be a major factor in the 2016 presidential election as well.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised how strong voters felt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a liberal Republican who enacted Obamacare or lobbied for it to be sent to the White House.\u201d\n\nThe telephone poll, which was taken in four early primary states between August 24 and 27, asked 2,182 likely GOP primary voters: \u201cDo you generally support or oppose the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare?\u201d\n\nOpposition to the ACA ranged from 85 percent in South Carolina, 83 percent in Iowa, and 81 percent in New Hampshire to 77 percent in Florida.\n\nThe poll also found that GOP voter opposition to state expansion of Medicaid to cover able-bodied, working-age adults \u2013 an optional component of Obamacare \u2013 was also very strong, ranging from 82 percent in South Carolina to 74 percent in Florida.\n\nAs of June, nearly 72 million individuals nationwide were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Of the four early primary states where the poll was conducted, only South Carolina and Florida have not expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA.\n\nHowever, in the 31 states (which includes D.C.) where Medicaid coverage has been expanded, a surge in enrollees, far beyond initial projections, threatens to upend state budgets when federal funding is reduced from the current 100 percent to 90 percent starting in 2017.\n\nRelated: Obama: Expanding Medicaid Under Obamacare \u2018Doesn\u2019t Cost You a Dime\u2019", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "More than three-quarters of Republican voters in four early primary states still oppose Obamacare and say they are much less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has implemented it or promoted its Medicaid expansion provision, according to a new poll released by FGA Action, a non-partisan public policy group.", "title": "Poll: Large Majority of GOP Primary Voters Still Oppose Obamacare", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/poll-large-majority-gop-primary-voters-still-very-opposed", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/obamacare_portal_ap.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-15T16:06:33-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T15:56:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T16:06:33-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than three-quarters of Republican voters in four early primary states still oppose Obamacare and say they are much less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has implemented it or promoted its Medicaid expansion provision, according to a new poll released by FGA Action, a non-partisan public policy group.", "title": "Poll: Large Majority of GOP Primary Voters Still Oppose Obamacare", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/poll-large-majority-gop-primary-voters-still-very-opposed", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/obamacare_portal_ap.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "More than three-quarters of Republican voters in four early primary states still oppose Obamacare and say they are much less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has implemented it or promoted its Medicaid expansion provision, according to a new poll released by FGA Action, a non-partisan public policy group.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11f3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFive years after Obamacare was passed, GOP voters are still angry about it, and they are still ready to send pro-Obamacare candidates packing,\u201d Tarren Bragdon, the group\u2019s OCEO, explained.\nOf the four early primary states where the poll was conducted, only South Carolina and Florida have not expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA.\nRelated: Obama: Expanding Medicaid Under Obamacare \u2018Doesn\u2019t Cost You a Dime\u2019\nTarren Bragdon, OCEO of FGA Action, a non-partisan public policy group based on the principles of free enterprise, individual liberty, and limited government.\n\u201cWe were surprised how strong voters felt about it,\u201d he said."}
