Their lawyers said they feared \u201cdraconian fines\u201d if they failed to comply with the new rule, which took effect Jan. 1.\n\nFriday\u2019s order says that if Little Sisters and the other nonprofits that filed suit inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that they have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services, the government may not enforce the provision until the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver rules on their legal challenge.\n\nCatholic leaders say the rule violates their religious freedom because they believe contraceptives are immoral.\n\nThe Obama administration says the requirement protects women's healthcare rights. Officials stressed that religious groups may opt out of paying for contraceptives by filling out a form triggering a requirement that their insurers pick up the cost of such coverage.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the Catholic groups objected to signing the form, saying it effectively forced them to take part in a process that would still result in contraceptives being provided.\n\nIn the ruling Friday, justices said the Catholic nonprofits \u201cneed not use the form prescribed by the government,\u201d nor send copies to their insurers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very relieved,\u201d said Daniel Blomberg, legal counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. He said the court\u2019s order would not only shield all the groups that joined Becket\u2019s lawsuit, but \u201cpractically speaking,\u201d it would also likely extend to any religious nonprofit that objected to providing contraceptives on religious grounds.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s order spoke for the entire court, and there were no dissents. But it also makes clear the order is temporary. The action \u201cshould not be construed as an expression of the court\u2019s views on the merits,\u201d the order said.\n\nIn March, the high court will hear arguments in the Hobby Lobby case on whether a profit-making corporation can refuse to provide contraceptives to its employees based on the religious views of the company\u2019s owners.\n\nFriday\u2019s order will likely put on hold the status of nonprofit religious groups until after the justices decide the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nFollow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook\n\ndavid.savage@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @davidgsavage", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court blocks contraceptives rule for religious groups", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday shielded the Little Sisters of the Poor and other nonprofit religious groups from complying, for now, with the Obama administration\u2019s rule that they provide free contraceptives in the health insurance they offer employees.", "title": "Supreme Court blocks contraceptives rule for religious groups", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-supreme-court-obamacare-contraceptive-religion-20140124-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52e2db2f/turbine/la-pn-supreme-court-obamacare-contraceptive-religion-20140124", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "supreme court, obamacare, contraception, little sisters", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/79029545", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-01-24", "Description": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday shielded the Little Sisters of the Poor and other nonprofit religious groups from complying, for now, with the Obama administration\u2019s rule that they provide free contraceptives in the health insurance they offer employees.
