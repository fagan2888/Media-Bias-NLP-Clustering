The company plans to spend close to $1 billion to hire 100 specialists to find alternatives to using ABS and petrochemical materials, reports Time.\n\nIn their quest to find sustainable alternatives, LEGO formed a new group called LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre.\n\nIn a June press release, J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp, CEO and President of the LEGO Group, said the following about their new mission.\n\n\u201cThis is a major step for the LEGO Group on our way towards achieving our 2030 ambition on sustainable materials. We have already taken important steps to reduce our carbon footprint and leave a positive impact on the planet by reducing the packaging size, by introducing FSC certified packaging and through our investment in an offshore wind farm. Now we are accelerating our focus on materials.\u201d\n\nAccording to LEGO, the new centre will be based at the LEGO Group\u2019s headquarters in Billund, Denmark. Employees will be working on finding alternative material the company can use in making their products.\n\nKjeld Kirk Kristiansenm, owner of the LEGO Group, commented on the announcement.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow. We believe that our main contribution to this is through the creative play experiences we provide to children. The investment announced is a testament to our continued ambition to leave a positive impact on the planet, which future generations will inherit. It is certainly in line with the mission of the LEGO Group and in line with the motto of my grandfather and founder of the LEGO Group, Ole Kirk Kristiansen: Only the best is good enough.\u201d\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp added more about LEGO\u2019s commitment.\n\n\u201cWhat we announce today is a long-term investment and a dedication to ensuring the continued research and development of new materials that will enable us to continue to deliver great, high quality creative play experiences in the future, while caring for the environment and future generations. It is a daunting and exciting challenge.\u201d\n\n[Featured image via Dan Kitwood/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "LEGO is investing $150 million to find sustainable material to replace the petrochemical-based plastics they use in manufacturing their toy construction bricks.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "LEGO is investing $150 million to find sustainable material to replace the petrochemical-based plastics they use in manufacturing their toy construction bricks.", "title": "LEGO Investing $150M To Find Sustainable Alternatives", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2227274/lego-investing-150m-to-find-sustainable-alternatives/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LEGO.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-05T15:35:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T15:40:52+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LEGO.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-07-05T15:35:45+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "lego,plastic,toy,bricks,construction bricks,,bio-based plastic,petrochemical,sustainable,toy bricks,business", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LEGO.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "LEGO is investing $150 million to find sustainable material to replace the petrochemical-based plastics they use in manufacturing their toy construction bricks."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "In their quest to find sustainable alternatives, LEGO formed a new group called LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre.\n\u201cThis is a major step for the LEGO Group on our way towards achieving our 2030 ambition on sustainable materials.\nBy 2030, with headquarters in Billund, Denmark, LEGO plans to rid itself from using petrochemical-based plastics \u2014 the main material used in making LEGO bricks.\nKjeld Kirk Kristiansenm, owner of the LEGO Group, commented on the announcement.\nLEGO, the world\u2019s largest toy manufacturer, wants to replace plastic in their products with \u201csustainable material.\u201d The family-owned company is investing $150 million to find sustainable alternatives to the current raw materials they use in making their famous toy construction bricks."}
