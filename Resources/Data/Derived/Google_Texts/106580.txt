Parker was pronounced dead about three hours later.

“He was breathing one second and then he was gone,” Harris said. “A lot of people are dying from gangs.”

A coroner’s report indicated that Winkie died of several gunshot wounds.

“There was obviously a disturbance there,” Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson told Westword reporter Michael Roberts.

When Darlene heard about her nephew’s death it brought back terrible memories from her childhood when her baby brother was shot to death at a party in Los Angeles in 1986. He was only 22.

No one had ever been brought to justice for that crime. As months passed, no one was ever arrested for Winkie’s murder.

That didn’t seem right.

How could a man be shot in a crowd and nobody know who did it, Harris asked. Word on the street was that a gang banger was seen shooting Winkie.

“Someone knows what happened but do to the street code of not talking has left my nephew’s killer free to the world,” Harris said.

“Because no one wants to come forward, how sad that my nephew’s killer or killers are out there enjoying their lives and my nephew is dead. All I am asking someone to please come forward to help bring closure.”

There are many people left without a son, nephew, uncle and friend, Harris said.

Parker’s nieces — Jerrika, Sparkle, Lorreisha — adored him.

“Winkie enjoyed being around his family and played a big part in his family’s life,” Harris said.
