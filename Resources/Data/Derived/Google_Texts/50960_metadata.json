(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nFor the second time in two years, the Supreme Court justices tangled over a question about personal beliefs and birth control: Must employers who are religiously opposed to it cover it in their health plans?\n\nA prominent group of pediatricians hopes the answer will be yes.\n\nErecting hurdles to the pill, in this case, could jeopardize the health of America\u2019s children, said Benard Dreyer, president of the the American Academy of Pediatrics. It could even encourage the next Disneyland measles outbreak.\n\nThe link, he acknowledges, isn\u2019t immediately obvious.\n\n[Court appears divided on contraceptive coverage, with Kennedy raising concern]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no discernible difference between a religious objection to contraception and a religious objection to a vaccine,\u201d said Dreyer, also a pediatrics professor at New York University. \"If [the Supreme Court] entitles an employer to be totally exempt from contraceptive coverage, it would presumably allow an employer to do the same for vaccination coverage.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a church-run school that condemns intrauterine devices, for example, could more easily say it won\u2019t fund a chickenpox vaccine. And a low-income worker, unsure of how to find another expense-free avenue or come up with the $94 to pay for the vaccine, might have trouble getting that shot for their first-grader.\n\nReligious resistance to vaccinations in American law can be traced back to the British Vaccination Act of 1898, which provided a \u201cconscience clause\u201d to allow exemptions to the mandatory smallpox vaccination. Most states already allow parents to reject vaccinations for their kids for nonmedical reasons. Some offer \u201cpersonal belief\u201d exemptions, while others allow for a religious exemption.\n\n[Today's moms are working later into their pregnancies and going back to work earlier, too]\n\nThough some people simply don\u2019t like vaccines \u2014 one prominent Baltimore Rabbi called them a hoax \u2014 only two religions have close to an official negative stance on them: Christian Scientists, who pray first to treat illnesses, and members of the Dutch Reformed Church, who worry the shots could affect their relationship with God.\n\nThe case before the court Wednesday, Zubik v. Burwell, mirrors 2014\u2019s Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, which said that forcing family-owned corporations to pay for birth-control coverage violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n\nOn Wednesday, the justices heard arguments on what the government has offered as a compromise: Religious colleges and advocacy groups will not have to pay for the drugs they oppose. Instead, such groups could inform the government that, because of religious reasons, they\u2019re opting out \u2014 and public money would go to cover the cost.\n\n[A toddler got meningitis. His anti-vac parents gave him an herbal remedy. The toddler died. Now his parents are on trial.]\n\nBut the petitioners, including East Texas Baptist University and Denver\u2019s Little Sisters of the Poor, argued that allowing birth control to be covered under their plans, regardless of who\u2019s footing the bill, implicates them in sin. Providing their information to the government, they say, makes them complicit.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the case\u2019s likely swing vote, appeared to side with the challengers. He told Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. that the government seemed to be \u201chijacking\u201d their insurance plans. Instead, he said, the administration should offer an alternative that does not involve the organizations.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor disagreed with Kennedy\u2019s logic. If everyone who said laws violated their beliefs chose not to follow them, she said, \u201chow will we ever have a government that functions?\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans on the individual and company level must fully cover vaccines, just like contraceptives. The law has technically ended out-of-pocket pay for these \u201cpreventive services,\u201d though not all pharmacists and insurers have yet complied.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents roughly 64,000 physicians who treat children, filed an amicus brief earlier this year, urging the court to consider \u201ceffects far beyond the facts of this case.\u201d (The organization files briefs when the court considers family-related cases, Dreyer said.)\n\n\u201cFuture objectors,\u201d the document reads, \u201ccould prevent children from obtaining critical, life-saving preventive care.\u201d\n\nMore on Wonkblog:\n\nThe odd thing Justice Kennedy noticed about abortions in Texas\n\nWhy Republicans are pushing for over-the-counter birth control\n\nWhy pregnant women in Mississippi keep dying", "article_metadata": {"description": "It all comes down to religious objections.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It all comes down to religious objections.", "title": "Why pediatricians care so much about the Supreme Court\u2019s birth control case", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/24/why-pediatricians-care-so-much-about-the-supreme-courts-birth-control-case/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/23/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court_Birth_Control-0c601-4460.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dpaqreport"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/24/why-pediatricians-care-so-much-about-the-supreme-courts-birth-control-case/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "SCOTUS, supreme court, birth control", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "SCOTUS, supreme court, birth control"}, "article_summary": "Nuns with the Little Sisters of The Poor rally outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the court hears arguments to allow birth control in health-care plans.\nSupreme Court Justice Anthony M.
