SARASOTA — Committees planning the 2015 Modern Pentathlon World Cup competition are looking for volunteers.

The event, scheduled from Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, is expected to draw more than 200 international pentathletes to Sarasota for men, women and combined competitions. Modern pentathlon is a day-long event that includes fencing, swimming, equestrian show jumping, running and shooting.

Last year, the Sarasota-Bradenton area hosted the World Cup Final in Modern Pentathlon at the Selby Aquatic Center and the Sarasota Polo Fields. This year the event will be hosted at the aquatic center and Nathan Benderson Park.

Volunteers are expected to come to the recruitment meeting and at least one training session, SANCA volunteer coordinator John Krotec said Monday. Here are the dates:

— A recruitment meeting from 10 a.m. to noon on Sat. Jan 31 at Nathan Benderson Park

— Volunteer training from 10 a.m. to noon on Sat. Feb. 7 at Nathan Benderson Park

— Volunteer training from 10 a.m. to noon on Sat. Feb 14 at Nathan Benderson Park

Questions can be directed to John Krotec at john@sanca.us or 941.400.7333.
