( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nIf you go What: Loveland Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. When: First United Methodist Church, 533 N. Grant Ave., Loveland. Where: 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Monday to Thursday through April 18; closed President's Day, Feb. 15. Cost: Free. More info: Visit www.MakeChangeNoCo.com, or call 599-1794.\n\nJennifer Woods of Loveland thought she arrived in plenty of time Wednesday to not have to wait to get her taxes done.\n\nBut getting to First United Methodist Church at 9 a.m., an hour before the Loveland Volunteer Income Tax Assistance volunteer tax preparers got to work, wasn't soon enough. She still had to wait 1 \u00bd hours when many filers began arriving at 8 a.m., or two hours before the basement office opens.\n\n\"I thought I was here early,\" said Woods, who has been using the service for four to five years and in the past had to wait no more than 20 minutes. \"They know what they're doing, and it's free. ... They have a lot of knowledge about all of the benefits you can get with your tax return.\"\n\nOn Feb. 1, Realities Focus Inc. volunteer tax preparers began preparing state and federal income tax forms for low- and middle-income and senior tax filers living in Larimer County. MakeChange NoCo is the registered trade name for Realities Focus, the nonprofit that has provided VITA and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs in the county since 1969.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volunteers are certified by the Internal Revenue Service and are required to undergo 20 hours of training for each filing season on tax law and software updates. Their job is to help taxpayers with their filing questions, working with those ages 59 and younger with gross incomes up to $60,000 through VITA and filers ages 60 and older through TCE at sites in Loveland and Windsor, which each have one site, and four sites in Fort Collins.\n\nMakeChange provides year-round assistance for homebound residents, at senior centers and at job sites through partnering with the WorkLife Partnership. The home base for the year-round services in Loveland is at the House of Neighborly Service Life Center.\n\nSo far, the Realties Focus volunteers have handled an average of 30 to 35 forms a day Monday to Thursday and will be working through April 18. By Wednesday, the volunteers filed close to 200 forms in Loveland alone and are expected to file 1,300 to 1,400 by the end of the season for the Loveland site.\n\n\"I think part of it is the tax returns. Every year they're getting more and more complicated,\" said Harry Love, Loveland area coordinator of the VITA program, adding that the IRS is encouraging electronic filing over paper returns.\n\nAs a result, the Loveland office is busier this year, even though eight preparers are working there, instead of the six last year. That's because the forms, with the additional complication of the Affordable Care Act paperwork, take an average of one hour and 10 minutes to fill out and file instead of 50 minutes like last year, Love said.\n\n\"We're still staying completely busy,\" Love said. \"By 10 a.m., the signup list is full. It's very popular.\"\n\nThe Loveland site and other sites begin to calm down around mid-March, but pick up again toward the end of March and early April, Love said.\n\nIn 2015, the sites helped nearly 4,000 taxpayers prepare their 2014 tax returns, saving them more than $600,000 in tax return preparation fees.\n\nThe average gross income of the filers is $20,000, and the cost to do a return is increasing with the average in Colorado for a simple tax return at $275, Love said. The preparers can help the filers identify the credits they qualify for, such as child tax, earned income, education and retirement, earning them additional money on their returns.\n\n\"On a limited income, paying a preparer can present a financial burden,\" said Earl Baumgartel, Loveland site coordinator. \"It helps them because every dollar is important to them. ... It gives them more disposable income.\"\n\nKassie Oswalt of Loveland has been getting her taxes done at the Loveland site for three years.\n\n\"It's just great resource to use because it's free because they donate all their time to do this,\" Oswalt said. \"I'm nervous about doing it online myself because I don't want to mess it up.\"\n\nBecky Wittler, also of Loveland, doesn't have a computer at home to do her taxes and is not current on the new tax laws, so she turns to Loveland VITA, she said.\n\n\"The average person doesn't sit at home and read up about tax laws,\" she said.\n\nShelley Widhalm: 970-669-5050, swidhalm@reporter-herald.com, twitter.com/ShelleyWidhalm", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_29517559/tax-filing-help-available-loveland", "modificationDate": "2016-02-14T17:48:54-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0214/20160214__15RHAVITAw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Shelley Widhalm \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "On Feb. 1, Realities Focus Inc. volunteer tax preparers began preparing state and federal income tax forms for low- and middle-income and senior tax filers living in Larimer County.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29517559:view"}, "startDate": "2016-02-14T17:48:39-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_29517559/tax-filing-help-available-loveland", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0214/20160214__15RHAVITAw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On Feb. 1, Realities Focus Inc. volunteer tax preparers began preparing state and federal income tax forms for low- and middle-income and senior tax filers living in Larimer County.", "title": "Tax filing help available in Loveland"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "On Feb. 1, Realities Focus Inc. volunteer tax preparers began preparing state and federal income tax forms for low- and middle-income and senior tax filers living in Larimer County.", "title": "Tax filing help available in Loveland", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_29517559/tax-filing-help-available-loveland", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0214/20160214__15RHAVITAw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-14T17:48:39-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2026-02-14T17:48:39-0700", "sailthru.title": "Tax filing help available in Loveland", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Shelley WidhalmReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0214/20160214__15RHAVITAw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2016-02-14T17:50:46-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "article_summary": "But getting to First United Methodist Church at 9 a.m., an hour before the Loveland Volunteer Income Tax Assistance volunteer tax preparers got to work, wasn't soon enough.\n( Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald )If you go What: Loveland Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.\nOn Feb. 1, Realities Focus Inc. volunteer tax preparers began preparing state and federal income tax forms for low- and middle-income and senior tax filers living in Larimer County.\nVolunteers will work through mid-April to help seniors, low-, middle-income adults with their taxesKathy Weisshaar, center, a tax preparer with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), helps Jay and Deb Evers with their tax return Wednesday at the First United Methodist Church in Loveland.\nBecky Wittler, also of Loveland, doesn't have a computer at home to do her taxes and is not current on the new tax laws, so she turns to Loveland VITA, she said."}
