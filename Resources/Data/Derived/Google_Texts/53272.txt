Wayne County this week will begin offering county retirees a series of seminars to help navigate their new health care insurance.

The county has teamed up with Charlotte, N.C.-based insurance company AmWINS Group Inc. to host the meetings. The company will also offer telephone support and online assistance.

“We entered into this partnership to empower retirees with information to help them select a healthcare plan that is best for them and their family,” Wayne County Executive Warren Evans said in a statement. “We have worked diligently to put the support mechanisms in place to ensure retirees transition smoothly throughout this process. I encourage all eligible retirees to take advantage of these resources.”

Wayne County, which has more than 5,000 retirees, has changed its health insurance as part of cost-cutting measures aimed at addressing the county’s $52 million structural deficit. County retirees’ current health care plan ends Nov. 30 and the new plan takes effect Dec. 1.

Under the new plan, eligible retirees will be given a monthly stipend to purchase health insurance. Eligible retirees are those who were in a bargaining unit and retired with insurance benefits under the 1990 Wayne County Health and Welfare Benefit Plan as well as those who retired under an executive and non-executive exempt benefit plan.

The amount of the stipend depends on each retiree’s eligibility for Medicare. Those who are eligible for Medicare will receive a $130 stipend for themselves and $130 for a spouse to buy supplemental health insurance. Retirees who do not qualify for Medicare will also receive an income-based stipend to buy insurance on the national exchange under the Affordable Care Act.

County and AmWINS representatives will lead the meetings and answer questions.
