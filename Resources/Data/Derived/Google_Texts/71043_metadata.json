Approximately half are children.\n\nSince October, the local indigenous population has accused the Orthodox Jews of discriminating against them and of violating Mayan customs. Maya elders also said the Jewish community sought to impose their religion and was undermining the Catholic faith predominant in the village.\n\nRabbi Uriel Goldman, a representative of the Jewish group, told Prensa Libre newspaper his community had taken up residence temporarily in a Guatemala City hotel until it can find a place to relocate to in an outlying part of the capital area.\n\n\u2013 History repeats itself \u2013\n\nGuatemala, a mountainous and scenic nation in Central America, cannot quite agree on how indigenous it is.\n\nThe government insists 42 percent of citizens belong to ethnic Maya tribes, traditional farmers who mainly speak Maya languages; indigenous leaders insist they represent 60 percent of the 15 million Guatemalans.\n\nIf the indigenous are right, they are starkly underrepresented in what is supposed to be a federal democracy.\n\nDuring three centuries of Spanish colonialism, Mayans were marginalized. After independence in the early 1800s, they spent almost another two centuries living in relative isolation, with a Spanish-speaking ruling class in Guatemala City who long referred to Mayans as dolts for not speaking Spanish.\n\nYet many rural Guatemalans \u2014 most indigenous live in rural areas on their traditional land \u2014 have never been to school in any language.\n\nInstead of embracing equal rights, including to education, in a democratic era, as recently as the 1990s, the traditional elite opted not to embrace bilingualism; not to push to guarantee rural educational equality; and not to have a strategy for integrating indigenous people into national life.\n\nIn Guatemala\u2019s 36-year civil war that ended in 1996, some 200,000 people were killed \u2014 93 percent of them at the hands of the government\u2019s armed forces, according to a United Nations report.\n\nThe report also found that 83 percent of victims were ethnic Mayans.\n\n\u201cHaving gone through history losing land to expropriation, which has contributed to their poverty, \u2026 and the state having been dysfunctional where they are concerned, really exacerbated\u201d indigenous people\u2019s reaction in this culture clash, Guatemalan Mental Health League chief Marco Garabito, a sociologist, told AFP.\n\nThe likelihood that more members of the Jewish community would keep coming triggered the Mayans\u2019 intense fears they could lose more of their lands.\n\nBut on Friday, the Human Rights Prosecutor\u2019s office said it regretted the \u201cforced departure\u201d of the Jewish group.\n\n\u201cThere can be no justification for \u2026 anyone claiming to have the right to threaten or expel foreigners from Guatemalan territory, or make them relocate,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Jews are being attacked because of their ethnicity,\u201d said anthropologist Estuardo Zapeta. \u201cThat\u2019s discrimination, plain and simple.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Unfamiliar orthodoxy \u2013\n\nThe Lev Tahor community was founded in 1980 by Israeli Shlomo Helbrans, seeking to practice an austere interpretation of Judaism.\n\nThe community faced legal problems in the United States and Canada before running up against indigenous opposition in Guatemala.\n\nCanadian media reports also said red flags had been raised by the group\u2019s treatment of children. But the group maintains its way of operating is nothing new.\n\nMaya leaders were confounded by the group\u2019s customs and practices, offended that they did not respond when they were greeted by locals.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t believe in Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary. They do not work. They dress all in black. And they scare off tourists. They don\u2019t sleep at night, and they are out walking around on the streets when we were asleep,\u201d said the indigenous council\u2019s Vasquez.\n\nThe Jews said they were targeted by an \u201caggressive\u201d subgroup of the Maya leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are peaceful people. And to avoid anything more regrettable, we decided to leave that town,\u201d said Misael Santos, another representative of the Jewish group.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/A-member-of-a-folk-group-holds-a-Mayan-mask-at-the-Tikal-archaeological-site-AFP-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Guatemala Mayans: From victims of discrimination to perpetrators?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd188f\"", "article_summary": "And to avoid anything more regrettable, we decided to leave that town,\u201d said Misael Santos, another representative of the Jewish group.\nBut on Friday, the Human Rights Prosecutor\u2019s office said it regretted the \u201cforced departure\u201d of the Jewish group.\nMost members of the small Jewish community are from the United States, Israel, Britain and Russia, and around 40 are Guatemalan.\nMaya elders also said the Jewish community sought to impose their religion and was undermining the Catholic faith predominant in the village.\nThe likelihood that more members of the Jewish community would keep coming triggered the Mayans\u2019 intense fears they could lose more of their lands."}
