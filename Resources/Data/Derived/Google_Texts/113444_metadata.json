Now, with the seemingly nonsensical shutdown shenanigans afoot in Washington, D.C., I am finally able to put that knowledge to good use.\n\nOh yes, I've put the pieces together. There's a vast conspiracy in play and it goes all the way up to the highest levels of power...\n\nThe Distinguished Senator from Calgary\n\nFunny coincidence that, Senator Ted Cruz, the architect of shutting down the U.S. government and attempting to defund Obamacare, was actually born in Calgary, Alberta, widely considered the most Canadian province of the Canadian Empire.\n\nIn a blatant attempt to hide his Canadianism, Cruz \"renounced\" his Canadian citizenship in August 2013. During his 21-hour talkathon on the Senate floor, he even went as far as to read Green Eggs & Ham instead of his native Green Eggs & Canadian Bacon.\n\nI am not fooled.\n\nWe have confirmed with numerous fictional sources that Cruz is a key figure in the double super-secret Canadian spy organization, the M.S.A. (Mountie Security Agency).\n\nTed \"I'm not Canadian, aye!\" Cruz, MSA operative, is destroying the U.S. from the inside at the behest of the Canadian government.\n\nThis begs the question: Oh Canada, why?\n\nFirst Gretzky, then Health Care\n\nThe terrorists hate us for our freedoms, but the Canadians hate us for stealing Wayne Gretzky.\n\nIn 1988, the United States carried out a covert operation kidnapping Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers (where he won four Stanley Cups) and rendering him to the Los Angeles Kings. This is uniformly considered to be the darkest day in Canadian history.\n\nWithout The Great One, all the Canadians had over us was universal health care for their citizens. But Obamacare threatened Canadian health care hegemony. Now Americans with pre-existing conditions would actually be able to get insurance.\n\nTheir only option, dispatch the MSA's top agent, Cruz the Calgarian, to do his worst. Was he acting alone? Not by a long shot.\n\nEt tu, Palin?\n\nFrom the beginning, former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin was one of the most vocal critics of Obamacare and its demonic death panels. Why would she sandbag the good old U.S. of A.? Two words: Hockey Mom.\n\nHer love of the great sport of hockey trumped her patriotism. As a pioneer in the Hockey Mom movement, Palin suffered incalculably when Gretzky was snatched by the States. How could she recruit other Hockey Moms to join her cabal when the Great One would never win another Stanley Cup?\n\nAnd Alaska is basically Canada anyways. It's far away, it's covered in snow and no one speaks English.\n\nThe MSA, recognizing this opening, turned Palin to their cause.\n\nThe Tea Party: A Pawn for a Queen?\n\nWhat about the Tea Party's complicity in the government shutdown? This bit is tricky, so stay with me here.\n\nWho loves Tea Parties?\n\nThe Queen of England\n\nWhose face is on the Canadian 20 dollar bill?\n\nThe Queen of England\n\nWho is still angry at her upstart colony for all that Declaration of Independence stuff?\n\nThe Queen of England\n\nYeah, we broke away a couple hundred years ago, but the Brits can really hold a grudge. Look how long Voldemort was pissed at Harry Potter.\n\nOver the Falls\n\nAs Dr. Strange Cruz and his minions take the helm of the USS U.S. and steer us through the Rapids of Shutdown over the Falls of Default, I can't help but marvel in the strategery of it all.\n\nAnd honestly, we do deserve this. We never should have snagged Gretzky from the Oilers. And now, we have the unmitigated gall to provide health care to people who have pre-existing conditions? We brought this on ourselves.\n\nWell played, Canada, well played, aye...\n\nFollow Jeff B.
