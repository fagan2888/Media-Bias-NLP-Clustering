Given these already congested conditions, the ILWU's refusal to fill critical yard crane positions makes an already difficult situation far worse,\" the 78-member PMA said.\n\nEarlier in the week, the management group accused the union of staging a work slowdown at the ports of Seattle and Tacoma in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRead MoreWest Coast dock talks teeter\n\nDockworkers, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, have been working without a contract since July. The ongoing situation on the West Coast, which handles roughly 60 percent of the nation's containerized marine cargo, has been a source of worry for the nation's importers. Retailers are still bringing in some inventory for the holidays. Manufacturers rely on smooth connections through the coast to maintain time sensitive manufacturing schedules.\n\nWhen contacted by CNBC, ILWU said workers are frustrated because employers have delayed action on the port congestion problems for years and have delayed a resolution of the contract talks for months.\n\n\n\nA longshoreman working 1,600 hours a year\u2014two-thirds of the longshore workforce\u2014earns about $123,000, according to statistics from the PMA. Clerks make $147,000 and walking bosses (foremen) make $209,000 for similar kinds of hours. In addition, workers get a benefits package worth about $93,000 a year.\n\nRead MoreWhy is there congestion at West Coast ports?", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Ship lines and terminals on the West Coast are accusing the dockworkers union there of a continuing effort to hamper cargo movements.", "author": "Allen Wastler", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Ship lines and terminals on the West Coast are accusing the dockworkers union there of a continuing effort to hamper cargo movements.", "title": "Ship lines accuse union of slowing up cargo, again", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/06/west-coast-ship-lines-say-ilwu-hampering-cargo.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/01/30/101376748-157159993.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ship lines and terminals on the West Coast are accusing the dockworkers union there of a continuing effort to hamper cargo movements.", "title": "Ship lines accuse union of slowing up cargo, again", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/06/west-coast-ship-lines-say-ilwu-hampering-cargo.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/01/30/101376748-157159993.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@AWastler", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Business, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-11-06T17:02:56-0500", "modified_time": "2015-09-01T07:38:54-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC"}, "pageNodeId": 102161962, "news_keywords": "ship lines, west coast, dockworkers, labor, ILWU, PMA, wastler"}, "article_summary": "Read MoreWhy is there congestion at West Coast ports?\nThe ongoing situation on the West Coast, which handles roughly 60 percent of the nation's containerized marine cargo, has been a source of worry for the nation's importers.\nRead MoreWest Coast dock talks teeterDockworkers, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, have been working without a contract since July.\nWhen contacted by CNBC, ILWU said workers are frustrated because employers have delayed action on the port congestion problems for years and have delayed a resolution of the contract talks for months.\nA longshoreman working 1,600 hours a year\u2014two-thirds of the longshore workforce\u2014earns about $123,000, according to statistics from the PMA."}
