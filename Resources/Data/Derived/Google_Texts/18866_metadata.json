Hannity finally addressed the challenge in a statement to Mediaite on Friday.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the answer Schultz was likely hoping for.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I have had dozens of spirited debates with Rev. Al Sharpton of the same network on radio, TV, including The National Action Network\u2019s annual convention, where The Rev. has shared with me personally that our exchanges are often the highlight of the convention,\u201d Hannity said in the statement. \u201cWhile I understand little Eddie desperately needs attention, he unfortunately does not have the intelligence, wit, humor or debating skills of Rev. Sharpton, or somebody like James Carville who I have also publicly debated numerous times.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201c[To] be blunt I really have better things to do with my time than attempt to educate a total buffoon who calls Laura Ingraham horrible names, and publicly states \u2018we ought to rip out Dick Cheney\u2019s heart, stomp on it, and shove it back in him.\u2019 Enough said.\u201d\n\nThe declined debate invitation will almost certainly not stop Schultz from openly attacking Hannity on his show.\n\nThe TV host labeled Hannity the \u201cking of cheap shots\u201d and claiming he would \u201csell his absolute soul to defeat President Obama\u201d on Friday, and slammed him for his \u201cignorance\u201d on Obamacare last week.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "MSNBC host Ed Schultz has twice challenged Sean Hannity to a public, face-to-face debate on the topic of Obamacare.
