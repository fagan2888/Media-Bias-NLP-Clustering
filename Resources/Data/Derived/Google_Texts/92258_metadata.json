Despite bitter opposition, despite having come close to self-inflicted disaster, Obama has emerged as one of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history,\u201d Krugman wrote. \u201cHis health reform is imperfect but still a huge step forward \u2013 and it\u2019s working better than anyone expected. Financial reform fell far short of what should have happened, but it\u2019s much more effective than you\u2019d think. Economic management has been half-crippled by Republican obstruction, but has nonetheless been much better than in other advanced countries. And environmental policy is starting to look like it could be a major legacy.\n\nAs successful as he claims Obama has been, Krugman notes the criticism the President has received from various critics.\n\n\u201cFirst, however, let\u2019s take a moment to talk about the current wave of Obama-bashing. All Obama-bashing can be divided into three types. One, a constant of his time in office, is the onslaught from the right, which has never stopped portraying him as an Islamic atheist Marxist Kenyan. Nothing has changed on that front, and nothing will,\u201d he said Krugman. \u201cThere\u2019s a different story on the left, where you now find a significant number of critics decrying Obama as, to quote Cornel West, someone who \u201dposed as a progressive and turned out to be counterfeit.\u201d They\u2019re outraged that Wall Street hasn\u2019t been punished, that income inequality remains so high, that \u201dneoliberal\u201d economic policies are still in place. All of this seems to rest on the belief that if only Obama had put his eloquence behind a radical economic agenda, he could somehow have gotten that agenda past all the political barriers that have con- strained even his much more modest efforts. It\u2019s hard to take such claims seriously.\n\n\u201cFinally, there\u2019s the constant belittling of Obama from mainstream pundits and talking heads,\u201d he continued. \u201cTurn on cable news (although I wouldn\u2019t advise it) and you\u2019ll hear endless talk about a rudderless, stalled administration, maybe even about a failed presidency. Such talk is often buttressed by polls showing that Obama does, indeed, have an approval rating that is very low by historical standards.\n\n\u201cBut this bashing is misguided even in its own terms \u2013 and in any case, it\u2019s focused on the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nKrugman\u2019s story comes as Obama goes about his second term of office with low approval ratings as well as economic ratings that have hit the lowest level of his presidency with, according to a CNBC survey, only 24% of Americans who are extremely confident with Obama\u2019s economic record .\n\n\u201cYes, Obama has a low approval rating compared with earlier presidents, Krugman admitted. \u201cBut there are a number of reasons to believe that presidential approval doesn\u2019t mean the same thing that it used to: There is much more party-sorting (in which Republicans never, ever have a good word for a Democratic president, and vice versa), the public is negative on politicians in general, and so on. Obviously the midterm election hasn\u2019t happened yet, but in a year when Republicans have a huge structural advantage \u2013 Democrats are defending a disproportionate number of Senate seats in deep-red states \u2013 most analyses suggest that control of the Senate is in doubt, with Democrats doing considerably better than they were supposed to. This isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect to see if a failing president were dragging his party down.\n\n\u201cMore important, however, polls \u2013 or even elections \u2013 are not the measure of a president,\u201d he added. \u201cHigh office shouldn\u2019t be about putting points on the electoral scoreboard, it should be about changing the country for the better. Has Obama done that? Do his achievements look likely to endure? The answer to both questions is yes.\n\nTo read Krugman\u2019s article in its entirety, click here.\n\n(Obama One Of The Most Successful Presidents In American History )\n\n690 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
