Bob Dylan will make a rare television appearance Tuesday night on the second-to-last episode of the "Late Show with David Letterman" on CBS. He will join the previously announced guest Bill Murray, part owner of the St. Paul Saints who also does some acting on the side.

This will be the first time in more than 21 years that Minnesota native Dylan has played Letterman’s show. He was a guest in November 1993, during Letterman’s first season on CBS. Dylan also sat in twice during Letterman’s stint at NBC, in 1984 and 1992.

Dylan, 73, rarely interacts with the media. Instead, he focuses on his so-called Never Ending Tour, which has kept him on the road since 1988. In February, Dylan released his 36th studio album, "Shadows in the Night," a warmly received collection of standards from the Great American Songbook.

As for Letterman, he has Tom Hanks and Eddie Vedder booked for Monday, but has not released any details of his "Late Show" finale on Wednesday.
