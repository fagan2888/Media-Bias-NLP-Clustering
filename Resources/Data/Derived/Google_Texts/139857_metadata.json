Foster is winding down, so you can forgive him for approaching these final weeks a little differently.\n\nOn Saturday, the Sun Devils held their second practice session in preparation for their upcoming bowl game. About halfway through, Foster and the team's other veteran players were dismissed early so that the younger players could get extra reps. Rather than head in and get on with his Saturday, Foster stuck around the practice field to not only help mentor his younger teammates, but also to maximize these last few times in the maroon and gold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely savoring it,\" Foster said. \"With the bowl game we\u2019re getting, we\u2019re going to have a longer bowl season as well. That is more days that I can come out here on this field and be with my teammates and coaches. I\u2019m enjoying the little things every day. I\u2019m enjoying every moment.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming Cactus Bowl matchup against West Virginia will be the final game of Foster's collegiate career, and an end to a disappointing senior season that saw ASU fall from the preseason No. 15 spot in the polls to a 6-6 record. Although it fell well short of everyone's expectations, Foster was heartened by the resolve and resilience that his team showed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sucked, but that\u2019s life,\" said Foster of the 6-6 record. \"Sometimes it doesn\u2019t go how you planned. I learned a lot about myself and a lot about this team. Sometimes the wins and losses don\u2019t do it justice when you see the improvement within the team. We did make a lot of good strides.\u201d\n\nFor Foster, his season has mirrored that of the team. Due in part to struggles across the entire offense and being, as his coaches have said, \"banged up\", Foster has posted the smallest on-field production totals of his career: 54 receptions for 544 yards and three touchdowns and 52 carries for 276 yards and one score. The touches, yards from scrimmage, and touchdowns are all less than half of what he posted in 2014.\n\nThroughout the year, many have cited Foster's move from running back\u2014where he rushed for 1,081 yards and was an All-Pac-12 second team selection a year ago\u2014to wide receiver as one of the reasons for the drop in production. Yet despite the drop in his numbers, Foster has no regrets about the position switch.\n\n\u201cI learned so much going through spring ball, to camp, to now,\" Foster said. \"Stuff I can add to my game at the next level to make myself more valuable. It\u2019s definitely a great learning experience that I\u2019ve had this year. I definitely know things that I can improve upon this offseason as well.\u201d\n\nIn this year full of challenges and obstacles, Foster and the Sun Devils were dealt yet another major setback last Thursday when offensive coordinator Mike Norvell left ASU to become the head coach at the University of Memphis. While Norvell had long been bandied about as an up-and-coming head coaching candidate in recent years, the departure still took the team by surprise.\n\nRather than feel jaded or bitter about the loss of his offensive coordinator before his final game, Foster is happy for Norvell's new opportunity.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great how the guys are taking it,\" Foster said. \"It\u2019s not like he got canned or anything. He\u2019s improving his life. He\u2019s family to us, and you can never be upset with someone who is trying to do better for themselves. We\u2019re all very happy for him. We know how great of an opportunity he has over there at changing that program. How our guys come out here, how the offensive coaching staff and (quarterback) Mike (Bercovici), and the offensive leaders out here have been taking control with their leadership, we had great spirit out here today. I was very happy with how things are going and how guys are stepping up.\u201d\n\nAs for how the offensive playcalling will be handled in the Cactus Bowl, Foster thinks it will be a collective effort.\n\n\u201cI think Coach (DelVaughn) Alexander, Coach (Chip) Long, Coach (Chris) Thomsen, and Coach (Todd) Graham is going to have a little more input,\" said Foster. \"I think they all do a good job of communicating, and they\u2019ve all been around the program so long and know what we run. They\u2019ll do a great job of making sure we are prepared for that game.\u201d\n\nDespite the setbacks this season has brought on, it has also included several significant triumphs.\n\nIn his final home game, Foster and the Sun Devils played host to rival Arizona. As he ran through Tillman Tunnel once last time during the pre-game Senior Day ceremonies, Foster reflected on how fast his time as a Sun Devil flew by.\n\n\"Four years go by so fast. So many games played. So many people come and go,\" said Foster. \"To see how much you grow and where I am at now from where I was as an 18-year-old freshman has been a great journey. I\u2019ve learned so much along the way from a lot of the great coaches and great teammates that I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nAs for the game itself, and as he has so many times before, Foster came up big for the Sun Devils. In the fourth quarter, he scored what would prove to be the game-winning touchdown on a one-yard run. The victory brought the cherished Territorial Cup back and closed that chapter of Foster's career on the highest note.\n\n\u201cThat was awesome. That was one of those games that you just remember for the rest of your life,\" said Foster of ASU's 52-37 win. \"No matter what, these last four years, I remember every single one of those games like it was yesterday. It\u2019s a great feeling to finish it out with a win against them. Three and one against them. I\u2019m very happy with my team in how we finished the year. We let some go, but I think we played with a lot of passion and heart.\u201d\n\nWith just under a month left in his career, Foster can look at the hard work he and his fellow seniors have done in revitalizing a Sun Devil program that was the model of disarray just four years ago. While the on-field fortunes of the team have improved, Foster feels the biggest strides have been made in the program's mentality.\n\n\u201cThe attitude and the mindset of going out there and not just competing, but being the best,\" Foster said of the change. \"In the classroom, on the field, it doesn\u2019t matter. Everyone wants to be the best at what they are doing. The energy and the culture has just completely changed in that aspect. Guys are coming out here and working hard, not just getting by but trying to be better and improve themselves.\u201d\n\nBeyond that legacy, Foster\u2014a Scottsdale native\u2014hopes that he can look back upon his career as the first of a new line of \"hometown heroes\". Since Foster committed to ASU in 2012, the program has had greater success in swaying top local prospects to stay home and become Sun Devils, including a pair of elite 2016 prospects in N'Keal Harry and Chase Lucas. It's a trend that Foster feels is just getting started.\n\n\u201cI love to see the tradition start to happen and unfold,\" said Foster. \"There is a lot of great talent in this state. At the end of the day, it has to fit to the kid. As long they know the opportunity they have here and the culture that has been building and is continuously growing is available to them, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. Before,a a lot of guys wouldn\u2019t be recruited hard and be completely blind to the school they have in front of them. Now, it\u2019s being shown and they are starting to see what kind of opportunity they have here.\u201d\n\nWhen he announced his commitment to ASU in January of 2012, Foster stated that his goal was to help lead the program to the Rose Bowl. His career will end falling short of that goal, but with the foundation that he helped lay down in Tempe, he thinks those aspirations will soon be reached by the next generation of Sun Devils.\n\n\"I see the values that are already instilled, and the young talent that we have out here is unbelievable,\" said Foster. \"We all still think that a championship is coming soon. We\u2019re still working for that. After I leave, I won\u2019t second guess that it\u2019s coming in the next couple of years. I love seeing the guys.\n\n\"I think they are in great hands. Coach Graham has done an unbelievable job, and I think he will continue to.\u201d\n\nFollow @BDenny29 Follow @SotDpodcast\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
