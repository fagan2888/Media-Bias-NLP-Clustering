Four people were stabbed at a party in Aurora at about 2 a.m. on New Year’s Day, and police were still looking for suspects Thursday morning, as some of the victims refused to cooperate with investigators, police said.

Dozens of people at the party needed to be interviewed, Aurora police said. The incident was characterized as “a large fight” in the 300 block of S. Duquesne Court, which is in the Murphy Creek golf course community east of Buckley Air Force Base.

All four victims are expected to survive, though one was rushed by ambulance to a hospital in critical condition, police said.

Three others were taken in private cars. No names were released.
