Athletes and even Fred Flintstone endorsed cigarettes in TV commercials. Smoke hung in the air in restaurants, offices and airplane cabins. More than 42 percent of U.S. adults smoked, and there was a good chance your doctor was among them.\n\nThe turning point came on Jan. 11, 1964. It was on that Saturday morning that U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry released an emphatic and authoritative report that said smoking causes illness and death \u2014 and the government should do something about it.\n\nIn the decades that followed, warning labels were put on cigarette packs, cigarette commercials were banned, taxes were raised and new restrictions were placed on where people could light up.\n\n\u201cIt was the beginning,\u201d said Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan public health professor who is a leading authority on smoking and health.\n\nIt was not the end. While the U.S. smoking rate has fallen by more than half to 18 percent, that still translates to more than 43 million smokers. Smoking is still far and away the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. Some experts predict large numbers of Americans will puff away for decades to come.\n\nNevertheless, the Terry report has been called one of the most important documents in U.S. public health history, and on its 50th anniversary, officials are not only rolling out new anti-smoking campaigns but reflecting on what the nation did right that day.\n\nThe report\u2019s bottom-line message was hardly revolutionary. Since 1950, head-turning studies that found higher rates of lung cancer in heavy smokers had been appearing in medical journals. A widely read article in Reader\u2019s Digest in 1952, \u201cCancer by the Carton,\u201d contributed to the largest drop in cigarette consumption since the Depression. In 1954, the American Cancer Society announced that smokers had a higher cancer risk.\n\nBut the tobacco industry fought back. Manufacturers came out with cigarettes with filters that they claimed would trap toxins before they settled into smokers\u2019 lungs. And in 1954, they placed a full-page ad in hundreds of newspapers in which they argued that research linking their products and cancer was inconclusive.\n\nIt was a brilliant counter-offensive that left physicians and the public unsure how dangerous smoking really was. Cigarette sales rebounded.\n\nIn 1957 and 1959, Surgeon General Leroy Burney issued statements that heavy smoking causes lung cancer. But they had little impact.\n\nAmid pressure from health advocates, President John F. Kennedy\u2019s surgeon general, Dr. Luther Terry, announced in 1962 that he was convening an expert panel to examine all the evidence and issue a comprehensive, debate-settling report. To ensure the panel was unimpeachable, he let the tobacco industry veto any proposed members it regarded as biased.\n\nSurveys indicated a third to a half of all physicians smoked tobacco products at the time, and the committee reflected the culture: Half its 10 members were smokers, who puffed away during committee meetings. Terry himself was a cigarette smoker.\n\nDr. Eugene Guthrie, an assistant surgeon general, helped persuade Terry to kick the habit a few months before the press conference releasing the report.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018You gotta quit that. I think you can get away with a pipe \u2014 if you don\u2019t do it openly.\u2019 He said, \u2018You gotta be kidding!\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m not. It just wouldn\u2019t do. If you smoke any cigarettes, you better do it in a closet,\u2019\u201d Guthrie recalled in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\n\nThe press conference was held on a Saturday partly out of concern about its effect on the stock market. About 200 reporters attended.\n\nThe committee said cigarette smoking clearly did cause lung cancer and was responsible for the nation\u2019s escalating male cancer death rate. It also said there was no valid evidence filters were reducing the danger. The committee also said \u2014 more vaguely \u2014 that the government should address the problem.\n\n\u201cThis was front-page news, and every American knew it,\u201d said Robin Koval, president of Legacy, an anti-smoking organization.\n\nCigarette consumption dropped a whopping 15 percent over the next three months but then began to rebound. Health officials realized it would take more than one report.\n\nIn 1965, Congress required cigarette packs to carry warning labels. Two years later, the Federal Communications Commission ordered TV and radio stations to provide free air time for anti-smoking public service announcements. Cigarette commercials were banned in 1971.\n\nStill, progress was slow. Warner recalled teaching at the University of Michigan in 1972, when nearly half the faculty members at the school of public health were smokers. He was one of them.\n\n\u201cI felt like a hypocrite and an idiot,\u201d he said. But smoking was still the norm, and it was difficult to quit, he said.\n\nThe 1970s also saw the birth of a movement to protect nonsmokers from cigarette fumes, with no-smoking sections on airplanes, in restaurants and in other places. Those eventually gave way to complete smoking bans. Cigarette machines disappeared, cigarette taxes rose, and restrictions on the sale of cigarettes to minors got tougher.\n\nTobacco companies also came under increasing legal attack. In the biggest case of them all, more than 40 states brought lawsuits demanding compensation for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Big Tobacco settled in 1998 by agreeing to pay about $200 billion and curtail marketing of cigarettes to youths.\n\nIn 1998, while the settlement was being completed, tobacco executives appeared before Congress and publicly acknowledged for the first time that their products can cause lung cancer and be addictive.\n\nExperts agree that the Terry report clearly triggered decades of changes that whittled the smoking rate down. But it was based on data that was already out there. Why, then, did it make such a difference?\n\nFor one thing, the drumbeat about the dangers of smoking was getting louder in 1964, experts said. But the way the committee was assembled and the carefully neutral manner in which it reached its conclusion were at least as important, said Dr. Tim McAfee, director of the Office on Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAt the same time, he and others said any celebration of the anniversary must be tempered by the size of the problem that still exists.\n\nEach year, an estimated 443,000 people die prematurely from smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke, and 8.6 million live with a serious illness caused by smoking, according to the CDC.\n\nDonald Shopland finds that depressing.\n\nFifty years ago, he was a 19-year-old who smoked two packs a day while working as a clerk for the surgeon general\u2019s committee. He quit cigarettes right after the 1964 report came out, and went on to a long and distinguished public health career in which he wrote or edited scores of books and reports on smoking\u2019s effects.\n\n\u201cWe should be much further along than we are,\u201d the Georgia retiree lamented.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Smoking in decline 50 years after surgeon general report", "title": "Smoking in decline 50 years after surgeon general report", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/04/smoking-in-decline-50-years-after-surgeon-general-report/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__7eeea95a-6beb-447e-978d-5ea88321b98alsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 395}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140104__7eeea95a-6beb-447e-978d-5ea88321b98alsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-04T17:02:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:49:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f07\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was the beginning,\u201d said Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan public health professor who is a leading authority on smoking and health.\nThe committee said cigarette smoking clearly did cause lung cancer and was responsible for the nation\u2019s escalating male cancer death rate.\nSurgeon General Luther Terry released an emphatic and authoritative report that said smoking causes illness and death \u2014 and the government should do something about it.\nIn 1957 and 1959, Surgeon General Leroy Burney issued statements that heavy smoking causes lung cancer.\nWarner recalled teaching at the University of Michigan in 1972, when nearly half the faculty members at the school of public health were smokers."}
