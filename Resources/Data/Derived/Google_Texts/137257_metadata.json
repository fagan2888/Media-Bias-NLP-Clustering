Fish said the intended target was Oregon guard Jason Calliste, who had been taunted earlier in the game.\n\n\u201cThank God, I\u2019m old and slow; I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d said Fish, who later received an apologetic email from the offending student, against whom he declined to press charges. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how a player would have reacted. It\u2019s one of those things that turned out about as good as it could.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Arizona State is you have to walk through the student section to get to your locker room. They should probably move the students to the other end.\u201d\n\nYet that sort of intimacy has long been part of the allure of college basketball. Student sections like Duke\u2019s Cameron Crazies and the storming of a court after a big victory help distinguish the sport from more dispassionate ones.\n\nScott Brooks, an associate professor of sociology and black studies at Missouri, said social media had altered the dynamic between spectator and participant. Engagement is not limited to the court, lending another layer of proximity to a tense environment.\n\n\u201cFor good and bad, access to social media has blurred the lines between fans and athletes,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAthletes will internalize this, and they start to see themselves as a victim. Now, you can respond back, but then the storm starts all over again. That act of being able to respond through social media, I think that\u2019s played a lot into this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.B.A., after an infamous brawl in Detroit in 2004, when a skirmish between Pistons and Indiana Pacers players spilled into the stands, drew up a fan code of conduct. Among the measures were limits on alcohol consumption, increased security in arenas and restrictions on abusive behavior, such as foul language or obscene gestures. In most N.B.A. arenas, a video message from a player on the home team is played before each game encouraging fans to enjoy the game in a respectful manner.\n\nHurd, the WAC commissioner, said his conference will explore such measures when the WAC administrators meet in May and the conference presidents gather in June.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t sat down and had a real serious, in-depth discussion about this. We\u2019ve pretty much left it up to the institutions to determine their game management policies. We have to talk with game management officials who deal with this on a regular basis and come up with best practices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is \u2014 Bakersfield doesn\u2019t have the same resources as Ohio State, and it doesn\u2019t have the same crowds, either \u2014 but I want to find out what our options are.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Hurd suspended K. C. Ross-Miller, the New Mexico State player who threw the ball, for the final two regular-season games, and his teammate Renaldo Dixon, who threw a punch while coming to the aid of a teammate, for one game. Menzies, the coach, is considering further punishment for Ross-Miller; penalties may be imposed on Utah Valley once the university completes an investigation.\n\nAs an assistant in places like Louisville, Southern California, San Diego State and U.N.L.V., Menzies had thought it endearing when fans stormed the court after a victory. He might have thought coaches like Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski and North Carolina\u2019s Roy Williams, who have complained about their teams getting off the court safely, were sapping the fun from the moment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have agreed with Coach K before I was actually out on the floor and felt the emotion that was going on with the fans,\u201d Menzies said. \u201cLooking at it on TV, it looks like, great, they\u2019re celebrating, it\u2019s all good. I\u2019m telling you it was scary. My personal feeling is fans belong in the stands and players on the court.\u201d\n\nIn less than two weeks, the WAC tournament championship will be played in Las Vegas. If the tournament goes to form, Utah Valley and New Mexico will be playing for an N.C.A.A. tournament berth. For the winner, a celebration is sure to ensue.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140302152344, "twitter": {"description": "A melee involving New Mexico State players and Utah Valley fans was the most recent in a series of confrontations, prompting at least one conference to consider changes.", "title": "Clashes Between Fans and Players Draw Greater Scrutiny", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/fan-player-clashes-draw-concern-in-college-basketball.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002744708"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/03melee/03melee-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/fan-player-clashes-draw-concern-in-college-basketball.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002744708", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/fan-player-clashes-draw-concern-in-college-basketball.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/ncaabasketball", "hdl_p": "Clashes Between Fans and Players Draw Greater Scrutiny", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/ncaabasketball/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 2, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Utah Valley University", "keywords": "Basketball (College),New Mexico State University,Utah Valley University", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Billy Witz", "SCG": "ncaabasketball", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By BILLY WITZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A melee involving New Mexico State players and Utah Valley fans was the most recent in a series of confrontations, prompting at least one conference to consider changes.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/03melee/03melee-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A melee involving New Mexico State players and Utah Valley fans was the most recent in a series of confrontations, prompting at least one conference to consider changes.", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "College Basketball", "modified": "2014-03-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/ncaabasketball/index.jsonp", "tag": "Utah Valley University", "published": "2014-03-02", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "03melee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140305172931, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/fan-player-clashes-draw-concern-in-college-basketball.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/03melee/03melee-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A melee involving New Mexico State players and Utah Valley fans was the most recent in a series of confrontations, prompting at least one conference to consider changes.", "title": "Clashes Between Fans and Players Draw Greater Scrutiny"}, "pdate": 20140302, "des": "Basketball (College)", "articleid": 100000002744708, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Clashes Between Fans and Players Draw Greater Scrutiny", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/03melee/03melee-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c14\"", "article_summary": "My personal feeling is fans belong in the stands and players on the court.\u201dIn less than two weeks, the WAC tournament championship will be played in Las Vegas.\n\u201cFor good and bad, access to social media has blurred the lines between fans and athletes,\u201d Brooks said.\n\u201cThe problem with Arizona State is you have to walk through the student section to get to your locker room.\narenas, a video message from a player on the home team is played before each game encouraging fans to enjoy the game in a respectful manner.\nFish said the intended target was Oregon guard Jason Calliste, who had been taunted earlier in the game."}
