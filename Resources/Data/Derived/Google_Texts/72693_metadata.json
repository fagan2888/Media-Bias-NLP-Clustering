The bike entered the east shoulder near the intersection. That's where it began to rotate and overturn as it continued through the grass.\n\nThe motorcycle then struck a drainage culvert, and was vaulted around 100 feet \u2013 crossing a driveway and hitting a palm tree at an elevation of six feet.\n\nThe vehicle continued past the palm tree, and broke through the top portion of a security fence. It broke into multiple pieces, and became lodged in dense shrubbery.\n\nPersaud was separated from the vehicle during this time. His body was found by friends who had been out looking for him after it was determined he was missing. Persaud\u2019s body was found at around 3:30 p.m. on Saturday.
