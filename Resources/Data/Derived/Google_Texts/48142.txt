It's the end of one journey and the start of another for more than 100 North Bay Haven seniors.

The first class graduated.

Family, friends, staff and bay county school officials gathered at Hiland Park Baptist Church in Panama City Saturday afternoon to watch the students walk across the stage in their first graduation gown.

The students ranked in the top 10 percent for standardized test scores this year.

School officials say this class made a huge impact for the school.

"This class has set the standard for all of our classes to come for what excellence means at our school. The family involvement is the biggest difference and families feel so invested in what we're doing and made a choice to be with us, so they really do share the school in many ways," said Meredith Higgins, North Bay Haven Charter Academy Principal.

73 students will be going to college or universities and 6 military appointments.

Next year, north bay haven high school and middle school will be moving from their current facilities at the old Panama City christian school classroom space from central baptist church on west 11th street, to a 2-story facility on 36-acres.
