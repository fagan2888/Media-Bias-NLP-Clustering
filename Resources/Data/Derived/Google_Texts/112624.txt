3Com Ergo Audrey (2001)

Named after Audrey Hepburn, this device was the first of the ill-fated "Ergo" line, a planned series of web devices intended for specific rooms of a house. The Audrey could browse the web, send e-mails, and supported handwritten notes with a stylus, but was generally regarded as pretty awful and was quickly discontinued.
