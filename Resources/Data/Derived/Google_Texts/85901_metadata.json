Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) says it\u2019s time to move on.\n\n\"It needs improvements, but this going back and criticizing without actually trying to make the improvements\u2026just trying to politicize it, they\u2019ve politicized this for six years now,\u201d said Brown.\n\nOne of the focuses of the hearing was fraud in the healthcare system. Some senators say it\u2019s non-existent, others say the government isn\u2019t trying hard enough to find it.\n\n\"The person who does not look for fraud did not find fraud because he was not looking for something,\u201d said Scott.\n\nSix years in, Senator Brown wants lawmakers to improve on the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act, rather than constantly trying to repeal it.\n\n\"The public won\u2019t stand for a repeal of it,\u201d said Brown. \"The President would veto it, republicans know that. Let\u2019s do this right and move forward.\u201d\n\nScott won\u2019t budge on repealing the law.\n\n\"If we were going to move forward, we would find a way to replace Obamacare,\u201d said Scott.\n\nAs of January of this year, HHS says almost 13 million people had signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) ---As the six year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act approaches, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to analyze the effectiveness of President Obama\u2019s healthcare program.", "language": "english", "author": "Peter Zampa", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/--Senate-committee-holds-hearing-on-the-Affordable-Care-Act-coming-up-on-six-year-anniversary-372456772.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Gray-DC-Logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) ---As the six year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act approaches, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to analyze the effectiveness of President Obama\u2019s healthcare program.", "title": "Senate committee holds hearing on the Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) ---As the six year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act approaches, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to analyze the effectiveness of President Obama\u2019s healthcare program.", "creator": "@nbc15_madison", "url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/--Senate-committee-holds-hearing-on-the-Affordable-Care-Act-coming-up-on-six-year-anniversary-372456772.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Gray-DC-Logo.jpg", "title": "Senate committee holds hearing on the Affordable Care Act", "site": "@nbc15_madison", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Senate committee holds hearing on the Affordable Care Act", "google-site-verification": "nVn1exeOti1r4o5YNXcCBEDU1eFrVztxyWcqAwhz9WA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Senate committee holds hearing on"}, "article_summary": "As of January of this year, HHS says almost 13 million people had signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nPosted Thursday, March 17, 2016---3:04 p.m.WASHINGTON (Gray DC) ---As the six year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act approaches, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to analyze the effectiveness of President Obama\u2019s healthcare program.\nSenators questioned officials from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), asking how healthcare.gov, and the Affordable Care Act in general, can improve.\nSix years in, Senator Brown wants lawmakers to improve on the shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act, rather than constantly trying to repeal it.\nHealtchare.gov has transformed since its rocky start in 2013, but Senator Scott still see issues."}
