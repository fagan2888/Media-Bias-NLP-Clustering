Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has dismissed criticism of his health care plan as short-sighted. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 health care revolution would come with a lot of question marks.\n\nSanders has staked his campaign for president on a platform of converting the U.S. health care system into a $14 trillion single-payer program run by the government. His opponent for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, has criticized the cost and the political feasibility of his plan, but Sanders makes it sound simple: If Europe can do it, so can we.\n\nExperts say it\u2019s not so simple, in part because no large free-market country, not in Europe or even Canada, has ever tried what Sanders is proposing \u2014 to socialize an industry that accounts for nearly one-fifth of the national economy.\n\n\u201cIt is not just a problem of the politics,\u201d said Sherry Glied, dean of the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University. \u201cThe devil truly is in the details in designing single payer \u2013 you have to define what you are going to give up, the trade offs, and once you do that [single payer] isn\u2019t a simple elegant thing anymore.\u201d\n\nExperts say Sanders\u2019 plan might decimate the health-insurance industry and force hundreds of thousands of Americans to find new jobs, or it might simply force insurers and their employees to cater more to the rich. It might bust the federal budget and stall economic growth, or it might supercharge the economy. It might give Americans the best, most affordable health care in the world, or it might sentence them to long waits, substandard care and a system that works much better for the wealthy than everyone else.\n\nThe plan\u2019s likely effects on the federal budget are just as murky. Analysts at the Congressional Budget Office started but never released an estimate in 2009 when Democrats were pushing for a single payer option to be considered alongside the Affordable Care Act. The details of that report are confidential, but it is generally very hard to know with any certainty what a policy upheaval like socializing health care would actually do to the government\u2019s bottom line, said former CBO director Doug Elmendorf.\n\nSanders voted for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but he criticizes the law for continuing to leave millions of Americans without health coverage.\n\n\u201cThere is only one way that I know of that you can provide universal, cost effective and comprehensive health care for all of our people,\u201d Sanders said in 2009 while ACA was being debated in the Senate. \u201cThat is a Medicare for all single-payer system.\u201d\n\nSanders has not yet offered key details about what such a system would look like if he were to enact it, such as how much it would pay doctors and what treatments would be covered. Those details could all significantly change how people use health insurance and how much it would cost the government.\n\nThe lack of detail makes it very difficult to estimate how his plan would change the economy. So does the lack of any comparable historical precedent for what he is proposing.\n\nThe trend in capitalist countries since the 1970s has been to liberalize previously state-run industries, such as airlines and telecommunications providers. Sanders would do the reverse, putting a full government umbrella over a health care industry that is nearly 16 percent of the U.S. economy.\n\nOther Western countries, such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and much of continental Europe, all launched their government-administered health systems before a large private health insurance sector could take root.\n\nThe National Health Service in the U.K. was born as the country struggled to recover from the destruction of World War II. Many of the country\u2019s doctors were spread out and working in service to the government during the war and it was an easy and seamless transition to a system that would grow to provide nationalized health care for more than 64 million British citizens.\n\nCanada is the best and most recent example of a country attempting a health care plan similar to the one Sanders\u2019s proposes, Glied said. The Canadian system evolved over decades from a universal plan that started in a single province in the 1940s.\n\nIn the absence of details and analogues, experts are left to guess at the effects of Sanders\u2019 plan. The Sanders campaign has embraced a forecast of the plan\u2019s potential effects produced by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, which some liberal economists have criticized as unrealistically optimistic.\n\nFriedman predicts Sanders\u2019 proposals would speed U.S. economic growth to as fast as 5 percent per year \u2013 up from a post-recession average of 2 percent \u2013 in part by dramatically increasing incomes and spending power for the middle class.\n\nIn an email interview, he predicted the plan would produce \u201closers as well as winners\u201d in the American workforce. \u201cHealth insurers would either fold or be dramatically scaled back,\u201d he wrote, as would companies providing billing services to health-care providers. Pharmaceutical companies would see their profit margins shrink, he said, though they would still be profitable.\n\nFriedman estimates 600,000 workers could lose their jobs across the economy, but that 98 percent of them would find new employment within two years.\n\nThe winners, he said, would include health care providers who no longer would need to worry about some patients never paying for services; employers outside the health sector, whose savings from no longer providing health insurance would outweigh new taxes to help fund the program; and workers who will pay less for care and potentially earn more as employers pass some health spending savings on in the form of higher wages.\n\nOther economist say the effects would be more complicated, depending on how much the single-payer system pays for patients\u2019 care.\n\nIf a typical single-payer benefit is not much more generous than basic Medicare benefits, said Timothy Layton, an economist at the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, \u201cI don\u2019t think the entire health insurance industry would disappear.\u201d\n\nInstead, he predicted, the industry is likely to cater to higher-income Americans who can afford supplemental insurance coverage, or who seek treatment from health providers who decide not to accept single-payer benefits at all.\n\nHigher-income consumers in Europe and other areas with single-payer plans are increasingly buying such supplemental coverage, said Scott Atlas, a doctor and health care researcher who is a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s conservative Hoover Institution think tank. Under an American single-payer plan, Atlas said, health care \u201cwill be driven toward two parallel systems with even more inequality\u201d between rich consumers and everyone else.\n\nLayton said some workers who lose jobs in the transition to supplemental care could find work in the federal government, administering the new single-payer plan, or for health providers themselves. They could also find work, he said, \u201cin a large industry of firms that help providers game the system and extract as much as they can from the government.\u201d\n\nGovernment estimates of the cost of health care spending also have a history of being completely wrong. Early studies of the cost of Medicare were off by billions of dollars and the Obama administration continues to grapple with shifting ACA budget expectations.\n\nElmendorf, the former budget office director who now serves as the dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said one challenge for economists in assessing universal Medicare has been trying to separate public spending and private spending in the current health system.\n\nPrivate hospitals are often paid with public funds from Medicare and Medicaid patients, public and government hospitals accept all forms of insurance and millions of people receive state and federal tax subsidies to buy private insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to project if Sanders\u2019s tax proposals would raise enough money to pay for the new spending. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center recently estimated Sanders would raise $15.3 trillion by increasing tax rates on all income brackets, raising the tax rate on investment income and introducing new taxes on carbon emissions and electronic stock trades.\n\nCombined, those changes would lead to some of the highest U.S. tax rates outside of war time, said Tax Policy Center Director Leonard Burman. The center\u2019s study said those high tax rates could reduce incentives for businesses and individuals to save and invest and could cause a jump in interest rates.\n\nHis campaign discounts those criticisms and likens Sanders\u2019 proposals to sweeping policy changes of the past, such as when President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced Social Security during the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cIf establishment economists had been advising FDR in the 1930s on his economic plans,\u201d said Sanders campaign policy director Warren Gunnels, \u201cif they had their macroeconomic models going on they would have tried to discourage FDR from doing the great things he did back then.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton, has criticized the cost and the political feasibility of his plan, but Sanders makes it sound simple: If Europe can do it, so can we.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jimtank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Hillary Clinton, has criticized the cost and the political feasibility of his plan, but Sanders makes it sound simple: If Europe can do it, so can we.", "title": "The many mysteries surrounding Bernie Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care plan", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/03/15/the-many-mysteries-surrounding-bernie-sanders-health-plan/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/20/National-Politics/Images/Dem_2016_Debate-06a7c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jimtankersley"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Sanders, Health care, single payer, socialism, Obamacare, Hillary Clinton, Europe", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jimtank"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Sanders, Health care, single payer, socialism, Obamacare, Hillary Clinton, Europe"}, "article_summary": "Canada is the best and most recent example of a country attempting a health care plan similar to the one Sanders\u2019s proposes, Glied said.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.
