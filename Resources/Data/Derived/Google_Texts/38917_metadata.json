There are still \u201ctoo many variables\u201d to know what will happen in 2016.\n\nPat Flaherty, assistant superintendent of human resources in Sheboygan, the state\u2019s 10th largest school district, said while the district was still working out its plan, \u201cWe said we can\u2019t afford to be giving part-time folks full-time benefits.\u201d\n\nMany school districts offer health insurance to part-time teachers and teachers\u2019 aides who work nearly 35 hours a week. Prior to 2011, Sheboygan paid for full health insurance benefits to part-time employees.\n\nFlaherty said he thinks the district would lose valued employees if it simply cut hours below 30 per week to avoid the Obamacare requirement. Both Sheboygan and Oshkosh school districts employ more than 200 people who meet this distinction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to work out how to be compliant,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to say \u2018OK everyone above 7.25 hours (and under 40 hours a week) we\u2019re going to reduce your hours.'\u201d\n\nEmployees in Wisconsin who work less than 30 hours a week are eligible for subsidies through the federal Obamacare exchange, but only if their employer doesn\u2019t offer health insurance.\n\nSchool districts took large funding cuts from the state with Act 10. Employees, however, had to pay into their own pensions and health benefits for the first time, which refunded a substantial portion of the cuts.\n\nThe school board, freed from requirements of the previous collective-bargaining agreement, instituted a pro-rated model. The district would still offer part-timers health insurance, but at an increased cost to the employee.\n\nWhere Act 10 cut funding but added certainty for school boards in Wisconsin, the ACA may increase costs and has created uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIs pro-ration still fair under this?\u201d Flaherty asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not definitive what they\u2019re telling us we need to do. Frankly, they can roll back again and give us another year to get this resolved.\u201d\n\nDistricts also have to contend with supposedly forthcoming \u201cnon-discriminatory\u201d regulations that were never written after the law passed. That part of the ACA fines employers that offer health insurance that\u2019s deemed to more greatly benefit the top 25 percent of earners in a company. In schools, that includes administrators and teachers with seniority.\n\n\u201cEmployers have been waiting for more than a year for the publication of regulations by the Internal Revenue Service that will address this question,\u201d lawyers at the Boardman Clark law firm in Madison wrote in December. \u201cHowever, the amount of the penalty for violating the non-discrimination provisions has been made clear: the penalty will be $100 per day per non-highly compensated person discriminated against.\u201d\n\nThe law firm recommended school districts keep contract language regarding health insurance flexible enough to revisit with higher paid staff, if necessary.\n\nNault said the non-discriminatory regulations could make prorating insurance impossible.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s one-year delay on the employer mandate last July also allowed employers to phase in coverage by offering a health plan to 70 percent of their full-time employers in 2015, which will rise to 95 percent in 2016. This gives larger school districts some leeway for making changes without getting hit with fines.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to jump out and do something and impact our employees today, and then something changes and they may not have had to be impacted for a year or two or three or four,\u201d Nault said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get pinched with a $2 million fine, either.\u201d\n\nContact Ryan Ekvall at rekvall@watchdog.org, at 608-257-1382 or on Twitter @Nockian.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Obamacare forces Wisconsin school districts to make tough personnel decisions for part time staffers to avoid millions of dollars in fines.", "title": "Obamacare forcing school districts' hands on part-time staff - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-10T09:18:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/131707/obamacare-schools-wisconsin/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Wisconsin", "tag": "Collective Bargaining,fines,ObamaCare,public schools,schools,Taxpayer,Wisconsin", "published_time": "2014-03-10T04:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T09:18:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Obamacare forces Wisconsin school districts to make tough personnel decisions for part time staffers to avoid millions of dollars in fines.", "title": "Obamacare forcing school districts' hands on part-time staff - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/obamacare.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Obamacare forces Wisconsin school districts to make tough personnel decisions for part time staffers to avoid millions of dollars in fines."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4329\"", "article_summary": "In March 2013, Mike Nault, human resources director at the Oshkosh School District, offered part-time teachers in the district an ultimatum.\nThis gives larger school districts some leeway for making changes without getting hit with fines.\nBy Ryan Ekvall | Wisconsin ReporterMADISON, Wis. \u2014 School districts throughout Wisconsin have some tough decisions to make about mandatory health care for their part-time employees.\nBoth Sheboygan and Oshkosh school districts employ more than 200 people who meet this distinction.\nSchool districts took large funding cuts from the state with Act 10."}
