To help Americans stay informed, the non-profit compiles an online directory of \u201chate-espousing\u201d groups and individuals, which includes the KKK and Neo-Nazi organizations.\n\nThe latest addition to their \u201cextremist files\u201d has surprised some people. SPLC profiled the famous neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, for his positions on both gay marriage and Obamacare:\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson rapidly ascended as a far-right political star after publicly scolding President Obama, whom he sat a few feet away from, at a National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013. Carson\u2019s reproach of Obama for his health care and tax policies went viral, unleashing a flood of adulation from right-wing media and hate groups.\n\nSPLC continued their reasoning for adding Carson to the list:\n\nSoon he was appearing as the keynoter at a rash of right-wing and hate group gatherings, linking gays with pedophiles, comparing the U.S. to Nazi Germany and endorsing biblical economic practices for 21st century America.\n\nTheir new page on Ben Carson includes some of his \u201cextremist\u201d quotes:\n\n\u2018Marriage is between a man and a woman. It\u2019s a well-established pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA [North American Man/Boy Association, a group advocating pedophilia], be they people who believe in bestiality\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter what they are, they don\u2019t get to change the definition.- \u2014 Interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity,\u201d March 26, 2013\n\nAnd:\n\n\u2018Obamacare is really the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And \u2026 in a way, it is slavery.\u2019 \u2014Values Voter Summit, Washington, D.C., Oct. 11, 2013\n\nAccording to The Blaze, this isn\u2019t the only example the group targeting a conservative. The non-profit has a history of politically-motivated policies:\n\nThis is not the first time the Southern Poverty Law Center has added a well-known conservative to one of its lists, as historian David Barton has been among those targeted by the group. And it\u2019s no secret that the Southern Poverty Law Center has come under fire from conservatives for its liberal inclinations in the past. The group was removed from the FBI\u2019s hate crime web page last year after conservative groups protested its initial inclusion there.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has clearly stated the criteria for the list: \u201cbeliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.\u201d\n\nBen Carson plans to run in the Republican primary in 2016, but not all conservatives agree with his statements. However, when it comes to LGBT issues, a 2014 Gallup poll shows that 39% of Americans still oppose gay marriage.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "Does he deserve to be on the list?", "published_at": "2015-02-10T12:39:09+00:00", "author": "Nick Morpus", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "Does he deserve to be on the list?", "title": "Presidential Hopeful Labeled 'Extremist' on The Southern Poverty Law Center's Online Database", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1710, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/15161682825_39d85184bc_k-e1423573773828.jpg", "height": 988}, "updated_time": "2015-02-10T14:45:41-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/02/248245-new-name-added-southern-poverty-law-centers-extremist-list-fair/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Does he deserve to be on the list?", "creator": "@muhroadz", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/15161682825_39d85184bc_k-e1423573773828.jpg", "title": "Presidential Hopeful Labeled 'Extremist' on The Southern Poverty Law Center's Online Database", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 248245, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-10T12:39:09-04:00", "wp-categories": 1471, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Politics", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/02/248245-new-name-added-southern-poverty-law-centers-extremist-list-fair/", "wp-category-slugs": "politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-02-10T12:39:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-10T14:45:41-04:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/nmorpus"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/15161682825_39d85184bc_k-e1423573773828.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "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The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) claims to champion civil rights and fight bigotry across the United States.\nAnd it\u2019s no secret that the Southern Poverty Law Center has come under fire from conservatives for its liberal inclinations in the past.\nTheir new page on Ben Carson includes some of his \u201cextremist\u201d quotes:\u2018Marriage is between a man and a woman.\nTo help Americans stay informed, the non-profit compiles an online directory of \u201chate-espousing\u201d groups and individuals, which includes the KKK and Neo-Nazi organizations.\nThe non-profit has a history of politically-motivated policies:This is not the first time the Southern Poverty Law Center has added a well-known conservative to one of its lists, as historian David Barton has been among those targeted by the group."}
