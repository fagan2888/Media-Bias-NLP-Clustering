Although the 49-21 victory over FCS opponent UC Davis at Hughes Stadium left unanswered many of the questions about how good this CSU team is \u2014 or can be \u2014 it at least enabled the Rams to regain some of their swagger.\n\nSenior quarterback Garrett Grayson threw for 425 yards and four touchdowns \u2014 two of them to sophomore wideout Rashard Higgins \u2014 and junior college transfer Treyous Jarrells, playing his first home game for CSU, ran for 84 yards as the Rams piled up 224 yards on the ground and 676 yards of total offense.\n\n\u201cUp front, the O-line did an excellent job, and we just ran behind them,\u201d said Jarrells, the junior from Sanford, Fla.\n\nWhat did it all mean in the wake of the misleadingly close 37-24 loss the previous week on the blue turf at Boise State?\n\nWell, the most intriguing thing about this matchup might have been that many consider the two universities to have the top two veterinary schools in the country. In football, UC Davis is in its third season in the Big Sky Conference, and for comparison purposes, the Aggies trailed Stanford 38-0 at halftime in the first week before falling 45-0.\n\nBut it counted, and especially in a FBS landscape where fattening up on FCS opponents is commonplace. Plus, this is a CSU program that two years ago followed up a victory over Colorado in coach Jim McElwain\u2019s first season with a loss to North Dakota State \u2014 the FCS powerhouse, but an FCS opponent nonetheless \u2014 in the second week.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado State beats UC Davis 49-21, Sept. 13, 2014\n\n\u201cI was really excited about that performance,\u201d McElwain said of Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cWe went into that game wanting to get a lot of things done and play a lot of guys. \u2026 We needed to get last week\u2019s taste out of our mouth.\u201d\n\nThe victory improved the Rams to 2-1, with a bye coming up this week before a Sept. 27 game at Boston College.\n\nIt was Grayson\u2019s second consecutive 400-yard passing game \u2014 he threw for 434 yards at Boise State, with the asterisk that much of those came after the game was out of hand. This time, his backup, Nick Stevens, relieved him midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI know he threw for a bunch, but here\u2019s the good thing \u2014 we finally hit some deep balls,\u201d said McElwain. \u201cI think the explosive guys played explosive, and that\u2019s good. When we get the balls in their hands, with them moving, they have a chance to finish.\u201d\n\nGrayson\u2019s TD passes included connections of 45 yards to Charles Lovett and 52 yards to Higgins, and a 69-yard completion to Elroy Masters Jr. got the Rams to the Aggies 2 and set up CSU\u2019s sixth touchdown before Grayson and the first offense was done for the afternoon midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI felt like the receivers and I were pretty much on point with everything we were doing,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cThe timing was there. That\u2019s huge going into a bye week because I\u2019ve been on the other end of the buy week when we lose with Coach Mac, and it\u2019s not fun. It\u2019s a good thing to go into a bye week with a win. Our heads are up high.\u201d\n\nDee Hart, who broke out with a 139-yard game against Colorado in the opener, ran for 38 yards on eight carries against the Aggies, and he and Jarrells continued to alternate effectively. This time, though, holdover Jasen Oden Jr. contributed a late 50-yard run and he finished with 68 yards.\n\nMcElwain said of Hart and Jarrells: \u201cThey were both really, really good baseball players where they came from, believe it or not. \u2026 I had to after kind of the third series that in the game of baseball, every time you go up, it\u2019s not a home run. Sometimes, they\u2019re looking to bounce and do things, trying to make a home run all the time instead of just going to do what you\u2019re supposed to do. Eventually, that guy\u2019s going to pipe you one and you\u2019ll take it out of the park.\u201d\n\nJarrells confirmed that exchange. \u201cHe came to us and told us to calm down, settle down a little bit, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d He added: \u201cI played second base. I was a good second second baseman. Hitting wasn\u2019t my thing, though.
