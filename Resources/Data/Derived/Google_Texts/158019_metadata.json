While we have not been able to turn back the global tide and rescue every Maine mill \u2014 five have closed in the past two years \u2014 there has been bipartisan consensus that we ought to do all we can as a state to give our mills a fighting chance.\n\nAnother important group of vital Maine institutions \u2014 community hospitals \u2014 are also under stress due to forces beyond their control. But unlike with the paper mills, state lawmakers have not stepped up to do all we can to provide these organizations with that fighting chance.\n\nIn my district, Franklin Community Health Network, which operates Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, just announced more than $4 million in annual operational and staff cuts that will mean 40 fewer full-time jobs in the region. The plan is aimed at stemming a string of losses dating back to 2011 that total more than $15 million.\n\nFCHN is still one of the region\u2019s largest employers with more than 700 full- and part-time employees. Perhaps more importantly, it is a critical community asset, providing high quality primary, acute and emergency care in a rural area.\n\nThere are a lot of forces working against Franklin and Maine\u2019s other community hospitals. Those stressors can be aggravated by a rural setting, but community hospitals in urban and suburban settings \u2014 Rockland\u2019s Pen Bay Health Care and Biddeford\u2019s Southern Maine Medical Center are examples \u2014 are feeling the pressure, too.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on?\n\nSome of the stress can be traced to the changing nature of health care. As we learn about the importance of good primary care and management of chronic conditions such as diabetes, mental illness and COPD, local hospitals must shift their focus. This new approach is vital to the health of our communities, but is not necessarily as profitable as treating acute needs.\n\nNot insignificant are changes to federal Medicare reimbursement rates tied to the federal Affordable Care Act. At Franklin Memorial Hospital, for instance, management estimates the 10-year impact of the changes, from 2011-2020, to be $10.9 million.\n\nThat reduction was supposed to be offset by more than $3 million in new Medicaid revenue. Unfortunately, Maine\u2019s governor and most of my fellow Republican legislators decided not to take advantage of the opportunity by expanding Maine's Medicaid program (MaineCare), despite the fact that the federal government would pay no less than 90 percent of the cost.\n\nRep. Russell Black, R-Wilton, understood the economics and supported that effort. His vote for expansion was a vote to help this community and its hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, nonprofit community hospitals in Maine are still committed to providing care to all who walk through their doors, regardless of ability to pay. At Franklin Memorial, that amounts to about $1.8 million worth of free care provided each year.\n\nAnd on top of all this, hospitals continue to experience the \u201ctemporary\u201d Medicare sequestration cuts that took effect several years ago as part of a federal budget deal.\n\nWe in the Legislature can\u2019t mitigate all these factors, just as we can\u2019t stem the declining demand for paper in the electronic age or put a halt to foreign competition in that industry. But we are not powerless.\n\nI know that expansion of MaineCare under the federal Affordable Care Act is an idea met with deep skepticism among most of my fellow Republicans. They are loath to tacitly endorse Obamacare. They worry that the federal government won\u2019t hold up its end of the deal to fund no less than 90 percent of the cost of expansion. And they see even a 10 percent share of MaineCare costs as perhaps beyond the state\u2019s means.\n\nBut my expansion bill, which could not garner the votes needed to even get to the governor\u2019s desk this past session, would have injected a needed dose of personal responsibility into the MaineCare program. It would have leveraged hundreds of millions of federal dollars that we know are available to our state right now. And while we must be good fiscal stewards, leveraging $93 million over three years to bring $1.2 billion to the state over the same time seems a good plan dollars-and-cents-wise.\n\nWould passage of this plan solve all the problems at Maine\u2019s community hospitals? No. Our health care industry leaders have a lot of hard work in front of them if community hospitals are to thrive. But it seems we have an obligation to give these institutions that are so important to our communities the best possible shot at survival and success.\n\nState Sen.
