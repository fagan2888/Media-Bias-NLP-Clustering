No, the company is still not \u201cprofitable\u201d because Jeff Bezos and the company\u2019s board of directors believe you build shareholder value by growing a business. So they have taken the money and invested it in everything from comedy videos to wine to delivery systems for those products.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t seem to mind since Amazon shares are up more than 200 percent since mid-2010. Now, after too many years of resisting the inevitable, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have finally surrendered and are embracing Internet commerce.\n\nA new study by MIT Technology Review says stores like Macy\u2019s have turned themselves into \u201cdigital hybrids,\u201d tracking consumers online and marketing to a generation that wouldn\u2019t set foot in a mall, let alone a department store. The buzzword is \u201comnichannel\u201d marketing.\n\nThere are four main reasons people are converting from in-store to online shopping, according to a survey by Continuum, a global innovation consultancy.\n\nConvenience (43 percent) It\u2019s easier to find what they\u2019re looking for (29 percent) For better prices (25 percent) To avoid interaction with employees (3 percent)\n\nYou can add free shipping to that list, according to the people I spoke with, along with great comparative shopping research tools for products like cameras, phones, TV\u2019s and automobiles, to name a few. In the case of Amazon and a few other enlightened commerce services, high on the list of plusses is customer service.\n\nRELATED: MOVE OVER, WALMART: FRESH EGGS AND MILK FROM AMAZON\n\nReturns are a breeze; if you make a mistake, Amazon makes you think it\u2019s their fault. Case in point. I once inadvertently ordered two copies of Tom Sawyer. It was the hardbound version of the classic at about $12. After requesting the return, I received an email from Amazon that I should keep the second copy of the book at no charge because I was one of their preferred customers. (I donated the book to my local library.)\n\nFor working mothers, shopping on line has become a necessity: One of my colleagues, Beth Braverman, a journalist and mother of a toddler, orders all her diapers from Diapers.com. I asked her why not shop at Costco or Walmart, and she said, \u201cI need one hand free at all times to hold on to my son\u2019s hand. Diapers by the case are bulky and Diapers.com ships for free.\u201d She also buys three pairs of the same shoe style in different sizes from Zappos. She keeps the one that fits and returns the other two\u2014no charge.\n\nAnother colleague, Andrew Lumby, is furnishing a new apartment he shares with roommates. He just bought a bookcase from Amazon because \u201cif I bought it at Ikea I would have to rent a car, which would cost more than the bookcase!\u201d Andrew also gets instant coupons form Slick Deals, while Beth relies on RetailMeNot.\n\nThese \u201cperks\u201d are just two of many reasons online retail sales are projected to jump 13 percent this year to $262 billion, according to Forrester Research.\n\nWhen Internet commerce grows, so does the revenue of FedEx, UPS and \u2013 keep your fingers crossed \u2013 the U.S. Postal Service. FedEx has seen its stock increase 49 percent this year, while UPS has surged 37 percent. Both beat the hefty performance of the S&P 500\u2019s 25 percent increase.\n\nAmazon and all the specialty online shops like Zappos are certainly a big reason for the boom in Internet shopping, but the Forrester report says there are two reasons for the boom. First, the increase in ownership of tablets and smartphones, and second, the commitment by traditional retailers to be \u201comnichannel\u201d merchants.\n\nRead more at The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After years of resisting the inevitable, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have finally surrendered and are embracing internet commerce.", "title": "Macy\u2019s Flagship Store Is Finally in the Palm of Your Hand", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/07/Macy-s-Flagship-Store-Finally-Palm-Your-Hand", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10142011_Shopping_Cart_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/07/Macy-s-Flagship-Store-Finally-Palm-Your-Hand", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10142011_Shopping_Cart_article.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After years of resisting the inevitable, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have finally surrendered and are embracing internet commerce.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e6b\"", "article_summary": "There are four main reasons people are converting from in-store to online shopping, according to a survey by Continuum, a global innovation consultancy.\nNow, after too many years of resisting the inevitable, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have finally surrendered and are embracing Internet commerce.\nThese \u201cperks\u201d are just two of many reasons online retail sales are projected to jump 13 percent this year to $262 billion, according to Forrester Research.\nIn the case of Amazon and a few other enlightened commerce services, high on the list of plusses is customer service.\nI asked her why not shop at Costco or Walmart, and she said, \u201cI need one hand free at all times to hold on to my son\u2019s hand."}
