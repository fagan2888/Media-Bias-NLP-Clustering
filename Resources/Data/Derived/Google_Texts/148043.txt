Police are looking for a 76-year-old Arlington man who went missing while his relatives were at a Thanksgiving gathering Thursday.

Aaron Ratcliff was last seen about 2 p.m. Thursday when his family left home in the 7100 block of Lake Jackson Drive, near State Highway 360 and Mansfield Webb Road, for a relative’s house.

Ratcliff wasn’t home when they returned. Police believe he may be walking around because he doesn’t have access to a car.

Police described him as 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds. He was last seen wearing a plaid shirt, dark pants and a dark-colored jacket, police said.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call 911.
