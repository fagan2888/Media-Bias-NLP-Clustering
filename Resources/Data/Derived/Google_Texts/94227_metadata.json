The company operates 15 assisted living communities located mostly in the center of the country, with one community in Pennsylvania being the farthest east.\n\nThe Salude facility in Suwanee, Ga., will be an upscale community focused on delivering clinical care and quality outcomes, says Dr. Alan Wang, CEO of Salude.\n\nThe $16.5 million development offers 64 private rooms and bathrooms within a 46,610-square-foot structure. Situated on more than 14.5 acres along Norholt Parkway in Suwanee, Salude\u2019s location offers a serene, private setting that will emphasize the facility\u2019s \u201cArt of Recovery\u201d initiative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting a higher acuity patient that traditional post-acute care facilities,\u201d says Wang. \u201cWith the Art of Recovery, we expect our patients to walk out of the facility and fully recover from injuries in less than a 20-day, maybe 15-day, length of stay.\u201d\n\nRedefining the \u201cArt of Recovery\u201d includes meals provided using locally sourced ingredients by Salude\u2019s professional chef for in-room dining, as well as enabling patients to access on-demand TV and video-conferencing capabilities with an on-staff concierge.\n\nDesign features of the facility\u2019s private rooms also facilitate recovery, with giant showers that allow patients with mobility issues to easily enter and exit, sliding doors on the entrances to bathrooms and large windows that allow more natural light.\n\nThe location of Salude will play a key role in the company\u2019s strategy to develop partnerships with other healthcare providers, as the facility sits in close proximity to multiple hospitals and health systems.\n\n\u201cSuwanee has a large growing affluent population base, with a lot of growing orthopedic, cardiology and pulmonary practices,\u201d says Wang. \u201cClose proximity to these facilities and managed care groups will be excellent referral sources to Salude.\u201d\n\nThe Salude facility is designed to be affordable when compared to higher acuity settings such as hospitals, says Silva.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest issues for healthcare going forward is facilities cost so much money that it drives up the cost of care,\u201d he says.\n\nWhereas a hospital might be $700 per foot to build, Salude is $220, according to Silva\u2019s estimations.\n\nLooking ahead, Fillmore Capital Partners has identified as many as 20 different sites to potentially develop future Salude facilities.\n\n\u201cThis facility might not be the answer for rural America, but it is a viable concept for urban, suburban and regional hospital systems that need a recovery unit,\u201d says Silva.\n\nTo manage the various Salude facilities, Fillmore Capital Partners plans to team with other senior living companies to handle operations.\n\n\u201cWe will build [Salude] for other companies that we have respect for their operating prowess,\u201d Silva says. \u201cWe\u2019ll also help them with their business model as well.\u201d\n\nThe first Salude facility will celebrate a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Suwanee location July 8 and will welcome its first patients two days later.\n\nWritten by Jason Oliva", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "fillmore capital partners, golden living, salude, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "A private investment firm with experience in the hospitality, healthcare and senior housing industries is planning to reinvent transitional care by blending cutting edge design with the services and operations of each all under one roof.
