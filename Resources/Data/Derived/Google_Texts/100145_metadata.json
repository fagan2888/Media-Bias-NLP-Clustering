My mistake. That was last year. This year he\u2019s Caitlyn, meaning that he\u2019s transformed himself into a woman.\n\nThis does not happen every day, you know. Most people, in this country at least, stick to what they know.\n\nA man knows he\u2019s a man. A woman knows she\u2019s a woman. This used to be so simple. Now we have to guess.\n\nThanks to Liberals and their Progressive agenda, no girl or woman is safe anywhere in America particularly at school.\n\nPrivacy is out. Modesty is forbidden. Big Brother is watching. From the moment the Obama Administration ordered all public schools to allow transgender people to use any shower or bathroom facility -- boys must be permitted to undress with girls and girls with boys -- Big Brother has got you covered everywhere you go.\n\nYour life, your comings and goings belong to the Government in what amounts to a war on women under this new policy enacted by Liberals.\n\nThe washroom used to be a zone of safety for women, so when Jewish sophomore Eliana Kopley ran for her life when she was being pursued by SJP and BDS Jihadist brutes at UC-Irvine \u2013 where was she supposed to hide when any Islamist crazed goon has the same rights to access the same ladies\u2019 room?\n\nObama meant it when he talked about changing the very foundation of this country -- meaning that no longer does this land belong to you and me. It belongs to him and it belongs to Loretta Lynch, his attorney general, who came on TV to heatedly equate the transgender movement to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nCase closed.\n\nSo don\u2019t you dare argue that your privacy rights come first. This makes you a bigot. Progressives will accuse you of this using hysteria rather than logic.\n\nThey need a cause. Without a cause, Progressives lose the means to hammer us with guilt and they lose their think tank foundations and all that money.\n\nSo as I have it figured, one fine day, a slow day, they sat around in search of something suitable to ruin the country\u2026a new cause.\n\nThe old causes were not doing so well. The healthcare thing? Obamacare? Not good. It\u2019s been a bust. Global warming? Also getting old and tiresome. Immigration and open borders? Americans were starting to resist, especially with Trump reminding us that the wrong people were getting in.\n\nThe attempts to diminish Israel and to humiliate its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 these too were missteps that backfired.\n\n\n\nAs one specialist explained, in a typical school of 2,000 kids, two will likely be transgender. Two!\n\nThen, to top it off, Obama\u2019s most trusted advisor, Ben Rhodes, confirmed what we always suspected, that the Iran Nuke Deal was a farce from the word go.\n\nYes we were tricked.\n\nSo they had to find something else to bamboozle us, something fresh, and along came Bruce Jenner making headlines for becoming a woman.\n\nNow here was a minority in search of a Progressive cause. Were there more like him \u2013 or her? Yes, the most acceptable figure is 700,000.\n\nThat\u2019s how many people there are in America who move from gender to gender and if that sounds like a fraction of the country \u2013 well it is.\n\nThe rest of us number 320 million, so to appease less than one percent of the population, all us have to relinquish our rights to privacy.\n\nBut a cause is a cause and without a cause Progressives have no reason to go on living.\n\nAs one specialist explained, in a typical school of 2,000 kids, two will likely be transgender. Two!\n\nSo if that\u2019s your daughter in the public washroom or shower and you see a man about to enter, you have no right to stop him.\n\nThe law is on his side. All he has to say is, \u201cToday, I am a woman.\u201d\n\nSo we are all in this together, every single American. It began with Bruce Jenner and ends with an Obama legacy leading us all down the same toilet.\n\nNew York-based bestselling American novelist Jack Engelhard writes a regular column for Arutz Sheva.
