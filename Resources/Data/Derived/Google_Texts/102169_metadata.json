Still, a federal exchange grant that runs through December 2015 will help Gov. Terry McAuliffe accomplish his mission of marketing health care options to the masses. Right now, it\u2019s all federal funding, but the governor wants to use state funds for the cause, too.\n\nIn October, the Department of Medical Assistance Services signed a $2 million contract with Richmond-based Big River Advertising for a \u201cdesign, production and marketing campaign to effectively target Virginians who are uninsured or underinsured and eligible for health insurance through the federal health insurance marketplace, Medicaid, or Child Health Insurance Program,\u201d according to the commonwealth\u2019s online procurement records.\n\nThrough radio ads, online banner ads and television ads, Big River is trying to boost the name ID of Cover Virginia, the state website that directs people to check their eligibility for health programs and subsidies on the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cThose materials focus on two messages for Virginians: the consumer assistance is available to help with the application process and that plans on the (federally facilitated marketplace) are affordable,\u201d DMAS said through spokesman Craig Markva.\n\nSome states, like Oregon, have gone all out with their marketing campaigns. The Cover Oregon exchange, which eventually failed, launched perhaps the most hipster and trippy TV campaign, with flying people.\n\nAfter state House and Senate Republicans earlier this year deflated McAuliffe\u2019s campaign pledge to expand Medicaid to new populations, the governor announced a smattering of moderate changes to health care programs for low-income Virginians.\n\nOne of those changes included leveraging state and federal funds to raise eligibility awareness with the goal of enrolling an additional 35,000 children in FAMIS, the state\u2019s program for children, and 160,000 people in the federal health insurance marketplace.\n\nMcAuliffe said he\u2019s hoping for up to $14 million in federal funds, but didn\u2019t specify how much will come from state coffers.\n\n\u201cThis outreach campaign will inform Virginians about coverage options that are already available through the federal marketplace, Medicaid and FAMIS,\u201d McAuliffe said at the time.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "The goal is to make people aware of what government-funded health care they may be eligible for.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The goal is to make people aware of what government-funded health care they may be eligible for.", "title": "Federal Taxpayers Help Virginia Make $2-million Health Care Advertising Push", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10669310_894001243958453_57378787904695661_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-07T13:00:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KeDvyq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The goal is to make people aware of what government-funded health care they may be eligible for.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10669310_894001243958453_57378787904695661_o.jpg"}, "title": "Federal Taxpayers Help Virginia Make $2-million Health Care Advertising Push", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "medicaid", "published_time": "2015-01-07T03:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-07T13:00:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Terry McAuliffe, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb590\"", "article_summary": "Terry McAuliffe accomplish his mission of marketing health care options to the masses.\nFederal taxpayers are pitching in $2 million for a marketing campaign to make sure Virginians eligible for government-subsidized health care know how to enroll.\nOne of those changes included leveraging state and federal funds to raise eligibility awareness with the goal of enrolling an additional 35,000 children in FAMIS, the state\u2019s program for children, and 160,000 people in the federal health insurance marketplace.\nMcAuliffe said he\u2019s hoping for up to $14 million in federal funds, but didn\u2019t specify how much will come from state coffers.\n\u201cThis outreach campaign will inform Virginians about coverage options that are already available through the federal marketplace, Medicaid and FAMIS,\u201d McAuliffe said at the time."}
