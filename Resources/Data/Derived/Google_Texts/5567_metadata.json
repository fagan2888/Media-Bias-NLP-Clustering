A 12-year-old girl in Milwaukee experienced just that when her mom found out she was plotting a fight on a fake Facebook page.\n\nLorraine Walls was not a very happy mother when she found out her daughter, Luticia Green, created a fake Facebook identity after being forbidden from using the site. Green had been suspended for bullying and starting fights at school, and the Facebook freeze was her punishment.\n\n\u201cShe had got caught sneaking a page on Facebook, twice,\u201d Walls said. \u201cShe had already snuck back on Facebook, talking to some young guy, and plotting a fight with her friend.\n\nWhen Walls figured out what was going on, she decided to teach her daughter a lesson by recording a video of her daughter apologizing for her bad behavior and publicly stating that she can no longer have a Facebook page or a boyfriend.\n\nAlthough many have praised Walls for disciplining her child in this viral video, she has received backlash for statements like, \u201cthe next time she\u2019s on Facebook and I catch her on Facebook, I\u2019m beating the hell out of her.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on CNN, Walls said that she would never actually hurt her daughter.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get whoopings,\u201d Walls clarified. \u201cShe\u2019s not getting beat, she\u2019s not getting abused.\u201d\n\nWalls, like any good parent, says she just wants the best for her daughter. Hopefully the 12-year-old learned her lesson.\n\nWatch the video below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Every child gets caught doing something stupid at some point, but not all of them get publicly humiliated for it on Facebook.
