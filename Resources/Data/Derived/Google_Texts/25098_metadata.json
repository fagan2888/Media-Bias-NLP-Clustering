They\u2019ll say the GOP\u2019s true leaders, our nation\u2019s future leadership, revealed itself in all its splendid, futile glory\u2014only to be stabbed in the back by a \u201cthundering herd of chicken-hearted Republicans in Name Only (RINOs) galloping to the Left.\u201d\n\nIf you asked me, I would say that we witnessed a recrudescence of a nihilistic tendency that has never been far from the surface in American politics\u2014a conservatism that is as far from the dictionary definition of conservatism as Obama is from being a socialist. Last fall, on the eve of the election, I wrote in Salon that \u201cAmerica is becoming more multicultural, more gay-friendly and more feminist every day. But as every hunter knows, a wounded or cornered quarry is the most dangerous. Even as the white, patriarchal, Christian hegemony declines, its backlash politics become more vicious.\u201d Was it vicious enough to strap a figurative suicide vest to its chest and threaten the U.S. with default? If you had asked me at the time, I would have said no. Little did I know.\n\nSome of the Republican jihadists who pressed for default feel so personally violated by the presence of a black family in the White House that they would just as soon burn it down as reclaim it. And some live in such a bubble of denial\u2014an alternate cognitive universe in which the poor lord it over the rich and white Christians are a persecuted minority, in which a president who was twice elected by an overwhelming popular majority is a pretender, and a law that Congress attempted to overturn more than 40 times was \u201cnever debated\u201d\u2014that they have convinced themselves that a default would have actually been a good thing, that it would have restored the U.S. economy to a sound foundation.\n\nIt is a triumph not so much of a conspiracy as of conspiracist thinking. As John Judis wrote in The New Republic last week, even \u201clobbyists I talked to cited\u2026.Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay on \u2018The Paranoid Style in American Politics\u2019 to explain the rise of the populist right. It\u2019s the kind of reference you\u2019d expect to read in a New Republic article, but not necessarily in a conversation with a business lobbyist.\u201d\n\nLest I be accused of falling for a left wing conspiracy theory myself, I want to say a few words about \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d before I continue. \u201cConspiracy theory\u201d is a loaded and frankly a bad term, one that unfairly besmirches any and all theorizing about conspiracies.\n\nBracketing all thinking about conspiracies with tall tales and outright delusions about secret societies whose leaders toast each other with blood drunk out of human skulls is unfair and misleading. Some anti-government conspiracy theories\u2014that the Tonkin Gulf Incident didn\u2019t happen as reported, for example, or that the CIA was involved with international dope dealers, are so far from being ridiculous that they turn out to be true. The NSA does have access to your emails. For that matter, a certain amount of toasting with skulls (if not actual blood) has been reliably reported to go on in some quarters.\n\nStill, there are theories and then there are theories. Scientists know the difference between unfalsifiable ones like intelligent design and genuinely scientific ones like evolution. Theories about political conspiracies are harder to put to the test; absence of evidence, as Donald Rumsfeld once said, is not evidence of absence. In fact it\u2019s the whole point.\n\nI do think most people know the difference between a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d in its pejorative sense\u2014say, that the Fed takes its orders from a secret society of Jewish elders, who cause depressions and wars to further their plan of ruling the world\u2014and its literal sense, such as a serious inquiry into Oswald\u2019s relationship to the CIA.\n\nStill, truth can be stranger than fiction and we need to respect that.\n\nIf I were to tell you that a cabal of Congressional Republicans had been quietly working with a roster of little-known political organizations since the last election, many of them funded by a pair of shadowy billionaire brothers, to bring the country to the brink of financial ruin, I\u2019d understand it if you thought I was talking about a conspiracy theory. But really I\u2019d be describing the sausage making that goes on in politics today and the blurry lines between lobbying and influence peddling\u2014and even more than that, about the behavior of people who are so blinded by rage, so driven by their own fever dreams about Obama\u2019s plot to turn the U.S. into a Third-World, multi-racial, socialist, Muslim, atheist paradise, that they would pay any cost to ruin his presidency.\n\nBut if there is still any question about what a bad conspiracy theory is, I\u2019d like to submit as Exhibit A one proposed by an anonymous author at the Canadian website Press Core, which was promoted a couple of weeks ago by World Net Daily columnist and Fox News contributor Erik Rush (sometimes known as \u201cthe other Rush\u201d) on his radio show. Part of what makes it a classically \u201cbad\u201d conspiracy theory, besides its tendentiousness, is its meanness. It\u2019s like a push poll; its sole purpose is to propagate a meme that demonizes and delegitimizes the president. I think it also provides insight into the mindset that characterizes far-right thinking these days.\n\nThe Navy Yard shootings in D.C., this theory goes, was a false flag incident perpetrated by the Obama administration to stop the Navy from arresting the president for treason. The victims of the shooting, who were all NCIS commanders, the story continues, had discovered that Obama was planning an even more horrific false flag\u2014he was going to explode a nuclear device in Washington, D.C., to justify going to war with Syria. Some of this \u201csounds like a conspiracy theory,\u201d the other Rush admitted, but \u201ca lot of stuff that seemed to some of us like conspiracy theories years ago turned out to be true over the last few months.\u201d\n\nOne way to judge a theory is to look at its source. Is it a generally respected news gatherer or a propaganda mill? Scanning the headlines at Press Core, I couldn\u2019t help noticing another article, this one with the byline Paul W. Kincaid, the site\u2019s editor. The piece reveals that the Vatican, the U.N., and the Third Reich have been working together on a covert and sinister plan to exterminate, and I am quoting now, \u201cas many as 3 billion people through Vatican unholy wars of terror against Muslim and Jewish states, designer diseases, and famine.\u201d\n\nThis story really astounded me, because it sees both Jews and Muslims as victims rather than perpetrators. That\u2019s not what you usually read on websites of this kind, trust me. Some of the most virulently anti-Islamic websites today, many of them run by Jews, feature stories that could have been written by 1930s anti-Semites like Elizabeth Dilling or Gerald Burton Winrod, except the word Shariah replaces the word Kehilla, and instead of out-of-context quotes from the Talmud about the necessity of lying to the gentiles they are pulled from the Koran and refer to the supposed doctrine of Tawriya. Of course a major theme at those sites is Obama\u2019s suspicious sympathies toward the Muslim world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conservative mindset is in decline.
