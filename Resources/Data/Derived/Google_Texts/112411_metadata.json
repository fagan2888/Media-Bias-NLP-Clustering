But Time magazine reports that several caveats overlooked by many have weakened the law.\n\n\u201cThe requirement to have health insurance under Obamacare packs less of a punch than many Americans assume,\u201d Time reports.\n\nThe law is largely toothless in its first year for three reasons, Time says:\n\n--The fine for failure to buy insurance is prorated to the time that a person is uninsured and is based on earnings above the federal income tax filing limit, which was $10,000 in 2013. The fines will go up next year, but this year they\u2019re relatively small.\n\n--There are lots of exemptions. There are loopholes that exempt Native Americans, prisoners, people with religious objections, those who are poor by several different measures, the homeless, people facing foreclosure, those who have had a utility shut off for non-payment, the bankrupt, victims of disaster, victims of domestic violence and others.\n\n--There is little to no enforcement of the law\u2019s mandates on individuals and families. The uninsured can\u2019t be criminally prosecuted or incarcerated for refusal to pay fines and the IRS can\u2019t place liens on property as a result of non-payment. The only method of enforcement of penalties is the withholding of the sum of the penalty from tax refunds. Those who don't receive refunds may escape the penalty entirely, TIME reports.\n\nThe first open enrollment period ended Monday night. The next opportunity to enroll begins when open enrollment resumes in November.\n\nREAD TIME\u2019S ANALYSIS HERE\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "Loads of Obamacare exemptions, loopholes mean those who don't buy insurance are unlikely to be penalized", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Loads of Obamacare exemptions, loopholes mean those who don\\u0027t buy insurance are unlikely to be penalized\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2014/04/loads_of_obamacare_exemptions.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/capturejpg-22949d857904528a.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12561270\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-01T14:39:46Z\", \"author\": \"Stan Diel\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"affordable care act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/capturejpg-22949d857904528a.jpg", "creator": "@Stan_Diel", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The only real enforcement mechanism is withholding of tax refund, TIME reports"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, April 01, 2014,  9:46 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/wire/photo/capturejpg-22949d857904528a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"srdiel\", \"author_nickname\": \"Stan Diel\", \"author_id\": \"1941\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from AL.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "The only real enforcement mechanism is withholding of tax refund, TIME reports", "title": "Loads of Obamacare exemptions, loopholes mean those who don't buy insurance are unlikely to be penalized", "url": "http://blog.al.com/wire/2014/04/loads_of_obamacare_exemptions.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/capturejpg-22949d857904528a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, April 01, 2014,  9:38 AM", "article_author": "Stan Diel", "Description": "The only real enforcement mechanism is withholding of tax refund, TIME reports"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcdc\"", "article_summary": "The only method of enforcement of penalties is the withholding of the sum of the penalty from tax refunds.\n\u201cThe requirement to have health insurance under Obamacare packs less of a punch than many Americans assume,\u201d Time reports.\nThe individual mandate that requires Americans to buy health insurance or face penalties under the Affordable Care Act is basically toothless, at least for this year, a new analysis shows.\nThose who don't receive refunds may escape the penalty entirely, TIME reports.\nThe mandate, which is among the law\u2019s most unpopular provisions, states that those without insurance must pay a penalty of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater."}
