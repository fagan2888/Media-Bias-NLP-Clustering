I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d\n\nHe wants the debate to be focused around Obamacare and what they would each replace it with. Jindal told WaPo that \u201cwe\u2019ve written our own plan and campaigned on it, rather than just complaining about Obamacare,\u201d even taking some shots at Cruz for \u201cwant[ing] to shut the government down.\n\nNow, this might seem like a somewhat desperate move, seeing as how Jindal is polling way below Cruz and is in the undercard debate next week, but it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s honed in on the Texas senator. He took some shots at Cruz months ago for leeching onto Donald Trump in the hopes of getting his supporters once he falters, and more recently pressed Cruz on his silence about Trump\u2019s health care plan.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bobby Jindal yesterday threw down the gauntlet to try and challenge Ted Cruz to a one-on-one debate.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cruz-jindal.jpg", "title": "Bobby Jindal Wants to Go One-on-One with Ted Cruz"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bobby Jindal yesterday threw down the gauntlet to try and challenge Ted Cruz to a one-on-one debate.", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cruz-jindal.jpg", "title": "Bobby Jindal Wants to Go One-on-One with Ted Cruz", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "online,print", "date": "2015-11-07T11:09:41+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bobby Jindal yesterday threw down the gauntlet to try and challenge Ted Cruz to a one-on-one debate.\nWell, in speaking to The Washington Post yesterday, Jindal said, \u201cHe said he\u2019ll debate anyone, anytime, so let\u2019s do it in Milwaukee.\nIn the wake of the widely-panned CNBC debate, Cruz declined to sign the joint GOP letter to networks, saying he would be willing to debate anyone, anytime, anywhere.\nI\u2019m happy to do it.\u201dHe wants the debate to be focused around Obamacare and what they would each replace it with.\nJindal told WaPo that \u201cwe\u2019ve written our own plan and campaigned on it, rather than just complaining about Obamacare,\u201d even taking some shots at Cruz for \u201cwant[ing] to shut the government down."}
