The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is beginning a review of twenty six hundred drug cases, including many from the Florida panhandle..

The review comes after a chemist in its Pensacola Crime Lab is suspected of swapping prescription drugs in evidence with over the counter pills.

FDLE Commissioner Gerald Bailey says his agency is stunned by what appears to be criminal activity.

The cases date back to 2006 when the chemist was hired.

He has been placed on administrative leave, is expected to be fired once all of the facts are know, and will likely face criminal charges. Cases affected cover 35 counties including all in northwest Florida.
