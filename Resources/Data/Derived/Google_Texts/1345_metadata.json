And driven by either agenda or ignorance, they don\u2019t even remember that at one time they were all champions of the same religious freedom they are now against. The SCOTUS ruling is not about contraception, but instead it affirms a law dating back to 1993. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a law, \u201cto protect the free exercise of religion,\u201d according to the U.S. Senate. Specifically, the purpose of the law is \u201cto provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is burdened by government.\u201d That is the crux of the Hobby Lobby claim. Congress passed this law almost unanimously.\n\nThe RFRA was introduced following an unpopular SCOTUS decision curbing the religious freedom of Native Americans to use peyote. Congressman Charles Schumer introduced the bill in March 1993, a time when liberals were strongly in favor of religious freedom. The bill was cosponsored by many of the same Democrats braying the loudest about the SCOTUS decision, including Rosa DeLorio, Luis Gutierrez, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters. The Senate passed this bill by a vote of 97-3. Voting in favor were Senators Biden, Boxer, Feinstein, Reid, and Mikulski among many others. What a difference a couple of decades makes. Harry Reid was in favor of religious freedom before he was against it. Voting for the RFRA in 1993, he is now indignant that the SCOTUS upheld the same law he voted for. Ditto Nancy Pelosi, who is fussing about \u201ca gross violation of workers\u2019 religious rights.\u201d What religious rights are being violated? Are the Hobby Lobby workers members of a religion with a commandment, \u201cThou shall be provided abortifacients paid for by someone else\u201d? Or is it the employer whose religious rights are being violated \u2013 \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d \u2013 by making him or her purchase these drugs for employees? Hillary Clinton also found the Hobby Lobby decision \u201cdeeply disturbing.\u201d How ironic that her husband, in November 1993, signed the RFRA into law, and when upheld 20 years later, she finds it disturbing. At the signing, then-President Bill Clinton remarked, \u201cWe all have a shared desire here to protect perhaps the most precious of all American liberties, religious freedom.\u201d He also noted that \u201cour laws and institutions should not impede or hinder but rather should protect and preserve fundamental religious liberties.\u201d Commenting on the Founders, he observed that they \u201cknew that there needed to be a space of freedom between Government and people of faith that otherwise Government might usurp.\u201d Perhaps if Mrs. Clinton had been at home baking cookies and having tea, she might have heard her husband\u2019s thoughtful comments at the time. Instead, she was making a killing on cattle futures, missing out on the passage of an important religious freedom law, and is now \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d about it. Aside from liberal politicians who are frequently for something before they are against it, even the NY Times changed its tune, as pointed out by James Taranto. In 1993 they were trumpeting the RFRA, but this week they are against it. \u201cThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act reasserts a broadly accepted American concept of giving wide latitude to religious practices that many might regard as odd or unconventional,\u201d the Times crowed in 1993. Fast forward 20 years, and the NY Times lost the religion they got in 1993, clearly upset over the \u201cdeeply dismaying decision on Monday in the Hobby Lobby case.\u201d \u201cReligious freedom\u201d served political purposes 20 years ago, but today\u2019s meme is \u201cwar on women\u201d attached to speechmaking and fundraising. So now religious freedom is in the eye of the beholder, based on the political winds of the day. If Democrats were so concerned that contraceptive coverage be part of the ObamaCare mandates, they could have inserted that into the original law. ObamaCare passed on a party-line vote, and regardless of what was in the law, Republicans had no means to stop it. But their \u201csituational outrage\u201d against a Supreme Court decision provides a nice distraction from the real problems with ObamaCare, such as this week\u2019s revelation: \u201cFederal officials can\u2019t resolve 85 percent of 2.9 million 'inconsistencies' on applications for Obamacare even after nine months of trying.\u201d Don\u2019t expect the mainstream press to notice politicians reversing their opinions. The media\u2019s parallel opinions change as fast as those of the politicians they cover.
