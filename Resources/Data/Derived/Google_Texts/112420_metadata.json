First in a series\n\nBy Giana Magnoli and Lara Cooper, Noozhawk Staff Writers | @NoozhawkNews | Published on 09.09.2013 11:20 p.m.\n\n[Noozhawk's note: This article is part of a Noozhawk special project for The California Endowment Health Journalism Fellowships, a program of USC's Annenberg School for Communcation & Journalism.]\n\n[Click here for a gallery of photos from the series.]\n\nRicardo sat in an examination room at the Eastside Neighborhood Clinic in Santa Barbara on a recent afternoon, explaining that swelling in his left leg has been bothering him.\n\nA local taxi driver in his 30s, Ricardo told Dr. Neil Sullivan that he\u2019s having weight problems, and the swelling gets worse when he tries to exercise.\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | About This Series |\n\nSullivan, who has worked at the Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics for 31 years, explained to Ricardo that Latinos have a higher chance of developing what\u2019s known as metabolic syndrome, and weight gain makes it worse.\n\nRicardo, who asked that his last name not be used for this story, is emblematic of many patients who come into the clinic at 915 N. Milpas St.; they complain of one issue, but their entire health picture is more complicated.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things going on,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\n\n\nAfter an exam showed Sullivan that Ricardo\u2019s legs were filling with fluid, he asked a nurse to set up an EKG for him.\n\nSansum Clinic donates EKGs and radiology services to the neighborhood clinics, a service that is crucial for Ricardo, who has neither Medi-Cal nor private insurance to cover the cost of such a test.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, he\u2019d be up a creek,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to pay $2,000 for an EKG if you don\u2019t have insurance or Medi-Cal.\u201d\n\nSullivan told Ricardo that he\u2019s overweight and his heart is pumping too hard. He ordered a chest X-ray, also free from Sansum, a stress test of Ricardo\u2019s heart, and he gave him some pills for the swelling in his legs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the classic case of what\u2019s going on in the clinics,\u201d Sullivan remarked. \u201cIf someone needs care, you can\u2019t just not treat them. You have to treat every patient the same, but you don\u2019t have the same resources.\u201d\n\nThe Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics are one piece in Santa Barbara County\u2019s network of care for low-income, indigent and undocumented people, and agencies work together to improve the overall health of the Central Coast community.\n\n\u201cProviding care to our entire population from our top to bottom is vital in terms of public health issues,\u201d said Gary Gray, former board chairman of Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics.\n\nSBNC operates three medical clinics and one dental clinic on the South Coast, and mostly serves patients who have Medi-Cal, Medicare or no insurance at all.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about pure charity, this is about taking care of the entire community in a way that makes it healthier, stronger and more vibrant,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI mean, if you have people who are walking around really ill, it is not good for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nThe Neighborhood Clinics work closely with the county Public Health Department to provide primary care for low-income patients on the South Coast. The Public Health Department similarly relies on Marian Regional Medical Center clinics as partners in the North County.\n\nSBNC refers patients to Sansum Clinic for specialty care, as Sullivan did for Ricardo.\n\nThrough digitized records, and a new Patient-Centered Medical Home model, a primary-care doctor will have a caseload of patients and get informed of any outside care \u2014 hospital visits, laboratory work \u2014 via the electronic health-care record system.\n\nThe records also can send prescriptions directly to the patients' pharmacy of choice.\n\nIt's a system used by Charles Condelos, 75, of Santa Barbara, who regularly visits the Neighborhood Clinics to renew his prescription for back pain medication and get checked out.\n\nThe online system double-checks prescriptions against the patient\u2019s age, other drugs and conditions, asking the doctors if they\u2019re certain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to know that, but it\u2019s a good reminder,\u201d said Dr. Charles Fenzi, chief medical officer for the Neighborhood Clinics.\n\nThe Public Health Department is getting networked with Cottage Health System, Marian Regional Medical Center and the Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics, so all digital health records can be easily shared among them.\n\nHealth care \u201chas been fragmented because we don\u2019t communicate, so technology hopefully will make that a lot easier,\u201d said Elizabeth Snyder, deputy director of primary care for the Public Health Department.\n\nThe county\u2019s eight clinics primarily serve patients who are uninsured, have public insurance like Medi-Cal, or are in the county-sponsored Medically Indigent Adult program.\n\nThe clinics provide primary and specialty care, and many private-practice doctors volunteer their time weekly, in addition to Cottage Health System's residency programs for physicians.\n\nThe county clinics serve 31,000 patients a year, with 120,000 patient visits. That averages out to 328 visits every day of the year.\n\nThroughout the county, the biggest medical issue is women\u2019s health, including obstetrics, gynecology and family planning.\n\nIn Santa Maria, Marian Regional Medical Center has about 250 births a month, and 70 percent to 75 percent of all obstetrics cases are Medi-Cal or emergency Medi-Cal patients, said Sue Anderson, the hospital's chief financial officer.\n\nThe other major diagnoses in the county are diabetes, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a common lung ailment.\n\nWith the current system, patients without insurance only go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick, and they often choose the easiest, nearest option \u2014 the local emergency room.\n\nThat is the most expensive way to provide care, and a big part of federal health-care reform is to encourage patients to use urgent-care centers or clinics, Andersen said.\n\n\u201cWe have close to 6,000 ER visits a month now, and a good portion of those are people who don\u2019t have primary-care physicians and use the ER as their primary place of service,\" she said. \"That\u2019s a very costly way of providing services, obviously.\u201d\n\nOften, those patients could be eligible for programs, but they get frustrated with the complex enrollment process, Snyder said.\n\n\u201cI think they get irritated with how complicated it is, and know they have to be seen in the ER,\u201d she said.\n\nThroughout the county, there are efforts to expand after-hours care and access while conducting programs to prevent patients from using the emergency room as a provider of last resort.\n\nAs federally qualified health-care centers, the county clinics must take all comers, as well. To help give access to walk-in appointments, primary-care physicians keep a certain number of appointments free every day, Snyder said.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, promotes a move back to a care model called the Patient-Centered Medical Home.\n\nWith this approach, a group of patients is assigned to a team of specialists led by a primary-care physician who is managing the care.\n\n\u201cRight now, services are episodic, and only when people get sick,\u201d said Suzanne Jacobson, chief financial officer for the county Public Health Department./\u201cThat\u2019s been the county safety net: keeping people from getting really ill and trying to keep people out of the emergency room,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut with the Patient-Centered Medical Home, it\u2019s bringing people in and actually having funding to keep them well, and actually give them the same kind of coverage and access to service that those of us with insurance have. That\u2019s going to be different, I think.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s emphasis on preventative care is backed up by the individual mandate that requires all taxpayers to have health insurance. It also is intended to end insurance company discrimination against consumers with pre-existing conditions.\n\nWith the expansion of Medi-Cal eligibility and subsidies for the state exchange plans, thousands of Santa Barbara residents are expected to get insurance who weren\u2019t eligible before, which will have significant impacts on the demand on local primary-care facilities.\n\nThe Public Health Department is preparing for 6,000 more people to be enrolled in Medi-Cal by the implementation date of Jan. 1, and has pre-registration plans rolling out in October. CenCal Health, the county's Medi-Cal administrator, is preparing for 30,000 people to enroll within the first 18 months of the health-care law taking effect in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | Complete Series Index |\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writers Giana Magnoli and Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) and .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) , respectively.
