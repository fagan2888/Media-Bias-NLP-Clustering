Their careers have inspired Native American tribal members throughout the U.S.\n\nMembers of the Creek Nation, an Okmulgee, Okla.-based tribe, are among those who have taken an interest in the career of Schimmels. Shoni is regarded as one of the premier players in women\u2019s college basketball. Jude is a part-time starter.\n\nThe Creek Nation arranged for two charter buses carrying 118 people, including Creek Nation Chief George Tiger, to watch the Schimmels lead Louisville against SMU.\n\nTiger said he saw members of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas at the game in addition to Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma citizens. The night before, the Schimmels\u2019 parents, Rick and Ceci, delivered a motivational seminar for the Creek Nation.\n\nDiane Jobe Buck of Edmond, Okla., made the 500-mile trip to watch the Schimmels play basketball. Shoni is the team\u2019s leading scorer, averaging about 17 points per game.\n\n\u201c[Shoni] is a classic example of Native athleticism,\u201d Buck said. \u201cWe have many Natives that have talent but aren\u2019t able to take advantage of their skills.\n\n\u201cShe has and has done so in a way that inspires people. Plus, she is so humble and respects Native people from all over.\u201d\n\nSchimmel scored 12 points to lead No. 5 Louisville to an 81-66 victory. Jude did not play.\n\n\u201cAt Creek Nation, we always want to support our student-athletes,\u201d Tiger said. \u201cThe Schimmel sisters have been role models and they\u2019ve brought a lot of togetherness among Native people.\u201d\n\nFollow @tommycummings\n\nzp8497586rq", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAxL29rbGFob21hLXRyaWJlLXNlbmRzLXR3by1idXNsb2Fkcy1vZi1jaXRpemVucy10by13YXRjaC1sb3Vpc3ZpbGxlcy1zaG9uaS1zY2hpbW1lbC1wbGF5LXNtdS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tommy Cummings", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Two busloads of Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma citizens were at Moody Coliseum today -- but not to cheer on the women's basketball team that's geographically closest to them.
