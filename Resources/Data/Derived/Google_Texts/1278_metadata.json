The main location features six exam rooms, a lab, a dispensary, a prayer room, offices, and a waiting room.\n\nVolunteers provide basic adult outpatient care for chronic problems, said Stan Neal, a retired family physician. Doctors use evaluations, exams and lab tests to diagnosis patients' ailments and then get them on a treatment plan. Volunteers who work on a regular basis even establish their own clientele, he said.\n\nCarolyn Kent was impressed with the services provided when she went to the dental clinic, needing her teeth pulled after they became infected.\n\n\"They were just as professional and wonderful as if you were paying them a hundred bucks a tooth,\" she said.\n\nSalem Free Clinics began when Gould was serving as West Salem Foursquare Church's outreach pastor. The church surveyed West Salem's Edgewater district to find out what the community needed.\n\nGould said he expected to be giving out food, clothing and diapers but was shocked that 70 percent of residents said their greatest need was health care.\n\nBuy Photo Registered nurse and diabetes educator Mary Tavares demonstrates Wednesday, Jan. 21, how to use an insulin pen to patient Nelson Mejia, 32, of Salem, at Salem Free Clinics.

Church leaders decided they wanted to include a medical clinic in the building they were constructing on Broadway, so they called Gould. Salem Free Clinics moved in September 2010.\n\nThe expansion allowed the ministry to grow sixfold and begin offering dental care and counseling, Gould said.\n\nTo capitalize on the building, the clinic needed money. It sent several letters to foundations, requesting grant applications. The only response was a letter and $50,000 check from the Hahn Foundation, Gould said.\n\n\"It allowed us to even dream the dream of growing,\" he said.\n\nBuy Photo Patient Shawn Nelson, 28, of Keizer, has an EKG performed by Lisa Kroes, a licensed practical nurse, at the Salem Free Clinics on Broadway Street NE on Wednesday, Jan. 21.

It has never had excess, though, Gould said with a chuckle.\n\nJM Keckler Medical Co. offered to donate six exam rooms' worth of medical equipment if someone would drive to Oakdale, Calif., to pick it up. The clinic just happened to have six exam rooms that needed outfitting.\n\n\"There are so many things that came together that are just absolutely providential,\" Gould said.\n\nFaith is the foundation of the clinic. Many of the volunteers \"do what (they) do as an expression of the love of Christ,\" Gould said.\n\nThat love is evident to patients visiting the clinic.\n\n\"They're practicing their faith, and that's the marvelous thing,\" Kent said. \"I think that's why you feel so good going in.\"\n\nSeventy-six area churches send volunteers and support the clinic, but it's not necessary for volunteers or patients to be Christians.\n\nToward the beginning of each visit, patients are asked if they'd like to have someone pray with them. Gould said 40 percent of patients accept the offer, which identified for him the link between health and spirituality.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act went into effect, there was a perception in the community that free clinics would no longer be necessary.\n\nClinic leaders knew that wouldn't be the case and proactively reached out to communities they could better serve.\n\nWhile several regional free clinics closed due to a drop in patient volume, Salem Free Clinics saw only a 4.5 percent decline.\n\nAt one time, the clinic turned away 800 patients a month and booked appointments two weeks out. Now they're able to serve every patient who asks and schedule them for an appointment four days later.\n\n\"People can actually access care much more readily than ever before,\" Gould said.\n\nThey worked diligently to help patients who became eligible for the Oregon Health Plan seamlessly transition to primary care providers.\n\nBefore the federal health care reform law, patient population demographics were consistent. That changed dramatically in 2014. Suddenly, Latino patients made up 40 percent of the population and Pacific Islanders 8 percent, Gould said.\n\nThe clinic now serves many undocumented-immigrant workers, who don't qualify for insurance, and citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands, who legally live in the U.S. but aren't guaranteed medical benefits.\n\nAs a result, the clinic had to double the size of their interpreter team and change all of their systems.\n\nThis year, the clinic will work to solidify their new systems while looking for populations that aren't being served.\n\nThe board will spend the next four to five months looking for a new executive director. After serving as the director since the clinic's beginnings, Gould is moving out of town and getting married.\n\nGould said he hopes the new leader will be passionate about the clinic's mission and have the relational capacity to be able to keep the clinic running as a volunteer-led nonprofit.\n\nJohn McConville, who's been volunteering since 2012, is serving as director in the interim.\n\n\"The clinic's best days are yet to come,\" Gould said.\n\nkhessel@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6743 or follow on Twitter @KaellenHessel\n\nRead or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/1JCuE6F", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A Salem medical clinic celebrates major milestones a year after coverage became available through the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Statesman Journal", "description": "A Salem medical clinic celebrates major milestones a year after coverage became available through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Salem Free Clinics celebrates 10 years, 30,000 patients", "url": "http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/local/causes/2015/01/24/salem-free-clinics-celebrates-years-patients/22289515/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/statesmanjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Salem medical clinic celebrates major milestones a year after coverage became available through the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "@salem_statesman", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bebbfd7d118db0091dec69ef9bfb086193113118/c=400-0-2000-1600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Salem/2015/01/24/B9315768723Z.1_20150124185726_000_G619O9MK5.1-0.jpg", "title": "Salem Free Clinics celebrates 10 years, 30,000 patients", "site": "@salem_statesman", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815599744", "fb": {"app_id": 138699832852944}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kaellen.hessel.7"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "While several regional free clinics closed due to a drop in patient volume, Salem Free Clinics saw only a 4.5 percent decline.\nSalem Free Clinics began when Gould was serving as West Salem Foursquare Church's outreach pastor.\nSalem Free Clinics moved in September 2010.\nBuy Photo Patient Shawn Nelson, left, 28, of Keizer, speaks with Dr. Rick Eikrem at the Salem Free Clinics on Wednesday, Jan. 21.\nBuy Photo Registered nurse and diabetes educator Mary Tavares demonstrates Wednesday, Jan. 21, how to use an insulin pen to patient Nelson Mejia, 32, of Salem, at Salem Free Clinics."}
