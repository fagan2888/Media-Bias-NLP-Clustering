If we are able to help people save their dollars, especially with the health care market the way it is now, I think it is a good service for the community.\u201d\n\nThe center will offer urgent care medical assistance for non-life-threatening concerns: minor cuts, burns and rashes; mild asthma; suspected bone fractures; sprains and strains; colds, cough and sore throat; ear, eye, skin or urinary tract infections; work or sport injuries; and the inability to get a same-day appointment with a primary care physician.\n\nNew physicians, nurses and mid-level providers, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, have been hired to staff the new urgent care space.\n\nBonello said patients will have access to urgent care every day at the Zeeland office, from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m.\n\nMarket expansion\n\nThe site in Zeeland is the second urgent care location Holland Hospital offers to the surrounding community.\n\nThe hospital also offers urgent care services on the north side of Holland at its Lakeshore Medical Campus.\n\nER referrals\n\nThose patients receiving urgent medical care who need ER services will typically be referred to Holland Hospital, depending on the type of care needed.\n\n\u201cThe exception would be if there was some type of life-threatening situation where we would need to send someone to the nearest location and then Zeeland would become the nearest location,\u201d said Bonello, referring to Zeeland Community Hospital. \u201cSome of that also depends on what kind of services they need. If someone was having a heart attack . . . they would either go to Spectrum downtown or to Holland Hospital.\u201d\n\nPhysician shortage\n\nHolland Hospital was prompted to expand its services due to the growth of urgent care nationally, which has been driven recently by Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, Bonello said.\n\nAs the insured population grows, the number of primary care physicians can\u2019t meet the demand, causing a projected influx of patients at the ER, who really are in need of urgent or primary care services.\n\nBased on current patterns, increased demand for primary care services is expected to grow by 14 percent, and the number of physicians is expected to increase by 8 percent, creating a projected shortage of 20,400 physicians by 2020, according to a 2013 report on primary care practitioners by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThere is a primary care shortage both locally and nationally, and there aren\u2019t enough primary care physicians to see the additional patients who are getting access to health care,\u201d Bonello said. \u201cWe already struggle with inappropriate visits to the emergency department. We are trying to head that off at the pass by expanding urgent care coverage to get people into a more appropriate location for minor illnesses and injuries.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A hospital has opened a second urgent care center to combat projected increases in non-essential visits to the emergency room during a physician shortage.
