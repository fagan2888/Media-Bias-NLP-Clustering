John McCain (R-AZ) garnered nearly 60 million votes in his 2008 presidential run against Barack Obama. In 2010, he won election to a fifth term in the Senate, receiving 58.7 percent of the Arizona vote. Now he\u2019s the least popular senator in the country, at least with his own constituents, according to new Arizona poll results from left-leaning Public Policy Polling.\n\nJust 30 percent of Arizonans approve of the job McCain is doing, while 54 percent disapprove, the poll found. McCain gets low approval marks from independents (25 percent) and Democrats (29 percent), but he fares only slightly better among the state\u2019s Republicans (35 percent). Arizona\u2019s state Republican Party formally censured McCain earlier this year for a \u201cdisastrous and harmful\u201d record, including support for issues like immigration reform that are \u201cassociated with liberal Democrats.\u201d\n\nRelated: McCain Censure the Latest Sign of GOP Fratricide\n\nJeff Flake, the Republican junior senator from Arizona, has a slightly lower 27 percent approval rating, the poll found, but his disapproval rating, at 47 percent, is also lower than McCain\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe low opinion both Republicans and Democrats have of John McCain now means he could be vulnerable in both the primary and the general election next time around,\u201d Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling, said in the statement accompanying the poll results. \u201cGeorge McGovern lost his Senate seat eight years after losing his presidential bid and McCain could suffer a similar fate.\u201d\n\nThe 77-year-old senator said earlier this year that he\u2019s \u201clooking very seriously\u201d at running for a sixth term in 2016. The new poll, which surveyed 870 Arizona voters from Feb. 28 to March 2, found that McCain trails in hypothetical matchups with former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Richard Carmona, the Democratic former U.S. surgeon general who lost a 2012 bid to replace the retiring Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl. He would lead in a race against former Governor Janet Napolitano.\n\nMcCain has been a sharp critic of President Obama\u2019s foreign policy, in particular, and he has also clashed with younger conservatives in the Senate, such as Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Just 30 percent of Arizonans approve of the job McCain is doing, while 54 percent disapprove, the poll found.", "title": "John McCain Is the Least Popular Senator in the Country", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/06/John-McCain-Least-Popular-Senator-Country", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08282013_Mccain_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/06/John-McCain-Least-Popular-Senator-Country", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08282013_Mccain_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Just 30 percent of Arizonans approve of the job McCain is doing, while 54 percent disapprove, the poll found.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9572\"", "article_summary": "Now he\u2019s the least popular senator in the country, at least with his own constituents, according to new Arizona poll results from left-leaning Public Policy Polling.\nSen.
