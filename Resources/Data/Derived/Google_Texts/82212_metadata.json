I just think that people, whether they\u2019re in the executive branch, legislative, or judicial branch, shouldn\u2019t see their appointment to a office as that it would be that they have permanent, no accountability whatsoever, and I also think when a person can be appointed to the Supreme Court and stay there for 40 years, my gosh, they might have outlived, you know, six or seven presidents during that course of time,\u201d Huckabee said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union program this weekend.\n\nHuckabee joins several liberals and conservatives in calling for some limit on lifetime terms enjoyed by federal judges. Senator Ted Cruz, another GOP contender, wants retention elections for the Supreme Court, while liberal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky has argued for 18-year terms for the Justices.\n\nLast fall, Chemerinsky appeared on the PBS News Hour to discuss the topic along with National Constitution Center president and CEO Jeffrey Rosen.\n\n\u201cLife expectancies thankfully are much longer today than they were in 1787, when the Constitution was written. Clarence Thomas was 43 years old when he was confirmed for the Supreme Court in 1991. If he remains until he\u2019s 90, the age which Justice Stevens stepped down, he will be a Supreme Court justice for 47 years,\u201d argued Chemerinsky.\n\nRosen explained while there were arguments for term limits, \u201cit would require a constitutional amendment. And, in practice, that\u2019s just not going to pass.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there are several significant parts of the Constitution as written in 1787, that make it difficult to change the tenure of Article III judges or remove them from office.\n\nArticle III, Section 1, of the Constitution says that federal judges, including the Supreme Court Justices, \u201cshall hold their Offices during Good Behaviour.\u201d Such judges can be tried through the impeachment process, and removed if found guilty in the Senate. But this has only happened once to a Supreme Court Justice, when the House passed impeachment articles against Samuel Chase in 1804. Chase\u2019s opponents, including Thomas Jefferson, couldn\u2019t get a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Chase in March 1805.\n\nThe other practical matter is the amendment process, which would be needed to change the Constitution. In one scenario, a super-majority of votes is needed in the House and Senate, followed by the approval of three-quarters of the states, for the Constitution to be changed.\n\nUnder a second scenario, states can ask Congress to call an amending convention, if two-thirds of the states join in such a demand. So far, though, no amendment has ever resulted from that process. And under the more traditional process, just 17 amendments have been added since 1791.\n\nA proposed constitutional amendment, to add term limits for the Justices, would need to get in line with other possible amendments, in a politically charged climate. It would also likely require that a political party control two-thirds of the House and Senate, and three-quarters of the states, unless an idea has broad non-partisan support.\n\nThe last amendment, the 27th, was ratified in 1992 and put a check on congressional pay raises during a current two-year congressional session. An amendment to change the frequency of Supreme Court appointments would likely run into a spirited political debate.\n\nTerm limits for Justices, as a practical matter, didn\u2019t seem to be considered at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote that, \u201cthe standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government,\u201d preventing \u201cdangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community.\u201d\n\nBut if an amendment were to be ratified about term limits for Justices, it wouldn\u2019t be the first amendment about term limits. The 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, placed term limits on the office of the President.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nChris Christie becomes 435th candidate to declare for 2016 election\n\nLooking back: George Carlin and the Supreme Court\n\n10 fascinating facts about the Declaration of Independence\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has renewed a call for term limits for Supreme Court Justices, but such a task would be a very tall one under the Constitution\u2019s terms.", "title": "The continuing debate over the Supreme Court and term limits", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/07/the-continuing-debate-over-the-supreme-court-and-term-limits/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gov-Huckabee-640.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gov-Huckabee-640.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-06T10:32:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T10:34:47+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Share:EmailGOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has renewed a call for term limits for Supreme Court Justices, but such a task would be a very tall one under the Constitution\u2019s terms.\nBut this has only happened once to a Supreme Court Justice, when the House passed impeachment articles against Samuel Chase in 1804.\nAn amendment to change the frequency of Supreme Court appointments would likely run into a spirited political debate.\nClarence Thomas was 43 years old when he was confirmed for the Supreme Court in 1991.\nTerm limits for Justices, as a practical matter, didn\u2019t seem to be considered at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia."}
