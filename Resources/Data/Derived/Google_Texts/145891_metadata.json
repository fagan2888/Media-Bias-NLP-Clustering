But in some instances, patients have to keep proving they are sick to keep their doctor, Brennan reported.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do at this point? Where do I go?\u201d heart patient Anthony Lucatorto told Brennan.\n\nThe 79-year-old may need a new heart and a new doctor because of new rules under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s open heart surgery, he\u2019s had both carotid arteries done, he had an aneurysm. And Dr. Hess has been here all the way,\u201d Anthony\u2019s wife Nancy Lucatorto told Brennan.\n\nRenowned Long Island cardiologist Dr. David Hess has been taking care of Lucatorto for 15 years, and now is a crucial time.\n\n\u201cHis heart function is very poor,\u201d said Dr. Hess. \u201cI\u2019m referring him to Mount Sinai for an advanced heart failure center and possible transplant or left ventricular assist device.\u201d\n\nBut Oxford UnitedHealthcare told Lucatorto he had to get a new doctor because Dr. Hess was being dropped from their plan.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy. I think they\u2019re playing with people\u2019s lives. Would they do it or treat their parents the same way that they\u2019re treating us?\u201d Nancy Lucatorto said.\n\nThe Lucatortos appealed, and the insurer said Dr. Hess could remain as Anthony\u2019s doctor. But that decision came with a catch.\n\n\u201cEvery three months, I have to attest to the insurance company as to how sick he is,\u201d Dr. Hess said. \u201cIf they believe that he\u2019s sick enough\u2026they will continue to allow him to see me on a provisional basis.\u201d\n\nHess said the new policy is a bad approach, especially for Lucatorto.\n\n\u201cTesting every three months as to how sick someone is is another bureaucratic impediment to the practice of medicine,\u201d said the cardiologist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely insane to come to people and say \u2018choose a new doctor.\u2019 The system is broken,\u201d Nancy Lucatorto said.\n\nCBS 2 reached out to UnitedHealthcare, but the insurer said they do not comment on specific cases for privacy reasons.\n\nMeantime, there\u2019s been a significant jump in enrollments for New Yorkers seeking health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMore than 76,000 people have enrolled in the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nAs of Sunday, more than 257,000 have completed applications.\n\nOfficials say the exchange has not had the repeated malfunctions experienced on the federal government\u2019s website.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurance companies say they are cutting some doctors from their plans to save money, due to the program known by some as Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/26/couple-blasts-absolutely-insane-provision-to-keep-doctor-under-affordable-care-act/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/obamacare_couple.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/obamacare_couple.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Insurance companies say they are cutting some doctors from their plans to save money, due to the program known by some as Obamacare.", "title": "Couple Blasts 'Absolutely Insane' Provision To Keep Doctor Under Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/obamacare_couple.jpg?w=625", "description": "Insurance companies say they are cutting some doctors from their plans to save money, due to the program known by some as Obamacare.", "site": "/CBSnewyork", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Couple Blasts 'Absolutely Insane' Provision To Keep Doctor Under Affordable Care Act"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic And The Best of NY", "fb": {"app_id": 148100721870411}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/50e3ae7b1a37ec6f5f022661f15b5473?s=16", "application-name": "CBS New York", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSNewYork"}, "keywords": "aca information, affordable care act, consumer, health, li news, lifestyle, local, news, ny news, radio.com - news, seen on cbs2, syndicated local, syndication, watch + listen, affordable care act, dick brennan, dr. david hess, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "bitly-verification": "98ab9c1eda26", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, dick brennan, dr. david hess, obamacare"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely insane to come to people and say \u2018choose a new doctor.\u2019 The system is broken,\u201d Nancy Lucatorto said.\nWould they do it or treat their parents the same way that they\u2019re treating us?\u201d Nancy Lucatorto said.\nAnd Dr. Hess has been here all the way,\u201d Anthony\u2019s wife Nancy Lucatorto told Brennan.\nThe 79-year-old may need a new heart and a new doctor because of new rules under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cEvery three months, I have to attest to the insurance company as to how sick he is,\u201d Dr. Hess said."}
