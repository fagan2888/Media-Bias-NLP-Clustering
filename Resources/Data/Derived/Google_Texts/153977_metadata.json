No, he\u2019s Boulder. The scale best adept to measure this massive mass of a man is Richter. And he has the team\u2019s biggest asset \u2014 confidence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a center in the NFL that can block me,\u201d said Knighton, who sacked three quarterbacks last season \u2014 interestingly in a three-game span \u2014 then sacked Tom Brady in the AFC championship game. \u201cThat\u2019s part of my belief in myself and my abilities, and that\u2019s also knowing you have a DeMarcus Ware over here, a Von Miller over here, and Derek Wolfe, Malik Jackson, Sylvester Williams and Kevin Vickerson. It makes things a lot easier for everybody.\u201d\n\nThis will be the most important season of Knighton\u2019s career. The 28-year-old must assume even more of a leadership role on a defense that saw captains scatter last spring. The pass rush is vital to how this defense will play, and he\u2019s vital to the pass rush \u2014 last season he rated 10th among tackles in run defense, 13th in pass rush defense, per Pro Football Focus. And this presumed weight gain is curious. It brings back memories of Miller, who beefed up during his suspension last season then looked slower upon his return. Knighton had some big nights last season, sure. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it? I think Knighton\u2019s line is \u201cIf you ain\u2019t broke, eat all the fixin\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThis is reminiscent of the portly protagonist in the Pulitzer-winning book \u201cA Confederacy of Dunces.\u201d Ignatius J. Reilly, whose plump was described with much pomp, defied logic by somehow getting even fatter, upon taking a job as a hot dog vendor, sneaking a weiner or 17, as the author said he \u201cchewed with blissful savagery.\u201d\n\nThis description also is apt of the defensive tackle\u2019s devouring of Brady, on a fourth-and-3 play at the Broncos\u2019 29-yard line, with Denver up 20-3 and 2:30 left in the third quarter. This made our town\u2019s media darling an international media darling during Super Bowl week.\n\nKnighton became a celebrity because of his effervescent sense of humor and his actual play, after years with Jacksonville, actually being watched by fans. He even recently starred in a Bridgestone tires ad, in which he hurried to the grocery after peering into an empty fridge and proclaiming: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFans always love the big guys anyway; they have a lot of personality,\u201d Knighton said.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s \u201cPot Roast,\u201d which Peyton Manning said Thursday is \u201cone of the greatest nicknames of all time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great attitude. He\u2019s a guy that the players feed off his enthusiasm and his love for football,\u201d Manning said. \u201cCertainly, he has a massive presence in there. \u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to him having a great year for us.\u201d\n\nWare could have gone anywhere. A stalwart of his generation, the defensive end looked at his free-agent options, and he chose Denver because he understood the unwavering dedication to winning. Everyone has made a big deal about Ware\u2019s pairing with Miller, but Ware understands the importance of Denver\u2019s best man in the middle since Dikembe Mutombo.\n\n\u201cI just know how he played,\u201d Ware said of Knighton. \u201cSort of his tenacity and everybody always talked about his size \u2014 how big a man he is and how he really holds down the middle. You really don\u2019t notice that until you play beside him and you see him take up two guys and you are able to get one-on-one blocks and do what you do best, and that is me pass rushing. It is just a great opportunity to be playing with him.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Terrance Knighton\u2019s role with Denver Broncos as big as his frame", "title": "Hochman: Terrance Knighton\u2019s role with Denver Broncos as big as his frame", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/25/hochman-terrance-knightons-role-with-denver-broncos-as-big-as-his-frame/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__knighton1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__knighton1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T20:57:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:49:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The pass rush is vital to how this defense will play, and he\u2019s vital to the pass rush \u2014 last season he rated 10th among tackles in run defense, 13th in pass rush defense, per Pro Football Focus.\n\u201cJust put three-asterisk-asterisk,\u201d said a smiling Terrance Knighton, a Broncos defensive tackle who is 6-foot-3, 3**.\n\u201cSort of his tenacity and everybody always talked about his size \u2014 how big a man he is and how he really holds down the middle.\nThe 28-year-old must assume even more of a leadership role on a defense that saw captains scatter last spring.\nIt brings back memories of Miller, who beefed up during his suspension last season then looked slower upon his return."}
