The practice was created with the premise that patients would be better off if doctors focused their attention more on preventing disease than simply treating it. In clinical parlance, \u201cprimary prevention\u201d means preventing disease occurrence, while \u201csecondary prevention\u201d means early diagnosis and treatment of existing disease before it causes significant harm. The thrust of MDPrevent was primary prevention: to help patients identify their risk factors for the major chronic diseases and leading killers, such as diabetes, heart and lung disease, stroke, and cancer, and to help them make lifestyle changes to prevent these factors from evolving to illness. I focused on lifestyle counseling, rather than diagnostic tests meant for early detection. But ultimately, the three major healthcare industry players\u2014the providers, the payers, and the patients\u2014all shared some responsibility for our failure. More than 1,000 patients came through our doors. The bad news: For every dollar we collected, our expenses equaled three dollars. Some may say that most start-ups fail. But what happened to MDPrevent is a cautionary tale. My incentives for creating this new model were more altruistic than financial. I previously cofounded, built, and sold a successful healthcare-services company. After spending years involved with the care of institutionalized elderly past the point where prevention makes any real difference, my ultimate goal became demonstrating that doctors could afford to focus on prevention without sacrificing their livelihoods. Of course, to start focusing on primary prevention, most doctors would have to undergo further re-education, as few have training in nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress, and the like. MDPrevent realized this and assembled a team that included a health psychologist, registered dietitian, exercise physiologist, yoga instructor, health educator, and nurse practitioners. Our system was predicated on an integrated model of care in which the physician would complete an initial thorough health risk assessment, make appropriate internal and external referrals, and then monitor progress by reviewing records and periodically meeting with the patient. In addition to personalized care, our custom facility, which included a teaching kitchen, a gym, and classrooms, allowed us to also offer our patients group classes focused on healthy cooking, exercise, nutritional therapy, diabetes education, and mindfulness meditation.\n\nWe knew that for the model to be scalable, it had to be based on insurance reimbursement rather than out-of-pocket payments. We hoped that once we demonstrated the value of primary prevention in a setting that derived its revenue primarily from insurance, the rest of the medical establishment would see the merit and follow suit. Of course, in my mind, at that point we would also be well along in creating our own successful financial endeavor based on the premise of doing well by doing good. First, the good news: On the personal front, after reading 50 books and more than 30,000 abstracts and studies, I reversed my own health issues. I dropped 25 pounds, brought my cholesterol under 200 and stopped taking medication for it, eliminated my irritable bowel syndrome and heartburn, markedly decreased my left hip osteoarthritic pain, and started running again for the first time in 10 years. Some local specialists told us they would not refer to us because of fears of offending their primary care and internal medicine referral sources. On the practice side, more than 1,000 patients came through our doors. Many people told us they loved the program, and we received many positive testimonials. Dozens of our patients sustained marked weight loss without drugs, supplements, or surgery. We successfully discontinued our patients\u2019 statins, lowered or discontinued blood pressure and blood sugar medications, and watched people finally take control of their health. We religiously followed an insurance-based reimbursement model. We lost money. The bad news was that for every dollar we collected, our expenses equaled three dollars. I didn\u2019t need my MBA to know that this was unsustainable, so I started cutting our costs. At the end, we were left with a health psychologist, a registered dietitian, and me. Even though I never took a paycheck, the Medicare reimbursement we received for our services still could not cover our costs. I even abandoned the offices we had built-out and moved to less expensive quarters we shared with an internist. It still made no difference.\n\nSo what had gone wrong? First, few primary care and internal medicine doctors would refer to us. When I first met with a few dozen of them to introduce myself and the model, they raved about the concept and assured me they would make referrals. They said there was nothing like us, and they were right. Yet, other than for a small handful, they did not refer. When I asked several of these doctors why they had not referred, the most common explanation was that they simply forgot, or that they had made a referral, but their patients chose to not come. Some local specialists told us they would not refer to us because of fears of offending their primary care and internal medicine referral sources. Most of the third-party insurance companies in the area did not cover our services. Medicare was the exception, but reimbursement was insufficient to cover our costs. The hospitals were no better. One local hospital initially asked us to open a Certified Diabetes Education Center because the hospital was shutting down its own program for financial reasons. As opening the center was consistent with our educational focus, we exerted much time and money to get certified so we would be open by the time the hospital shut down its program. The hospital initially told us they would refer diabetics to us, but then someone reversed the decision and the hospital decided to refer to its sister hospital instead. We also met with another local hospital and asked them to allow us to incorporate our prevention model into their primary care practice, and they also turned us down. Then there were the payer problems. Most of the third-party insurance companies in the area did not cover our services at all. Medicare was the exception, but reimbursement was insufficient to cover our costs. Although the Affordable Care Act included provisions to reimburse for services such as an Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) and Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity (IBTO), Medicare still paid less for such visits than other appointments of a similar length. As a result, many doctors told me that they had simply started lumping the AWV with a scheduled medical visit, often spending less than 15 minutes on a service that, when done right, could easily exceed an hour.\n\nWe also approached the larger Medicare managed care companies, thinking that they would embrace our model as a way to save money on hospitalizations, prescriptions, emergency care, and specialist doctor visits. One small insurance company did contract with us in 2013, and not a single one of their patients needed a hospital visit after seeing us all year. We attribute that to the fact that each patient was offered, and most took advantage of, no-cost nutritional and psychological counseling. The other companies rejected us, and we were told by their representatives that they did not want to threaten or dilute their existing doctor relationships. When it came to pharmaceuticals, we didn't rush to prescribe if there were a non-drug alternative. This approach was a turn-off to many patients. But the final, and possibly most important, factor was a Medicare contracted audit we went through. A few months ago, we received a letter requesting we submit records for services we rendered and billed for Intensive Behavior Therapy for Obesity (IBTO). This new service introduced by CMS in 2012, allows doctors and nurse practitioners to provide obesity counseling to patients who qualify with a body mass index over 30. The service involves 15-minute weight-loss counseling sessions, for which Medicare reimburses about $25. Meanwhile, 15 minutes of any other kind of medical counseling is reimbursed by Medicare at about $75. Based on our cost structure, by the time we finished paying for the costs of the provider and the overhead, we were losing about $25 for every 15-minute visit. If we had billed $75 instead, we would have netted $25. So imagine our shock when we received a letter from a Medicare sub-contractor informing us that we would need to submit to a record review. After submitting our records, we were told that our claims were inappropriate. When we questioned the results, the response was that the records indicated that the obesity-counseling service had been mostly provided by a registered dietitian instead of a physician or nurse practitioner, as required. When we responded that we had used a registered dietitian under Medicare\u2019s \u201cincident to\u201d rule, which allows a licensed professional to take over for a physician after the initial physician visit, the reviewer claimed she wasn\u2019t aware of this Medicare provision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our system was predicated on integrated health, including cooking, exercise, nutritional therapy, and mindfulness meditation.
