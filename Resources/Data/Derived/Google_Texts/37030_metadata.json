Stewart is stepping down in three weeks, ceding the host\u2019s seat to South African comic Trevor Noah.\n\nObama\u2019s appearances on the Daily Show have spanned his political career, appearing as senator, then presidential candidate and finally as president. His earlier interviews foreshadowed some of his biggest presidential policy decisions, and his later ones were spent defending his presidency and America\u2019s progress under his reins.\n\nNovember 7, 2005\n\nIn his first interview on the show, Obama also shared (now laughable) concerns that his political career would fizzle out.\n\n\u201cI do worry about the hype,\u201d he said to Stewart. \u201cThe only person more overhyped than me is you.\u201d\n\nHe also established himself as a family man and reminded viewers of potentially Stewart\u2019s best TV segment of all time, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten cool points with my wife, who loves your show, and my four-year-old who remembers you from Elmopalooza.\u201d\n\nAugust 22, 2007\n\nIn Obama\u2019s first appearance on the show after announcing his presidential run, Stewart read him some slanderous headlines, including one that read: \u201cAngry Obama the Pothead is Not How They Remember Him on Hawaii.\u201d\n\nHe also called out fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton a \u201cvery capable senator\u201d and admitted that \u201cshe was doing some heavy lifting on issues\u201d during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\n\nApril 21, 2008\n\nOn this appearance, Obama displayed his oratory skills when Stewart gave him a task: to make anything, even the most mundane sentence, sound inspirational. He succeeded, inflecting the statement, \u201cI\u2019m calling to ask if you\u2019re happy with your cellphone service,\u201d with pathos.\n\nOctober 27, 2010\n\nHis next appearance was in the midst of the 2010 midterm elections, after a tumultuous first 18 months in office.\n\nStewart expressed that he felt the legislation under the Obama administration was \u201ctimid at times.\u201d\n\n\u201cJon, I love your show. but this is something where I have a profound disagreement with you,\u201d Obama replied, touting Obamacare as a crowing achievement of his presidency. \u201cThis notion that healthcare was timid\u2014you\u2019ve got 30 million people who are gonna get healthcare because of this.\u201d\n\nOctober 18, 2012\n\nComing off the heels of the second presidential debate against Mitt Romney, which many thought Obama blundered, the president set out to set the record straight.\n\nHe articulated his hope to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, which he vowed to do during his first campaign and has yet to be done. He blamed congressional stalemates for his inaction, saying that we \u201cstill haven\u2019t gotten that through Congress.\u201d\n\nHe also urged Americans to vote.\n\n\u201cThe stakes on this could not be bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no excuse not to vote. And I hope you vote for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The President will appear on the show with Stewart as anchor for the final time on Tuesday night", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The President will appear on the show for the final time Tuesday night", "title": "A Brief History Of Obama's Daily Show Appearances", "url": "http://time.com/3966335/a-brief-history-of-obamas-daily-show-appearances/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/obama-dailyshow.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/obama-dailyshow.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The President will appear on the show for the final time Tuesday night", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A Brief History Of Obama's Daily Show Appearances"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "jon stewart, daily show, obama jon stewart, obama daily show", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "jon stewart, daily show, obama jon stewart, obama daily show"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80b2\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s appearances on the Daily Show have spanned his political career, appearing as senator, then presidential candidate and finally as president.\nPresident Obama will travel to New York on Tuesday to make his final appearance on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart at the helm.\nApril 21, 2008On this appearance, Obama displayed his oratory skills when Stewart gave him a task: to make anything, even the most mundane sentence, sound inspirational.\nStewart is stepping down in three weeks, ceding the host\u2019s seat to South African comic Trevor Noah.\nStewart expressed that he felt the legislation under the Obama administration was \u201ctimid at times.\u201d\u201cJon, I love your show."}
