No, that\u2019s not a joke.\n\nThe Obama administration strongly opposes the Republican bill that forces the IRS to investigate rape victims. \u201cIf the President were presented with H.R. 7, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\u201d\n\nThe White House issued a statement today on H.R. 7 \u2013 the Orwellian \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d (Rep. Smith, R-New Jersey, and 164 cosponsors) \u2013 that included, \u201cThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 7.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration doesn\u2019t like the infringement upon women\u2019s freedom or the theft of home rule inherent in the GOP bill, \u201cThe legislation would intrude on women\u2019s reproductive freedom and access to health care; increase the financial burden on many Americans; unnecessarily restrict the private insurance choices that consumers have today; and restrict the District of Columbia\u2019s use of local funds, which undermines home rule.\u201d\n\nThis bill officially makes the Republican Party the party of big government.\n\nThe Obama administration explained that it is already law that we do not use tax money for abortions (it\u2019s called the Hyde Amendment), \u201cLongstanding Federal policy prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered. This prohibition is maintained in the Affordable Care Act and reinforced through the President\u2019s Executive Order 13535.\u201d\n\nOf course, this bill isn\u2019t really about taxpayer funds. It\u2019s about controlling women and creating an environment of fear and intimidation around women\u2019s health. The White House continued, \u201cH.R. 7 would go well beyond these safeguards by interfering with consumers\u2019 private health care choices. The Administration strongly opposes legislation that unnecessarily restricts women\u2019s reproductive freedoms and consumers\u2019 private insurance options.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans are trying to pass it off as the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d, but there is already no taxpayer funding for abortion. Not only is that a law, but ObamaCare took special pains to ensure this. Furthermore, the President even issued an Executive Order to make it even more clear, for those who have a hard time reading actual legislation that they vote on.\n\nPredictably, it is Republican policies that lead to abortions. Study after study shows that access to birth control and sex education significantly reduce the unwanted pregnancy rate, which reduces the abortion rate. These are Democratic policies.\n\nIn 2010, publicly funded family planning averted 760,000 abortions, according to a Guttmacher Institute report \u201cContraceptive Needs and Services 2010\u2033 released in July of 2013.\n\nRepublicans are at risk of causing 760,000 more abortions per year by defunding family planning. So instead of having the IRS investigate rape victims, if they really care about abortion, they would refund Planned Parenthood and other family planning organizations.\n\nUnlike many in the House GOP, the President is not a knuckle-dragging neanderthal incapable of dealing with women as equals. In fact, this White House has been the most pro-women policy oriented administration in history. Obama and the Democrats are the speed bumps against the crazy Republican train that keeps coming from women\u2019s freedom.\n\nRepublicans are trying to claim that there is no \u201cwar on women\u201d. If forcing women to submit to the IRS for an investigation over health matters isn\u2019t a war on women, I\u2019m afraid to ask what would constitute a war on women.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Obama administration just cut House Republicans off at the knee in order to protect American women from the egregious bill they were trying to pass that would force the IRS to investigate rape victims.
