Catherine Samba-Panza told the U.N. General Assembly that the success of the U.N. force will hinge on the involvement of the country\u2019s security and defense forces at its side. Months of fighting between a mostly Muslim rebel coalition and a Christian militia have left at least 5,000 people dead. Samba-Panza said that after a July 23 cease-fire agreement it is time to bring all parties together to consider \u201ca new republic and pact to recast the Central African state.\u201d\n\nINDIA\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he\u2019s serious about holding peace talks with Pakistan but also criticized the neighboring country, insisting it must create an \u201cappropriate atmosphere\u201d for the dialogue. In his first U.N. address since taking power in May, Modi said that dialogue needs to take place \u201cwithout the shadow of terrorism.\u201d Modi invited Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration, but India in August withdrew from planned talks between their foreign secretaries as Pakistan wanted to consult first with separatists in the disputed region of Kashmir. In his U.N. address Friday, Nawaz criticized India\u2019s withdrawal from the talks, saying the world saw it as a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir since independence in 1947.
