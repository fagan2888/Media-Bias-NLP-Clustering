They analyzed data on fast food transactions per capita from 1999 to 2008 in 25 richer countries, along with data on body mass index (BMI).\n\nAs the average number of fast food transactions rose in those countries throughout the decade, people became fatter \u2014 with an average BMI increasing from 25.8, or just a bit overweight, to 26.4, closer to an obese rating of 30.\n\n\"Unless governments take steps to regulate their economies, the invisible hand of the market will continue to promote obesity worldwide with disastrous consequences for future public health and economic productivity,\" lead investigator Roberto De Vogli, of the University of California at Davis, said in statement. In recent years, \u201cvirtually all nations have undergone a process of market deregulation and globalization \u2014 especially in the last three decades,\u201d he added.\n\nThe biggest jumps in obesity occurred in Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, whose economies had deregulated the most. The lowest increases in obesity were seen in Italy, Greece, Belgium, and the Netherlands, all countries with more stringent market regulation \u2014 though the economic story of the \u201cPIG\u201d [Portugal, Italy, and Greece] countries of Southern Europe remains far more complex.\n\nTellingly, the obesity rate in countries studied rose sharply while the overall consumption of calories, including those from animal fat, rose only slightly, according to Francesco Branca, who directs WHO\u2019s department of nutrition for health and development. \"Policies targeting food and nutrition are needed across several sectors including agriculture, industry, health, social welfare, and education,\" Branca said. \"Countries where the diet is transitioning from one that is high in cereals to one that is high in fat, sugar, and processed foods need to take action to align the food supply with the health needs of the population.\"\n\nBranca and his colleagues suggest governments consider some of the following measures:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "global obesity epidemic, market deregulation and obesity, fast food consumption, economic deregulation, tighter regulations", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "To fight the global obesity epidemic, medical investigators say governments should regulate aspects of their economies such as agriculture and the food industry.", "title": "Could Tighter Regulations Lower Obesity Rates?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-market-deregulation-might-have-led-global-obesity-268426", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/02/obesity-caused-economic-deregulation-agriculture-food-industry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "To fight the global obesity epidemic, medical investigators say governments should regulate aspects of their economies such as agriculture and the food industry.", "title": "Could Tighter Regulations Lower Obesity Rates?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-market-deregulation-might-have-led-global-obesity-268426", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/02/obesity-caused-economic-deregulation-agriculture-food-industry.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/02/obesity-caused-economic-deregulation-agriculture-food-industry.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-02T18:15:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-02T18:20:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "To fight the global obesity epidemic, medical investigators say governments should regulate aspects of their economies such as agriculture and the food industry."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23e2\"", "article_summary": "In recent years, \u201cvirtually all nations have undergone a process of market deregulation and globalization \u2014 especially in the last three decades,\u201d he added.\nA new study by Irish and American investigators finds economic deregulation to blame for increasing fast food consumption in countries around the world.\nA team of international scientists has proposed that governments of the world address a root cause of the obesity epidemic: the deregulation of agricultural and related industries.\nThey analyzed data on fast food transactions per capita from 1999 to 2008 in 25 richer countries, along with data on body mass index (BMI).\nThe biggest jumps in obesity occurred in Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, whose economies had deregulated the most."}
