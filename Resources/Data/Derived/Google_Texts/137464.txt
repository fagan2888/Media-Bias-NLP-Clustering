Lt. Col. Joni Ernst on Saturday blasted Obamacare and out-of-control government spending just hours before she deployed for two weeks of duty with the Iowa National Guard.

In the GOP weekly address, Ms. Ernst, the Republican candidate for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat, touted her military service and took pointed shots at the “liberals” in Washington and elsewhere across the country.

Ms. Ernst will face off against Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in the race to fill the retiring Sen. Tom Harkin’s seat.

“The problem with America today is that Washington is full of liberals who think government is the solution to every problem. They think that nothing can be solved unless Washington is involved,” she said. “And so they grow our government, every year making it more intrusive and more involved in our lives. Today, government tells us what doctors to see, what kind of light bulbs to use, and in some places, even how much soda we can drink.”

The “soda” comment apparently is a reference to New York City’s failed attempt to ban large soft drinks. The proposed ban has been thrown out by a judge.

Ms. Ernst also cited her military service in taking aim at the “bureaucracy” inside the Veterans Affairs Department.

“Part of that bureaucracy is failing our veterans, and the stories we’ve heard about the failures of the VA are heartbreaking.” she said. “As an active member of the Iowa National Guard and the wife of a retired U.S. Army ranger, I believe this isn’t a partisan issue. It’s an American problem that must be solved.”
