NPQ reported last week that Louisiana was the first when Governor Bobby Jindal issued an order terminating his state\u2019s contract with PP. Now, New Hampshire and Alabama have taken similar actions.\n\nCNN picked up Alabama governor Robert Bentley, a medical doctor, as he tweeted that life from \u201cconception to birth and beyond\u201d is important to him. \u201cI respect human life, and I do not want Alabama to be associated with an organization that does not. The deplorable practices at Planned Parenthood have been exposed to Americans. I\u2019ve terminated any association with the organization in AL.\u201d\n\nWSFA-TV reported that, \u201cAccording to the Alabama Medicaid Agency, a total of $4,351.37 has been paid to Planned Parenthood Southeast over the last two years. In 2014, $933.79 was paid for an office visit, one intrauterine device insertion and injections. This year, $3,417.58 has been paid for office visits, insertion of contraceptive implants, contraceptive injections, intrauterine device insertions and other injections.\u201d\n\nStaci Fox, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of the Southeast, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that Governor Bentley has been distracted by a deceptive attack against our organization instead of staying focused on what really matters to women in Alabama. What Alabamians need is more access to health care, not less. As a high-quality provider of medical care to women across Alabama, ensuring access to quality health services is fundamental. Planned Parenthood Southeast has been providing high-quality, affordable health care in the state for nearly 80 years and each year provides health care and education to more than 22,000 people across Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.\u201d\n\nOver in New Hampshire, the Christian Science Monitor reported the Republican-led Executive Council voted along party lines Wednesday against $639,000 in state funding for Planned Parenthood. New Hampshire was well positioned to act swiftly, as it\u2019s the only state with such an elected council that works with the governor to approve large state contracts.\n\nJennifer Frizzell, vice president for public policy of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said that without New Hampshire\u2019s funding PPNNE \u201cwould be forced to cut direct program costs, which could mean shortening health center hours, eliminating staff positions, and reducing patient access to affordable care.\u201d\n\nWith attempts to defund PP at the national level stalled, other states are expected to follow this route. Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, told the Monitor, \u201cWe\u2019ll see more attacks at the state level on family planning funding. [Some politicians] will use this whole issue as a way to further scrutinize abortion providers, and Planned Parenthood specifically.\u201d\n\nWhile the political battle is fueled by the continuing national debate over abortion and choice, it is clear that if PP loses substantial funding, women who use PP for a wide range of medical services will be at risk. According to the Washington Post, abortion services represent only three percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s activity!\n\nAnd by existing federal regulations, none of the funds being withheld by the states could have been used to provide abortions.\n\nSupporters of Planned Parenthood will be in court asking these barriers to be removed. Ms. Fox in her statement put forward the belief that their legal position was quite strong:\n\n\u201cThe courts have been clear that the federal law prohibits states from excluding abortion providers from Medicaid. To date, two Circuit courts, the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, have reached the issue, and the Supreme Court has declined to review the Seventh and the Ninth Circuit decisions. Also the Center for Medicaid, CHIP and Survey & Certification (CMCS) clearly stated in an informational memo dated June 2011: \u2018States are not, however, permitted to exclude providers from the program solely on the basis of the range of medical services they provide.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014Marty Levine", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three states have now moved to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics within their borders.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/08/10/the-planned-parenthood-defunding-fight-a-state-status-report/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "Three states have now moved to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics within their borders.", "title": "The Planned Parenthood Funding Fight: A State Status Report", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/08/10/the-planned-parenthood-defunding-fight-a-state-status-report/", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2015/08/PP-funding.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/08/10/the-planned-parenthood-defunding-fight-a-state-status-report/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy,  abortion services,  anti-abortion,  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,  Planned Parenthood,  womens health"}, "article_summary": "Supporters of Planned Parenthood will be in court asking these barriers to be removed.\nThe deplorable practices at Planned Parenthood have been exposed to Americans.\nElizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, told the Monitor, \u201cWe\u2019ll see more attacks at the state level on family planning funding.\nAs a high-quality provider of medical care to women across Alabama, ensuring access to quality health services is fundamental.\nI\u2019ve terminated any association with the organization in AL.\u201dWSFA-TV reported that, \u201cAccording to the Alabama Medicaid Agency, a total of $4,351.37 has been paid to Planned Parenthood Southeast over the last two years."}
