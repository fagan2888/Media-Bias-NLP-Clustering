In a touching tribute to deceased West Side legend Nate Dogg, who Cube called a \"fallen hero of mine,\" the rapper did a call-and-response version of Nate's \"The Next Episode\" lyrics before tearing into Westside Connection's \"Gangsta Nation.\" \"Drop Girl,\" his new single featuring 2 Chainz and Redfoo, also entertained when unfurled live.\n\n\n\n\"It Was a Good Day\" naturally dazzled toward the conclusion of the performance, but it was a medley of 80's hits by various rap titans -- LL Cool J, Rakim, Run-DMC -- that got the audience moving most vigorously. When Ice Cube punctuated the retrospective with N.W.A.'s \"Straight Outta Compton,\" a video screen behind him showed the young rapper prowling the streets in the music video, spitting each line with measured intensity. Ice Cube may still be better-known for his filmography -- a new movie of his, \"22 Jump Street,\" was released the same day of his Bonnaroo performance! -- than for his recent music, but he demonstrated that his magnetic presence on the mic has not wavered since the \"Straight Outta Compton\" days.\n\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Immediately following Kanye West's heavy-handed headlining set at Bonnaroo on Friday night (June 13), Ice Cube provided a blast of unadulterated coolness with an hour-long set of old-school cuts and playful chest-thumping from the West Coast veteran.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Ice Cube Plays Throwback Hits & Pays Tribute To Nate Dogg", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121370/bonnaroo-2014-ice-cube-performance-set-video", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/bonnaroo-2014-ice-cube-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Immediately following Kanye West's heavy-handed headlining set at Bonnaroo on Friday night (June 13), Ice Cube provided a blast of unadulterated coolness with an hour-long set of old-school cuts and playful chest-thumping from the West Coast veteran.", "title": "Bonnaroo 2014: Ice Cube Plays Throwback Hits & Pays Tribute To Nate Dogg", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6121370/bonnaroo-2014-ice-cube-performance-set-video", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/bonnaroo-2014-ice-cube-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Immediately following Kanye West's heavy-handed headlining set at Bonnaroo on Friday night (June 13), Ice Cube provided a blast of unadulterated coolness with an hour-long set of old-school cuts and playful chest-thumping from the West Coast veteran.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Ice Cube at Bonnaroo 2014: Throwback Hits & Nate Dogg Tribute After Kanye West's Set | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc86e\"", "article_summary": "Ice Cube may still be better-known for his filmography -- a new movie of his, \"22 Jump Street,\" was released the same day of his Bonnaroo performance!\nWhen Ice Cube punctuated the retrospective with N.W.A.\nImmediately following Kanye West's heavy-handed headlining set at Bonnaroo on Friday night (June 13), Ice Cube provided a blast of unadulterated coolness with an hour-long set of old-school cuts and playful chest-thumping from the West Coast veteran.\nBonnaroo 2014 Full Coverage: Photos, Video & MoreEarly on, Ice Cube acknowledged that, in 2014, he's not known as well for his hip-hop joints as he is for his other ventures.\nBillboard's Bonnaroo 2014 Video"}
