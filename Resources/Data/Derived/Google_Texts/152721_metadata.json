But when he asked Mr Cano to help him get to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre down the road, all became clear.\n\nFor Malibu has now become the \u201cRehab Riviera,\u201d with scores of clinics opening up to fix the minds of wealthy drug addicts and burnt-out celebrities. And just as if an unwanted supermarket was opening in the Cotswolds, the usually liberal denizens of \u201cThe Bu\u201d have had enough.\n\n\u201cI have heard from neighbours that there have been other incidents of patients escaping or getting out,\u201d said Mr Cano, 54, who called the local sheriff\u2019s department after fetching his nude visitor some shorts and a shirt. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my family\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nMalibu, with its 21 miles of prime Pacific coastline, has long been a popular Hollywood hang-out, as well as a film location. The cult Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski was shot here, and in the 1970s, it was the beat of James Garner\u2019s fictional private gumshoe Jim Rockford, star of The Rockford Files.\n\nIncreasingly, though, the same relaxing climes that attract celebrities at the top of their game also attracts them at the bottom. Residents say that their narrow winding streets are now clogged with cars. They also complain of excessive noise from late-night recovery meetings, and a proliferation of paparazzi at the end of their roads.\n\nLast month the actress Lindsay Lohan emerged from one Malibu clinic after an apparently successful treatment for alcohol addiction.\n\nBoth Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen have been residents of Malibu clinics (Rex Features)\n\n\u201cNo one has a problem if people follow the rules, but this has become a $100 million business in Malibu,\u201d the town\u2019s mayor Joan Harris told The Daily Telegraph. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is the rehab places have said 'We are here and you adhere to our standards,\u2019 rather than the other way around.\u201d\n\nWith former clients such as Robert Downey Jr, Charlie Sheen and Diana Ross, the luxurious clinics that have sprung up amid Malibu\u2019s palm trees charge more than $30,000 (\u00a320,000) a month, catering to a myriad of \u201cHollywood\u201d addictions such as tranquillisers, sexual compulsion, and even the internet. They feature rose gardens, infinity pools, sun decks and \u201clife purpose\u201d counsellors, as well as \u201crecovery nutritionists\u201d providing gourmet meals. Matthew Perry, the former Friends star, who struggled with alcohol and painkiller addiction in the past, recently converted his own $13 million Malibu home into a \u201cSober Living Centre\u201d for reformed addicts.\n\nThe clinics are world leaders in what they offer. Malibu is home to the number one rehab centre on the planet, \u201cPassages\u201d, according to Healthcare Global magazine, where new arrivals are greeted by a Statue of Liberty replica on the lawn. They then walk through a facade reminiscent of a mini-Parthenon before being assigned their own 10-person support team, including therapists, doctors and acupuncturists.\n\nPassages did not return a request for comment, although on its website, Chris Prentiss, who co-founded it following his son\u2019s addiction to heroin, says its programme is \u201cunique\u201d and has \u201csaved thousands.\u201d\n\nBut in a recent letter to the Malibu Times, resident Jo Geise, who lives next to one of Malibu\u2019s most exclusive beaches, complained that a centre had opened there and was extolling its location in \u201cexclusive and private Malibu.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not private anymore when day and night staff and 'guests\u2019 hog the parking on our neighbourhood street and hold meetings which attract dozens of cars,\u201d she said.\n\nMalibu City Council, the guardian of its 12,000 citizens\u2019 quietude, has taken up the gauntlet and is accusing the rehab centres of overwhelming local infrastructure. Specifically, the council claims they are violating planning rules designed to limit their size.\n\nMalibu\u2019s council claims rehab centres are \u201cclustering\u201d by buying up adjoining properties, getting more licences for those buildings and thereby creating \u201ccampuses.\u201d\n\nChristi Hogin, the City Attorney for Malibu, said: \u201cThe rehabilitation facilities have all this money and they have burrowed their way into a loophole in the law and bought up properties in the same block. We are going to take some action to enforce the residential zone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02659/malibu_2659298k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nickallen789"}, "keywords": "malibu, rehab, passages, lindsay lohan, charlie sheen, robert downey jr, USA,North America,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "Home;News;World_News;North_America;USA;Nick_Allen;Editor's_Choice;Editor's_Picks", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "malibu, rehab, passages, lindsay lohan, charlie sheen, robert downey jr", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Welcome to Malibu, the Rehab Riviera... although its residents wish it wasn't", "section-id": 2280, "GSAGenre": "northamerica", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-northamerica-usa", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/northamerica/usa", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "Malibu residents have had their fill of the celebrity-filled clinics that have \n  made it California's \"Rehab Riviera\" and are trying to block plans \n  for more.", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 10280963, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-02", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-north_america-usa", "last-modified": "2013-09-02", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 813, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Nick Allen", "tag": "Editor\\u0027s Picks", "subsection": "USA", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 7, "imagecount": 2, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10280963, "tmgads.articleid": 10280963, "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Welcome to Malibu, the Rehab Riviera... although its residents wish it wasn\\u0027t \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10280963/Welcome-to-Malibu-the-Rehab-Riviera...-although-its-residents-wish-it-wasnt.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02659/malibu_2659298k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10280963\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-02T14:15:50Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Nick Allen\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"Home\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Nick Allen\",\"Editor\\u0027s Choice\",\"Editor\\u0027s Picks\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Malibu residents have had their fill of the celebrity-filled clinics that have   made it California's \"Rehab Riviera\" and are trying to block plans   for more.", "title": "Welcome to Malibu, the Rehab Riviera... although its residents wish it wasn't", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10280963/Welcome-to-Malibu-the-Rehab-Riviera...-although-its-residents-wish-it-wasnt.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02659/malibu_2659298k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "northamerica", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.northamerica.usa", "DCSext.author": "Nick Allen", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-09-02 15:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe was completely nude, with cuts, and looked like he had been climbing through mud,\u201d said Mr Cano, 54.\nFor the well-heeled few who can afford it, California\u2019s exclusive Malibu Beach neighbourhood offers pristine sands, fine surfing, and some of the best real estate on America\u2019s West Coast.\nFor Malibu has now become the \u201cRehab Riviera,\u201d with scores of clinics opening up to fix the minds of wealthy drug addicts and burnt-out celebrities.\nBut when he asked Mr Cano to help him get to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre down the road, all became clear.\nBoth Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen have been residents of Malibu clinics (Rex Features)\u201cNo one has a problem if people follow the rules, but this has become a $100 million business in Malibu,\u201d the town\u2019s mayor Joan Harris told The Daily Telegraph."}
