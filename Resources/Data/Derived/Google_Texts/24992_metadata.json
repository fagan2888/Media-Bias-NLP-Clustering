Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance.\n\nLinda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country.\n\n'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again.\n\n'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.'\n\nMr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund.\n\nHaving spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'.\n\nMr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war.\n\nA total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said.\n\nMore than \u00a32,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page.\n\nMr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942.\n\nHe spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the \u2018death march\u2019 in 1945.\n\nHitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East.\n\nWriting home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry\n\nRobert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy\n\nAfter the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91.\n\nNow a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain\u2019s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair.\n\nFor the past two years he has used his \u00a350,000 savings to pay towards a \u00a3960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed \u00a3350 a week.\n\nBut as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead.\n\nHis son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: \u2018This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s as good as told me that if he has to move, he\u2019ll just give up on life. Whenever he\u2019s been in hospital, he \u2026 pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking.\n\n\u2018He hates being anywhere which isn\u2019t familiar \u2026 going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.\u2019\n\nDespite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer.\n\nThe council\u2019s Phil Porter said: \u2018We recognise Mr Clark\u2019s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people \u2026 are in.\n\n\u2018However \u2026 the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.\u2019\n\nThe council said Mr Clark\u2019s needs can be met in a care home for \u00a3451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer.\n\nMr Porter said: \u2018We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.\u2019\n\nHe added that the council had offered \u2018a deferred payment which means he doesn\u2019t need to sell his house to pay for his care\u2019.\n\nAfter signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Help,Heroes,join,fight,WWII,veteran,home,London,council,ignores,petition,signed,165,000,people,refuse,pay,live,carer", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3025491/Help-Heroes-join-fight-WWII-veteran-home-London-council-ignores-petition-signed-165-000-people-refuse-pay-live-carer.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Former Prisoner of War Robert Clark, pictured, who survived a 1,000-mile Nazi death-march has been given an emergency grant to allow him to stay in his home of 50 years in Burnt Oak, north west London.", "title": "Help for Heroes join fight to keep WWII veteran in his own home", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3025491/Help-Heroes-join-fight-WWII-veteran-home-London-council-ignores-petition-signed-165-000-people-refuse-pay-live-carer.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/01/18/2733AB9200000578-0-image-a-2_1427910388632.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3025491/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3025491/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3025491, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Help,Heroes,join,fight,WWII,veteran,home,London,council,ignores,petition,signed,165,000,people,refuse,pay,live,carer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-04-04T11:14:30.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Darren+Boyle+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-04-05T09:03:30.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Help Heroes join fight WWII veteran home London council ignores petition signed 165 000 people refuse pay live carer"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Former Prisoner of War Robert Clark, pictured, who survived a 1,000-mile Nazi death-march has been given an emergency grant to allow him to stay in his home of 50 years in Burnt Oak, north west London.", "title": "Help for Heroes join fight to keep WWII veteran in his own home", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3025491/Help-Heroes-join-fight-WWII-veteran-home-London-council-ignores-petition-signed-165-000-people-refuse-pay-live-carer.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/01/18/2733AB9200000578-0-image-a-2_1427910388632.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2015/04/1418450360_4147704354001_4147698524001.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Former Prisoner of War Robert Clark, pictured, who survived a 1,000-mile Nazi death-march has been given an emergency grant to allow him to stay in his home of 50 years in Burnt Oak, north west London."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb07a\"", "article_summary": "Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country.\nNow a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain\u2019s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair.\nThe charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future.\nHelp for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care.\nMr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942."}
