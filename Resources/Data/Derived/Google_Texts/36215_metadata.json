Maybe that drenching rainstorm the night before, which delayed a Rockies loss before the eighth inning, lingered around LoDo.\n\nOr maybe in the midst of a sinking season with just three victories in three weeks, the threat of another was weighing down the atmosphere.\n\nThe Rockies are hitting like their bats are bricks.\n\nBut one hitter, on one big hit in the third inning, broke through. Charlie Blackmon, one of two Rockies all-stars, hit a high, deep home run to right field, pushing Colorado to a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres. It was Blackmon\u2019s first home run since June 16.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be tough to score against (Tyson) Ross,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cBut Charlie Blackmon had the big blow.\u201d\n\nBlackmon, who Sunday became a surprise selection to the NL all-star team, leads baseball with 13 leadoff home runs and 45 RBIs from the first spot. He\u2019s the Rockies\u2019 first all-star leadoff hitter since Eric Young in 1996.\n\nBlackmon\u2019s two-run, line drive homer, off an 88 mph slider from San Diego\u2019s Tyson Ross, scored DJ LaMahieu and gave the Rockies a 2-0 lead in the third inning.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a fastball, but he threw me a slider. That\u2019s why I was out front of it,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad pitch. I did have to come out of my swing to get to it. It wasn\u2019t my best swing. But I was able to stay on it, get the barrell on it. That happened to be enough to get it out.\u201d\n\nWeiss said: \u201cWatching (Blackmon) tonight, I thought his swing path was better.\u201d\n\nAfter an outstanding April and first week of May, the Rockies shot into first place in the National League West on May 7. But they\u2019ve tumbled since.\n\nReasons for the Rockies\u2019 skid are myriad. Their pitching staff is fraying with injuries, sure. But while Colorado\u2019s offense was carrying the load early in the season, leading both leagues in nearly every major category, they\u2019ve fallen off a ledge lately.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 team batting average in July (.220) is down 29 percent compared with April and 25 percent compared with June. Their on-base percentage (.278) led to just 2.4 runs per game.\n\nIn their second game this series against the Padres, the Rockies managed seven hits against Tyson Ross. An all-star selection, Ross is a solid pitcher stuck on a horrible hitting team \u2014 the Padres hit just .171 in June, the worst monthly average in the history of the game, the early-days \u201cdeadball era\u201d included.\n\nRoss and Rockies starter Franklin Morales threw an identical number of pitches (98), with the same number of strikes (63). They each pitched six strikeouts, allowed one home run and threw one wild pitch.\n\n\u201cI just had to give my team an opportunity,\u201d Morales said. \u201cThe most important thing for me is to locate my fastball.\u201d\n\nMorales left after 5 innings, right after giving up a solo home run to Rene Rivera that Rockies left fielder Corey Dickerson never thought about chasing.\n\n\u201cHe went about as long as he could,\u201d Weiss said of Morales. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we needed.\u201d\n\nMorales is the first Rockies starter to win in their past 25 games other than Jorge De La Rosa, who has won three games. It was Morales longest outing since May, in both pitches and innings.\n\nMorales was the beneficiary of Blackmon\u2019s more timely home run. And Blackmon\u2019s two hits \u2014 he also doubled in the first inning on a line drive to right field \u2014 were a team high. Troy Tulowitzki, Dickerson, Nolan Arenado, Drew Stubbs and DJ LeMahieu all singled.\n\n\u201cEvery player on every team in this league has to dig deep,\u201d said Rex Brothers, who pitched a scoreless seventh inning with two hits and a strikeout. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just what has been going through our minds as the bullpen \u2014 digging deep and doing whatever it takes to hold that lead.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nPadres\u2019 Eric Stults (3-11, 4.96 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jair Jurrjens (0-1, 15.43), 1:10 p.m. Wednesday, no TV; 850 AM\n\nLast week, Jurrjens, the 13th starter the Rockies have used this season, made his first major-league appearance this season since the Rockies acquired him from the Cincinnati Reds organization. He struggled in more ways than one. Jurr jens lasted just 4 innings and gave up eight runs on 12 hits in his start last week. But he also got a trip to a hospital \u2014 because of breathing problems, probably caused by the altitude. Jurrjens isn\u2019t known as having a power arm \u2014 he has a career strikeout-to-walk ratio of less than 2-to-1. This will be his first start against the Padres since 2011.\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Twins\u2019 TBA at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (9-6, 4.75), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nSaturday: Twins\u2019 Kevin Correia (4-11, 4.79) at Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (1-3, 4.79), 2:10 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Charlie Blackmon homers as Colorado Rockies top San Diego Padres 2-1", "title": "Charlie Blackmon homers as Colorado Rockies top San Diego Padres 2-1", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/08/charlie-blackmon-homers-as-colorado-rockies-top-san-diego-padres-2-1/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708_093810_rockies.jpg", "height": 492}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708_093810_rockies.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T22:02:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:31:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa0c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe knew it was going to be tough to score against (Tyson) Ross,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\nCharlie Blackmon, one of two Rockies all-stars, hit a high, deep home run to right field, pushing Colorado to a 2-1 victory over the San Diego Padres.\nThe Rockies\u2019 team batting average in July (.220) is down 29 percent compared with April and 25 percent compared with June.\nIn their second game this series against the Padres, the Rockies managed seven hits against Tyson Ross.\nRoss and Rockies starter Franklin Morales threw an identical number of pitches (98), with the same number of strikes (63)."}
