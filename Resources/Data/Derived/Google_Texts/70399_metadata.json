Thomas Rosica, a Canadian priest who works with the Vatican's press office, said the Vatican requires foreign embassies to the Holy See be separate from the country's mission to Italy, have a separate address and have a separate entrance.\n\nBoth Rosica and the senior State Department official said the proposed U.S. move satisfies those requirements.\n\nRosica also praised Ken Hackett, the new U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, telling CNN that \"at this critical time in history, he brings eminent credentials to represent the United States to the Vatican.\"\n\nHe added there \"a very good feeling right now\" between the two countries.\n\nAnother Vatican official, not authorized to speak on the record about diplomatic relations, told CNN the Holy See understands security concerns are an issue for some countries and this move is \"an exception, not the ideal, but not the end of the world.\"\n\nThe State Department contends the move from a free-standing building to a more secure compound that currently includes the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations is a must following attacks on other American embassies.\n\nThe State Department official dismissed complaints that the move was hurting the U.S. relationship with the Vatican, telling reporters the embassy to the Holy See will be much closer to the Vatican and there will be \"no reduction in diplomatic staff. There\u2019s no reduction in ambassadors, there\u2019s no reduction in mission.\"\n\n\"The plan is to have the U.S. mission to the Holy See relocate to a building\" inside the current U.S. government compound, said the official. \"We figure that we will save about $1.4 million a year in lease and operating costs in moving them.\"\n\nAdditionally, the official said the security of the current U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is \"not in a building that has the kind of physical security protection that we would like it to have\" but that the new building affords diplomats with better security.\n\nFor Francis Rooney, the former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See under President George W. Bush, the proposed move is a slight to the Vatican.\n\nRooney told CNN that a freestanding, separate embassy shows more value to the relationship and that he worries the move will create \"a perception among foreign governments and other missions that the United States does not value its relationship with the Holy See.\"\n\n\"It is going to depreciate the prestige of the mission to relocate\" he said.\n\nIn response to the Vatican's statement that relations between it and the United States are fine, Rooney said the Holy See is \"bending over backwards not to disagree with the Department of State\u2019s decision\" and that privately \"they wouldn't want it to happen.\"\n\nNot all former U.S. ambassadors to the Holy See agree with Rooney, however.\n\nAmbassador Miguel H. Diaz, who served as Obama's first ambassador to the Holy See, said those who disagree are not basing their opinion on fact and information.\n\n\"I firmly believe that these issues have to be based on facts and not politicized in any way,\" he said. \"It is absolutely, 100 percent incorrect, it is absolutely erroneous, to interpret this decision in any way as the intention of the Obama administration to undermine or diminish the relationship between the United States and the Holy See.\"\n\nHe continued: \"This was done for security and financial reasons, not in any way to undermine and diminish the importance of the Holy See.\"\n\nJust as quickly as ambassadors like Rooney and Diaz weighed in, a number of contrastive Catholics began to assail the Obama administration for the move.\n\n\"The public perception is going to be a downgrading of the importance of the Holy See,\" Bill Donohue, head of the conservative Catholic League. \"It smacks of an animus.\"\n\nDonohue and others contend that by moving the embassy into a compound with other embassies, the United States is distancing itself from the Vatican and harming relations. He also finds it hard to believe the Obama administration would make a decision based on security and cost.\n\n\"When you have a track record that is not exactly Catholic-friendly, the people like myself are going to ask what is going on here,\" he said. \"This is the first time in six years this administration has ever been concerned with saving money. I am not surprised they found it at the Vatican.\"\n\nChris Hale, who helped run Catholic outreach for Obama's 2012 campaign, said the reaction of conservative Catholics is \"another attempt to politicize another issue and create a fight that isn't there.\"\n\n\"This is in no way signaling the administration\u2019s desire to not work with Pope Francis,\" he said. \"I think (conservative Catholics) are concerned with the narrative of Pope Francis being a progressive and they are trying to push any narrative the creates a perceived divide between Pope Francis and President Obama.\"\n\nIn attempt to quell any controversy, earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See posted on its Facebook page that reports that claim the \"embassy to the Holy See is closing, that our Ambassador\u2019s position is being cut, and/or that his residence is moving \u2026 are untrue.\"\n\nThe embassy, according to the Facebook post, will make the move in \"early 2015.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Dan Merica and Eric Marrapodi, CNN Washington (CNN) - When the State Department announced it was moving its Vatican embassy to a compound shared with the U.S. Embassy in Italy, some former ambassadors and conservative American Catholics were outraged.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Vatican downplays controversy over U.S. embassy move", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/27/vatican-knocks-down-controversy-over-u-s-embassy-move/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/130212111235-st-peters-vatican-620xa.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Dan Merica and Eric Marrapodi, CNN\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington (CNN) - When the State Department announced it was moving its Vatican embassy to a compound shared with the U.S. Embassy in Italy, some former ambassadors and conservative American Catholics were outraged.", "title": "Vatican downplays controversy over U.S. embassy move"}, "keywords": "barack obama, catholic church, pope francis, united states, vatican,", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/27/vatican-knocks-down-controversy-over-u-s-embassy-move/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd995\"", "article_summary": "Both Rosica and the senior State Department official said the proposed U.S. move satisfies those requirements.\nBy Dan Merica and Eric Marrapodi, CNNFollow @danmericaCNNFollow @EricCNNBeliefWashington (CNN) \u2013 When the State Department announced it was moving its Vatican embassy to a compound shared with the U.S. Embassy in Italy, some former ambassadors and conservative American Catholics were outraged.\nDonohue and others contend that by moving the embassy into a compound with other embassies, the United States is distancing itself from the Vatican and harming relations.\nA spokesman for the Vatican said the move was well within the Holy See's requirements for embassies and that relations with the United States are far from strained.\nRosica also praised Ken Hackett, the new U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, telling CNN that \"at this critical time in history, he brings eminent credentials to represent the United States to the Vatican.\""}
