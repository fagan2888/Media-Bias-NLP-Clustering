Tony Guyton, CC by 2.0\n\nParents often worry how their divorce will affect their children, but what happens between stepparents and their children after a second marriage falls apart? Expectedly, children take their cues from their parents when deciding how to continue step-family relationships, finds a new study from University of Missouri College of Human Environmental Sciences. In particular, the researchers say, stepchildren maintain ties with their former stepparents only when parents encourage them to continue doing so.\n\n\u201cRemarriages end in divorce more often than first marriages,\u201d wrote the authors, \u201cso many stepchildren experience multiple parental divorces and the potential loss of significant family ties.\u201d\n\nTo explore these broken hearts, the researchers interviewed 41 young adults who had experienced their parents\u2019 remarriage and subsequent divorce. At one time or another, half of the participants had considered their stepparents as family. The researchers refer to this as \u201cclaiming kin.\u201d During remarriage, they explain, judgments are made about whether or not someone is \u2018family,\u2019 and if so, expectations about feelings and interactions follow. However, in some cases, there\u2019s ambiguity. This is stressful since everyone is less sure how to act and feel. Subsequent divorce muddies the waters even more. During a second divorce, neither blood ties nor legal ties exist, and so stepparents and stepchildren remain unbound in the two ways commonly used to decide family obligations.\n\nDuring the study, the researchers found half of the subgroup who had \u201cclaimed kin\u201d still maintained relationships with their former stepparents, but the other half had ended these relationships. While a 6-year relationship might be just a tiny portion of an adult\u2019s life, it could occur during an especially meaningful moment in a child\u2019s development and so mean much more to a child than the parent. And though fairy tales often portray stepmothers as \"evil,\" in reality they may be more important to a child than his or her biological mother.\n\nStill, the fact is kids often have little agency or voice within their families and even less within stepfamilies. Whether or not they continue an ongoing relationship with a stepparent depends, largely, on their parents. Consider the fact that until kids are old enough to drive, they often don\u2019t have a way to maintain contact unless their parents facilitate the visits.\n\nIn the end, the researchers discovered stepchildren's views of former stepparents primarily depended on three issues: emotional reactions to the divorce, patterns of support or resource exchanges, and parental encouragement or discouragement to continue step-relationships.\n\nSource: Coleman M, Ganong L, Russell L, Frye-Cox N.
