Coupons.com has removed the option to print coupons from other regions using various zip codes.

CouponsInTheNews.com reported on Friday that Coupons.com, and their affiliate sites like the Smart Shopper coupons link, are no longer offering the option to enter in various zip codes to see what printable coupons are available in different cities and states.

You can probably still go into your settings and manually change your address to see other coupons in different areas, but that is far more time consuming than the zip code box that was available on their home page.

As the CouponsInTheNews article mentioned, they may have made this change so regional coupons remain in the region where they were intended to be used.

Regardless, it does change the availability of the coupons. What do you think?
