It\u2019s a call fraught with risk, and history offers few guideposts.\n\nMillions of workers on the sidelines and shifting demographics make it harder to tell just how low the jobless rate can sink before labor supply gets tight enough to stoke wage and price pressures.\n\nIt\u2019s a key issue for Fed officials debating when to lift interest rates. Policymakers indicated last month that they see room for more improvement in the job market. They marked down their projection of long-term unemployment to as low as 5 percent from the 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent range they saw in December.\n\nNow some economists are asking whether the Fed has overshot, while others wonder whether policymakers should aim to get unemployment even lower.\n\n\u201cThe goal posts are moving on their own, and the Fed is trying to figure out where they are,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. Because policy works with a lag, he said, officials are forced to rely on today\u2019s projections as they shape tomorrow\u2019s outcomes. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to drive a car looking in the rearview mirror.\u201d\n\nDisagreement abounds, and the stakes for predicting long-run unemployment are high.\n\n\u201cNobody really knows that number with any precision,\u201d former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said at a recent conference in Washington. \u201cThe Fed will continue to grope to find out what the right number is.\u201d\n\nIf the Fed is overly ambitious about how low unemployment can sink, policymakers could wait too long to increase interest rates and let inflation heat up more than they intend, repeating missteps from the 1970s. If they raise rates too soon or too high, they could needlessly put a lid on the U.S. expansion.\n\nThe Fed monitors labor and inflation data to predict one policy guidepost, known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. The NAIRU is roughly synonymous with the natural rate of unemployment: the joblessness that exists even in a healthy economy, as industries evolve, creating some jobs and wiping out others. Pushing unemployment below that equilibrium rate tightens the labor market past a tipping point, prompting employers to offer higher wages. That boosts prices.\n\nAfter the onset of the 2007-09 recession, economists expected that the natural rate had probably shifted higher: Many Americans had been out of work for months or years, long enough for their skills to atrophy and leave them permanently jobless. Technology seemed to be causing an unprecedented skills mismatch.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, demographics could be expected to push natural unemployment higher. People in the large baby boom generation are aging out of their prime working years and into retirement. That means the bulk of the labor force is shifting toward the even-larger millennial generation, born after 1981. Because younger workers tend to have fewer work skills and higher unemployment, their workforce dominance could push up overall jobless levels.\n\nAmid such structural changes, the Fed\u2019s forecast of long-term unemployment rose to a range of 5.2 percent to 6 percent in 2012 and 2013.\n\nWith fewer experienced, skilled workers in the labor force, a drop in headline unemployment would be expected to force employers to offer higher wages to attract qualified applicants.\n\nThat\u2019s not what happened, though. As unemployment has fallen, hitting an almost seven-year low of 5.5 percent in February, wage gains are modest and inflation is nowhere to be found. That suggests the natural unemployment rate could be lower, something the Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged when it shifted its projections down last month.\n\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans said last month that he thinks the natural unemployment rate might be around 5 percent, and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Dennis Lockhart said he\u2019s \u201ccertainly sympathetic\u201d with the idea that the rate has moved lower.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is moving it down based simply on the notion that we aren\u2019t seeing wage growth,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Conn., and a former Richmond Fed researcher. \u201cIt\u2019s like groping in the dark.\u201d\n\nMonetary policy takes time to affect the economy, Stanley said. That means inflation could sneak up on policymakers if they wait to see \u201cthe whites of the eyes\u201d before raising rates, Stanley said \u2014 and they might not be nimble enough to counteract it.\n\nJeanna Smialek,\n\nBloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the Fed is overly ambitious about how low unemployment can sink, policymakers could wait too long to increase interest rates.", "og": {"description": "If the Fed is overly ambitious about how low unemployment can sink, policymakers could wait too long to increase interest rates.", "title": "Shifting jobless outlook puts Fed in risky territory with no map", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150403-shifting-jobless-outlook-puts-fed-in-risky-territory-with-no-map.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150403-financial_markets_wall_street_federal_reserve_42868774.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/FINANCIAL_MARKETS_WALL_STREET_FEDERAL_RESERVE_42868774.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-04T02:00:38Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-04T02:00:38Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Shifting jobless outlook puts Fed in risky territory with no map\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150403-shifting-jobless-outlook-puts-fed-in-risky-territory-with-no-map.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150403-financial_markets_wall_street_federal_reserve_42868774.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/FINANCIAL_MARKETS_WALL_STREET_FEDERAL_RESERVE_42868774.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2244695\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-04T02:00:38Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150403-financial_markets_wall_street_federal_reserve_42868774.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/FINANCIAL_MARKETS_WALL_STREET_FEDERAL_RESERVE_42868774.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-04-04T02:00:38Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddecd\"", "article_summary": "Because younger workers tend to have fewer work skills and higher unemployment, their workforce dominance could push up overall jobless levels.\nThat suggests the natural unemployment rate could be lower, something the Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged when it shifted its projections down last month.\nThe Fed monitors labor and inflation data to predict one policy guidepost, known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\nWhat\u2019s more, demographics could be expected to push natural unemployment higher.\nNow some economists are asking whether the Fed has overshot, while others wonder whether policymakers should aim to get unemployment even lower."}
