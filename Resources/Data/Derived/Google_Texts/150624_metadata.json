As far as I\u2019m concerned, he probably still does,\u201d Trump said, using the same evidentiary standards as when he spoke about ebola and Obamacare earlier in the segment.\n\nIf you\u2019re rich enough you can go on television and call your enemies cokeheads and no one will question you.\n\nWatch the clip below, via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you're rich enough you can go on television and call your enemies cokeheads and no one will question you.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/trump3.jpg", "title": "Trump Calls New York AG a Cokehead"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you're rich enough you can go on television and call your enemies cokeheads and no one will question you.", "title": "Trump Calls New York AG a Cokehead", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/trump3.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-10-20T07:42:26+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "source alleging New York Attorney General and Trump nemesis Eric Schneiderman once did coke in the mid-2000s.\nThat\u2019s good enough for Page Six, and more than good enough for Trump.\nEvery Monday Fox & Friends hosts Donald Trump to free-associate about the news, and this Monday they found a doozy: Page Six has a named(!)\nIf you\u2019re rich enough you can go on television and call your enemies cokeheads and no one will question you.\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, he probably still does,\u201d Trump said, using the same evidentiary standards as when he spoke about ebola and Obamacare earlier in the segment."}
