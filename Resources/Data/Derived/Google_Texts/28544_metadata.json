The bill was called the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act until earlier this month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a statement opposing the bill on Monday, the White House said nearly all state and local officials spraying for mosquitoes are already allowed to use chemicals \"as needed to respond to Zika virus concerns and do not require any additional authorization.\" http://bit.ly/1XuU1kU\n\nPremium hikes of 16 percent on average\n\nAn analysis from Avalere Health shows proposed ObamaCare premiums for silver-level plans are increasing an average of 16 percent in nine states that so far have complete data.\n\nThe proposed increases vary widely \u2013 from a 44 percent average increase in Vermont to a 5 percent increase in Washington state \u2013 but appear to be much higher than last year on average. An Avalere analysis at a similar point in the process last year found an average increase of about 6 percent.\n\nThere are important caveats. First, these increases are not final yet, and state regulators can reject them. Still, final rates are expected to see widespread increases as well. http://bit.ly/1TUU2JJ\n\nDems making clear they want $1.9B for Zika\n\nAnother House Democrat \u2013 this time, the head of the House Democratic Caucus \u2013 says he'll oppose anything less than the president's full $1.9 billion ZIka funding request.\n\nRep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) said both the House's $622 million bill and the Senate's $1.1 billion proposal are insufficient to address the escalating crisis.\n\n\"I would not support inadequate funding to deal with the healthcare catastrophe that could develop if we do not tackle the Zika virus in the right way,\" Becerra told reporters in the Capitol.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the House minority leader, has sounded a similar warning in recent weeks, saying she also opposes both chambers' bills.
