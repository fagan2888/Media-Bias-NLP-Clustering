The marketplaces contain richer and skimpier categories, but silver plans were the most popular this year.\n\nFirst we looked at the cheapest silver plan in each geographical market, to give a sense of the best price an insurance shopper could get. Since last year, the price of the cheapest silver plans has barely risen; it\u2019s actually going down in seven states. The average increase was just 1 percent. That\u2019s pretty remarkable considering that health insurance premiums nearly always go up. If you\u2019re the kind of customer who cares only about premiums, it pays in almost every market to go back to the marketplace this year and switch to the cheapest plan.\n\nPrices Aren\u2019t Spiking for the Federal Government Federal tax credits for health insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are calculated based on the price of a plan in each market known as the \u201cbenchmark.\u201d So far, the average benchmark premiums are going down in many of the states with public rates for 2015.\n\nIf you stayed with the cheapest silver plan from 2014 \u2014 according to the Department of Health and Human Services, it was the most popular choice around the country \u2014 those prices are going up almost everywhere. In some cases, they have increased by more than 10 percent. The average increase is 8.4 percent.\n\nHere is an example of how those changes are playing out: In New York City, the cheapest 2014 silver plan was offered by MetroPlus and cost $359 a month, before tax credits, for a 40-year-old single nonsmoker. Renew that plan and the premium will increase by 17.3 percent. But switch to the cheapest plan now listed, offered by Health Republic, and the premium will go up by only 1 percent. The Health Republic network is broad, and includes providers who were in the MetroPlus plan. But consumers in other markets may need to be willing to jettison providers if they want the best price.\n\nThe third number we examined is important, too. For people with incomes between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $33,000 to $95,000 for a family of three \u2014 the federal government will kick in money to help pay for the insurance. Those subsidies are calculated based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan and the purchaser\u2019s income. What\u2019s happening in these plans can tell us how much the federal government\u2019s bill for subsidizing health insurance is going to go up. On average, the prices for the second-cheapest plans, called \u201cbenchmark plans,\u201d are actually going down by 1.4 percent, and in most places where they are increasing, they are increasing modestly. That\u2019s good news for the federal budget.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe small increases in the cheapest silver plan and the decreases in benchmark plans are a sign the marketplace is working as intended, said Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist who helped design the marketplace structure in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe main feature was that competition would bring rates down, and it did,\u201d he said.\n\nA few important caveats about this data: We still don\u2019t know the rates in every state. The McKinsey database includes rates the company has collected from the 18 states and the District of Columbia, which have publicly posted the prices that insurers plan to charge consumers. About 43 percent of Americans eligible to sign up live in those states, which include New York, California, Michigan and Ohio. In many of the states included in this analysis, the rates are still being reviewed by regulators. Even in states where regulators have approved the rates, prices could go down before the marketplaces open on Nov. 15. As more state data becomes available, we plan to update our map.\n\nBut to keep premiums from rising, consumers will have to fight inertia. The Obama administration is trying to make it as easy as possible for people to preserve their coverage next year by simply renewing their current health plans. People who don\u2019t choose to shop again on Healthcare.gov will be automatically renewed in the plans they bought in 2014. That\u2019s not true for every state. Some states running their own marketplaces, including Colorado and Rhode Island, are either requiring consumers to log in and update their information before they can renew or recalculating tax credits before sending renewal notices. But the federal rule applies in a majority of states.\n\nPhoto\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that few customers will return to the marketplace to shop for a new health plan. Customers in the Affordable Care Act marketplace may be more price-sensitive than those in previous government insurance markets. But in those other plans, inertia has tended to set in.\n\nFewer than 10 percent of seniors change their Medicare Part D drug plans each year, and only 12 percent of federal employees switch plans on the federal benefit exchange. Studies have shown that, in the Medicare Part D market in particular, many more seniors would be better off if they changed plans more frequently.\n\nIn the marketplaces, it\u2019s not yet clear why rates on the most popular plans are increasing so much more than their competitors. It\u2019s possible insurers are charging more for these plans to take advantage of inertia and increase profits. It\u2019s also possible that some priced their initial policies unsustainably low, given the new nature of this market, and are now correcting.\n\nBrendan Buck, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said the main factor driving premium increases was \u201cwho signed up.\u201d Many of the new lowest cost plans are new market entrants, according to McKinsey, which means they may have less data on how expensive these new customers will be to cover. We\u2019re likely to get more insight into the forces driving premiums changes in coming years.\n\nAutomatically renewing marketplace plans will be a mistake for many people, but it is an especially risky one for the 85 percent of people who qualified for some sort of subsidy. The Obama administration has chosen not to recalculate the value of tax credits for people who don\u2019t return to the Healthcare.gov site.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf your subsidy should go down \u2014 either because you have received a raise since last year or because the benchmark plan in the market became cheaper \u2014 you could end up owing the government a lot more money than you think, and you won\u2019t find out until tax time. Sam Baker at National Journal has a good article walking through the mechanics of how this works.\n\nNot everyone has to worry about these invisible price changes, especially if incomes haven\u2019t changed. But in markets where federal rules apply and the benchmark is going down a lot, it pays to return to the marketplace before renewing. Places where that will be an issue include parts of Georgia, Indiana and Ohio \u2014 where benchmark prices are declining by more than 15 percent. For people in those areas, returning to the marketplace could prevent a surprise tax bill.\n\n\u201cThe structure makes for a very competitive environment among the insurance carriers,\u201d said Paul Houchens, an actuary at Milliman, who estimates that, in some cases, what looks like a 5 percent premium rise could actually mean an increase of more than 30 percent. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cI can see how it would create more confusion for consumers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140917140127, "twitter": {"description": "In the Affordable Care Act marketplaces so far, insurance filings show good news for the federal budget and aggressive shoppers.
