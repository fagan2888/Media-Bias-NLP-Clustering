Now the Lakers great and five-time champion is on the verge of passing His Airness at No. 3 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, a feat he\u2019s all but certain to achieve Sunday at Minnesota (he needs only nine points).\n\nThe Denver Nuggets, for better or worse, deserve some credit here. Although Bryant has posted his best scoring average (27.9 points per game) against the Golden State Warriors and has saved the most 40-plus-point games for the Phoenix Suns (11), he scored 40 or more against the Nuggets nine times, tied with Houston for the third-most. (He did it to the Warriors 10 times.)\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at those nine games against the Nuggets, starting with his first two on back-to-back nights:\n\nFeb. 11, 2003: 42 points in a 121-93 Lakers win in L.A.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb. 12, 2003: 51 points in 113-102 Lakers win in Denver\n\nJan. 2, 2005: 42 points in a 99-91 Lakers win in L.A.\n\nApril 6, 2006: 42 points in a 110-108 (OT) Nuggets win in Denver\n\nApril 23, 2008: 49 points in 112-107 Lakers win in L.A.\n\nMay 19, 2009: 40 points in a 105-103 Lakers win in L.A.\n\nMay 23, 2009: 41 points in 103-97 Lakers win in Denver\n\nMay 8, 2012: 43 points in a 102-99 Nuggets win in L.A.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Denver Nuggets,Kobe Bryant,Michael Jordan", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Looking back at the nine 40-plus-point outings against the Nuggets by Kobe Bryant, who is on the verge of passing Michael Jordan at No. 3 on the all-time scoring list.", "title": "WATCH: Looking back at Kobe Bryant's 40-plus-point games vs. Nuggets", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/12/13/watch-kobe-bryant-puts-40-plus-points-vs-nuggets-nine-times/12258/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/12/kobe-nuggets-495x305.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Looking back at the nine 40-plus-point outings against the Nuggets by Kobe Bryant, who is on the verge of passing Michael Jordan at No. 3 on the all-time scoring list.", "title": "WATCH: Looking back at Kobe Bryant\u2019s 40-plus-point games vs. Nuggets", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/12/13/watch-kobe-bryant-puts-40-plus-points-vs-nuggets-nine-times/12258/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/12/kobe-nuggets-495x305.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Looking back at the nine 40-plus-point outings against the Nuggets by Kobe Bryant, who is on the verge of passing Michael Jordan at No. 3 on the all-time scoring list."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf3a\"", "article_summary": "Throughout his 18-plus seasons in the NBA, Kobe Bryant has drawn comparisons to Michael Jordan for obvious reasons.\nNow the Lakers great and five-time champion is on the verge of passing His Airness at No.\n3 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, a feat he\u2019s all but certain to achieve Sunday at Minnesota (he needs only nine points).\nThe Denver Nuggets, for better or worse, deserve some credit here.\n(He did it to the Warriors 10 times.)"}
