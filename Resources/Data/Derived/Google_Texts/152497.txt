A Decatur man has died after being trapped in an overturned log truck in Jones County Wednesday.

42-year-old Rickey D. Stewart of Decatur was trapped in an overturned log truck for two and a half hours Wednesday morning, before he died of his injuries. He was involved in a two vehicle accident that happened on Highway 29 south of Ellisville. Stewart's 18-wheeler hauling logs struck another vehicle near a bridge and went down an embankment. First responders tried to extract Stewart from the vehicle, and a life flight helicopter was on the scene but left after the coroner confirmed his death.
