She packed them in ice chests and moved them when her office flooded this year. She pays a company to monitor the fridge in case the temperature rises.\n\n\u201cThe security company can call me any time of the day or night so I can go save my vaccines,\u201d said Irvin, a pediatrician. Those in the refrigerator recently cost $70,000, she said \u2014 \u201cmore than I paid for four years of medical school.\u201d\n\nVaccination prices have gone from single digits to sometimes triple digits in the last two decades, creating dilemmas for doctors and their patients as well as straining public health budgets. Some doctors have stopped offering immunizations because they say they cannot afford to buy these potentially lifesaving preventive treatments that insurers often reimburse poorly, sometimes even at a loss.\n\nChildhood immunizations are so vital to public health that the Affordable Care Act mandates their coverage at no out-of-pocket cost and they are generally required for school entry. Once a loss leader for manufacturers, because they are often more expensive to produce than conventional drugs, vaccines now can be very profitable.\n\nOld vaccines have been reformulated with higher costs. New ones have entered the market at once-unthinkable prices. Together, since 1986, they have pushed up the average cost to fully vaccinate a child with private insurance to the age of 18 to $2,192 from $100, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even with deep discounts, the costs for the federal government, which buys half of all vaccines for the nation\u2019s children, have increased 15-fold during that period. The most expensive shot for young children in Irvin\u2019s refrigerator is Prevnar 13, which prevents diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria, from ear infections to pneumonia.\n\nLike many vaccines, Prevnar requires multiple jabs. Each shot is priced at $135, and every child in the United States is required to get four doses before entering school. Pfizer, the sole manufacturer, had revenue of nearly $4 billion from its Prevnar vaccine line last year, about double what it made from high-profile drugs like Lipitor and Viagra, which now face generic competitors.\n\nBig seller\n\nMichael Haydock, an analyst at the London-based consulting firm Datamonitor Healthcare, said no vaccine had ever been such a big seller. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive in part because it\u2019s a very effective vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also because they\u2019re exploiting their monopoly.\u201d\n\nThat does not sit well with many doctors. Even though the vaccine has not changed, the price of the current version, Prevnar 13 (it protects against 13 strains), has gone up an average of 6 percent each year since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010.\n\n\u201cYou have to make back your investment and pay your shareholders, but at what point do you say, \u2018Look, you\u2019ve had your steak, gravy and potatoes and this is enough?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Steven Black, a vaccine expert at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital who served on the government committee that recommended all children get Prevnar 7, an earlier version of the vaccine.\n\nTo deal with the rising prices, some doctors, who say they lose money on every vaccination, reserve their shots for long-standing patients. A survey of family-practice doctors, who along with pediatricians are among the lowest-earning physicians, found that about one-third were considering giving up immunizations because of the expense. Another survey found that 40 percent do not offer at least some required childhood immunizations.\n\nThat is why Breanna Farris, a San Antonio mother, had to call 10 pediatricians in April before she found Irvin to vaccinate her son, Traven, who is entering kindergarten this fall. The family\u2019s usual doctors do not offer vaccinations and referred Farris to local pharmacies (which do not vaccinate children) or the city health clinic (which would not take Traven\u2019s insurance).\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Where should I go?\u2019 \u201d Farris said. \u201cThey say vaccines are covered, but that isn\u2019t really true if doctors aren\u2019t giving them.\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s view\n\nThere are, of course, some good reasons vaccines like Prevnar are more expensive than previous offerings. Vaccine trials, which once included thousands of volunteers, must now include tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people, as fears about side effects like autism have grown, even though many studies have concluded that such worries are unfounded. Some of the newer vaccines are complicated to manufacture.\n\nPrevnar, for example, involves attaching a piece of a dangerous bacterium\u2019s outer layer to a protein that renders it better able to provoke a protective immune reaction in babies. And because it covers 13 strains of the disease, it is in some ways 13 vaccines in one.\n\nPfizer maintains that Prevnar\u2019s prices are justified because of its investment in \u201cone of the most complex biologic products ever developed and manufactured,\u201d said Sally Beatty, a company spokeswoman. She noted that it takes five years and costs $600 million to build a vaccine manufacturing site, and that one batch of Prevnar 13 takes two years to create, with more than 500 quality control tests. Development of the first Prevnar vaccine took 14 years, Beatty said, from the initiation of research to licensing. (That work occurred before Pfizer acquired the Prevnar brand in 2009 when it bought Wyeth Laboratories, which had in turn acquired it from smaller companies.)\n\nMost developed countries demand better cost-effectiveness numbers before approval of vaccines and can use that to negotiate for discounts, said Anthony Newall, a health economist at the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\nThe Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products pays $101, a price that has not changed over time. In Britain, the small private health care market sells prefilled syringes of Prevnar 13 for an average of $82 at pharmacies; the National Health Service pays even less, experts say.\n\nPrice variations\n\nBecause some companies, like Pfizer, require that each physician sign a legal agreement not to disclose the price he or she paid, there is little informed shopping. \u201cI was kind of aghast, I didn\u2019t think it could be legal, but it is,\u201d said Dr. Gary L. Freed, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who has studied vaccine purchases. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly a very inefficient market since it means physicians don\u2019t have information to bargain.\u201d\n\nThe result is much like that in other aspects of American medicine: huge price variations for the same item or service. Large group practices that have purchasing clout with drugmakers and insurers may make a profit from providing vaccines, while solo practices, like Irvin\u2019s, can incur losses. Some doctors pay three times as much as others in the same city, Freed\u2019s studies have found. One large practice was yielding $39 per dose of Prevnar, while 11 percent of practices were losing money on it.\n\nIt is not clear how much Pfizer is profiting from Prevnar in the United States. But one measure is to look at the price at which Pfizer sells Prevnar for use in the poorest countries through a World Health Organization initiative: $3.30 a dose.\n\nThe CDC, which declined an interview for this article, must walk a delicate line pressing drug companies to modulate prices: When there is one manufacturer, as with Prevnar 13, the company could raise charges or slow production, creating disastrous shortages.\n\nThe family practice doctor downstairs in Irvin\u2019s office building has stopped immunizing children. A local obstetrician recently told her in tears that she cannot afford to give pregnant patients a shot recommended to boost the mother\u2019s immunity to whooping cough, protection that is transferred to her unborn baby for the first months after birth. Nationally, less than 10 percent of pregnant women are getting this recommended shot.\n\nThough there are many reasons women go unvaccinated, studies show that patients are far less likely to get a vaccine if their doctors do not offer it. And the consequences can be grave: Last year, two babies, each a month old, died of whooping cough in San Antonio. Their mothers had not been vaccinated during pregnancy.\n\nElisabeth Rosenthal,\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vaccination prices have gone from single digits to sometimes triple digits in the last two decades, straining public health budgets.", "og": {"description": "Vaccination prices have gone from single digits to sometimes triple digits in the last two decades, straining public health budgets.", "title": "Doctors, patients feel pinch of shot costs", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140704-doctors-patients-feel-pinch-of-shot-costs.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140704-vaccine_prices_2.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/VACCINE_PRICES_2.jpg", "height": 438}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-07-05T02:39:58Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-07-05T02:39:47Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Doctors, patients feel pinch of shot costs\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140704-doctors-patients-feel-pinch-of-shot-costs.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140704-vaccine_prices_2.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/VACCINE_PRICES_2.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1785862\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-05T02:39:47Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20140704-vaccine_prices_2.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/VACCINE_PRICES_2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-05T02:39:47Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb13d\"", "article_summary": "And because it covers 13 strains of the disease, it is in some ways 13 vaccines in one.\nDevelopment of the first Prevnar vaccine took 14 years, Beatty said, from the initiation of research to licensing.\nThe most expensive shot for young children in Irvin\u2019s refrigerator is Prevnar 13, which prevents diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria, from ear infections to pneumonia.\nTo deal with the rising prices, some doctors, who say they lose money on every vaccination, reserve their shots for long-standing patients.\nLike many vaccines, Prevnar requires multiple jabs."}
