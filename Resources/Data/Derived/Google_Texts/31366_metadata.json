Here's why. In recent news we have seen or read much to be concerned with. Here are three examples:\n\n1. USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin recently ran an entire series titled \u201cKids in Crisis,\u201d which address the mental and emotional health of our young people in Wisconsin. This is manifesting with an increase in teen suicides as well as other behaviors indicating a desperate need for help. Noted throughout the series was the need for additional mental health services as well as access to services. However, there was very little identified about root causes and how to combat those.\n\nThe entire Kids In Crisis series may be found here: post.cr/1NnWZOU.\n\n2. \u201cThe Raising of America\u201d, a documentary series which addresses early childhood and the future of our nation, shares these startling facts:\n\n\u2022Every child\u2019s brain develops more connections before age 5 than they do the rest of their lives.\n\n\u2022The United States is the only nation in the industrialized world that has no mandate for paid maternity leave.\n\n\u2022The United States has more child poverty than any nation in Europe, except Romania.\n\nLearn more at www.raisingofamerica.org.\n\n3.\"Safe zones\" have been created at police stations nationwide to exchange money for goods purchased on Craigslist. Yet, parents and providers advertise and seek child care routinely on the same website for our most precious asset, our children. We know this website can be a haven for predators who lie in wait for the vulnerable.\n\nGreatest nation in the world?\n\nWe proclaim to be the greatest nation in the world, but we ask, for whom? Surely not for our children, as evidenced by the Gannett series \u201cKids in Crisis.\u201d Not for the newborn whose parents must work to make ends meet. Not parents who are so desperate to find reliable child care, in order to work, they seek it from a website with questionable reputation and results.\n\nSo what then is the solution? Commitment: A commitment to turn our attention to our future, which will be carried out by our children. A commitment to providing quality care for young children. A commitment to ensuring they have time to bond with family. A commitment to ensuring their basic needs are met including economic and social needs.\n\nChild Care Resource & Referral\u2019s role\n\nDuring the Week of the Young Child, and every week of the year, CCR&R will work to advocate for and increase the capacity of quality child care in the counties we serve. In addition, we will continue to educate and provide training to child care providers in all areas of early care and education including nutrition, safety, mental health, conscious discipline and family engagement. We will also advocate for regulated child care and the resources necessary to attain this. What will you do?\n\nJudy Olson is executive director of Child Care Resource & Referral, which provides services in Calumet, Fond du Lac, Green Lake, Manitowoc, Outagamie, Sheboygan, Waupaca and Winnebago counties.
