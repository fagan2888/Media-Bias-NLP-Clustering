On the plus side, the plan seeks to put an end to the numerous mandates included in the controversial healthcare system. The individual mandate, and the employer and employee mandates will be brought to an end. Included in Bush\u2019s plan are several other policy ideas that would shift insurance markets to more of a free-market system.\n\nHaskins not only looks at the good parts of the plan, he also examines the drawbacks. Bush\u2019s plan would hold in place the guarantee for people with pre-existing to be able to purchase health insurance. This well-intentioned part of Obamacare leads to many opportunities to abuse the system. Haskins examines several other negatives that he sees in the plan.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: In the podcast, Bush\u2019s plan to cap tax breaks is talked about at length. Just to clarify and correct, Bush\u2019s plan is to cap the tax break individuals, not businesses, receive for their employer-provided health insurance. Here\u2019s the official quote from Bush\u2019s campaign website: \u201cGive individuals a $12,000 tax break on the health benefits they receive through their employer \u2014 a reform that will encourage lower insurance premiums and higher wages.\u201d\n\nFurther analysis of this plan can be found here.\n\n[Subscribe to the Heartland Daily Podcast for free at this link.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/10/heartland-daily-podcast-justin-haskins-jebs-plan-to-repeal-replace-obamacare/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/healthmoney.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Heartland Daily Podcast \u2013 Justin Haskins: Jeb\u2019s Plan to Repeal & Replace Obamacare"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd69bd\"", "article_summary": "In today\u2019s edition of The Heartland Daily Podcast, Heartland Editor Justin Haskins discusses presidential candidate Jeb Bush\u2019s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nEditor\u2019s Note: In the podcast, Bush\u2019s plan to cap tax breaks is talked about at length.\nBush\u2019s plan would hold in place the guarantee for people with pre-existing to be able to purchase health insurance.\nIncluded in Bush\u2019s plan are several other policy ideas that would shift insurance markets to more of a free-market system.\nJust to clarify and correct, Bush\u2019s plan is to cap the tax break individuals, not businesses, receive for their employer-provided health insurance."}
