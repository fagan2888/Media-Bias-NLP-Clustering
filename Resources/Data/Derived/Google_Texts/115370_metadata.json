She retired to Wilson in 2013.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d she said of the appointment. \u201cI\u2019ve served on a number of nonprofit boards in New Jersey, and I gave them up because we moved out to Wyoming. The hospital is something I\u2019m passionate about. I\u2019ve spent my entire career in health care.\u201d\n\nShe has also helped her parents and an aunt through severe medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer.\n\n\u201cI really learned a lot about cancer, about mental health, about taking care of people with dignity and listening to them and helping them really live out their lives as they choose to live it out,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nDuring her time with the pharmaceutical company Novartis, Hogan helped with strategic planning to prepare the corporation for changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act. Trustees likely valued that experience on her resume, she said.\n\nOn the application Hogan submitted to the board, she wrote that she was a part-time Jackson Hole resident, but she and her husband plan to put their New Jersey home on the market in April and to live here full time, she said.\n\nTrustees picked Hogan from a field of seven, a choice they said was difficult. The field included two outspoken hospital critics: former patient Susan Crosser and former employee Vickie Memmer. Other candidates included medical professionals, valley residents and some second homeowners who recently moved here full time.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Jackson Hole News&Guide", "description": "Retired pharmaceutical executive Cynthia Hogan has been named the newest member of the St. John\u2019s Medical Center board of trustees.", "title": "Hospital board chooses Hogan", "url": "http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/jackson_hole_daily/local/hospital-board-chooses-hogan/article_42d7a7e8-4756-54c6-ae63-82e545173177.html", "image": "http://jhnewsandguide.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/og_image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@JacksonHoleNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Retired pharmaceutical executive Cynthia Hogan has been named the newest member of the St. John\u2019s Medical Center board of trustees.", "fb": {"app_id": 1448656212045976}, "keywords": "st. john's medical center,cynthia hogan,michael tennican,zach hall,novartis,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,als,local,health,top_story", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "st. john's medical center,cynthia hogan,michael tennican,zach hall,novartis,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,als,local,health,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b40\"", "article_summary": "Retired pharmaceutical executive Cynthia Hogan has been named the newest member of the St. John\u2019s Medical Center board of trustees.\nHospital leaders touted Hogan\u2019s experience in the health care industry, both as a professional and as someone who has helped people through serious medical conditions.\nHogan, 58, spent more than three decades in the pharmaceutical industry, working in a dozen different positions.\nDuring her time with the pharmaceutical company Novartis, Hogan helped with strategic planning to prepare the corporation for changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act.\nMembers of the board voted unanimously Thursday to appoint Hogan to replace departing trustee Zach Hall."}
