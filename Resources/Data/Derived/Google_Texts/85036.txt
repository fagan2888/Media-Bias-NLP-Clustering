With all the talk about a looming physician shortage in the US, it’s instructive to see where the US falls in terms of physicians per capita.According to a 2014 report from the World Health Organization, the US has 24.5 physicians per 10,000 people. That’s just behind the UK (27.9) and Slovenia (25.2), and just ahead of Uzbekistan (23.8).The US has 29 hospital beds per 10,000 people, and, according to the World Bank, and spends about 17.9% of the nation’s gross domestic product on healthcare.What follows is a list of the 10 countries with the most physicians per capita. The data come from the WHO and World Bank. Population data comes from the UnitedNations.One small note: San Marino and Monaco would come in fourth place and second place, respectively. However, we’ve left them off the list since neither has a population in excess of 40,000.
