Adrienne Grunwald for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThree of New York City\u2019s top religious leaders, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Rev. A.R. Bernard and Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, visited Friday the South Brooklyn home of police Officer Wenjian Liu, who was fatally shot two weeks ago by a gunman who cited police shootings of unarmed black men and later took his own life.\n\nThe Dec. 20 slayings of officers Liu and Rafael Ramos resulted in an outpouring of support for police officers, and Cardinal Dolan has taken a leading role in the aftermath, addressing the shootings from the pulpit and calling the officers\u2019 deaths a \u201cbrutal and irrational execution.\u201d\n\nAt the Liu family\u2019s home Friday, Cardinal Dolan, the city\u2019s top Catholic official; the Rev. Bernard, who leads a Christian mega-church in Brooklyn; and Rabbi Potasnik, the executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis, declined to comment on their meeting. Officer Liu, who was born in China and emigrated to the United States at 12 years old, wasn\u2019t religious, according to police officials. But his wake and funeral this weekend will incorporate some Buddhist traditions in a nod to his cultural background.\n\nOutside the home, bouquets of flowers have been piled waist high and a small blue tarp tent has been erected. There wereseveral teddy bears, including a panda, a wreath and a sign in both Chinese and English that reads: \u201cGone but not forgotten.\u201d Just inside the fence are a row of religious candles.\n\nBarbara Rosenwald, 57 years old, of Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, lit three candles in front of the memorial, saying it was \u201cimportant for me to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a 19-year-old daughter who wants to become a police officer,\u201d Ms. Rosenwald said. \u201cShe wants to go to the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. I\u2019m scared for her, but I\u2019m very proud of her, and I can\u2019t believe that I lived to see this day when officers were assassinated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Three of New York City's top religious leaders, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Rev.
