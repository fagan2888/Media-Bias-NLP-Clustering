The law kicked in on Tuesday as early voting in Texas\u2019 November 5 election began.\n\nAs she told local channel Kiii News, 117th District Court Judge Sandra Watts was flagged for possible voter fraud because her driver\u2019s license lists her maiden name as her middle name, while her voter registration form has her real middle name. This was the first time she has ever had a problem voting in 49 years. \u201cWhat I have used for voter registration and for identification for the last 52 years was not sufficient yesterday when I went to vote,\u201d she said.\n\nWatts worried that women who use maiden names or hyphenated names may be surprised at the polls. \u201cI don\u2019t think most women know that this is going to create a problem,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThat their maiden name is on their driver\u2019s license, which was mandated in 1964 when I got married, and this. And so why would I want to use a provisional ballot when I\u2019ve been voting regular ballot for the last 49 years?\u201d\n\nMany married women do not update their IDs after taking their spouse\u2019s surnames, as the process is arduous and costly. Women must present original documents verifying their name change, such as a marriage license, or pay $20 to obtain new copies. Under the new voter ID law, these women are potential voter fraud risks.\n\nWatts is hardly the only woman who has encountered problems. ThinkProgress\u2019 Scott Keyes interviewed 84-year-old Dorothy Card, who was denied a voter ID three times even though she has voted for more than 60 years and provided extensive proof of identity.\n\nWhile Watts, as an experienced judge, is familiar with the intricacies of election law, the people most likely to be stopped at the polls will be less informed about their rights. Low-income voters, minorities, students and seniors disproportionately lack the required identification \u2014 a fact that prompted the Justice Department and several federal judges to block the law under now-defunct provisions in the Voting Rights Act. After public outcry, Texas officials said they would distribute a free voter ID to eligible recipients who applied for one. As of this week, however, just 41 people received free IDs, out of the 1.4 million Texas voters who lack the required documents.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A Texas district judge ran into trouble at the polls because she used her maiden name on her driver's license, violating the state's new draconian voter ID law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A Texas district judge ran into trouble at the polls because she used her maiden name on her driver's license, violating the state's new draconian voter ID law.", "title": "Texas Judge Almost Blocked From Voting Because Of New Voter ID Law", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/10/23/2821651/texas-judge-voter/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/watts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas district judge ran into trouble at the polls because she used her maiden name on her driver's license, violating the state's new draconian voter ID law.", "creator": "@avivash", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/watts-321x214.jpg", "title": "Texas Judge Almost Blocked From Voting Because Of New Voter ID Law", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/watts.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/watts.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-23T09:51:12+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/avivawshen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ab1\"", "article_summary": "Justice Texas Judge Almost Blocked From Voting Because Of New Voter ID Law CREDIT: Kiii NewsA Texas district judge who has been voting for the past five decades was almost barred from the polls Tuesday, thanks to the state\u2019s newly implemented, stricter voter ID law.\nUnder the new voter ID law, these women are potential voter fraud risks.\nAfter public outcry, Texas officials said they would distribute a free voter ID to eligible recipients who applied for one.\nThe law kicked in on Tuesday as early voting in Texas\u2019 November 5 election began.\nThinkProgress\u2019 Scott Keyes interviewed 84-year-old Dorothy Card, who was denied a voter ID three times even though she has voted for more than 60 years and provided extensive proof of identity."}
