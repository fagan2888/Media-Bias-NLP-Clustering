That provision was added, on a 90-10 vote, to the broader bill, and replaces an earlier version that would have only ended the tax through 2025.

That penalty is triggered if the portion of the premium an employer charges for single coverage exceeds 9.5% of an employee's household income and the employee is eligible for and uses a federal premium subsidy to purchase coverage in a public exchange.\n\n\u2022 Elimination of the 2.3% federal excise tax imposed on manufacturers of medical devices.\n\nThese provisions were added by the Senate to the budget reconciliation bill the House of Representatives passed in October.\n\nThe House is expected to accept the Senate measure, eliminating the need for a congressional conference committee to iron out the differences.\n\nHowever, the White House earlier this week said President Barack Obama will veto the measure.\n\nWith the Senate narrowly passing the legislation, there is little expectation that that are enough votes to overturn a presidential veto.\n\nHowever, observers say it is likely that at least some of the health care law repeal provisions could be included in so-called \u201cmust pass\u201d legislation to extend expiring tax code provisions.\n\nSuch a bill could emerge next week, observers say.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Key provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the excise tax on costly health care plans, would be repealed under legislation passed by the Senate Thursday night.The slew of the health care reform law-related provisions in the broader budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 3762, that the Senate...", "title": "Senate approves bill to kill health reform law 'Cadillac' tax - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20151204/NEWS03/151209884", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20151204/NEWS03/151209884/AR/0/senate-majority-leader-mitch-mcconnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Key provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the excise tax on costly health care plans, would be repealed under legislation passed by the Senate Thursday night.The slew of the health care reform law-related provisions in the broader budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 3762, that the Senate...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Senate approves bill to kill health reform law 'Cadillac' tax - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "The slew of the health care reform law-related provisions in the broader budget reconciliation bill, H.R.\nKey provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the excise tax on costly health care plans, would be repealed under legislation passed by the Senate Thursday night.\nHowever, observers say it is likely that at least some of the health care law repeal provisions could be included in so-called \u201cmust pass\u201d legislation to extend expiring tax code provisions.\nThe Senate vote \u201cis another strong bipartisan recognition that this tax must be repealed to preserve employer-sponsored health coverage,\u201d James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council in Washington, said in a statement.\nThese provisions were added by the Senate to the budget reconciliation bill the House of Representatives passed in October."}
