He will be honored next month at a luncheon in Salem.\n\nRuiter\u2019s volunteer work in schools began when he retired 11 years ago. He became a volunteer reader in the Start Making a Reader Today program at the elementary schools where his daughter taught over the years.\n\nBut on Halloween in 2011, a fifth-grade neighbor showed up with her mom at Ruiter\u2019s door trick-or-treating. Ruiter asked the girl\u2019s mother how reading was going, and the mom suggested the girl needed some extra one-on-one time. The girl wondered whether Ruiter could be the one to provide it.\n\nHe agreed and began volunteering at her school, Ponderosa Elementary, where he felt at home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at a few other schools,\u201d Ruiter said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt as much a part of the staff.\u201d\n\nNow in his fifth year volunteering at Ponderosa, Ruiter has moved on from helping with SMART. Ruiter introduced Ponderosa Elementary to Khan Academy, a free website that offers lessons in subjects such as science, math and computer programming.\n\nStudents can sign on to Khan Academy at home to challenge themselves, and Ruiter has encouraged the kids to learn to write computer code.\n\nRuiter wasn\u2019t a coder himself, though, until now.\n\nAfter earning a degree in speech and hearing therapy, Ruiter taught for a couple of years. But he said he couldn\u2019t support his family on a teacher\u2019s salary. He worked in insurance until his retirement.\n\nOnce Ruiter started volunteering, he remembered the passion he had for interacting with children, or as he calls them, \u201ckiddos.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I missed it until I started doing it again,\u201d Ruiter said.\n\nThe staff at Ponderosa Elementary is thrilled with the work he\u2019s doing. Principal Steve Austin said the school is lucky to have an engaged staff and that Ruiter just adds to the productivity.\n\nAnd Khan Academy can help students who are behind review their skills or test students who are ahead.\n\nAustin nominated Ruiter for the governor\u2019s award; he sees the positive effect Ruiter has on the kids and also the positive effect they have on him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just energizing to him,\u201d Austin said.\n\nThe award came as a surprise to Ruiter. Austin said Ruiter was honored by it but is determined to keep the focus on the students and school\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do it for any kind of extrinsic reward,\u201d Austin said. \u201cBut it was a natural fit.\u201d\n\nNicole Ricketts, a reading teacher at Ponderosa, has worked closely with Ruiter during his time there. When she was teaching fourth grade, Ruiter began working with some of her students who needed help with math.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one that\u2019s the cheerleader,\u201d Ricketts said, explaining how Ruiter is constantly thinking of innovative ways to engage kids.\n\nIn a write-up about the governor\u2019s award winners on the Oregon Volunteers website, Ruiter is described as someone who \u201calways looks for ways to help students and their families,\u201d and that he \u201cmeets with countless parents explaining how to help their children at home. \u2026 He does all this with a passion and enthusiasm for learning that is contagious.\u201d\n\nMany of the students on campus know and recognize Ruiter. Fourth-graders Reid Abrahamson and Mason Bergler, both 9, have been working with \u201cMr. Bill,\u201d as they call him, since second grade.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just really helpful,\u201d Reid said, launching into an excited description of the kind of coding he\u2019s learned from Khan Academy, thanks to Ruiter.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to the students why Ruiter gives up his free time to volunteer at the school, sometimes five days a week.\n\n\u201cHe likes kids,\u201d Mason said.\n\nReid and Mason have advanced from basic coding to making their own animations over time. And although at first some students were surprised to see someone their grandparents\u2019 age taking on computer coding, they now acknowledge Ruiter knows his stuff.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who are his age are intimidated by technology,\u201d Austin said. \u201cHe embraces it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0325, kfisicaro@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Bend man has been recognized for his work at Ponderosa Elementary School with a 2015 Governor\u2019s Volunteer Award.
