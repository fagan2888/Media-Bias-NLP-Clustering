Janissa Delzo, YouTube\n\nBetween hosting Extra TV, starring in her own reality television series, being the CEO of AfterBuzz TV, how did Maria Menounos manage to lose 40 lbs. and keep it off?\n\nYou can read all about it in her new book, The EveryGirl\u2019s Guide To Diet And Fitness, a follow-up to her 2011 book, The EveryGirl\u2019s Guide to Life. But who is the \"EveryGirl\"? In one of the first few pages of her book, she explains just that:\n\nEverygirl (n): A term in this book that literally refers to every girl out there, young or old, single or married, rich or poor who lacks time in their day and money to spend, either because they are struggling financially or are just wise and thrifty, but more than anything wants to improve their lives and to grow.\n\nMenounos\u2019 book features a wide range of health information, including 11 diet and fitness rules to live by, 13 steps that helped Maria drop 40 lbs., a guide to gyms and exercise, delicious healthy recipes, and much more. Some A-list celebrities, like Khloe Kardashian, Bethenny Frankel, Suzanne Somers, and others, offer some healthy living advice.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Janissa Delzo Photo courtesy of Janissa Delzo\n\nA brief look into some of Menounos\u2019 many EveryGirl Tips:\n\n\u201cThe Skinny On Wrinkles: If I haven\u2019t convinced you that you don\u2019t need to be thin as a rail for health reasons, then consider the fact that when you\u2019re skinny, the wrinkles on your face show more because you lack the fat on your face to fill them out!\u201d \u201cAvoid Crash Dieting: Short-term crash diets often slow your metabolism, so that when you return to eating normally you\u2019ll gain weight back faster. Worse your body instinctively puts on extra pounds as a kind of insurance in case you\u2019re foolish enough to attempt another crash diet down the road.\u201d \u201cRun Your Body On High-Quality Fuel: If you put low-grade fuel in your car, the result is a car that runs like crap, with a shortened life expectancy. Put high-grade quality fuel in your car and the result is a car that runs well and lasts longer. The same can be said for your body, as is shown by people like my father. Give your body quality fuel \u2014 food that comes from the ground \u2014 and you\u2019ll get the same results! Not processed food. Real food.\u201d \u201cPick Up A Magic Bullet Blender: I use mine constantly to blend healthy shakes and dressings. Fast to use, space saving, and easy to clean \u2013 they are a convenient kitchen and weight-loss companion.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy of Pat Lambert Photo courtesy of Pat Lambert\n\nAt Maria\u2019s June 5 book signing at Trina Turk in Manhattan, I got the scoop on the biggest takeaway she wants you to have from her book.
