While it\u2019s hard to tell who will draw the bigger crowd \u2014 the pope on Friday or the singer on Saturday \u2014 the message behind their appearances might not be all that different.\n\nAfter all, Beyonc\u00e9 will perform as part of a high-profile concert that is linked to the Global Citizen Festival. Other acts will include Coldplay, Pearl Jam and Ed Sheeran, and luminaries such as Bono, Stephen Colbert, Leonardo DiCaprio, Salma Hayek Pinault, Hugh Jackman, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and Bill and Melinda Gates, are all expected to make appearances.\n\nThis story first appeared in the September 25, 2015 issue of WWD.

If you have 25 million people tuning into a political debate, I think it\u2019s good,\u201d he said, before turning to the Global Citizen Festival. \u201cIf you\u2019re hearing people talk about Syrian refugees and the Affordable Care Act\u2026even if you\u2019re tuning in to hear Beyonc\u00e9 sing \u2018Single Ladies,\u2019 you\u2019re going to hear about global poverty, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Geist will co-host the Global Citizen Festival in New York's Central Park on Saturday, which will showcase high-profile musical acts.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Alexandra Steigrad", "og": {"site_name": "WWD", "description": "Geist will cohost the Global Citizen Festival in New York\u2019s Central Park on Saturday, which will showcase a slate of high-profile musical acts.", "title": "NBC\u2019s Willie Geist on the Power of Beyonc\u00e9 and Donald Trump", "url": "http://wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/nbc-willie-geist-global-citizen-poverty-beyonce-donald-trump-10240079/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/global-citizen-festival-11.jpeg?w=640&h=427&crop=1", "height": 801}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/global-citizen-festival-11.jpeg", "description": "Geist will co-host the Global Citizen Festival in New York's Central Park on Saturday, which will showcase high-profile musical acts.", "site": "@wwd", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "NBC\u2019s Willie Geist on the Power of Beyonc\u00e9 and Donald Trump"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Women's Wear Daily brings you breaking news about the fashion industry, designers, celebrity trend setters, and extensive coverage of fashion week.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwd.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a9597fffaf6885dd6f870d1269ef3b72?s=16", "application-name": "WWD", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-24T18:59:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T19:27:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Beyonce, Donald Trump"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c6c\"", "article_summary": "He highlighted the Syrian refugee issue, and underscored the importance of its impact on Europe and the Middle East to global poverty.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hearing people talk about Syrian refugees and the Affordable Care Act\u2026even if you\u2019re tuning in to hear Beyonc\u00e9 sing \u2018Single Ladies,\u2019 you\u2019re going to hear about global poverty, too.\u201d\nALL THE SINGLE LADIES\u2026AND THEN SOME: Central Park will be playing host two well-known figures \u2014 Pope Francis and Beyonc\u00e9.\nAfter all, Beyonc\u00e9 will perform as part of a high-profile concert that is linked to the Global Citizen Festival.\nThis story first appeared in the September 25, 2015 issue of WWD."}
