(KUTV) Lawmakers have passed a Medicaid expansion plan, and Utah lawmen are sighing with relief.

The narrowly-focused plan does not cover everyone, which has upset Democrats.

But law enforcement has lobbied for the healthcare plan that had now passed both houses.

Lawmakers voted last year to let more criminals out of jail and prison and offer them treatment in the community instead.

But, then, lawmakers turned down Obamacare and turned down Gov. Gary Herbert's Healthy Utah, and had no plan to help drug addicts go straight.

Now Republicans have passed a plan to pay for treating criminals, but Democrats say the plan is too limited to do the job and does not go far enough to help people.Lawmakers have passed a Medicaid expansion plan, and Utah lawmen are sighing with relief.
