Scientists have raised the alert level on Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano after observing "signs of unrest" that followed a prolonged period of seismic activity.

United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the Big Island raised the alert level from normal to advisory. The move was issued after a year of small earthquakes and recent soil/rock changes that could of raised the magma levels.

Authorities in a release say the change in alert level does not mean an eruption is imminent, but warn that the active volcano will one day erupt again, but no one knows when.

Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984 after about three years of increased earthquake activity. Scientists say the advisory level could remain elevated for long periods of time without an eruption and could even possibly raise the level to watch.

There are four levels of alert. The lowest being "normal", "advisory", "watch" and "warning" being the most severe.
