The No. 7-ranked Orange opened the season last weekend with an 18-5 victory over Siena.\n\nFreshman Chaunce Hill, a recipient of the Tewaaraton Native American Scholarship, said playing in the Carrier Dome against Syracuse has always been a dream of his.\n\n\"I've been working my whole life for this opportunity,\" Hill said.\n\nUAlbany graduate assistant Tim Cox offered this advice to the freshmen: \"These guys are all the same age as you are, and they are out there playing. Don't ever think of yourself as a freshman or an underclassman. Don't get nervous.\"\n\nCox, who played for UAlbany last year, said it's important not to be intimidated by playing in the Carrier Dome.\n\nAdded Thompson: \"That place has a way of making you nervous, no matter how many times you play there.\"\n\nHill said he's looking for \"a win, a win for my team, a win for my boys, and a win for my family.\"\n\nCelia Balf is a frequent contributor to the Times Union.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "University at Albany men's lacrosse alumnus Lyle Thompson has one piece of advice for his former team in its season opener against rival Syracuse: \"Effort and attitude is all that matters.\"  Thompson, currently playing professionally for the Florida Launch with his brother, Miles, scored four goals in last year's 17-12 setback against the Orange.
