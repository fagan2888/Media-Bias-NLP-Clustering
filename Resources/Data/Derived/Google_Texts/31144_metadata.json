Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s controversial executive action on immigration has highlighted a thorny health care issue for states: Potentially millions of immigrants could legally stay here and work, but still lack health insurance.\n\nUnauthorized immigrants have limited access to health care coverage, and the president\u2019s action likely will make them ineligible for most Medicaid services and bar them from purchasing insurance on the federal and state exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nSome states have sought to solve the problem for low-income immigrants with separate state-funded insurance programs. Those that have not are wrestling with the consequences of a population that is going without routine care, which can drive up costs when preventable illnesses become serious health emergencies.\n\nTreating kidney disease as an emergency condition, for instance, costs almost five times what it would with routine care denied to unauthorized immigrants, according to a Baylor College of Medicine study published by the Texas Medical Association last year.\n\nUnauthorized immigrants without health insurance present other problems for states. In Maryland, for instance, state attorneys face cases of criminally insane defendants who are no longer deportable but can\u2019t get the follow-up care required for release into the community.\n\nThe issues arise from what the Annenberg Public Policy Center calls \u201ca curious intersection\u201d between the ACA and the president\u2019s executive action that defers deportation for many unauthorized immigrants: The action allows them to live and work here legally, but not to get insurance under the ACA.\n\nThe president\u2019s action, Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA), defers deportation for immigrant parents of U.S. citizens and it expands the 2012 program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which deferred deportation for immigrants who arrived unlawfully before they turned age 16.\n\nThe action is on hold because of an injunction issued Feb. 16 by a federal judge in Texas after 26 states filed suit. The Obama administration is appealing. But even if the president wins, the health care issue likely remains for the immigrants who are allowed to stay and work.\n\n\u201cPeople granted DAPA or expanded DACA will not be eligible for federal health coverage programs,\u201d the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute recently wrote on its policy blog.\n\nOnly states with state-funded alternatives, such as California\u2019s Medi-Cal, are considering plans to accept expanded DACA/DAPA recipients. California, along with Washington, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and the District of Columbia use state or local funds to offer some health insurance to DACA recipients, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nCalifornia and New York have been the most successful in bridging the gap, according to a Migration Policy Institute study of unauthorized immigrants. In both states, unauthorized immigrants are more likely to have health insurance than the general population.\n\nIllinois was planning a state-funded insurance exchange open to all, including unauthorized immigrants, under Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who replaced Quinn in January, has not said whether he will continue the plan.\n\nMany immigration and health care advocates hope the situation will change nationally, and DACA and DAPA recipients will be allowed to purchase insurance on all exchanges and be covered by employer plans under the ACA. Dozens of state and local advocacy groups have asked the federal government to open up more health insurance options for DACA and future DAPA recipients.\n\n\u201cThere is some hope that the work authorization will allow people granted DACA or DAPA to obtain jobs that provide health insurance benefits,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Health Policy Institute said. \u201cHowever, many people in low-wage, part-time and seasonal jobs will continue to be left out of employer-sponsored health insurance or unable to afford their required share of the premiums.\u201d\n\nState Headaches\n\nMore than half of unauthorized immigrant adults have no health insurance, and one in five lives in poverty, according to Pew Hispanic Center estimates (Pew also funds Stateline). That creates problems, even in criminal cases.\n\nAt a meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington, D.C., this week, Assistant Attorney General Rhonda Edwards of Maryland said she\u2019s finding it increasingly hard to deal with mental hospital inmates who are unauthorized immigrants because of their lack of insurance.\n\nWithout insurance, it\u2019s difficult or impossible to release patients from mental hospitals and free the beds for other patients, she said.\n\n\u201cTreatment for mental illness is afforded to illegal mentally ill immigrants who are court-committed to state-run facilities at governmental expense,\u201d Edwards wrote in a paper on the subject. \u201cHowever, once these individuals are released, no governmental funding is allocated for their care and treatment for mental illness symptoms that may cause them to be a danger in the community.\u201d\n\nUnauthorized immigrants without insurance are entitled to emergency care, including childbirth care, through a federal-state Medicaid safety net fund costing $2 billion a year, according to a 2013 report from Kaiser Health News. Routine care is often left to safety net clinics that also get federal funding, but politically sensitive care like birth control can be inconsistent from state to state.\n\nA recent University of Kentucky study found that lack of insurance drives many immigrant women to cross the border into Mexico to get oral contraceptives.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an undocumented woman, you\u2019re really reliant on these clinics,\u201d said Kinsey Hasstedt, a public policy associate for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health advocacy group.\n\nAn Employment Advantage?\n\nThe issue of health insurance came up in arguments before U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen, who issued the injunction which blocked DAPA and the expansion of DACA.\n\nStates argued that DACA and DAPA recipients would have an unfair advantage over citizens in competing for jobs because employers wouldn\u2019t have to buy insurance for them.\n\nExpanding deferred deportation could \u201ccreate a discriminatory employment environment that will encourage employers to hire DAPA beneficiaries instead of those with lawful permanent status in the United States,\u201d Hanen wrote in a memorandum opinion in issuing the injunction. \u201cIf an employer hires a DACA beneficiary, it does not have to offer that individual healthcare nor does it incur a monetary penalty for the failure to do so.\u201d\n\nBut employment experts said such a tactic is not as easy as it sounds. Any employer of more than 50 people must provide health insurance for all employees unless every single one is exempt, said Ken Jacobs of the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center.\n\n\u201cThere is a penalty that applies to employers that do not provide affordable coverage,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThat rule applies to all workers.\u201d\n\nAngel Padilla, a health policy analyst at National Immigration Law Center, agreed. He pointed to a brief released in December by the Annenberg Public Policy Center debunking the idea.\n\n\"It would be extremely unlikely for DACA and DAPA grantees to allow an employer to skirt the employer mandate and there are a number of existing protections to keep this from happening,\u201d he said.\n\nStates Can Step In\n\nStates have always been free to make their own health care provisions for unauthorized and other immigrants, who are generally barred from government health benefits such as Medicaid for five years after they attain legal status.\n\nSeveral states, such as Alaska and Massachusetts, provide state funding for selected unauthorized immigrants (such as children and pregnant women) for some services, according to a Pew report released last year. But other states, such as Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming, deny Medicaid even to some immigrants with green cards who have been legal for five years.\n\nMany states are opposed to providing help to unauthorized immigrants on ethical and financial grounds. Foes say it\u2019s wrong to reward illegal entry into the country, and that more demand on health care resources will strain budgets and harm the quality of care. Opinion polls often favor withholding health care subsidies from illegal immigrants, according to a review by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a group seeking to stop illegal immigration.\n\nBut without affordable health insurance, advocates say unauthorized immigrants will continue to have health issues.\n\n\u201cWith a growing undocumented immigrant population in Texas, our state legislators must be aware of and address this problem before it evolves into a health care crisis,\u201d researchers warned in last year\u2019s Baylor College of Medicine study on health care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 11 Ways Immigration Reform Helps The Economy 11 Ways Immigration Reform Helps The Economy\n\n1 of 11 Reform Would Help Curb The Deficit Immigration reform would reduce the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years, according to an April analysis by the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank.
