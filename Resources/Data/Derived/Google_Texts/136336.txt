A Fort Myers-based integrated cancer care services provider accused of billing for tests that were not needed will pay nearly $20 million to the federal government to settle allegations from a whistleblower that it violated the False Claims Act, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The federal government also accused 21st Century Oncology LLC of prompting physicians to order unnecessary tests by offering bonuses that were based in part by the number of tests referred to the lab.
