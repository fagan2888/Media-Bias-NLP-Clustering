(AP) - Andy Dalton couldn\u2019t have scripted his season opener with Cincinnati much better.\n\nFor Jack Del Rio and the Raiders, it\u2019s hard to imagine it getting much worse.\n\nDalton welcomed Tyler Eifert back to the lineup by throwing him two touchdown passes and Jeremy Hill ran for two scores to help the Bengals spoil Del Rio\u2019s coaching debut in Oakland with a 33-13 victory over the Raiders on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe got the looks that we wanted,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cOur guys made plays. I think that\u2019s what it came down to. We executed exactly how we wanted to and it allowed us to have big games.\u201d\n\nDalton was helped by the return of Eifert, who went down with a season-ending elbow injury in the season opener last season.\n\nWith A.J. Green taking the attention on the outside, Eifert had free reign in the middle of the field to catch nine passes for 104 yards as the Bengals (0-1) broke out to a 33-0 lead and coasted.\n\nIt was a nightmare game for the Raiders (0-1), who lost starting quarterback Derek Carr to a hand injury in the second quarter and were held scoreless until midway through the fourth quarter in Del Rio\u2019s first game as coach.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very disappointing, embarrassing effort,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cI take full responsibility. We\u2019ll get it turned around and corrected.\u201d\n\nThe tone was set right from the start as the Raiders went three-and-out on their first possession - the eighth straight season they began with a three-and-out or turnover.\n\nDalton then moved the ball easily on an 11-play drive capped by Hill\u2019s 3-yard score on fourth-and-1 when he got outside of Ray-Ray Armstrong and raced past Ben Heeney into the end zone.\n\nDalton frequently found the middle of the field open against a Raiders defense that lost starting safety Nate Allen to a knee injury in the first half.\n\nDalton hit Eifert on scoring strikes in the closing seconds of the first half and then late in the third quarter to make it 30-0, driving Oakland fans to boo or head to the exits.\n\n\u201cWe definitely showed what we\u2019re capable of doing with all the weapons we have as an offense,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI think the sky is the limit for us.\u201d\n\nAfter 12 straight years without a winning record or playoff berth, the Raiders were hoping for more success with Del Rio in charge and Carr back for his second season as quarterback.\n\nBut Carr once again struggled to get the ball downfield, going 7 for 12 for 61 yards before hurting his right hand trying to stiff arm Adam Jones on a scramble late in the second quarter. X-rays were negative, but Del Rio did not say whether Carr would miss time.\n\nMatt McGloin fared no better as the Raiders didn\u2019t even take a snap in Bengals territory until the first play of the fourth quarter against a Bengals defense that looked improved from last season. They avoided the shutout when McGloin threw a pair of TD passes to Marcel Reece in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first game. We can\u2019t cry right now,\u201d receiver Michael Crabtree said. \u201cWe got 15 more games. It\u2019s the first game. We lost bad. We\u2019re going to go back to the lab.\u201d\n\nThe game was chippy with several personal fouls, including one on Jones for ripping off the helmet of Oakland receiver Amari Cooper and slamming his head against it. Austin Howard, who was already called for holding on the play, then shoved Jones as a mild skirmish broke out. The penalties wiped out a 60-yard run by Jamize Olawale.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to play football,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI don\u2019t back down from nobody and I\u2019m not out there trying to start anything. I\u2019m just having fun playing football.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Aldon Smith, signed by Oakland on Friday, did play but made little impact as a pass rusher. He had one solo tackle, one assist and one quarterback pressure. \u2026 The Bengals got their first win in Oakland after 10 previous losses. \u2026 Raiders S Charles Woodson left with an injured shoulder on the final drive.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andy Dalton couldn't have scripted his season opener with Cincinnati much better.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Andy Dalton couldn\u2019t have scripted his season opener with Cincinnati much better.", "title": "Bengals spoil Del Rio\u2019s debut with 33-13 win over Raiders", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/13/bengals-spoil-del-rios-debut-with-33-13-win-over-r/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/61151b1f375bec29810f6a70670070df.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/61151b1f375bec29810f6a70670070df.jpg", "description": "Andy Dalton couldn't have scripted his season opener with Cincinnati much better.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bengals spoil Del Rio\u2019s debut with 33-13 win over Raiders"}, "Author": "JOSH DUBOW", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "For Jack Del Rio and the Raiders, it\u2019s hard to imagine it getting much worse.\nX-rays were negative, but Del Rio did not say whether Carr would miss time.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very disappointing, embarrassing effort,\u201d Del Rio said.\nDalton welcomed Tyler Eifert back to the lineup by throwing him two touchdown passes and Jeremy Hill ran for two scores to help the Bengals spoil Del Rio\u2019s coaching debut in Oakland with a 33-13 victory over the Raiders on Sunday.\n\u2026 The Bengals got their first win in Oakland after 10 previous losses."}
