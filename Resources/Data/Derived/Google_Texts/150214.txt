EDITOR: I’m writing this with a heavy heart as I have lost hope in people willing to help those in need.

My brother is very ill with cancer, the other day he went to Menard’s to pick up plywood to make himself a ramp to get his scooter in and out of his vehicle. In his weakened condition, as he tried to get the board in his car. It got caught and threw him off balance causing him to fall on his back. He laid there in the parking lot hearing people walk by him with no one offering to help him. What has happened to helping your fellow man? So sad that my brother not only has to deal with physical pain but also the emotional pain caused by lack of care and interest by others.

My brother would do anything he could for anybody without a doubt. I hope that the people who walked past my brother that day will never have to feel as helpless as he did.
