And it's not because they earned too much money this past year, but too little. My quick answer, to ease their minds: No, you won't. In fact, you may get a little extra subsidy at tax time this year.\n\n\n\nTo understand why they are worried, it helps to step back for a minute. Under the Affordable Care Act, people whose incomes are between 100 percent and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level can receive tax credits to offset the cost of health insurance. (Here\u2019s a chart with the numbers.) The assumption was that people who made less than 100 percent of the poverty level would get insurance through expanded Medicaid coverage, which was also part of the health care law. But many states decided to not expand Medicaid after a Supreme Court decision gave them that option. And in those states, households with incomes below the poverty limit cutoff fall into the dreaded \u201ccoverage gap\u201d\u2014too poor to get tax credits but unable to get Medicaid.\n\nThe readers I'm hearing from live in those states that did not expand Medicaid. And as they tally up their 2014 income, they are realizing that they ended up making less than they expected, and their income for the year will be under Federal Poverty Limit. They're afraid that when they file their tax return and the government finds out how little they earned they'll be forced to pay back their premium tax subsidy.\n\n\n\nBut experts in the health law say not to worry. \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service has a special rule about this,\u201d explains Tara Straw, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank. \u201cIf you bought coverage on the Marketplace, got tax credits, and ended up with an income below the poverty line, then you still get your credit. In fact, you\u2019re going to get a refund because your credit was based on a higher amount than you actually earned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "APTC, premium tax credit, insurance subsidy, HealthCare.gov, Obamacare, IRS, tax reconciliation, FPL, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, North Carolina, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Internal Revenue Service, income tax, Form 8962, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Ask Nancy", "Title": "Too Rich For Medicaid But Too Poor For A Health Care Subsidy - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/11/to-rich-for-medicaid-but-too-poor-for-a-health-care-subsidy/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/CRO_HCR_income_tax_subsidy_09-13.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Too Rich For Medicaid But Too Poor For A Health Care Subsidy - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2014-11-25T18:15Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2014-11-25T19:42Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Too Rich For Medicaid But Too Poor For A Health Care Subsidy - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "APTC, premium tax credit, insurance subsidy, HealthCare.gov, Obamacare, IRS, tax reconciliation, FPL, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, North Carolina, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Internal Revenue Service, income tax, Form 8962, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Ask Nancy", "contenttag": "Ask Our Health Insurance Expert", "description": "If you got a subsidy for your health insurance, you won't have to pay it back even if your income dips below the poverty line.
