But when Obama used the term 5 times on June13, and 16 times in his commencement speech at West Point on June 19th, he was using his bully pulpit to make a point.\n\nRelated: The 10 Richest Members of Congress 2014\n\nMost, like this publication, continue to use the widely accepted acronym ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or al-Sham, but both describe the same murderous organization. The difference is that the Levant describes a territory far greater than simply Iraq and Syria. It\u2019s defined as this: The Levant today consists of the island of Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and part of southern Turkey.\n\nWhy would Obama prefer ISIL? An \u201carmy\u201d of that territorial magnitude takes the focus off the two countries that many believe define Obama\u2019s continued failure in the Middle East. Most likely, he would rather eliminate the connection between the chaos in Iraq with his inaction in Syria. Better that the upheaval in a country to which we committed so much blood and treasure remain the fault of George W. Bush. The president has already been tarred with having failed to secure a Status of Forces deal with Prime Minister al-Maliki, which would have allowed a contingent of American troops to stay in Iraq.\n\nNumerous critics warned that sectarian hostilities were inevitably going to worsen under the openly partisan Shiite government; they argued that only by arranging a continuing presence in Iraq would the U.S. have any opportunity to moderate Maliki\u2019s divisive anti-Sunni regime. Instead, the minute U.S. troops left in 2011, Maliki began to shut down and marginalize Shia and Kurd voices, arresting opponents, including Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi.\n\nRelated: ISIS Invades Social Media\u2026and Gets Turned Back\n\nNumerous sources have claimed that Obama purposefully undermined the negotiations over a SOFA, suggesting he wanted to score political points by getting our troops out, no matter the long-term consequences of an overly hasty exit.\n\nNot only has the worsening of sectarian hostilities encouraged the current Sunni uprising, Maliki has also permitted shipments of weapons from Iran to al-Assad\u2019s government in Syria through Iraqi airspace. The Obama administration had early on denied that Maliki was providing this assistance, undermining U.S. interests, until Secretary of State Kerry went to Bagdad to demand an end to such transfers. Presumably, a U.S. presence would have prohibited such access.\n\nPresident Obama is also criticized for refusing to arm moderate factions in the early days of the Syria uprising, a hesitation Hillary Clinton now says she opposed. Because he dithered, the U.S. lost the opportunity to engage with the less extreme opponents of Bashar Al-Assad. Our absence arguably created a vacuum, into which streamed Al-Qaeda linked extremists, helping create the alliance between Islamic terrorists in Syria and Iraq . Now, across the Middle East, there is fear that extremists will ultimately control Syria.\n\nPresident Obama was clever to announce that our military advisors would soon be helping Iraq confront the insurgent ISIL; Americans might not be so forgiving about sending more of our best and bravest to help push back ISIS. It\u2019s all in the \u201cmessage.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Peek-POV/2014/06/23/Obamas-Use-ISIL-Not-ISIS-Tells-Another-Story", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There has been little notice of the president\u2019s insistent use of the acronym \u201cISIL\u201d to", "title": "Obama's Use of ISIL, Not ISIS, Tells Another Story"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Peek-POV/2014/06/23/Obamas-Use-ISIL-Not-ISIS-Tells-Another-Story", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There has been little notice of the president\u2019s insistent use of the acronym \u201cISIL\u201d to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1afe\"", "article_summary": "President Obama was clever to announce that our military advisors would soon be helping Iraq confront the insurgent ISIL; Americans might not be so forgiving about sending more of our best and bravest to help push back ISIS.\nWhy would Obama prefer ISIL?\nPresident Obama is also criticized for refusing to arm moderate factions in the early days of the Syria uprising, a hesitation Hillary Clinton now says she opposed.\nThe difference is that the Levant describes a territory far greater than simply Iraq and Syria.\nAn \u201carmy\u201d of that territorial magnitude takes the focus off the two countries that many believe define Obama\u2019s continued failure in the Middle East."}
