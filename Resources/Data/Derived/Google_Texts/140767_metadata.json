UCCs also avoid the drawback of limited access to after-hours care at hospitals and other healthcare facilities. One of the important factors driving the UCCs market is the constant growth in the number of insured population. Growing health insurance coverage in the U.S. predicts an increase in demand for urgent care services. Patients insured under private policies are observed to more likely opt for treatment at urgent care centers than at emergency response or other hospital settings. The Affordable Care Act (2010) has introduced insurance cover for additional 32 million people in 2014. The changes introduced by the Act would be crucial to UCCs creating such facilities as a standard for affordable public health care.\n\nRequest Sample: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=2254\n\nSegmentation\n\nThis UCCs market is segmented based on the major service types offered.
