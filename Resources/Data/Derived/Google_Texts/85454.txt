The results of a recent study reminded me of how broken our health care system is in this country. The United States spends more on health care per capita than any other nation, and yet our health care outcomes (including infant mortality and lifespan to name just a couple) lag behind many other industrialized nations. Go check out the percentage of Americans age 65 or older who have two or more chronic conditions, then compare that number to the U.K., New Zealand and France (among others); I'll wait while you pick your jaw up off the floor.
