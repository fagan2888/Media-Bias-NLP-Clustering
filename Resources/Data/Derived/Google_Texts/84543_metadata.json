(Photo: Angela Folds / For Williamson ) Story Highlights Follow Ana Maria Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s pageant journey at facebook.com/MissTennesseeLatina.\n\nAbby Rorex met Ana Maria Casta\u00f1eda \u2014 Miss Latina Tennessee \u2014 in the most modern of ways: via Instagram. A mutual love for all things \u201c#Franklin\u201d brought these two enterprising women together.\n\n\u201cI started following Ana Maria on Instagram because I was drawn to her story,\u201d said Rorex, a local fitness instructor. \u201cI had no idea there was a Miss Tennessee Latina Pageant, much less that this year\u2019s winner was right here in Franklin.\u201d\n\nTheir online friendship developed into a professional partnership when Rorex, owner of 100% Fit fitness studio, chose to sponsor Casta\u00f1eda as she competes for the 2014 Miss U.S. Latina Pageant title.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic community in Franklin is a thriving one, and I wanted to show my support for this important demographic in the town I\u2019ve chosen for my business and home,\u201d Rorex said. \u201cI want others to hear Ana Maria\u2019s inspiring story because she\u2019s a great example of the successes that hard work and determination can bring.\u201d\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Casta\u00f1eda moved with her family to Middle Tennessee when she was 4. The daughter of Reyna Graciela Barragan and Felipe Angel, she is now 23, the oldest of nine children. She attended Saint Cecilia Academy, where she received multiple recognitions for her outstanding community service, often volunteering with nonprofit organizations such as Catholic Charities\u2019 refugee program.\n\nA first-generation college graduate, Casta\u00f1eda later attended Lipscomb University, where she studied psychology and communications/public relations.\n\nCasta\u00f1eda\u2019s first pageant competition was for the Miss Tennessee Latina title in 2013, where she finished as second runner-up.\n\n\u201cCompeting in a pageant was a \u2018bucket list\u2019 item for me. I trained for it all on my own,\u201d Casta\u00f1eda said. \u201cNow, as the 2014 titleholder, I am truly living my dream. My goal as Miss Tennessee Latina is to empower the Hispanic community by helping families empower themselves through education and career driven success, whether it be appearing at Tennessee schools to speak to children about the importance of education, or volunteering at different charities that aid Hispanic families,\u201d she said.\n\nSponsoring Casta\u00f1eda is Rorex\u2019s first involvement in the pageant world.\n\n\u201cEven though I\u2019ve never been around pageants, I have a very competitive nature and I know what it takes to set and reach goals.\u201d\n\nRorex tailored a fitness program for Casta\u00f1eda that included one-on-one training and group classes to help her achieve her optimal fitness level for the national competition, which will begin on Sunday and continue to Aug. 31 in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\u201cThe first time I worked with Ana Maria, I was expecting her to be a little bit prissy and delicate. But, every time she trained, she gave it all she\u2019s got. She works hard,\u201d Rorex said. \u201cI think I\u2019m as excited as she is about the national competition! I am so proud of her.\u201d\n\nGetting fit on a deadline\n\nYou\u2019re probably not preparing for a beauty pageant, but life events, such as weddings, class reunions,and vacations are great motivators for getting fit.\n\nAbby Rorex, a certified health and life coach and owner of 100% Fit Franklin, shares her tips for getting in shape on a deadline.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you need to do to get ready for your big event is to drink tons and tons of water. Next, continue your normal weekly fitness program, but I suggest adding the following:\n\n\u2022 Six 20-second sprints four times a week. This is absolutely the best way to burn fat quickly. Go 80 to 100 percent of your maximum speed to get your heart rate up and burn fat.\n\n\u2022 Complete a \u201cdaily wake up call\u201d every morning as soon as you wake up: 10 push-ups, 20 curls with weights, 30 squat jumps, 40 side lunges and 50 jumping jacks.\n\nRorex says that by adding this to what you are already doing, you will see better tone and weight loss changes much faster.\n\nThe details\n\n\u2022 The 2014 Miss U.S. Latina Pageant will continue through Aug. 31 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Delegates from across the nation representing their states and Hispanic heritage will vie for the coveted title and right to represent the United States at the international Miss Latin America of the World competition.\n\n\u2022 Abby Rorex\u2019s fitness studio, 100% Fit, is in Jamison Station, Suite 120, at 320 Liberty Pike in Franklin.
