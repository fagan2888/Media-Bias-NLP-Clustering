In a rejoinder that also had nothing to do with the merits of the case at hand, Justice Clarence Thomas sneered that however small the accused\u2019s current solitary prison quarters might be, they are \u201ca far sight more spacious than those in which his victims, Ernesto Dominguez Mendez, Marcos \u00adAntonio Zamora and Jose Luis Rositas, now rest.\u201d In his dissent in a case upholding the structure of federal tax subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed the majority opinion as \u201cpure applesauce\u201d and sniffed that the law should be better named \u201cScotuscare.\u201d\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer used a dissent in a case testing the efficacy of the lethal injection protocol to announce that he has come to believe the death penalty may always violate the Eighth Amendment. In a concurring opinion in the same case, \u00adScalia scoffed: \u201cJustice Breyer does not just reject the death penalty, he rejects the Enlightenment.\u201d Perhaps most famously, in last term\u2019s blockbuster marriage equality cases, the majority opinion written by Justice Kennedy was scorched and pillaged by four separate dissenting opinions, one from each member of the court\u2019s conservative wing. The critiques included Scalia\u2019s characterization of the majority opinion as containing the \u201cmystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie\u201d and the conclusion (again by Scalia) that if he had ever joined an opinion whose opening lines were written as Kennedy\u2019s were, \u201cI would hide my head in a bag.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the era of the judicial dissent as body slam. Most of these opinions had precisely the desired effect: They were rounded up and repeated and retweeted and doubtless embroidered on throw pillows. In much of the ensuing commentary, court watchers worried that the justices\u2019 soaring rates of written dissents, nasty and personal attacks and scathing remarks read aloud from the bench bespeak a new toxicity in Supreme Court discourse. As Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine, put it in an editorial in The Los Angeles Times, the justices seem to be working to \u201cencourage a new generation of peevish, callous scoffers.\u201d\n\nThe legal historian Melvin I. Urofsky\u2019s ambitious new look at the role of dissents throughout our constitutional history offers some useful tools for making sense of the Roberts court\u2019s recent predilection for personal, non sequitur and ad hominem dissents. According to his central thesis, a dissent can become important, can indeed shape the future, when it becomes part of the larger \u201cconstitutional dialogue.\u201d \u00adUrofsky\u2019s concern here is for the \u201ccanonical or prophetic\u201d dissents that go on to shape the future deliberations of the justices, their successors and the American public.\n\nUrofsky\u2019s extraordinarily careful analysis and sense of historical depth make \u00ad\u201cDissent and the Supreme Court\u201d an important book, one that explores some of the most significant dissents in the history of that institution. Working his way through the arguments against published dissents in the court\u2019s early history \u2014 Chief Justice John Marshall wanted his colleagues to speak in \u201cone voice\u201d \u2014 Urofsky approvingly cites Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes\u2019s defense of the dissenting opinion as \u201can appeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed.\u201d Urofsky\u2019s project is to show how the dissents in cases like Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) and Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) became as much a part of constitutional history as the majority opinions.\n\nUrofsky is riveting when detailing the arguments and rhetorical workings of the nation\u2019s great dissenters, from John Marshall Harlan to Louis Brandeis to William O. Douglas. He concludes with the reminder that in some of the most significant cases, the dissenter \u201cspoke for a future that not only had not arrived but in some cases could not even be guessed at.\u201d Indeed his book can serve as a guide, a way of determining what constitutes a really fine and compelling dissent, which Urofsky distinguishes from \u2014 for instance \u2014 Justice Felix Frankfurter\u2019s frequent tone of: \u201cI am right and why don\u2019t you people listen to me.\u201d\n\nAnd yet it remains true that a unifying definition of constitutional dialogue \u2014 and even of a truly significant dissent \u2014 continues to be elusive. The greatest dissents are great, in this telling, precisely because they shaped history. And, as Urofsky cautions several times, in this instance quoting Mark Tushnet\u2019s \u201cI Dissent,\u201d \u201cthe fate of a dissent lies in the hands of history.\u201d Without the benefit of a glance in the rearview mirror, it\u2019s almost impossible to know which brilliantly written opinions would be lost and which would become building blocks in the larger legal foundation of the country \u2014 and whether they did so in part due to outside factors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Urofsky notes, a dissent becomes influential because sometimes future justices will perceive its truth decades later. Sometimes colleagues\u2019 views will change. Sometimes public opinion will be energized. But it\u2019s terrifically hard to tell whether a particular dissent accomplished those ends or whether future circumstances, the shifting stances of colleagues and public pressures were the true agents of change. At the end of his book, Urofsky selects three contemporary dissents that may well stand the test of time. These three opinions will always be good, or even great \u2014 yet history may still ignore them.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20151021053003, "twitter": {"description": "How dissent has shaped court deliberations and the course of constitutional history.", "title": "\u2018Dissent and the Supreme Court,\u2019 by Melvin I.
