The Chinese really put on a spectacular event, going above and beyond,\u201d Jaskiewicz said.\n\nThe trip to China came with some airline issues. His planned flight was canceled a day before the scheduled departure, forcing him to scramble to find an alternate flight. That resulted in an additional $400 baggage charge when he had to switch airlines. And one of his favorite rods was broken during the trip. But from that point it was a memorable journey, even if the fishing was tough.\n\nJaskiewicz was able to spend a couple of days sightseeing in Shanghai before the competitors headed to the tournament venue, about 2\u00bd hours from Shanghai. The opening ceremony included speeches by political dignitaries, dancers, singers and a fireworks display. There were festivities every evening. The hotel key cards were embossed with the tournament logo.\n\nThe fishing conditions were not as much fun. Eligible species were yellowcheek carp, topmouth culter or Chinese perch. Only three fish were caught on the practice day, but one was enough to get everyone excited. An angler from Denmark landed a huge yellowcheek carp, toothy species participants had seen crashing the water. Jaskiewicz estimated the fish at 60 inches and 60 pounds.\n\nOn the first day of competition, Jaskiewicz hooked a fish around 11 a.m., but after getting it to his kayak discovered he had caught a chub, not on the list of eligible species. Only one angler landed an eligible fish, a participant from the host country, leaving 46 fishermen in a tie for second. The second and third days weren\u2019t much better. On the final day, Jaskiewicz parked himself in one likely-looking spot. An hour before the end of the event, he hooked a fish, but the hooks on his tiny crankbait pulled free.\n\n\u201cOnly having two bites the whole tournament and one fish that wasn\u2019t a legal fish was a little frustrating. But only five guys caught fish and one of them caught two fish. A lot of guys didn\u2019t have a bite the whole time,\u201d Jaskiewicz said.\n\n\u201cBut it was one of those times where misery loves company. That helped me swallow how bad I was doing, knowing that everybody else was having just as hard a time.\u201d\n\nChinese anglers took first, second and fourth. The Danish angler was third and a fisherman from Great Britain was fifth.\n\nOne bonus for Jaskiewicz was an opportunity on the return trip to fly in a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, an aircraft that is manufactured in North Charleston and Everett, Washington.\n\n\u201cWhat a better experience than the (Boeing) 777 I took over there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest difference between the two was how quiet it was. I couldn\u2019t stop telling people how I impressed I was. I was able to sleep a good amount.\u201d\n\nAlthough the fishing didn\u2019t live up to what Jaskiewicz and the other anglers hoped for, he said he is already looking to see where the next qualifying event will be held for the 2016 Hobie Fishing World Championship.\n\n\u201cI met a lot of great guys, hopefully some guys I can call friends,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of camaraderie, but when the fishing began, the competitiveness was very apparent. Now I have fishing buddies across the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jaskiewicz enjoys tough but fun Hobie Fishing World Championship, Sports, \r\nSportsTideline Magazine, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nOutdoors, \r\nRecreation, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, China,Dave Jaskiewicz,fishing,Outdoors", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "After catching only one fish during a competition that took him halfway round the world, Dave Jaskiewicz of Daniel Island says he would love an opportunity to do it again.", "title": "Jaskiewicz enjoys tough but fun Hobie Fishing World Championship", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151128/151129411/jaskiewicz-enjoys-tough-but-fun-hobie-fishing-world-championship", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151128/PC20/151129411/AR/0/AR-151129411.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151128/PC20/151129411/AR/0/AR-151129411.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After catching only one fish during a competition that took him halfway round the world, Dave Jaskiewicz of Daniel Island says he would love an opportunity to do it again.", "title": "Jaskiewicz enjoys tough but fun Hobie Fishing World Championship", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151128/PC20/151129411/AR/0/AR-151129411.jpg?201511281852", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151129411}}, "keywords": "Jaskiewicz enjoys tough but fun Hobie Fishing World Championship , Sports, \r\nSportsTideline Magazine, \r\nLocal Sports, \r\nOutdoors, \r\nRecreation, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, China,Dave Jaskiewicz,fishing,Outdoors", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T11:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-28T18:52:00Z", "author": "Tommy Braswell"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "After catching only one fish during a competition that took him halfway round the world, Dave Jaskiewicz of Daniel Island says he would love an opportunity to do it again."}, "article_summary": "Jaskiewicz was one of 47 anglers who recently competed in the fifth annual Hobie Fishing World Championship, a three-day kayak competition held on Shang Lake in Changshu, China.\nBut only five guys caught fish and one of them caught two fish.\nOn the final day, Jaskiewicz parked himself in one likely-looking spot.\nI was able to sleep a good amount.\u201dAlthough the fishing didn\u2019t live up to what Jaskiewicz and the other anglers hoped for, he said he is already looking to see where the next qualifying event will be held for the 2016 Hobie Fishing World Championship.\nBut from that point it was a memorable journey, even if the fishing was tough."}
