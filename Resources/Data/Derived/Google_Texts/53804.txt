According to the American Association of Medical Colleges within the next 10 years physician demand is expected to grow by up to 17 percent.

This can be largely attributed to the growth and aging of our population. The nation's population is expected to spike 10 percent by 2025. Experts also project that full implementation of the affordable care act will account for about 2 percent of this projected growth.

On average it takes 10 years to train and license a physician depending on their field of study or specialization, meaning that the projected shortage needs to be addressed now.

Thankfully Nebraska is well ahead of the curve when it comes to meeting demand in a number of important field such as cardiology, orthopedics and radiology.
