Imagine abolishing the IRS.\u0094\n\nThat statement quickly got people wondering what would replace the IRS if the agency were ever abolished. Bill Smith, managing director in CBIZ MHM\u0092s National Tax Office, is among those who have their doubts it could ever happen. Even though Republicans in Congress have voted to reduce the IRS\u0092s funding for the past five years, and on Wednesday, lawmakers debated a series of measures that would effectively put limits on the IRS, he does not believe Cruz or his colleagues would be able to eliminate the agency or its functions.\n\n\u0093I don\u0092t know how they would collect the taxes,\u0094 said Smith. \u0093Even if you switch to a flat tax, which is what he\u0092s advocating, you still have to have someone to collect it. You can\u0092t just hope people are going to send their money in. We already know that even with an agency that does collect it, there\u0092s a tremendous amount of noncompliance. That\u0092s why they calculate the tax gap. They have an agency in place that has a great deal of weapons at its disposal for making people do the right thing, and it\u0092s difficult even with that.\u0094\n\nAccording to various estimates, the IRS collects more dollars than each dollar in its budget. For example, according to the IRS, every dollar invested in IRS enforcement programs generates $7 in return. In fiscal year 2012, when the IRS budget was $11.8 billion, the agency collected $2.52 trillion, or roughly $214 for every dollar it spent.\n\nGoing to a flat tax, as Cruz has proposed, would not necessarily make the annual filing much simpler, even if it could be done on a postcard.\n\n\u0093He has proposed going to the flat tax, and he says you ought to be able to file your taxes on a postcard,\u0094 said Smith. \u0093All you do is put down what you earn and send it in. When asked about charitable contributions and mortgage interest deductions, he suggests you just put down what you earn, take out your mortgage interest deduction and charitable contributions, and then send it in.\u0094\n\nSmith points out that approach would ignore many of the tax breaks, for example for capital gains and dividends. Even Cruz\u0092s approach to charitable contributions has its contradictions, given the controversy over how the IRS reviews applications for tax-exempt status.\n\n\u0093He\u0092s going to allow charitable contributions, but you don\u0092t have an agency that says which organizations are exempt,\u0094 Smith pointed out.\n\nSmith also sees a contradiction in eliminating the IRS while running for the presidency. \u0093It\u0092s the sole collector of revenues for the federal government,\u0094 he observed. \u0093If you don\u0092t have money coming into the federal government, you abolish the federal government and then there\u0092s no need to run for president. None of it makes any sense.\u0094\n\nIf Cruz wins support for the idea of eliminating the IRS, it might actually come from the opposing party. \u0093I think he\u0092s probably got a lot of Democrats who are interested in the presidential campaign who are going to back him very strongly because they\u0092d love to have a Republican candidate who\u0092s taking the position that we abolish the IRS because it\u0092s not going to do very well in a debate,\u0094 said Smith.\n\nSpeaking of debates, Cruz might find himself facing off against a former IRS commissioner, Mark Everson, who is also running for the Republican nomination (see Former IRS Commissioner Everson Running for President). \u0093I have a feeling Mr. Everson probably knows a little bit more about the IRS and the tax system than Mr. Cruz,\u0094 said Smith.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/blogs/debits-credits/news/reality-check-on-ted-cruzs-proposal-to-abolish-the-irs-74097-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Debits & Credits", "title": "Reality Check on Ted Cruz\u2019s Proposal to Abolish the IRS"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "title": "Reality Check on Ted Cruz s Proposal to Abolish the IRS", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz threw his hat into the ring to launch his candidacy for the Republican nomination this week, promising among other things to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service.", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, irs, cbiz mhm, bill smith, congress, tea party, mark everson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5f2\"", "article_summary": "\u0093Even if you switch to a flat tax, which is what he\u0092s advocating, you still have to have someone to collect it.\nEven Cruz\u0092s approach to charitable contributions has its contradictions, given the controversy over how the IRS reviews applications for tax-exempt status.\n\u0093I have a feeling Mr. Everson probably knows a little bit more about the IRS and the tax system than Mr. Cruz,\u0094 said Smith.\nImagine abolishing the IRS.\u0094That statement quickly got people wondering what would replace the IRS if the agency were ever abolished.\n\u0093He\u0092s going to allow charitable contributions, but you don\u0092t have an agency that says which organizations are exempt,\u0094 Smith pointed out."}
