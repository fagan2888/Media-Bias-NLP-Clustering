He\u2019s starting to quell a multi-day case of plantar fasciitis with some shoe insoles. He\u2019s gellin\u2019.\n\nBad news is he added a left quad injury. Dickerson fouled a ball off his back leg in the fifth inning before hitting into a double play.\n\nManager Walt Weiss said the leg was \u201cpretty swollen\u201d and Dickerson needed a sub.\n\nDickerson had a lighter view.\n\n\u201cI hit some really weird foul balls sometimes,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cEvery now and then, I feel like I can hit anything. And it gets me in trouble.\u201d\n\nDickerson said the swelling came down after the game and he wasn\u2019t worried about it. It just got tight coming off the field in the fifth.\n\nAt the plate against Giants starter Tim Hudson, Dickerson finished 0-for-3. And the Rockies fell to the Giants for the first time this season, 5-4. It was the second time Hudson got through seven innings at Coors Field in nine starts. But he\u2019s never won at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a better approach against a guy like that, who\u2019s been around and is really crafty,\u201d Dickerson said.\n\nGAME NOTES:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Coors Field,Corey Dickerson,Drew Stubbs,Jorge De La Rosa,Pedro Astacio,plantar fasciitis,Tim Hudson,Ubaldo Jimenez", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Good news for Corey Dickerson was his left foot felt better.
