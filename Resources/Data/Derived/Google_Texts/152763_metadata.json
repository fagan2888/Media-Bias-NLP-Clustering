His attack on nine African Americans in a church was a political attack designed to keep the government in the hands of white men. His bullets were a salvo in the fundamental struggle that we have fought bitterly since 1865: Who owns America?\n\nWhen the 21-year-old white man killed six women and three men, including pastor and South Carolina state senator Clementa Pinckney, he reportedly said: \u201cI have to do it. You rape our women and you\u2019re taking over our country. And you have to go.\u201d Roof\u2019s words seem bizarre\u2014not just because black Americans make up less than 15 percent of the population but also because he murdered six women\u2014but they made more sense when they first entered the American vernacular. His statement hails straight from the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War, when white Southern men had to come to grips with the fact that they would no longer control the country.\n\nMen like Roof are staring at that same reality today.\n\nBefore the Civil War, white Southern Democrats controlled American politics. They used the government to prop up the system of racial slavery that brought money, social status, and political power to wealthy white men. But when Southern leaders tried to spread their system across the nation, northern Republicans, who were largely men-on-the-make, organized to stand against them. Republicans insisted that in America, every man should be able to rise, and should have a say in the government to make sure wealthy men could not manipulate the laws to their own advantage. Once in power, Republicans used the government to give all poor men land, education, and, in 1865, freedom.\n\nIn the wake of the Civil War, white Southern Democrats initially refused to face the reality that they would have to share any sort of economic, political, or social power with their former slaves. President Andrew Johnson, himself a Democrat, took over from the slain President Lincoln during Congress\u2019s long summer recess. He pardoned all but about 1,500 white Southerners, and demanded little from white legislatures in the South seeking readmission to the Union except that they ratify the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery. State legislators ratified the amendment, but then promptly set about recreating antebellum conditions of racial servitude with what were known as \u201cBlack Codes.\u201d In most states, black people could not own guns, had to sign year-long work contracts, and could be arrested on charges of \u201cvagrancy,\u201d fined, and then bound to anyone who paid their fine. Nowhere could a black person testify in court against a white person, which meant that no black southerner could claim the protection of the law against theft, rape, or murder.\n\nWith the return of their states to the Union and with the Black Codes in place, Southern Democrats were poised to retake control of the national government and return it to its prewar defense of property.\n\nBut when Congress reconvened in December 1865, Northern congressmen refused to return the same African Americans who had fought for the Union to quasi-slavery under the very men who had spent four years trying to destroy the nation. As a condition for readmission to the Union, Congress put forward the Fourteenth Amendment to give black men legal rights. Southern whites promptly retorted that they would rather remain under military rule than submit to black equality. So northern congressmen passed the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867, which called for new Southern state constitutional conventions to rewrite state constitutions providing for black civic rights. Crucially, the Military Reconstruction Act permitted African American men to vote.\n\nAs Republicans began to organize black voters, white Southern Democrats recoiled at the idea of sharing political rights with black men. Democrats railed that lazy black people would destroy the country. They would vote for handouts so they could stop working.\n\nWhite Southern Democrats tried to keep African Americans from political power by simply refusing to enroll voters. So Congress put the army in charge of voter registration. When both white and black Republicans registered to vote and elected moderate constitutional conventions, white Democrats organized the Ku Klux Klan as a political force to stop the change in government. Before the 1868 elections, members of the Ku Klux Klan murdered at least a thousand African Americans and their white allies. Things were particularly bad in South Carolina, where Klan members killed African American clergyman and state legislator B. F. Randolph at a train depot in broad daylight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dylann Roof's assault was the latest salvo in the racial struggle we have fought since 1865: Who owns America?", "title": "GOP\u2019s fear of a black America: The long, racist history which explains Dylann Roof and stains the so-called \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dylann Roof's assault was the latest salvo in the racial struggle we have fought since 1865: Who owns America?", "title": "GOP\u2019s fear of a black America: The long, racist history which explains Dylann Roof and stains the so-called \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/21/gops_fear_of_a_black_america_the_long_racist_history_which_explains_dylann_roof_and_stains_the_so_called_party_of_lincoln/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/lincoln_paul_atwater.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dylann Roof's assault was the latest salvo in the racial struggle we have fought since 1865: Who owns America?", "title": "GOP\u2019s fear of a black America: The long, racist history which explains Dylann Roof and stains the so-called \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/lincoln_paul_atwater.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Cox Richardson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American History, Charleston, Civil War, Conservatives, Dylann Roof, Dylann Storm Roof, Editor's Picks, Race, Republicans, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As a condition for readmission to the Union, Congress put forward the Fourteenth Amendment to give black men legal rights.\nAs Republicans began to organize black voters, white Southern Democrats recoiled at the idea of sharing political rights with black men.\nBefore the Civil War, white Southern Democrats controlled American politics.\nWhite Southern Democrats tried to keep African Americans from political power by simply refusing to enroll voters.\nBefore the 1868 elections, members of the Ku Klux Klan murdered at least a thousand African Americans and their white allies."}
