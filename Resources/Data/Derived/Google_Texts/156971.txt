One woman is dead and another is recovering in the hospital after they were both attacked early Friday morning.

Police responded to an assault at a home near Hefner and May Ave. shortly after 7:00 a.m.

Some people living on Lakeside Drive say their neighborhood is pretty quiet for the most part.

"I'm a little bit uneasy," said Alex Charin, resident.

Charin lives right across the street from the house where the attacked happened. He says he moved into the neighborhood a little over a year ago, and never heard or saw anything troubling coming from the home.

"I guess the boyfriend came over once and introduced himself, and said if I ever needed my lawn mowed to come see him and he'd do that," said Charin. "That was really the extent of the conversation. Never really had anything to do with them."

The attack happened in the 2900 block of Lakeside Drive between Sunrise Blvd. and Northland Rd. Police responded after getting a 911 call from a woman, who lived inside of the home.

"When officers arrived they found 2 victims inside the residence. Two female victims," said The Village Deputy Chief Steve Jagosh,

Police say there was also a child inside of the home, but the little girl was not hurt. Both women were taken to the hospital, but the female friend was pronounced dead at the hospital.

"We have a possible suspect that we are trying to verify," said Jagosh. "At this point the suspect did leave the scene in one of the victim's vehicles. We are trying to verify who he is at this point."

Police say the suspect took off in a grey Mazda van. Police believe he may have already left the area.
