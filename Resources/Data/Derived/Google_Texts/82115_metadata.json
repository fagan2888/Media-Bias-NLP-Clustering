Instead of dumping a bucket of ice water on his head, a man chose to explain his experience watching what his mother, who passed away from ALS, went through.\n\nHe, along with 1.2 million Facebook users\u2019 videos, are raising awareness for the fatal neuromuscular disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Approximately 5,600 people are diagnosed with ALS every year, and within five years from the time of diagnosis, 90 percent of its victims will die. The short life expectancy isn\u2019t the worst part of the disease, but instead how it manifests inside the body and slowly deteriorates the brain's ability to communicate to muscles. In order to raise awareness along with research funds, people who videotape themselves dumping ice water on their heads, post it to Facebook, Instagram, or other social media websites, and then challenge their friends or family members to do the same within 24 hours or donate $100 to ALS.\n\nOnly two and a half weeks ago, the first ALS challenge video was uploaded by 29-year-old former college baseball player Pete Frates, and inspired Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift, LeBron James, and the entire Jets NFL team to participate in the cause. The ALS Association and its 38 chapters has received $22.9 million in donations since July 29, compared to the $1.9 million within the same time period last year, and money keeps coming in. Before the videos, half of the general public had never even known what ALS was, and now with 453,210 new donors, it has become a playful and meaningful way to spread awareness.\n\n\u201cThe story right now goes: You\u2019ve got ALS, have it for a little while, a long while, but either way, the end is always the same. ALS always wins. So in order to rewrite the end of it, we need to raise awareness: money,\u201d Frates said in a Life Story Foundation video.\n\nThe challenge took on a different meaning for one ALS victim's son, who felt compeled to explain what happens to the body step-by-step in addition to donating to ALSA.org. Currently, there is no cure for ALS, and the one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the disease only extends survival by two to three months, at best. Only 10 percent of patients diagnosed with ALS will survive for 10 years or longer; however, in almost all cases people eventually die of respiratory failure, while acutely aware of their failing and entrapping body.\n\n\u201cImagine one day your legs stop working. You can feel them, but you can\u2019t move them, and then your hands and arms stop working, and now you can\u2019t move at all, even though you can still feel everything. So, if you have an itch somewhere, too bad you can\u2019t scratch it. If your muscles get sore from sitting in the same position for too long, it\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t do anything. You\u2019re stuck unless someone helps move your body for you,\u201d he said.\n\nMany have likened the disease to becoming a prisoner within their own body or to being buried alive with a fully functional mind. The disease attacks the spine\u2019s nerve cells, muscles atrophy and lose function, losing your muscle movements, and the ability to speak, swallow and eventually breathe. It all leads to complete and devastating paralysis. The cause of ALS is currently not understood, and although there is a small five percent portion of those who have a genetic link to the disease, it seems as if it could strike anyone, but the overwhelming influx of donations may give those affected new hope.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "als, ice, bucket, challenge, raises, millions, one, man, explains, why, so, many, people, are", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The ALS ice bucket challenge has raised millions of dollars for research and one man explains the importance of finding a cure.", "title": "What's The Point Of Dumping Ice Water On Your Head, Anyway?
