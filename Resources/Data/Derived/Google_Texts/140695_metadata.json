The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) The Republicans have taken control of Congress, and with it ownership of health care reform. As long as the Republicans were in opposition, they could just complain. And they did, voting repeatedly \u2014 and futily \u2014 to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, they are coming up with actual reform ideas. Their first reform proposal \u2014 to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week under the ACA \u2014 may be emblematic of what is to come.\n\nTimothy Jost\n\nThe idea is favored by business groups that support the GOP financially. But such a change would increase the number of uninsured and raise the federal budget deficit by $53 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nCurrently, full-time employment is defined as 30 hours per week, and under the health care law, large companies must offer health insurance to those working full time. Most American workers now work close to 40 hours a week and are insured. But under the Republican proposal, employers could send employees home a half-hour early on Friday and drop their coverage.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates this change could \"lead employers to make changes that would affect many more workers than will be affected under current law\" as well as cause a million American workers to lose their employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans' reform proposals would hurt Americans.", "pubdate": "2015-01-15T12:48:40Z", "author": "Timothy Jost", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Republicans' reform proposals would hurt Americans.", "pubdate": "2015-01-15T12:48:40Z", "title": "GOP, stop messing with Obamacare (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/opinion/jost-gop-obamacare/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140421175321-obamacare-new-patient-gi-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140421175321-obamacare-new-patient-gi-t3-entertainment.jpg", "template-top": "opinion,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/opinion/jost-gop-obamacare/index.html"}, "keywords": "opinion, GOP, stop messing with Obamacare (Opinion) - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2015-01-15T12:48:40Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(CNN) The Republicans have taken control of Congress, and with it ownership of health care reform.\nTheir first reform proposal \u2014 to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week under the ACA \u2014 may be emblematic of what is to come.\nCurrently, full-time employment is defined as 30 hours per week, and under the health care law, large companies must offer health insurance to those working full time.\nMost American workers now work close to 40 hours a week and are insured.\nBut under the Republican proposal, employers could send employees home a half-hour early on Friday and drop their coverage."}
