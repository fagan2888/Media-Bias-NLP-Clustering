Congress is scheduled to vote on a Budget Bill on Friday that would keep the government afloat until October.

Congress is scheduled to vote on Friday on a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would keep the government afloat until next October but the bill is filled with things that are not directly related to financing the government, NBC News reported.

Some of the add-ons onto the bill include things like a budget boost for the Food and Drug Administration to aid in its food safety efforts.

The bill is full of digs at the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. It delays the so-called Cadillac tax on the most generous health insurance plans, costing the government an estimated $87 billion in revenue from 2018, when it was supposed to kick in, through 2025.
