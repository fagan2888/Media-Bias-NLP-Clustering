Subban just inside the Colorado blue line. With Grigorenko in pursuit, Subban skated parallel to the line from his right to his left, but Grigorenko poked the puck off his stick and Subban then fell.\n\n\u201cHe had the puck and was skating on the blue line,\u201d Grigorenko told me about a half hour later later in the Avalanche dressing room. \u201cI was just trying to put on pressure.\u201d\n\nStarting the rush the other way, Grigorenko got the puck to Matt Duchene, then took a return pass and patiently fed Jarome Iginla at the edge of the crease, and Iginla had a virtual open net for the late tie-breaking goal in the Avalanche\u2019s 3-2 win Wednesday at the Pepsi Center.\n\n\u201cMatt had more speed coming into the zone, so I just gave it to him and kept driving the net,\u201d Grigorenko said. \u201cMatt saw me there and Jarome was wide open because we both drove the net and their backcheck lost us. So it was an easy play to make.\u201d\n\nIf it ended there, I wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this days later. Those would have remained extra quotes in the digital recorder.\n\nEven the best of defensemen foul up, and Subban probably should have sent the puck into the corner. But in most cases, the coach doesn\u2019t go out to the arena\u2019s loading dock and throw his star defenseman under the team bus. That\u2019s essentially what Canadiens coach Michel Therrien did, and the furor in Montreal hadn\u2019t died down as the weekend began.\n\n\u201cThe team worked hard,\u201d Therrien said in the post-game scrum outside the visiting dressing room. \u201cWe deserved a better result. It\u2019s too bad an individual mistake cost us the game late in the game. \u2026 (Subban) could have made a better decision at the blue line. He put himself in a tough position. We play as a team. When we don\u2019t, we could be in trouble, and this is what happened.\u201d\n\nSubban told reporters, \u201cIf I do that play all over again and don\u2019t lose an edge, I probably take it down the wall and create something.\u201d\n\nOver the next few days, Therrien and Subban said there was no rift between them. Therrien said he was simply being truthful and that he would have said it about any player who made a costly mistake.\n\nBut in Montreal, it all added to the perception that Therrien is coming both: a) unglued; and b) to the end of his second tenure with the Canadiens \u2014 even if GM Marc Bergevin, who chose Therrien over Patrick Roy in 2012, sticks to his stated plan to have Therrien finish the rest of the season before evaluation of where to go from there.\n\nFrom afar, I\u2019m not going to pretend to be able to judge the job Therrien has done. But as the predictable \u201cHe lost his team\u201d indictments gain steam \u2014 I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re wrong as much as I\u2019m saying they sure sound lamely familiar, right out of the NHL\u2019s \u201cFire the coach\u201d templates \u2014 it\u2019s mind-boggling how little consideration seems to be given the fact that the Canadiens have been without the best goalie in the league, Carey Price, for most of the season.\n\nAbsolutely, that doesn\u2019t give Therrien a free pass, whether for his ill-advised, curious remarks about Subban or anything else, but consider that they\u2019re trying to get by with Mike Condon and Ben Scrivens in the net.\n\nYes, that Ben Scrivens.\n\nAnd in his three-plus seasons in his second stint behind the Canadiens\u2019 bench, Montreal was 152-93-29 going into Friday night\u2019s home game against Philadelphia.\n\nThis is a tough business.\n\nEspecially in Montreal.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nDylan Larkin, center, Red Wings\n\nWhen: Detroit visits Colorado on Saturday in an NHL Stadium Series game at Coors Field. The Avalanche has a relatively light schedule heading into that historic game, hosting San Jose on Wednesday after Sunday\u2019s contest at Vancouver.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Larkin, 19, entered the weekend with a team-leading 19 goals, and his 39 points were second to veteran Henrik Zetterberg. Among NHL rookie scorers, Larkin was tied for second behind Chicago\u2019s Artemi Panarin, 24. Larkin won the fastest skater competition at the NHL All-Star Game last month, breaking the record set by Mike Gartner in 1996.\n\nBackground: Larkin was born in Waterford, Mich., and grew up in Clarkston, Mich. He attended the University of Michigan for one season as an 18-year-old freshman before turning pro. He spent his junior and senior years playing for the U.S. National Development Program in Ann Arbor, Mich.\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Larkin\u2019s all-Michigan background, world-class skill and model character make him the future face of the franchise. Zetterberg, 35, and Pavel Datsyuk, 37, can\u2019t play forever, and Larkin seems like he\u2019ll be a Red Wing for the next 15 to 20 years. Born in 1996, Larkin probably was too young to understand the Avalanche-Red Wings rivalry in its heyday, but he\u2019ll undoubtedly learn much about it this week.
