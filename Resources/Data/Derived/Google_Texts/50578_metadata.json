Besides these historic decisions, there was another that\u2019s being hailed as important for property rights and the raisin industry.\n\nIt all began with a raisin grower bucking a federal system that\u2019s been in place since the 1930s. The United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s California Raisin Marketing Order, a Depression-era program that began in 1937, was put in place to stabilize raisin prices. A board of private raisin producers would meet every year to determine by a two-thirds margin if a percentage of each grower\u2019s crop should be set aside in order to maintain stable crop prices. The Department of Agriculture would then adopt the decision into law. The surplus raisins, for which the government did not pay, would then be used for various federal programs, exports or for charity, according to NPR.\n\nThe raisin producers would receive a portion of the net proceeds from the surplus, often amounting to less than the cost of growing the grapes, or nothing at all.\n\nIn the 2002-2003 season, the government ordered raisin growers to set aside 47 percent of their crop. Marvin and Laura Horne, raisin growers and packers in Kerman, California, near Fresno, refused to play ball. When the government sent trucks to the Hornes\u2019 facility to pick up the raisins, the Hornes refused them entry. In response, the federal government ordered them to pay $480,000 (the fair market value of the raisins) and a more than $200,000 fine, according to the court decision.\n\nThe Hornes fought the federal government on the issue, and the case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court after a challenge to a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.\n\nOn June 22, in an 8-1 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with Marvin Horne that the supply management system violates the Takings Clause in the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fifth Amendment. The court also set aside the more than $480,000 the government had assessed against the Hornes. The majority also found that there is no difference between real and personal property, as the Ninth Circuit had contended there was. Real property is land and items permanently attached to it, while personal property is pretty much everything else.\n\n\u201cNo more will they take our raisins and not pay for them,\u201d Marvin Horne told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough for us having this cloud over our heads. Now we have been vindicated.\u201d\n\nMany raisin producers don\u2019t see it that way. More than 1,600 of them from California had joined the USDA to defend the program. They say the Hornes are \u201cfree riders\u201d who evaded the rules and also benefitted from the higher prices those rules guaranteed, according to the LA Times.\n\nWhether the Supreme Court decision will dismantle the federal Marketing Order in the raisin industry is still an open question.\n\n\u201cThe decision could possibly spell the end of the current system, but in principle, all it means is that the government will have to pay compensation for the fair market value of any of the raisins that are taken this way,\u201d Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, tells Modern Farmer in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if going forward the Department of Agriculture has authorization from Congress to pay compensation in these cases and if they don\u2019t have that authorization, than in order to keep this program functioning, they might need Congress to pass a new law, which of course could happen, but doesn\u2019t seem tremendously likely.\u201d\n\nAccording to Somin, who was involved in an amicus brief in the case, if the Supreme Court had come down on the side of the Department of Agriculture, it \u201cwould have had very dangerous implications for all sorts of taking cases and property rights.\u201d He says the decision has prevented personal property from being \u201cvulnerable to uncompensated taking\u201d and also points to the Court\u2019s move toward \u201cbeginning to take Constitutional property rights more seriously.\u201d\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissenting opinion in the case, agreeing with the Ninth Circuit Court that because the raisin producers sometimes receive compensation for the product, the USDA\u2019s seizure didn\u2019t qualify as a true taking.\n\nSomin, who has blogged about the case for The Washington Post, says it\u2019s \u201ca bad argument. It\u2019s a little like saying there isn\u2019t a taking if the government seizes your house, sells it, and gives you 5 percent of their profits from the sale of the house. The fact that they give you some compensation in no way means your property wasn\u2019t seized in the first place.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it may be a moot point as far as the raisin industry is concerned. The federal government hasn\u2019t ordered any raisins set aside in the past five years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States Supreme Court has handed down some major decisions recently; the two biggest were granting the right for same-sex couples to marry anywhere in the country, and the ruling in favor of Obamacare.
