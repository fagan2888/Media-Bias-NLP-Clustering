But if the viewing public was voting, the results Sunday night would be very different.\n\nU.K. bookmaker Paddy Power listed Birdman as a 4/7 favorite to win as of Saturday evening, with Boyhood at 5/4 odds. Similarly, Predictwise, a site that aggregates and analyzes information to forecast political, sports and entertainment events, gives Birdman a 64.5 percent chance of winning. Boyhood is the only other contender, with a 34.3 percent chance.\n\nRelated: The 2015 Oscar Nominees\u2019 Worst Films\u200b\u200b\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking to win your Oscar pool, the best bet would be to stick to one of those two films. (Similarly, the men who helmed those movies are the safest bets to take home the Best Director prize, with I\u00f1\u00e1rritu pegged at having a nearly 60 percent likelihood of winning.)\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted before, though, there\u2019s often a wide gulf between massive commercial success and Oscars glory. That certainly held true this year. As you can see on the chart below, the movie-going public\u2019s clear favorite was Clint Eastwood\u2019s American Sniper. (You could say it really blew away the competition, but we would never be so crass.)\n\nThe biopic about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle has taken in more than $300 million at the box office, far ahead of the next Best Picture nominee, The Imitation Game, which has earned just over $80 million so far. American Sniper, which sparked some political controversy for its depiction of the Iraq war, has made more at the box office than the other seven nominated movies combined. And in a Google Consumer Survey of 1,005 people conducted for The Upshot, 42 percent called American Sniper the best movie they had seen in the past year. No other film came close.\n\nRelated: Hollywood\u2019s Desperate Measures to Save the 2015 Season\n\nIt\u2019s not that the other nominees were box office flops \u2014 each was solidly profitable, and could become even more so. But American Sniper was the only 2014 release to be both a huge box office draw and an Oscar contender. All of which means that many Americans will likely be very disappointed when another movie wins Best Picture on Sunday night. Bookmakers haven\u2019t posted odds on whether we\u2019ll be hearing more about Hollywood\u2019s \u201cliberal bias\u201d on Monday, but that seems like a pretty safe bet, too.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The race for the Best Picture Oscar appears to be between two contenders: Alejandro Go", "title": "Oscars 2015: \u2018American Sniper\u2019 Wins Where It Counts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/22/Oscars-2015-American-Sniper-Wins-Where-It-Counts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/american-sniper.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/22/Oscars-2015-American-Sniper-Wins-Where-It-Counts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/american-sniper.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The race for the Best Picture Oscar appears to be between two contenders: Alejandro Go", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "As you can see on the chart below, the movie-going public\u2019s clear favorite was Clint Eastwood\u2019s American Sniper.\nBut American Sniper was the only 2014 release to be both a huge box office draw and an Oscar contender.\nAll of which means that many Americans will likely be very disappointed when another movie wins Best Picture on Sunday night.\nAmerican Sniper, which sparked some political controversy for its depiction of the Iraq war, has made more at the box office than the other seven nominated movies combined.\nAnd in a Google Consumer Survey of 1,005 people conducted for The Upshot, 42 percent called American Sniper the best movie they had seen in the past year."}
