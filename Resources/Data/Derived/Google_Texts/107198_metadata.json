Read the previous stories by clicking here and here.\n\nPatricia Watkins got out of the hospital last December with a new diagnosis and a lot of fear.\n\n\u201cI had no idea how to take care of myself,\u201d Watkins, 58, said.\n\nAlthough Watkins had had insurance for nearly a year \u2013 she bought it through the marketplace created by the federal health law \u2013 she had been getting her care at a walk-in clinic, just as she did when she was uninsured. She\u2019d have preferred to have a set primary care doctor, but didn\u2019t know how to search for one.\n\nThe prospect of handling a new heart failure diagnosis was even more daunting.\n\nSo Watkins called her insurance company, ConnectiCare, and ended up in touch with Maria Christine Binalla, a nurse care manager who helped guide Watkins through the health care system. At first, they talked on the phone every day. Binalla helped Watkins find a primary care doctor and address medication issues, conference calling her and a pharmacist. They addressed issues outside of the medical system that mattered to her health, like finding a dietician at Shop Rite who could help Watkins find healthier foods, and balancing the work of managing Watkins\u2019 medical conditions with the long hours she worked at her security job.\n\n\u201cShe actually walked with me step by step, so it was all great,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI was relying on her.\u201d\n\nFor the Farmington-based insurer, it was one of hundreds of individual efforts aimed at helping those newly covered under Obamacare navigate the health care system and address barriers to taking care of their health. The assistance ranges from making primary-care appointments for customers who haven\u2019t yet incurred claims to linking customers in need to community programs that help with energy bills or provide rides to medical appointments.\n\nSurveys of people who gained insurance under the federal health law indicate that close to 90 percent want more information on how to use their coverage, said Sophie Stern, deputy director of the Best Practices Institute at Enroll America, a group focused on ensuring that people get and stay covered.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly they said they want to hear from the health insurance company,\u201d Stern said.\n\nThe insurers selling plans through Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT, are using a variety of techniques to help customers new to insurance and to encourage new members to see a primary care provider. A survey of exchange customers earlier this year indicated that 28 percent did not have a primary care doctor, and 36 percent hadn\u2019t yet used their coverage.\n\nUnitedHealthcare has called new members, for example, to see if they have questions.\n\nHealthyCT has been emphasizing the importance of wellness and selecting a primary care physician through its newsletter and an online health and wellness platform that has tools including weight trackers. It also allows members to communicate with nutritionists or trainers. The company hopes to do more targeted messaging to individual customers later this year or next year, said Karen Clarke, HealthyCT\u2019s vice president for external affairs.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield has focused on expanding online options \u2013 including a mobile app \u2013 to help member find a provider or determine what they would have to pay for care, based on research suggesting that two-thirds of customers prefer to get information online, Director of Sales Paul Bartosic said.\n\nAnthem also has a program that uses member health data, such as medical and pharmacy claims, and notifies them with suggestions if it identifies gaps in care. It also notifies a patient\u2019s doctor if it identifies that the person hasn\u2019t refilled a prescription regularly or is overdue for a test.\n\nConnectiCare, which covers more exchange customers than any other Connecticut insurer, has been reaching out to members who, according to medical claims (or a lack of them), haven\u2019t visited a primary care provider. Those members might get mailings or a phone call from one of the company\u2019s care managers. Sometimes, while speaking to a customer, they\u2019ll conference-call a doctor\u2019s office to schedule a visit.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave it on somebody, because they may not call,\u201d said Kim Green, a nurse and senior care manager at ConnectiCare.\n\nThe company began the effort for those who bought plans on the exchange, but has since expanded it to other individual-market customers. It says that strategy has helped about 1,000 people find a primary care provider so far this year.\n\nNew customers, new needs\n\nThose calls reflect, in part, an attempt to adapt to the needs of new insurance customers. In the past, aside from Medicare plans, ConnectiCare focused largely on employer-sponsored coverage, insuring people who had access to human resources departments to help with coverage issues and experience with insurance.\n\nPeople buying their own health plans don\u2019t usually have that kind of support. And it wasn\u2019t entirely clear who would be signing up under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Green said.\n\nA few weeks into the health law\u2019s coverage rollout, it was clear that many members needed a lot of help navigating the health care system. \u201cEvery call was pretty long,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a holistic view. It\u2019s gone beyond, \u2018These are the benefits that you have,\u2019 and the assumption that just because you have insurance, you\u2019ll know how to use it and you\u2019ll take advantage of those benefits.\" Michelle Zettergren\n\nShe and her colleagues explained the online provider directories and list of covered drugs. For customers without Internet access, they mailed copies or gave out phone numbers for doctors.\n\nSome faced language barriers that made finding a provider or making an appointment difficult. Some worried whether they could afford care. Some were afraid of what they\u2019d learn about their health if they saw a doctor.\n\nSome new customers faced barriers to getting care that Green described as \u201csocial work needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to work on any kind of condition they have if they\u2019re worried about that, they\u2019re worried about finding a place to live, they\u2019re worried about transportation to get to the doctor\u2019s office or basic needs,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company assembled a team to compile and regularly update a list of community resources, such as faith-based organizations that provide free rides. Its community outreach team holds events in various communities, often partnered with libraries or church groups, to answer questions about coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a holistic view,\u201d said Michelle Zettergren, ConnectiCare\u2019s senior vice president and chief sales and marketing officer. \u201cIt\u2019s gone beyond, \u2018These are the benefits that you have,\u2019 and the assumption that just because you have insurance, you\u2019ll know how to use it and you\u2019ll take advantage of those benefits. It\u2019s really kind of understanding the holistic picture of what\u2019s going on in that person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the business case for an insurance company to do that?\n\n\u201cEveryone assumes that the insurance companies are happy when you don\u2019t go for care,\u201d Zettergren said. \u201cAnd the reality is, we want folks to be going for care on an ongoing basis within the right setting, with the right individuals. We want them to have ownership of their health care.\u201d\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\n\u201cSomebody not seeing a doctor for 15 years is a really bad thing for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt elevates the issues that they have, and you\u2019re now looking, when they finally do enter into the system, [at] a much more costly experience versus if you\u2019re addressing these things up front.\u201d\n\nA guide through the health care system\n\nFor Watkins, getting the right care required addressing barriers that having an insurance card alone wasn\u2019t going to fix.\n\nShe had to fit managing her medical condition into a heavy work schedule with unpredictable shifts.\n\n\u201cIt was very challenging,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong other things, that meant finding time to take her blood pressure regularly. Once, during the winter, she called Binalla from an outdoor work site, wearing three layers of clothes. Binalla asked if she was going to check her blood pressure. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m too bundled up!\u201d Watkins answered.\n\nShe had to overcome some bad habits she\u2019d developed. In recent years, she\u2019d been working more than 70 hours many weeks and getting little sleep. She\u2019d buy cheap sandwiches and energy drinks. \u201cIt all just caught up with me,\u201d she said.\n\nThen there was navigating the medical system.\n\nThe hospital referred Watkins to a walk-in clinic. Watkins continued going to the walk-in at first. But the on-call doctors changed frequently, making it difficult to address questions that came up with one doctor\u2019s plan if another was on.\n\nBinalla suggested that it might be better to have a relationship with a set doctor, and helped Watkins find one in the insurer\u2019s network. She suggested asking the primary care doctor for recommendations for a cardiologist, which Watkins did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have that one relationship and someone that\u2019s going to be able to know me personally,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cIt works out better.\u201d\n\nAt first, she was hesitant to discuss her concerns with health care providers, worried they wouldn\u2019t understand. She asked Binalla if she could be on the phone during one of her appointments, so Binalla could convey her questions.\n\nShe signed a form so Binalla could communicate with her doctors and get faxed copies of her medical records. \u201cI was relying on Christine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce the doctor told me, \u2018You\u2019re looking great, I think you\u2019re going to be ok,\u2019 the phone calls slacked up a little bit.\u201d Patricia Watkins\n\nThey spoke daily for at least 20 or 30 minutes at first. Gradually, she became more comfortable handling her care, and called Binalla less frequently.\n\n\u201cOnce the doctor told me, \u2018You\u2019re looking great, I think you\u2019re going to be ok,\u2019 the phone calls slacked up a little bit,\u201d Watkins said.\n\nShe takes better care of herself, working closer to 40 to 50 hours per week, getting more sleep and maintaining a low-sodium diet.\n\nAnd Binalla said Watkins now handles the health care system on her own. She\u2019ll call a doctor if the office didn\u2019t call her back as expected. Where Watkins once wondered if she should discuss something with a doctor, now she does it with ease, Binalla said.\n\n\u201cShe advocates for herself confidently,\u201d Binalla said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/26/insurer-coaches-some-new-customers-through-the-health-system/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Affordable Care Act, Beyond Coverage, connecticare, coverage to care, insurance, primary care", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/26/insurer-coaches-some-new-customers-through-the-health-system/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "For those who gained coverage under Obamacare, learning to navigate the health care system can take more than an insurance card.
