Over a week after video surfaced of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber alleging that the Affordable Care Act passed thanks to “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of the American voter,” President Obama is finally answering questions about the comments.

During a press conference Sunday after the G-20 summit in Australia, Obama alleged that Obamacare was not designed to deceive the American people, according to Politico.

“The fact that an adviser who was never on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is not a reflection on the actual process that was run,” declared Obama.

Gruber, an MIT professor, was paid nearly $400,000 as a consultant for his work on the Affordable Care Act.

Obama also cited the scrutiny of the law by news organizations as evidence of the law’s transparency.

“I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story,” explained Obama. “I think it’s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent. It was a tough debate.”

This certainly isn’t the first time Obama has been examined for potentially misleading Americans about Obamacare. After all, Obama’s promise that “if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it” proved to be false last year when Americans started losing their health care plans.

Unsurprisingly, though, Obama is now distancing himself from Gruber and his suggestions about the law that were videotaped last year.

Other Democrats, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have been even more obvious in their efforts to run from Gruber.

“I don’t know who he is,” Pelosi said of the Obamacare architect Thursday despite the fact that she had specifically praised his work and mentioned him by name in a 2009 press conference.
