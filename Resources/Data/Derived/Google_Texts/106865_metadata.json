But its focus was on paid family leave and pregnancy accommodations, and ought to be seen by conservatives as a challenge to meet legitimate needs without sacrificing principle and expanding centralized authority. The president advocated for the federalization of employment laws as he called for Congress to leave \u201cnone of our country\u2019s talent behind.\u201d Conservatives should provide an alternative.\n\nAs the president himself put it, \u201cWork gives us a sense of place and dignity as well of income, and it is critically important, but family is also the bedrock of our lives.\u201d He called for society to create an environment in which everyone can achieve a balance between work and family. That\u2019s an ideal to strive for, a conservative principle to agree on, but what the president saw as a last resort when calling out his opposition\u2014saying that if Congress doesn\u2019t take action to address these issues then we\u2019ll need mayors, city governments, state legislatures, governors, CEOs, and companies to act\u2014should become the foundation for a genuine discussion by conservatives about how America can promote the family.\n\nThe president wasn\u2019t wrong when he said that allowing parents to spend time nurturing their infant child or caring for an ill relative, without sacrificing financial security, is not a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue,\u201d but rather a common-sense issue. He was right when he rejected the category \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d altogether, pointing out that anything that makes life harder for women makes life harder for families\u2014though I defy him to stay consistent even as he supports abortion. Paid family leave, especially paid parental leave, is a good thing. Federal mandates on businesses, or a centralized one-size-fits-all program paid for by increased federal taxes, are not good things.\n\nThe president is leading by example. Like the CEOs of the companies he referenced at the summit, including Google and Johnson & Johnson, Obama gives paid leave to his White House staff when they have a child, must care for a sick or injured family member, or are themselves sick or injured. In his speech he called for other federal departments to do the same. If realized by redistributing rather than expanding their funding, there seems little wrong with that. On the contrary, it\u2019s just the kind of conscientious and competitive payroll move more businesses could consider making.\n\nThree states have programs to provide paid family leave: California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. California\u2019s and Rhode Island\u2019s are paid for by an employee payroll tax and benefits are based on income. New Jersey\u2019s is a combined employer and employee payroll tax. Considering these states\u2019 financial positions, it hardly seems like the wisest expansion of state disability programs. It is, however, the kind of decision states should be making, not the federal government. Beyond questions of constitutional allocation of powers and responsibilities, states necessarily have a clearer understanding of the needs of their citizens, and can tailor a more responsible allocation of resources while also refraining from further ballooning the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe president\u2019s audience expressed their disdain when he mentioned Congress. He replied, quite sensibly, \u201cDon\u2019t boo; vote.\u201d Conservatives should heed the same message when they hear calls for Congress to pass laws addressing paid leave. Rather than boo, they should vote, and say, \u201cLet\u2019s deal with it.\u201d Let\u2019s address the balance between work and family with action in churches, and communities, and cities, and counties, and businesses, and state legislatures. The United States is the only developed nation without provided paid maternity leave. That\u2019s only a demerit if we don\u2019t have something better. The president said, \u201cWhenever I can act on my own, I\u2019m going to.\u201d For this, don\u2019t give him the chance, or the reason.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbaa\"", "article_summary": "Paid family leave, especially paid parental leave, is a good thing.\nThree states have programs to provide paid family leave: California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey.\nBut its focus was on paid family leave and pregnancy accommodations, and ought to be seen by conservatives as a challenge to meet legitimate needs without sacrificing principle and expanding centralized authority.\nHe replied, quite sensibly, \u201cDon\u2019t boo; vote.\u201d Conservatives should heed the same message when they hear calls for Congress to pass laws addressing paid leave.\nThe United States is the only developed nation without provided paid maternity leave."}
