Paul LePage (R) remains a highly unusual political figure (thanks to Gerald Weinand of Dirigo Blue for the tip).\n\nA day after issuing a statement that equated Social Security with welfare and touched off a wave of political criticism, Gov. Paul LePage sought to clarify the statement Thursday, saying he doesn\u2019t actually believe that. LePage criticized the Portland Press Herald for making an \u201cerroneous interpretation\u201d of a media release that his office issued Wednesday. It dealt with a report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showing that Maine\u2019s personal income growth was below the U.S. average and last in New England in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nFederal officials responsible for measuring economic growth recently found that Maine trails other states in New England on personal income. The Republican governor\u2019s office said the data is misleading: the data includes income from social-insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and unemployment insurance.\n\nAnd for LePage, economic security through social-insurance programs shouldn\u2019t count.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what liberals call these payments, it is welfare, pure and simple,\u201d the governor said in a written press release. \u201cLiberals from the White House all the way down to Democratic leadership in Augusta believe that redistribution of wealth \u2013 taking money from hard-working taxpayers and giving it to a growing number of welfare recipients \u2013 is personal income. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just more welfare expansion.\u201d\n\nIn other words, on Wednesday, Paul LePage condemned programs like Social Security as \u201cwelfare\u201d and \u201credistribution of wealth.\u201d But on Thursday, Paul LePage decided voters and journalists should \u201cinterpret\u201d his written press release in a way that won\u2019t hurt him politically.\n\nIf you have money in your pocket by way of a paycheck, Maine\u2019s governor thinks that\u2019s great. If you have money in your pocket by way of Social Security, Maine\u2019s governor thinks you\u2019re \u201ctaking that money from hard-working taxpayers.\u201d\n\nWhy in the world would a politician struggling in his re-election bid say something like this? As it turns out, there\u2019s one plausible explanation.\n\nMaine is literally the only state in the Northeast that refuses to accept Medicaid expansion, despite the fact that it\u2019s passed the legislature repeatedly with bipartisan support, and it\u2019s all because LePage simply won\u2019t consider the policy. The governor has struggled to come up with a coherent explanation for why he won\u2019t budge, but the result leaves more than 60,000 low-income Mainers without access to medical care.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, leaving this chunk of the population uninsured also hurts Maine\u2019s economy, which is apparently what prompted this week\u2019s dustup.\n\nIn practical terms, LePage\u2019s hostility for social-insurance programs undermines state finances and state economic activity. So what\u2019s the solution? For Maine\u2019s far-right governor, the answer is to argue that resources from social-insurance programs simply don\u2019t matter.\n\nFor those wondering how in the world this guy got elected governor of Maine in the first place, it\u2019s worth noting that in 2010, the state hosted a four-way race featuring a Republican, a Democrat, and two independents. With the mainstream vote split, LePage won with 38% support.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's not at all common for a politician to say a written statement was misquoted, but Maine Gov.
