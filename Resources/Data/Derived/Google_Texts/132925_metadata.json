(Photo: file photo)Buy Photo\n\nResidents in a handful of Jersey Shore towns went to the polls Tuesday to cast their votes on school renovation and expansion referendums. Below are the tallies, as provided by the Monmouth County and Ocean County clerks\u2019 offices.\n\nBAY HEAD\n\nThe borough\u2019s school district was seeking approval on a $4.3 million project designed to build an addition on the Bay Head Elementary School as well as renovate and improve portions of the building. The district planned to bond $3.3 million of the total project costs. The remainder was funded through a $470,430 donation from the Bay Head School Foundation, $247,930 in superstorm Sandy insurance funds, and $272,950 from the school\u2019s capital reserve.\n\nThe referendum was approved by a vote of 328 to 48.\n\nFREEHOLD BOROUGH\n\nVoters defeated a $32,902,400 project to make additions and improvements to the Park Avenue Elementary/Middle School and the Freehold Learning Center.\n\nSchool officials said the projects \u2014 $15 million for the Park Avenue Elementary School/Middle School and $3.7 million for the Freehold Learning Center \u2014 are needed to alleviate overcrowding.\n\nThe district currently rents four classrooms in West Freehold Elementary and two classrooms in Marshall Errikson, both in Freehold Township, to alleviate some of the overcrowding. Another 346 students are educated in administrative and library space, according to school officials. More than 1,600 are enrolled in the district, which has a capacity for only 1,148 students.\n\nWithout approval, district officials said, they may be forced to use split scheduling for students.\n\nThe referendum was defeated by a vote of 374 to 272, according to Monmouth County Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nLAKEWOOD\n\nTownship voters approved a nearly $34.7 million bond for installing heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and roofs at several public schools.\n\nThe bond's annual cost would be $55.49 for a property assessed at $300,000, according to district documents.\n\nThe state has agreed to kick in $11.7 million toward the cost of the bond should it be approved, Schools Superintendent Laura Winters said.\n\nThe referendum was approved by a vote of 2,436 to 1,381.\n\nMANCHESTER\n\nTownship voters accepted a $15.5 million spending plan aimed at repairing and replacing aging infrastructure and upgrading the district\u2019s security. The money will replace decades-old roofs, pay for new lighting and security vestibules. The money also will fund a new heating and air conditioning system, which officials said is so old that replacement parts are no longer available.\n\nThe faulty air conditioning system may have played an important roll in a mold outbreak at Manchester Township Middle School in 2012. The school was closed for two months while it was being cleaned, and cost $1.1 million to remediate. Only $150,000 of the remediation cost was borne by taxpayers; insurance covered the rest, according to school officials.\n\nManchester\u2019s last school referendum passed in 2009.\n\nThe $15.5 million spending plan was approved by a vote of 2,090 to 1,290, according to the Ocean County Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1wZ1V7g", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Jersey voters went to the polls Tuesday and cast their votes on school referendums for rennovations and building expansions.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "New Jersey voters went to the polls Tuesday and cast their votes on school referendums for rennovations and building expansions.", "title": "Results are in: Voters decide on school spending plans", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/education/2014/10/01/voters-decide-school-referendums/16540295/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey voters went to the polls Tuesday and cast their votes on school referendums for rennovations and building expansions.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/228c3068aa4f4a28b216747a876207573f9fc5ce/c=306-0-1560-1254&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/10/01/-00000000.jpg", "title": "Voters decide on school referendums", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "school referendums, New Jersey school referendums, New Jersey school spending"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf76a\"", "article_summary": "School officials said the projects \u2014 $15 million for the Park Avenue Elementary School/Middle School and $3.7 million for the Freehold Learning Center \u2014 are needed to alleviate overcrowding.\nOnly $150,000 of the remediation cost was borne by taxpayers; insurance covered the rest, according to school officials.\nBAY HEADThe borough\u2019s school district was seeking approval on a $4.3 million project designed to build an addition on the Bay Head Elementary School as well as renovate and improve portions of the building.\nManchester\u2019s last school referendum passed in 2009.\nAnother 346 students are educated in administrative and library space, according to school officials."}
