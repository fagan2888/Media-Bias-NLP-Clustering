(Newser) – If a proposed measure somehow makes its way into law, students in Kentucky could see a $2,500 reward for finding transgendered people in a bathroom that doesn't match their assigned sex. The bill targets school officials who allow transgendered students to use their preferred bathrooms—as well as officials who don't "take reasonable steps to prohibit the person encountered" from doing so, US News and World Report reports. In such cases, students could sue in state courts and win $2,500, plus more funds for psychological harm inflicted. The bill, sponsored by state senator CB Embry, was apparently spurred by a request from the Family Foundation of Kentucky; that group drafted it, he tells WBKO. The bill would also require "the best available accommodation" for transgendered people who are uncomfortable with single-sex bathrooms.

Students, Embry says, are "certainly welcome to live their lives as they choose. If they want to dress as the opposite sex and the school is OK with that, that’s fine," he notes. The bill, he says, is aimed at preventing discomfort among other users of the bathrooms. Will it pass? It seems highly unlikely: Embry isn't aware of a single fellow lawmaker who supports the bill. What's more, notes the head of the Kentucky Fairness campaign, the bill "is in direct violation of Title IX, the law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in schools." Embry does, however, point to one person who apparently supports it. "I have a friend, and we can all say these things, who is a homosexual and she agrees that she doesn’t want men in her bathroom."
