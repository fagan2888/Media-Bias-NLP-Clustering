Still, it remains controversial because it sides with the safety of the patient and others at the expense of a patient\u2019s individual rights.\n\nTwo sweeping mental health reform bills that have been introduced in Congress both call for expanding capacity for forced medication. However, some mental health advocates, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness, have expressed moral concerns about forcing an individual, even one with profound mental illness, to be medicated against his or her will. They also argue that it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe Smith case is particularly unusual because the state is asking a judge to force medication not necessarily for the usual reason of protecting people from harm but to ensure that the state can move through the legal process. That type of forced medication is not common, although it has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court and a handful of states have passed laws to facilitate it as an option.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Deborah Cashman cited a new Maine law, passed this summer, in her motion last month, but didn\u2019t need to. The Supreme Court decision from 2003 already provided a pathway, which may render moot the objections of Smith\u2019s attorneys, who believe their client\u2019s constitutional rights are being violated.\n\nConstitutionality aside, forcing medication in these types of cases raises questions. Smith is a pretrial defendant, who \u2013 even though he has confessed \u2013 is still presumed innocent. And his competence to stand trial is an entirely different issue than his mental capacity at the time of the alleged crime. That means even if his competency is restored through medication, it has no bearing on his state of mind in May 2014, when he allegedly killed his father.\n\nKathy Swedlow, an assistant dean and professor at Western Michigan University\u2019s Cooley Law School who has published on the topic, said despite the high court\u2019s decision 12 years ago, forced medication for the purpose of restoring competency remains fraught with problems.\n\n\u201cProfessionals can determine incompetency, but how do you effectively determine that medication restores competency?\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we really going to know if a person is competent?\u201d\n\nCONFESSION, BIZARRE BEHAVIOR\n\nSmith, 25, already has confessed to stabbing his father, Leroy Smith Jr., to death in May 2014 inside the Gardiner apartment they shared.\n\nHe told police that he dragged the body into the bathtub to cut it into pieces, loaded those pieces into trash bags, and dumped the bags in the woods a few miles down the road.\n\nDuring his confession, the younger Smith said he killed his father because of years of sexual abuse, but he also referred to himself as God, said the FBI told him to put a video of the slaying on YouTube and later claimed that people associated with heavy metal bands were conspiring to kill him.\n\nAt an initial hearing less than a week after the killing, Smith claimed that he was a political prisoner. His behavior has been similarly bizarre during subsequent court appearances.\n\nSmith underwent a forensic evaluation last summer and fall that resulted in a ruling in January by Justice Donald Marden, who found the defendant not competent to stand trial. He\u2019s been at Riverview, in Augusta, ever since.\n\nBy law, Smith can be held indefinitely to see if his competence can be restored, but that may never happen. Lately, Smith has been making things more difficult.\n\nAccording to court documents, Smith has refused to take his Seroquel, an anti-psychotic medication that\u2019s often used to treat schizophrenia, his mental health diagnosis.\n\nWithout that medicine, Smith suffers from debilitating delusions, according to Ann LeBlanc, director of the State Forensic Service, who conducted his forensic evaluation.\n\nWith it, though, Smith is \u201csubstantially likely\u201d to be rendered competent, Cashman has argued.\n\nScott Hess, one of Smith\u2019s attorneys, said that although the Supreme Court case allows involuntary medication, the state has to meet certain criteria: that there are important government interests at stake, that the medication will make it likely to render a defendant competent, that less intrusive means are unlikely to achieve the same results, and that administering medication is medically appropriate.\n\n\u201cEven though Mr. Smith is charged with a serous crime, the state cannot simply experiment upon him by forcing medications into his body, based on a guess that a particular medication might restore his competency,\u201d Hess said. \u201cThis would be unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nCashman has outlined in court documents that the state has a \u201csignificant interest in restoring (the) defendant\u2019s competency in this case.\u201d Although she wouldn\u2019t comment on the case directly, it\u2019s likely that the significant interest she cites is the fact that restoring Smith\u2019s competency, even if it means he eventually is found not criminally responsible, will make it easier for him to be institutionalized.\n\nIf he\u2019s found not guilty by reason of insanity, the state could keep him at Riverview indefinitely. If Smith\u2019s competency is not restored and he demonstrates no imminent threat of harm to himself or others, the state may not be able to keep him at Riverview for the long term.\n\nAmy Fairfield, a defense attorney with a long history of representing forensic clients, said she was surprised to hear about the state\u2019s motion. Forensic patients are generally defined as either accused criminals who have been found not competent to stand trial or individuals who have been found not criminally responsible because of a mental illness.\n\n\u201cIn most cases of competency, people never come back to competence, even with medication,\u201d Fairfield said.\n\nAsked whether the state\u2019s interest is in keeping Smith as a forensic patient rather than a civil patient, Fairfield said that seemed likely.\n\n\u201cIf the charges go away, the state has almost zero control over that patient,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a real possibility that he would be having dinner with all of us in the near future.\u201d\n\nA hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Kennebec County Superior Court, but the judge likely will not act on the state\u2019s motion at that time.\n\nThe decision will be watched closely. Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and the court master for the consent decree that governs treatment of Riverview patients, said he believes this is the first time the state has requested forced medication for the purpose of restoring competency.\n\nTWO TYPES OF FORENSIC PATIENTS\n\nRichard Malaby, the state representative who sponsored the bill that became the law cited by Cashman, said he didn\u2019t draft the legislation to assist in criminal cases, although he supports that use.\n\nAs it turns out, though, the law was not needed to petition a judge to force medication.\n\nThat framework already was provided in the 2003 Supreme Court case, Sell v. United States.\n\nMalaby said his main aim was to improve safety for both patients and staff at psychiatric facilities, specifically Riverview. He said patients who have refused medication have become violent and attacked staff or harmed themselves.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker from Hancock said an inability to force medication on patients at Riverview \u2013 specifically, forensic patients \u2013 is one of the major reasons the hospital has been plagued with problems.\n\nSo Malaby\u2019s bill created provisions to allow forced medication, under certain circumstances, for two types of forensic patients \u2013 those who have been found not competent to stand trial, like Leroy Smith III, and those who have been found not criminally responsible for their crime by reason of insanity.\n\nState officials already have discretion to force patients to take their medication under certain circumstances in civil cases. That is allowed under a law that passed in 2010.\n\nLegal guardians, health care practitioners and law enforcement personnel can petition a court to order treatment \u2013 much in the same way they can petition to have an individual involuntarily committed to a hospital.\n\nThe threshold for forced medication in civil cases is lower than the bar required to commit someone to a psychiatric facility involuntarily. But the option is still used sparingly, in part because some mental health advocates have been critical of it.\n\nThose same organizations fought passage of Malaby\u2019s bill this spring.\n\nOamshri Amarasingham, public policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, testified in May that a law already exists to force-medicate \u2013 a reference to the 2010 legislation \u2013 and said additional measures were not needed.\n\n\u201cIf a patient lacks the capacity to consent, a guardian should be appointed to make decisions in her best interest. Outside of that process, DHHS has the authority to forcibly medicate patients in its custody in emergency situations,\u201d she said, referring to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nNAMI Maine\u2019s Jenna Mehnert said that forcing medication simply to aid in prosecutions is misguided.\n\n\u201cAn individual\u2019s mental state at the time the crime was committed, not after forced treatment, should be the driving factor during the court process,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite those objections by mental health advocates, the labor unions representing nurses and social workers supported the measure.\n\nWathen said that officials felt that it didn\u2019t make sense to allow forced medication for patients who have been committed in civil cases but not for forensic patients whose institutionalization was tied to a criminal case.\n\nThe bill passed unanimously in both the House and Senate and became law without the governor\u2019s signature.\n\nMaine became the sixth state to codify the 2003 Supreme court decision into statute.\n\nWathen said the Smith case will be interesting to watch but he doesn\u2019t think it will lead to a groundswell of requests for forced medication.\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough of these types of cases in Maine, thankfully,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leroy Smith III's case raises questions about how far the state can go to ensure its murder case moves ahead.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Leroy Smith III's case raises questions about how far the state can go to ensure its murder case moves ahead.", "title": "State's effort to force drug on defendant before trial sparks debate - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 637, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aa.jpg", "height": 477}, "updated_time": "2015-09-20T12:07:30-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/09/20/states-effort-to-force-drug-on-defendant-before-trial-sparks-debate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Leroy Smith III's case raises questions about how far the state can go to ensure its murder case moves ahead.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aa.jpg", "title": "State's effort to force drug on defendant before trial sparks debate - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Cops & Courts", "published_time": "2015-09-20T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-20T12:07:30-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By law, Smith can be held indefinitely to see if his competence can be restored, but that may never happen.\nTwo sweeping mental health reform bills that have been introduced in Congress both call for expanding capacity for forced medication.\nThe threshold for forced medication in civil cases is lower than the bar required to commit someone to a psychiatric facility involuntarily.\nForced medication, sometimes referred to as assisted outpatient treatment, has been consistently upheld as lawful by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nWithout that medicine, Smith suffers from debilitating delusions, according to Ann LeBlanc, director of the State Forensic Service, who conducted his forensic evaluation."}
