Remember:\n\n\u25a0 Fruits and vegetables don\u2019t play well together. So don\u2019t store them together in a refrigerator drawer or next to each other on the counter or in a pantry. Many fruits produce ethylene gas, which acts like a ripening hormone and can speed spoilage.\n\n\u25a0 Vegetables need to breathe. Poke holes in the plastic bags you store them in, or keep them in mesh bags. An airtight plastic bag is the worst choice. And don\u2019t pack veggies tightly together; they need space for air circulation or they\u2019ll spoil faster.\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t clean produce until you\u2019re ready to use it. Dampness encourages bacteria growth.\n\n\u25a0 Store garlic at room temperature in an open container, to allow air circulation.\n\nDon\u2019t take off the protective papery husk until you\u2019re ready to prep. It\u2019s fine to store garlic next to its buddy, the onion.\n\n\u25a0 Keep potatoes in a dark and cool place, but don\u2019t refrigerate. The cold, damp air in the refrigerator causes their starches to turn into sugars, which can affect taste and texture. Store them in a paper bag \u2014 more breathable than plastic \u2014 in a coolish spot, such as a pantry. Keep them away from onions or fruits like apples that exude ethylene gas, which can make your spuds begin to sprout.\n\n\u25a0 Cucumbers hate to be cold. Anything below 50 degrees will cause them to spoil faster. If you must refrigerate them, do it for no more than three days. Cucumbers also are sensitive to ethylene gas, so keep them away from bananas, melons and tomatoes.\n\n\u25a0 Break up the bunch of bananas, as charming as it might look. Then wrap each stem in plastic wrap. That will reduce the emission of ethylene gas, and the bananas will ripen more slowly. Once a banana reaches the desired ripeness, refrigerate it to keep it from ripening further.\n\n\u2013 Candy Sagon, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2011/10/Vegetables.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "So don\u2019t store them together in a refrigerator drawer or next to each other on the counter or in a pantry.\nMany fruits produce ethylene gas, which acts like a ripening hormone and can speed spoilage.\nKeep them away from onions or fruits like apples that exude ethylene gas, which can make your spuds begin to sprout.\nThat will reduce the emission of ethylene gas, and the bananas will ripen more slowly.\nRemember:\u25a0 Fruits and vegetables don\u2019t play well together."}
