SAN JOSE -- With less than a month to go before Obamacare's Jan. 31 sign-up deadline for a 2016 health care plan, California's health insurance exchange is holding weekly enrollment events throughout the Bay Area to provide consumers free, confidential enrollment assistance.

Insurance agents and enrollment counselors certified by the exchange, called Covered California, will be on hand during the following dates and locations to walk consumers through the process, helping them avoid the costly tax penalties for not having health insurance this year.

Those fines are going up to $695 per adult and half that amount for family members who are 17 and younger (up to $2,085), or 2.5 percent of annual household income -- whichever is greater.

Below are some weekly Covered California enrollment events in Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara and Solano counties through January:
