The combination creates a particularly interesting legislative mix for the newest member of Alabama's federal delegation.\n\nOversight & Government Reform is essentially a legislative watchdog of the executive branch. The committee will afford Palmer the opportunity to press federal agencies for information and transparency on issues ranging from the government's response to the Ebola outbreak to the Affordable Care Act and even the IRS targeting of conservative groups.\n\nAs a member of the House Committee on the Budget, Palmer will have input into setting the general spending and revenue priorities for the federal government. With Tom Price, a staunch conservative from Georgia, leading the committee, Palmer's perspectives on fiscal restraint will likely be welcome.\n\nPerhaps Palmer's most interesting committee assignment is to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. With Mo Brooks (AL-05) already on the committee, Alabama could have a formidable congressional duo impacting the state's growing science and aerospace industries.\n\nHow do you think Palmer will fare as a member of these three committee's? What issues would you like to see him prioritize for the Sixth Congressional District or for the State of Alabama?\n\n(Cameron Smith writes a regular column for Alabama Media Group.
