The anticipation snowballed. And eventually, the wider sporting world was so teased by the possibilities, the bout, when it finally materialized, built into the richest in boxing history.\n\nBut the fight that everybody wanted so badly to see became a fight that nobody really wants to watch again.\n\nMayweather dominated Pacquiao for a unanimous decision late Saturday night in front of 16,507 high-paying fans at a sold-out MGM Grand Garden Arena to unite the 147-pound welterweight championship. Mayweather finally stamped his name, alone, as the No. 1 pound-for-pound king of boxing.\n\n\u201cI knew I had him from Round 1,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cI\u2019m 10 steps ahead of every fighter.\u201d\n\nIn moving his record to 48-0, Mayweather is one victory from reaching Rocky Marciano\u2019s famed record as heavyweight champ in the 1950s. Julio Cesar Chavez holds the record for the longest professional undefeated streak, going 89-0-1 in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\u201cThis is my era,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m TBE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best ever\u201d is an argument Mayweather can make, but probably won\u2019t win. Years ago, he set himself up as the foil, boxing\u2019s bad guy who\u2019s too talented to touch. It\u2019s an image that spilled outside the ring into domestic violence charges.\n\nBut even with a largely pro-Pacquiao crowd chanting \u201cManny, Manny\u201d to drown out the \u201cMoney, Money\u201d chants for Mayweather, it was the champ who won big.\n\nMayweather immediately earned $100 million, with the paper to prove it.\n\n\u201cThe check got nine figures on it, baby,\u201d he said, showing off the payment to reporters.\n\nHis earning will probably continue. Cable TV companies were overwhelmed by high demand for the pay-per-view broadcast, and the fight was delayed nearly an hour while the orders piled up.\n\nMayweather\u2019s mastery as a fighter is his preternatural ability to avoid getting hit. His greasy defense sets him apart. And even when Pacquiao pushed him into corners and against the ropes, Mayweather slipped away.\n\nPacquiao twice battered a balled-up Mayweather with speed-bag punches, and they split four of the first eight rounds. But after a Pacquiao barrage subsided in the sixth, Mayweather dropped his hands, shook his head and said, \u201cNope.\u201d\n\nMayweather cruised through the final five rounds. He landed 148 of his 435 punches, according to CompuBox statistics. They included 81 of 168 power shots. Pacquiao connected with just 81 total hits of 429 thrown \u2014 just a 19 percent rate.\n\nIf Mayweather proved he\u2019s at the top of the boxing heap, his ascent didn\u2019t endear him to the mainstream.\n\n\u201cCall me old school, but I like the fans getting their money\u2019s worth by watching an action-packed fight,\u201d said Oscar De La Hoya, the last transcendent boxing champion, who eventually lost to both Mayweather and Pacquiao.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not into the boxing, running style. I like jumping out of my seat because a fight was exciting and the fans got their money\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nBecause this is boxing, a minor controversy surfaced after the fight. Pacquiao said he fought with an injured shoulder suffered nearly three weeks ago in sparring. And his punches were largely left-handed.\n\nHis camp, though, claimed the Nevada State Athletic Commission refused to allow for anti-inflammatory shots before the fight. The commission said it was never informed of an injury until about an hour before the fight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Pacquiao said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make alibis or complaints or anything.\u201d\n\nInjury or not, there was nothing left in doubt between Mayweather and Pacquiao. There was no rematch clause written into their contract. And it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll fight again.\n\nPacquiao, a congressman in the Philippines, remains a box office draw, although his worthy opponents are dwindling.\n\nMayweather, who now owns five titles across two weight divisions, said he will relinquish his belts to give younger fighters a chance at championships. As the agreed-upon No. 1 pound-for-pound champ, his titles are irrelevant.\n\nBut Mayweather, who has one more fight left on a multiyear TV contract with Showtime, said he will probably retire after one more bout.\n\nThat fight, though, isn\u2019t likely to dethrone Mayweather.\n\n\u201cIf it was my last fight, I\u2019d find somebody I could beat up real bad,\u201d said Floyd Mayweather Sr., the fighter\u2019s father and trainer. \u201cSomebody who would not cause me any trouble whatsoever.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cSuperfight\u201d had a super fighter in Mayweather but wasn\u2019t great to see", "title": "\u201cSuperfight\u201d had a super fighter in Mayweather but wasn\u2019t great to see", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/03/superfight-had-a-super-fighter-in-mayweather-but-wasnt-great-to-see/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150503__BN20150504_Z00_BNSP04BOXFOLOp1.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150503__BN20150504_Z00_BNSP04BOXFOLOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T17:58:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:21:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Fight fans clamored for years to see Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao in the same ring.\nBut even with a largely pro-Pacquiao crowd chanting \u201cManny, Manny\u201d to drown out the \u201cMoney, Money\u201d chants for Mayweather, it was the champ who won big.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make alibis or complaints or anything.\u201dInjury or not, there was nothing left in doubt between Mayweather and Pacquiao.\nPacquiao twice battered a balled-up Mayweather with speed-bag punches, and they split four of the first eight rounds.\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m TBE.\u201d\u201cThe best ever\u201d is an argument Mayweather can make, but probably won\u2019t win."}
