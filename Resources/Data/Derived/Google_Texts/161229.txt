The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) has significantly cut the out-of-pocket costs for behavioral health care, and the biggest beneficiaries of reduced costs are young adults from racial and ethnic minorities.

A study from the University of Miami School of Business Administration, published in the journal Psychiatric Services, found that the dependent coverage provision of PPACA has cut the number of uninsured young people by at least three million, since it allows young adults to stay covered by their familyâ€™s insurance till age 26.
