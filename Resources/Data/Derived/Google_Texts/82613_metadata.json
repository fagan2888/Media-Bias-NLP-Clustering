A hearing has been scheduled for March 17. If the preliminary injunction is granted, the court could halt the import of the elephants until the lawsuit is resolved.\n\nSix of the elephants are expected to join the four currently living in Dallas\u2019 Giants of the Savanna habitat.\n\nThe Dallas Zoo had hoped to welcome the new elephants by the end of the year.\n\nDallas Zoo spokeswoman Laurie Holloway said the zoos could not comment on the case.\n\n\u201cBut we are hopeful for a quick resolution that enables the relocation of the animals,\u201d she said. \u201cAs drought conditions throughout Swaziland worsen and food sources become scarcer, the zoos are eager to relocate these animals to provide them a healthy life in a safe home.\u201d\n\nThe elephants, which are between 6 and 20 years old, have been living in drought conditions and competing for resources with a population of critically endangered black rhinos, the zoos said. The Swazi government decided it needed to either relocate or cull the heard in order to maintain biodiversity in the parks.\n\nAbout 21 elephants will remain in the two parks where the animals were living.\n\nThe three zoos also agreed to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars over several years for black rhino conservation.\n\n\u201cAny actions that would further delay this move also jeopardize the elephants\u2019 well-being,\u201d said Dennis Pate, CEO and executive director at the Omaha zoo. \u201cThey are currently living in temporary bomas that are not designed for long-term care, and the region is experiencing extreme drought that threatens food supply.\u201d\n\nDuring the permit approval process, the wildlife agency had to determine that importing the animals is not detrimental to the species\u2019 survival, that the zoos are suitably equipped to house and care for the animals and that the animals would not be used primarily for commercial purposes.\n\nThe animal-rights group\u2019s suit claims that though the wildlife agency published notice that no significant impact was found under the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not disclose or analyze the social, behavioral and physical impacts on the elephants.\n\nTim Van Norman, chief of the Branch of Permits for the fish and wildlife agency, told National Geographic that Congress has not required his agency to weigh the ethics of the import. He said his group considers whether the import is humane and determines whether it is detrimental to the species, not individual animals.\n\nThe suit specifically mentions the Dallas Zoo, stating that a Friends of Animals member who previously worked at the zoo observed the elephants during her employment and visits \u201cbut has had a difficult time doing so after learning about the problems caused by keeping elephants in zoos.\u201d\n\nThe group says the member, and others, would like to continue visiting the zoos, but would be unable to do so or will \u201cno longer be able to enjoy their visits to the zoos because of the confinement of elephants taken from the wild in Swaziland.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas Zoo has said it\u2019s unaware of any other lawsuits, though the Friends of Animals suit isn\u2019t the first attempt to stall plans to importing the elephants. An open letter signed by a group of conservationists, scientists and animal welfare advocates pushed for the elephants to remain in Swaziland and claimed the zoos were capturing and importing the elephants to \u201crestock a dwindling zoo elephant inventory,\u201d not for conservation.\n\nJudge John D. Bates, the judge with whom the case has been assigned, heard a separate Friends of Animals case last year. In July, Bates ruled in favor of the Department of the Interior\u2019s motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nIn 2003, animal rights groups sued the fish and wildlife service alleging the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa and the Wild Animal Park in San Diego provided false information on permit applications to bring 11 elephants from Swaziland. The court ultimately denied the group\u2019s request and the lawsuit was dismissed.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAyL2FuaW1hbC1yaWdodHMtZ3JvdXAtc3RlcHMtdXAtZWZmb3J0cy10by1oYWx0LWltcG9ydC1vZi1lbGVwaGFudHMtdG8tZGFsbGFzLXpvby5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
