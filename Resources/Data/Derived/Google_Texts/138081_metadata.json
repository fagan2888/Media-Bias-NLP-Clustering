This big and rich beer hits 8 percent ABV.\n\nThe two choices are built for a broad appeal among beer geeks and designed to stand out among the thousands of beers on the floor at the Colorado Convention Center. The winner is decided by GABF attendees who cast votes after tasting samples.\n\nThis year\u2019s competition is getting more hype after the House took home a narrow win in the inaugural competition. In 2014, the House\u2019s Representative Saison took 51.9 percent of the GABF vote compared to the 48.1 percent for the Senate\u2019s Upper Chamber Fresh Hop ale.\n\nAsked about whether the House is just trying to win votes with an IPA, House Speaker Pro Tem Dan Pabon pivoted in classic political fashion. \u201cThe fact that it is a popular beer style simply reflects the strong connections the House has with its Colorado constituents,\u201d the Denver Democrat said, probably only half-joking.\n\nThe Senate also sought to amplify its game. \u201cWe found consensus for a more robust, full-flavor style than was brewed by either team last year,\u201d said Sen. Chris Holbert, a Parker Republican who probably smirked when responding by email with a legislative pun (\u201cconsensus\u201d).\n\nHolbert helped the House win the title a year ago but now finds himself on the opposite team with his election to the Senate. \u201cI have confidence in our brew, which will make it easy to encourage GABF attendees to try it and, ultimately, cast their vote for our beer,\u201d he said.\n\nPabon said the House isn\u2019t getting over-confident, despite being reigning champs. \u201cWe never take anything for granted in the House, even if the Senate is involved,\u201d he said. \u201cWe plan to stick to our contest-winning strategy of producing the best product possible \u2026 while also espousing the bipartisan way the beer was fashioned. We know Coloradans want us to work across the aisle to produce great results. What better way to show what great work we can do when we work together?\u201d\n\nThe competition is sponsored by the Colorado Brewers Guild and provides the state\u2019s craft beer makers an informal opportunity to highlight the industry\u2019s work in the state. It\u2019s an event the lawmakers obviously enjoyed a year ago.\n\nHolbert said the Senate beer takes its name from a GABF tradition. At the event, if someone drops a plastic tasting cup, the crowd erupts into a loud shout. \u201cWe thought it a great tie-in to the GABF atmosphere and a way to draw attention to a beer that is so good that, when you taste it, you\u2019re apt to drop your glass and shout for joy!\u201d Holbert said, putting plenty of spin on it. \u201cThat\u2019s indicative of the fun that GABF attendees experience and I hope that a majority find it engaging enough to vote for the Senate brew.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Holbert, the Senate team featured Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood, Matt Jones, D-Louisville, Tim Neville, R-Littleton, and Pat Steadman, D-Denver.\n\nThe House team included Pabon, Polly Lawrence, R-Douglas County, Jeni Arndt, D-Fort Collins,\n\nJoann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, Paul Lundeen, R-Monument, Kim Ransom, R-Littleton, and Yuelin Willet, R-Grand Junction.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Brewers Guild,Colorado House,Colorado Senate,craft beer,GABF,Great American Beer Festival,Hop the Vote,Hop the Vote 2015", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "In this year\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Hop the Vote craft beer competition between Colorado lawmakers at GABF, a new brand of politics is emerging: beer populism.", "title": "Hop the Vote: In GABF contest, lawmakers brew fan favorites", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/09/03/hop-the-vote-in-gabf-competition-colorado-lawamkers-brew-fan-favorites/122832/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/09/rsz_gabf-495x365.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In this year\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Hop the Vote craft beer competition between Colorado lawmakers at GABF, a new brand of politics is emerging: beer populism.", "title": "Hop the Vote: For GABF beer competition, Colorado lawmakers hope fan favorites win votes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/09/03/hop-the-vote-in-gabf-competition-colorado-lawamkers-brew-fan-favorites/122832/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/09/rsz_gabf-495x365.jpg", "creator": "@ByJohnFrank", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In this year\u2019s Hop the Vote craft beer competition between Colorado lawmakers at GABF, a new brand of politics is emerging: beer populism."}, "article_summary": "In 2014, the House\u2019s Representative Saison took 51.9 percent of the GABF vote compared to the 48.1 percent for the Senate\u2019s Upper Chamber Fresh Hop ale.\nIn this year\u2019s Hop the Vote competition at the Great American Beer Festival, a new brand of politics is emerging: beer populism.\nThe House team included Pabon, Polly Lawrence, R-Douglas County, Jeni Arndt, D-Fort Collins,Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, Paul Lundeen, R-Monument, Kim Ransom, R-Littleton, and Yuelin Willet, R-Grand Junction.\nHolbert said the Senate beer takes its name from a GABF tradition.\n\u201cI have confidence in our brew, which will make it easy to encourage GABF attendees to try it and, ultimately, cast their vote for our beer,\u201d he said."}
