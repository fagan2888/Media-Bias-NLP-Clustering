More and more organizations are assessing the need for and integrating new media into their programs to extend the reach of their work. And, many organizations are using their annual conferences to share, teach and listen for effective ways to integrate new media into their programs. Last year, we blogged about Creating Change: The National Conference on LGBT Equalityâ€™s New Media Training Institute (NMTI) where attendees had an introduction to social media and learned social media best practices.

On January 30th, 2014, the one-day training is happening again as part of the 2014 Creating Change conference. GLAAD is hosting the Institute and the topics include:

a review of the latest digital tools and online advocacy strategies,

assessing social media tools,

how to stay on top of the latest new media trends, and

how to incorporate new media strategies in your organization.

The trainers include Ryan Davis, former Social Media Director at Blue State Digital and Allison Palmer, former Vice President of Campaigns and Programs at GLAAD.

To participate in the Institute you must register for the Creating Change conference. Visit the NMTI 2014 website to learn more about the training. And, if you are unable to attend the conference, like us, we will share the information and resources from the training.
