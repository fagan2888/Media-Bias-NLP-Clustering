(Tim Berger / Staff Photographer) (Tim Berger / Staff Photographer)\n\nOne of Green\u2019s favorites this time around is billionaire Donald Trump, whose card ties into his conservative stance on immigration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a little elephant pi\u00f1ata, which really was perfect about Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a little kiddie country club outfit. I probably didn\u2019t have to try very hard on that one.\u201d\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hilary Clinton is depicted wearing Cinderella\u2019s tiara and signature glass shoes, while also wearing her trademark women\u2019s business suit.\n\nPresident Barack Obama \u2014 given the ongoing controversy over the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is shown as a young boy wearing roller skates while tending to a scraped-up knee caused by losing his balance. Green calls that one \u201cO-Band-Aids.\u201d\n\nEach playing-card parody is accompanied with a book quotation.\n\nThe first edition of Politicards came out in 1972 when the race for president was between George McGovern and Richard Nixon. Green was tasked by a client at the time with making a political chess set, but he pitched it for the simpler idea of playing cards.\n\nHe\u2019s been doing it for every national election since 1996. Green claims he never aims to push one political party over another, so he takes a nonpartisan, even-handed approach to his humor.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like to get mixed up in that kind of political in-fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather have people say, \u2018Let\u2019s go have some fun.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile he has conservative leanings nowadays, Green said he\u2019s a registered independent.\n\nHe said his sketches tend to be on the lighter side. Bart Everett, a former Los Angeles Times editor who saw Green\u2019s work when he was a freelance cartoonist, agrees.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really easy to be mean \u2026 That\u2019s not Peter\u2019s nature. That\u2019s not the way he is,\u201d said Everett, who is also a Politicard fan.\n\nAbout 200,000 decks are sold during each election cycle. While some assuredly are used for games of poker or blackjack, they\u2019ve also become a popular collectible for autograph seekers.\n\nWhen John McCain was running for president in 2008, Green said he bumped into the Arizona senator at a fundraiser.\n\n\u201c[McCain] said, \u2018You don\u2019t know how many of these I\u2019ve signed,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nConservative commentator Pat Buchanan has even used his own Politicard as a Christmas card.\n\nGreen seeks out autographs, too, by mailing his parodied subjects their respective cards. If he gets a signed one back, he keeps them in his San Fernando Road office, where he also does the original watercolor paintings of the characters before the cards are made. The overall process takes about three months.\n\nThere will be a 2020 edition of Politicards and even more down the road, Green said. The plan, as usual, will be to keep things light.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to do that as an editorial cartoonist, not having a position \u2026 I really want people being stimulated about different issues by looking at the cards and playing with them, but not necessarily walking away really pro or con for anything,\u201d he said.\n\n--\n\nArin Mikailian, arin.mikailian@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @ArinMikailian", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Cartoonist suits up for the 2016 election with new deck of political playing cards", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Glendale News Press", "author": "Glendale News Press", "og": {"site_name": "Glendale News-Press", "description": "As the 2016 presidential hopefuls began to emerge and trade barbs, Peter Green was gathering fodder for his political caricatures \u2014 all 54 of them.", "title": "Cartoonist suits up for the 2016 election with new deck of political playing cards", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/community/tn-gnp-cartoonist-suits-up-for-the-2016-election-with-new-deck-of-political-playing-cards-20151201-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-565e4fda/turbine/tn-gnp-cartoonist-suits-up-for-the-2016-election-with-new-deck-of-political-playing-cards-20151201", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@GlendaleNP", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "glendale, cartoonist, playing cards, election, 2016, political, politics, politicians, president, candidates, artist, peter green", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 291879701925}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/85202180", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-12-01", "Description": "As the 2016 presidential hopefuls began to emerge and trade barbs, Peter Green was gathering fodder for his political caricatures \u2014 all 54 of them.
