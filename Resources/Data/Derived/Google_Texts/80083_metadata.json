His season \u2014 the finest of his seven-year career \u2014 was over, with two regular season games left, and possibly a postseason.\n\nLess than 24 hours earlier, Bruton learned he had fractured the fibula in his right leg during Sunday\u2019s 34-27 loss at Pittsburgh. The injury, which he initially thought was just a bruise, didn\u2019t preclude him from playing the remaining three quarters.\n\n\u201cIt shows his passion and his love for the team and his leadership,\u201d said safety Darian Stewart. \u201cAny guy that can play with that much pain throughout the game, he\u2019s got my respect.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with Kubiak on Tuesday, Bruton fulfilled a commitment he made before he was injured: He hobbled over to the Broncos\u2019 fieldhouse, where he joined a handful of teammates to give bicycles to children of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver.\n\nBruton\u2019s on-field duties were done. But his work behind the scenes goes on.\n\nBruton, selected by the Broncos in the fourth round of the 2009 NFL draft out of Notre Dame, is the second-most tenured player on the roster. A team captain the past three seasons, he transformed himself into one of the Broncos\u2019 most vital players this season \u2014 in the defensive backfield, as well as on special teams \u2014 recording a career-best 42 tackles.\n\nBut to many within the organization and out, it has been his influence off the field that has really stood out, so much so that his teammates voted him their 2015 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year nominee and the NFL Players Association voted him the Broncos\u2019 2016 Byron \u201cWhizzer\u201d White Award winner, both acknowledgments of his humanitarian and community-service work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s David,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask David to do anything. He does everything on his own. He\u2019s a special player, a special person.\u201d\n\nChildhood literacy\n\nLast April, in partnership with Mile High United Way, Bruton launched David Bruton Foundation and Bruton\u2019s Books, designed to create childhood literacy programs and provide books to students in grades K-3 in low-income areas of Colorado.\n\nIn the months since, the program has provided more than 2,000 books to four elementary schools \u2014 Kenton and Crawford in Aurora, and Columbine and Greenlee in Denver. Thousands more books are expected to be donated in the new year.\n\n\u201cYou see so many sports figures who forget about the community,\u201d said Christine Benero, the president and CEO of Mile High United Way. \u201cThat\u2019s not across the board, but oftentimes that happens. And here you meet a man who has taken his position and really recognized how he can give kids that opportunity. He\u2019s a pretty extraordinary human being.\u201d\n\nTuesdays are labeled \u201cdays off\u201d for the Broncos, meaning there aren\u2019t any scheduled team activities. However, they\u2019re anything but for Bruton. On most Tuesdays, he\u2019s either reading at a local elementary school, attending bike giveaways or other events for children of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Denver, or serving as a spokesperson for the Western Dairy Association\u2019s \u201cFuel Up to Play 60\u201d program, which aims to educate children on nutrition and fitness.\n\nThis past year he has wedded his passions of reading and cycling, hosting a Family Fun Ride and raffling off a customized Broncos Trek bicycle autographed by his teammates to raise additional funds for childhood-literacy programs. In September, he donated $26,000 to the cause.\n\nThe results? Already evident.\n\n\u201cThere was a bike giveaway recently, and they wanted me to come help give away the bikes at one of the Boys & Girls Clubs,\u201d Bruton recalled. \u201cI believe eight or nine of those kids were from Greenlee, a school that I adopted under the Bruton\u2019s Books. They got rewarded these bikes because they had improved their reading scores. That alone, seeing that immediate impact, is definitely something that has stuck with me and continues to motivate me.\u201d\n\nThe amount raised through Bruton\u2019s work recently swelled as his foundation received a $10,000 donation from Nationwide for his Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year nomination. Also, he would receive a combined $170,000 should he win the leaguewide Payton award, its accompanying social-media challenge and the league\u2019s Whizzer award.\n\nThe potential earnings will go back into the community \u2014 toward building \u201cScholastic Reading Oases,\u201d which are designated areas within the elementary schools Bruton\u2019s Books has adopted to provide additional reading resources.\n\n\n\nThe work is personal\n\nFor Bruton, the work \u2014 be it with Bruton\u2019s Books, the Boys & Girls Clubs, \u201cFuel Up to Play 60\u201d or beyond \u2014 is personal.\n\nA bookworm with a political science degree, he served as a substitute teacher in his hometown of Miamisburg, Ohio, during the 2011 lockout. Since turning pro, he has made inroads toward getting an advanced degree to ensure he\u2019s set up when football ends.\n\nAnd, as the father of a 10-year-old boy, the message, he said, can\u2019t simply be relayed. It has to be lived.\n\n\u201cDavid, his educational background, he understands what the power of reading and the power of books is,\u201d Benero said. \u201cHe understands that it sets you on a lifetime path, so he lives that every single day. He talks about it, he thinks about it.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday, Bruton\u2019s name had been erased, temporarily, from the active roster. An \u201cX\u201d marked the spot of injury on his right leg as he began his rehabilitation and walked with crutches around the Broncos\u2019 practice facility.\n\nA new face will take his spot in the defensive backfield Monday night, when the Broncos host Cincinnati in a game that will go a long way toward determining the team\u2019s postseason fate.\n\nBut Bruton isn\u2019t leaving.\n\nOff the field, he still has work to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because I\u2019m extremely blessed and it\u2019s been instilled in me since I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for the accolades. I don\u2019t do it for the awards. I do it because I like seeing a positive change and a big difference being made.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "David Bruton\u2019s season ends early, but biggest job continues", "title": "David Bruton\u2019s season ends early, but biggest job continues", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/david-brutons-season-ends-early-but-biggest-job-continues/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__bruton4p1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__bruton4p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T19:02:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:22:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "David Bruton was summoned to coach Gary Kubiak\u2019s office Tuesday afternoon to get the news he expected but nonetheless hated to hear.\n\u201cI believe eight or nine of those kids were from Greenlee, a school that I adopted under the Bruton\u2019s Books.\nThe work is personalFor Bruton, the work \u2014 be it with Bruton\u2019s Books, the Boys & Girls Clubs, \u201cFuel Up to Play 60\u201d or beyond \u2014 is personal.\nHis season \u2014 the finest of his seven-year career \u2014 was over, with two regular season games left, and possibly a postseason.\n\u201cDavid, his educational background, he understands what the power of reading and the power of books is,\u201d Benero said."}
