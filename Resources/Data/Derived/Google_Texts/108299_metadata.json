John McCollister (R-Omaha) has proposed a bill that would expand Medicaid in Nebraska by allowing many people above the federal poverty line to purchase private health insurance using federal dollars.\n\nThe state\u2019s unicameral legislature has declined three years in a row to raise the qualifying income threshold for Medicaid, a change allowed by a provision in the Affordable Care Act. This round, the Transitional Health Insurance Program Act (LB 1032) takes a different approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a public-private partnership where Medicaid administers eligibility and funding but private insurance companies manage the risks and payments,\u201d McCollister told Health Care News.\n\nThe bill states, \u201cIt is necessary to improve the health of and health care coverage for uninsured individuals in Nebraska in a manner that utilizes the private health insurance market, emphasizes personal responsibility, leverages insurance offered by employers and private insurance companies, and strengthens Nebraska\u2019s health care system as a whole.\u201d\n\nArkansas, a Cautionary Tale\n\nSome Nebraskans read the bill differently. In his State of the State Address, Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) called Medicaid expansion \u201cone of the biggest long-term risks\u201d to Nebraska\u2019s budget.\n\nIn a weekly column for the governor\u2019s website, Ricketts added, \u201cWhile this is a new plan, it\u2019s the same story. Medicaid expansion is an expensive and an unreasonable risk to Nebraska taxpayers.\u201d\n\nRicketts then compared the proposed bill\u2019s expansion model to the one Arkansas implemented in 2014: \u201cAfter just six months, the Arkansas expansion was $137 million, or 61 percent, over budget. One of the reasons was because more people signed up than projected. State officials in Arkansas predicted a maximum of 215,000 able-bodied adults would enroll in Medicaid, but after a year and a half that number had surged to almost 300,000. After the surge, more than 40 percent of Arkansas citizens were on Medicaid, making Arkansas one of the most Medicaid-dependent states in the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, purchasing private insurance with federal dollars costs around $1,700 more per person each year than traditional Medicaid in Arkansas,\u201d wrote Ricketts.\n\n\u2018Unaffordable and Unpredictable\u2019\n\nIn another response to McCollister\u2019s plan, the Platte Institute for Economic Research examined nearby Arkansas\u2019s Medicaid expansion. In Arkansas\u2019 Failed Medicaid Experiment: Not a Model for Nebraska, Jonathan Ingram and Nicholas Horton write, \u201cThis new approach to Medicaid expansion is unaffordable and unpredictable, pushes adults out of private insurance and into taxpayer-funded welfare, puts the truly needy on the chopping block, discourages work, and shrinks the economy.\u201d\n\nMcCollister, who used to work for the Platte Institute, says the Arkansas plan Platte analyzed is outdated, and he says Arkansas is reworking its expanded Medicaid plan.\n\n\u201cWe took the best features from the new model and put it in the proposed one for Nebraska,\u201d McCollister said, although he did not specify which of Arkansas\u2019s failed features the Nebraska plan would exclude.\n\nNebraska lawmakers will decide the issue a fourth time during this year\u2019s legislative session, which ends April 20.\n\nMichael McGrady (mmcgrady@uccs.edu) writes from Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nJonathan Ingram and Nicholas Horton, Arkansas\u2019 Failed Medicaid Experiment: Not a Model for Nebraska, The Platte Institute for Economic Research, January 2016: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/arkansas-failed-medicaid-experiment-not-model-nebraska\n\nImage via Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f04\"", "article_summary": "Pete Ricketts (R) called Medicaid expansion \u201cone of the biggest long-term risks\u201d to Nebraska\u2019s budget.\nMedicaid expansion is an expensive and an unreasonable risk to Nebraska taxpayers.\u201dRicketts then compared the proposed bill\u2019s expansion model to the one Arkansas implemented in 2014: \u201cAfter just six months, the Arkansas expansion was $137 million, or 61 percent, over budget.\n\u2018Unaffordable and Unpredictable\u2019In another response to McCollister\u2019s plan, the Platte Institute for Economic Research examined nearby Arkansas\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nNebraska lawmakers will decide the issue a fourth time during this year\u2019s legislative session, which ends April 20.\nThis round, the Transitional Health Insurance Program Act (LB 1032) takes a different approach."}
