From bison to black-footed ferrets and beyond, tribes are restoring habitat and returning species that have long been part of traditional life and culture back to their original abodes.

In a recent story The New York Times has noted the efforts of the Three Affiliated Tribes, the Lakota and other Native groups to bring back animals, focusing on the young American Indians who are becoming involved in the process.

Bronc Speak Thunder is one of the people who helped bring purebred bison back to Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.

“Mr. Speak Thunder, 32, is one of a growing number of younger Native Americans who are helping to restore native animals to tribal lands across the Northern Great Plains, in the Dakotas, Montana and parts of Nebraska,” The New York Times reported on August 25.

Likewise, Robert Goodman, Oglala Lakota Sioux, moved back to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation after earning a wildlife management degree. Since then he has returned the swift fox to its traditional lands, The New York Times said, one of six habitats, four on tribal lands, that have seen the animals’ return.

“A lot of younger folks are searching, seeking out interesting experiences,” Speak Thunder told The New York Times. “I have a lot of friends who just want to ride with me some days and help out.”
