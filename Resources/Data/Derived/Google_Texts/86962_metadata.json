He also blasted Democrats as the party of \u201ccorporatism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to take those principles of limited government and a strong national defense to people who don\u2019t vote for us now. And why don\u2019t they vote for us now? Because the Democratic Party, the left press, the professors, the movies have been telling everyone conservatives don\u2019t care about working people. Conservatives only care about rich people. That\u2019s what they tell them. That\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for that, Rubio added.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton will raise more money out of Wall Street than anyone has ever raised in the history of the Republic. You know why?\u201d Rubio asked. \u201cBecause big government is good for the people who have already made it. If you are a billionaire, if you are a multi-billion dollar corporation, big government doesn\u2019t bother you. It helps you. Why do you think the big banks are bigger than they have ever been? Because they can afford the lawyers and the lobbyists to deal with Dodd-Frank and all these regulations. Who can\u2019t afford to deal with them? The regional banks, the community banks, the banks that lend money to small business, they can\u2019t deal with all this stuff. They get left behind.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in countries with government-controlled economies, most wealth is dynastic wealth, in contrast to the United States, where he said most millionaires were self-made.\n\n\u201cIt is not a coincidence that in the countries around the world where the government dominates the economy, I promise you the same families, the same names, the same companies dominated those countries for generation, after generation after generation,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s not capitalism. That\u2019s corporatism. When government dominates the economy, the people who control government win and everyone else gets left behind.\u201d\n\nSome in the crowd asserted they were solidly behind Rubio, others said they were undecided and getting a feel for the candidate.\n\n\u201cI knew from the first time I saw him that he would run for president and he is the candidate who can win,\u201d Toni Rubin, of West Ashley, South Carolina, told TheBlaze.\n\nHer husband Stephen Rubin, jumped in, too.\n\n\u201cWe used to have two yard signs, one for Rubio and one for Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter today, I\u2019m throwing my Trump sign out.\u201d\n\nRandall Gilstrap, of Summerville, isn\u2019t certain that Rubio can win South Carolina, but believes he will out-perform expectations. He said he was undecided but was leaning toward Rubio.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be a lot more support for him in South Carolina than the pundits expect,\u201d Gilstrap told TheBlaze.\n\nJust as Rubio poked fun at himself regarding the water bottle, on Tuesday, he poked fun at himself for the repeating himself in an earlier debate.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do because Barack Obama, at the risk of repeating myself,\u201d he was interrupted by laughter, \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nHe fired up the crowed, asking, \u201cWas Obamacare an accident or on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn purpose,\u201d the crowd responded.\n\n\u201cWas Dodd-Frank an accident or on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn purpose,\u201d The crowd again answered.\n\n\u201cWas the deal with Iran an accident or on purpose? \u2026 Was the stimulus an accident or on purpose?\u201d\n\nHe saved most of his ammunition for Obama and Clinton. However, he did make what was a clear reference to real estate billionaire Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his top two rivals.\n\n\u201cThis election can\u2019t be about making a point,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis election has to be about winning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "SUMMERVILLE, South Carolina \u2013 Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio picked a somewhat unusual spot Tuesday for a political rally at a picnic shelter near the Dorchester Boat Club.
