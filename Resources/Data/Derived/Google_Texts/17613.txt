Will Mitt Romney ever run for president again? Not if his wife Ann has any say in the matter.In an interview Friday onthe former Massachusetts governor described his attempt to unseat President Barack Obama last year as "a fabulous experience.""I loved it," a beaming Romney said as his wife looked on.But when the 66-year-old Republican was asked whether he might have another go at the Oval Office, Ann Romney grabbed her husband's head and shook it side to side, signifying no."We're not doing that again," the former GOP 2012 presidential nominee said with a grin.Romney said he sought the nation's highest office in a bid to get the nation "back on track.""This, for me, was not about, 'Hey, I want to be president, and have the Secret Service around, and live in that big White House,'" he said."This, for me, was about making sure that we can get the country on the right track and the question I had is, 'Am I the person most likely and most effective to get the country back on track?'"Romney also said he called New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to apologize that information about the vetting process he put Christie through during the campaign as vice presidential contender was leaked in a new book, "Double Down," by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann."I was very upset ... An individual released confidential information; it embarrassed my campaign, embarrassed me," Romney said."I told [Christie] I'm very sorry. This is not something he expected. When you provide confidential information to a presidential candidate or nominee, you expect him to be able to keep it private."Romney also addressed the controversies swirling around the Affordable Care Act."I think a lot of people recognize the flaws in the Obamacare product,'' Romney said."Not just its implementation, but the more fundamental flaw, which was the president promised people could keep their plans. That promise was not accurate, it was not honest, and the whole foundation of his second term I think is in jeopardy as a result of that."The real problem that the president has is a broken promise, is dishonesty ... They're being asked to buy policies they don't want at prices they can't afford."
