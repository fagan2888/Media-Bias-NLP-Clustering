A dozen counties were under states of emergency, and the tourist haven of Ocracoke Island was without power.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very good day. There have been no casualties or serious injuries reported,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said at a news conference in Raleigh.\n\nArthur hit with top sustained winds of 100 mph, earning a Category 2 status on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It weakened to a Category 1 as it moved northeast into colder waters of the Atlantic Ocean with 90-mph top sustained winds.\n\nPICTURES SHAKEN FROM WALLS\n\nMcCrory said North Carolina\u2019s beaches were open. Thousands of Independence Day beachgoers had left the low-lying Outer Banks ahead of the storm as it disrupted July Fourth festivities and fireworks.\n\nKathleen O\u2019Neal, owner of Island Artworks on Ocracoke Island, said she could feel her house lift up as the storm passed overhead.\n\n\u201cIt was very bad here,\u201d she said, adding that many trees had been knocked down and part of a neighbor\u2019s roof had been pulled off.\n\nThousands of tourists were wandering around looking at damage, she said\n\nHyde County officials on Ocracoke said power could be restored by late Sunday. Meanwhile, a generator on the island was supplying power on a rotating basis.\n\nState officials said ferry service to Ocracoke would resume, with residents and property owners to be let in on Saturday. Only emergency personnel were allowed on incoming ferries on Friday.\n\nMcCrory\u2019s office said Highway 12, the 50-mile road connecting Hatteras Island to the mainland, had been blocked by flooding, downed power poles and sand.\n\nThe road was expected to reopen by late Sunday.\n\nArthur is the first hurricane to hit the United States since Superstorm Sandy devastated parts of New York and New Jersey in October 2012, causing an estimated $70 billion in damage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NAGS HEAD, N.C. \u2014 A weakened Hurricane Arthur was aimed at southern New England on Friday, wielding tropical storm-force winds, after an earlier landfall in North Carolina that caused only slight damage.The summer resort areas of Nantucket and Cape Cod, popular destinations for visitors over the long Fourth of July [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "NAGS HEAD, N.C. \u2014 A weakened Hurricane Arthur was aimed at southern New England on Friday, wielding tropical storm-force winds, after an earlier landfall in North Carolina that caused only slight damage.
