A woman riding her bicycle was hit and killed by the driver of a pickup truck in Aurora on Wednesday.

Aurora police said the woman and a man were riding their bikes southbound near East Yale Avenue and South Ursula Street around 6:40 p.m. when they stopped at Yale to press a walk button.

As the bicyclists started to cross the road, police said a woman driving a Dodge pickup in the left westbound lane ran the red light and hit the woman bicyclist.

The victim, who was wearing a helmet, was taken to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. The man who was riding with her was not hit or injured.

The driver of the Dodge, who was not injured, remained at the scene and was cooperating with investigators, police said. Officers are investigating whether intoxication played a role in the crash.

Police said there was a large vehicle stopped for the red light in the right westbound lane of Yale Avenue at the time, and may have blocked the cyclistsâ€™ view of the pickup.

Sun glare may have also been a factor in the crash, police said.

No names were released.
