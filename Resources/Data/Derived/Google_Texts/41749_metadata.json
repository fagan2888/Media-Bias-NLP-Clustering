The board voted Thursday night with unanimous support.\n\nOn June 3, the education association, which has a membership of 389, ratified the contract with a \u201chealthy majority,\u201d said association President Kathleen Petrini.\n\nThe contract is retroactive to July 1, 2014, ending June 30, 2019. The agreement includes a 3.8 percent average salary increase over the five years of the contract, aligning Garnet Valley closely with surrounding districts.\n\n\u201cWe value the expertise and talents of our fine teachers and are glad we\u2019ve been able to negotiate a contract that honors the great work they do,\u201d said district Superintendent Dr. Marc Bertrando.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA starting teacher\u2019s salary will increases from $45,100 to $47,600 by fall 2019. Teachers who are at the highest point in the pay scale (16 years of service and a master\u2019s degree plus 30 credits) will see an increase from $94,400 to $100,150 by fall 2019.\n\nThe contract will be funded, in part, by taxpayer increases in alignment with Act 1 under the assumption of an index of about 1.9 percent annually. The district also anticipates revenue increases generated by new commercial development.\n\nContract terms call for teachers to have an increase in their healthcare premium, starting with an 8 percent contribution in the first year, and increasing to a 13 percent contribution by year five, as well as modifications in their prescription plan. The prescription plan changes require teachers to use CVS pharmacies and follow guidelines regarding generic drugs, allowing the district to see $850,000 in savings over the five years of the contract.\n\nThe contract also includes language that protects the district from incurring the 40 percent additional costs resulting from and Affordable Care Act provision expected to go into effect in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe contract that was ultimately reached is in alignment with the fact finder\u2019s report,\u201d said board President Rosemary Fiumara, referring to the December document that was not approved. \u201cWe used it as a basis and negotiated some modifications that worked for each side.\u201d\n\nNon-economic changes include a five-minute earlier start time of 7:25 a.m. for middle and high school teachers, which will create a short transition time before students report at 7:30 a.m. In addition, teachers will work with administrators to develop online courses and create opportunities for students to participate in cyber education.\n\nFiumara said the contract addressed important priorities of the education association and had concessions on both sides.\n\n\u201cNow we can focus on students and education. We would like to acknowledge the tremendous support from the community, many of whom came out to meeting after meeting,\u201d said Fiumara.\n\nPetrini, on behalf of her membership, said they were pleased to have reached an agreement by the end of the year. She noted the teachers were also happy to enjoy the waning days of school with the students in various activities.\n\n\u201cWe would be remiss if we didn\u2019t say this contract would not have been possible without the support of parents and Garnet Valley community, and the commitment of the school board to work together to attain a fair agreement,\u201d said Petrini.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Primos news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Garnet Valley School Board, teachers ink five-year deal", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20150604/NEWS/150609797", "image": {"width": "1364px", "identifier": "http://www.delcotimes.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DC/20150604/NEWS/150609797/AR/0/AR-150609797.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1500px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Garnet Valley School Board, teachers ink five-year deal"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "CONCORD >> The Garnet Valley School Board and Garnet Valley Education Association have approved a five-year contract after 18 months of negotiations.
