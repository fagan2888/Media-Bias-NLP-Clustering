HONOLULU — Lava from Kilauea volcano has stalled just under 500 feet from the main road in Pahoa on the Big Island.

Hawaii County Civil Defense said in a statement Saturday lava has been breaking out along the sides of the flow that has streamed down the volcano’s northeast flank since June.

Last weekend, the lava crossed a country road on the edge of the small town of about 1,000 residents. It has smothered part of a cemetery, burned a shed and some tires, toppled trees and burned grass.

Its pace has slowed in recent days but county officials say it’s still active.

The county says the burning from the lava is generating light to moderate amounts of smoke. Trade winds are pushing the smoke toward the south and southwest.
