The sheriff's office says a woman, a girl and a dog had to be rescued after they drove into a high water near Lake Tenkiller Wednesday morning.

Sheriff Ron Lockhart says the woman drove her pickup around a barricade on Cato Creek road off Highway 82 at the Cherokee-Sequoyah County line just before noon.

He says a civilian in a pontoon boat reached the truck and got all three safely to shore. No one was injured.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol says a tow truck was sent to the scene to pull the pickup out of the water.
