Port St. Joe's Chuck Gannon has been inducted into the Florida Athletic Coaches Association Hall of Fame.

Gannon was told of his induction back in June and officially received the honor Saturday.

He's been at five different schools since moving to the sunshine state in the 1980's, coming to the Sharks in 1994, where he's coached baseball, basketball, track and field, and of course, football, winning state titles in 2005 and 2014.

Gannon is currently an assistant coach on the PSJ football team, serving as the defensive coordinator of a team that recorded seven shutouts this past season, including three straight in the regional finals, state semifinals, and state championship game.
