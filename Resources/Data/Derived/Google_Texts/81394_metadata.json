Such scandals only make the larger news outlets when they involve politicians in national offices, but that doesn\u2019t mean it never happens on a local scale.\n\nConsider this report from Sacramento, Cali., where state records obtained by a local newspaper indicate that the California Senate hired what amounts to a private, 24-hour taxi service for intoxicated state officials. All of this, of course, was paid for by the California taxpayers:\n\nThe employees are paid $2,532 per month, the Sacramento Bee reported. The service comes after high-profile arrests of lawmakers on suspicion of drunken driving. Four lawmakers in the last five years have been accused of drunk driving, including three on streets around the Capitol.\n\nNo official comments were made when the paper made inquiries with the office of Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles). Meanwhile, an official spokesperson declined to comment \u201cbecause it\u2019s a security issue.\u201d\n\nAccording to a man who turned down the job and an unnamed legislative chief, the service was meant \u201cto be used in an emergency\u201d only. Whether or not this is actually the case remains unknown, as no official comments have been made about the taxi service since the investigation went public.\n\n[h/t CBS San Francisco]\n\n[Image via Shutterstock.com]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scandals involving taxpayer dollars aren't all that uncommon, but this story about a 24-hour taxi service for drunk California senators takes the cake.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_88820254.jpg", "title": "California Taxpayers Paid 24-Hour Taxi Bill for Drunk Senators"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scandals involving taxpayer dollars aren't all that uncommon, but this story about a 24-hour taxi service for drunk California senators takes the cake.", "title": "California Taxpayers Paid 24-Hour Taxi Bill for Drunk Senators", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shutterstock_88820254.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewHusband", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-06-01T13:02:09+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Whether or not this is actually the case remains unknown, as no official comments have been made about the taxi service since the investigation went public.\nAll of this, of course, was paid for by the California taxpayers:The employees are paid $2,532 per month, the Sacramento Bee reported.\nConsider this report from Sacramento, Cali., where state records obtained by a local newspaper indicate that the California Senate hired what amounts to a private, 24-hour taxi service for intoxicated state officials.\nFour lawmakers in the last five years have been accused of drunk driving, including three on streets around the Capitol.\nNo official comments were made when the paper made inquiries with the office of Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles)."}
