Bush, said: \"He will be confirmed.\"\n\nTAX EXEMPTION SCANDAL SPARKS TRUST ISSUE\n\nWith the 2014 tax filing season due to begin in late January or early February, Congress will be eager not to delay the confirmation, especially because acting commissioners have been running the IRS for the last 13 months.\n\nIt is the longest the IRS has gone without a confirmed commissioner since at least the 1950s. Koskinen would replace acting chief Danny Werfel, a White House budget official. Koskinen's term would be for five years.\n\nThe IRS came under scrutiny this year when lawmakers with ties to the conservative Tea Party movement accused the agency of unfairly subjecting conservative groups that had sought tax-exemptions to extra time-consuming scrutiny.\n\nA two-month political uproar ensued, leading to the resignation of one acting IRS commissioner, the appointment of another, embarrassment for the White House and damage to the agency's politically neutral image. The matter is still under FBI and congressional investigation.\n\nTuesday's confirmation hearing gives Republicans an opportunity to revive the scandal.\n\n\"Koskinen must explain how he will lead this agency out of its recent turmoil and regain the public's trust,\" Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee's top Republican, said in a statement.\n\nGrassley said, \"The big thing is the intimidation of the IRS. We need to make sure our IRS is non-ideological.\"\n\nTHE IRS AND OBAMACARE\n\nBoth Grassley and Hatch said Koskinen must answer questions about how he would handle the IRS's role in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\nBeginning in January 2014, a tax credit will be available to low- and middle-income individuals to help pay for health insurance.\n\nEarlier this month, the IRS's inspector general said the agency needs tighter fraud filters to prevent the tax credits from being issued erroneously.\n\nGrassley has previously raised concerns about Koskinen's campaign contributions. Koskinen has contributed about $80,000 to Democratic candidates dating back to 1989, public campaign records show, including two $2,500 donations last year to Obama.\n\nSenator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and the committee's chairman, endorsed Koskinen on Friday.\n\n\"He is the right person to take on this challenge, and with filing season approaching, the IRS needs its leader in place,\" Baucus said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Patrick Temple-West; Editing by Howard Goller and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Temple-West", "Author": "Patrick Temple-West", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "West", "title": "With IRS under fire, Obama's tax man choice faces Congress", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131209&t=2&i=818882323&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B81S1F00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, TAX, KOSKINEN", "sailthru.title": "With IRS under fire, Obama's tax man choice faces Congress", "keywords": "US,USA,TAX,KOSKINEN,Taxation,Government / Politics,United States,US Government News,Regulation,White Collar Crime / Fraud / Corporate Crime", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "description": "West", "WT.cg_n": "Politics", "DCSext.ContentID_politicsNews": "USBRE9B813M20131209", "sailthru.description": "West", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "politicsNews", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-09T23:03:14+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "politicsNews;ford;ATTCrisis;freddieMac;creditMarkets;everything;treasuryMarkets;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;echoActivityStream;HSBC_US;TDAmeritrade;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;JPMorgan;CFA;jpGambaroPeople;trending-hp;samsung;newsproHome;AmericanVoices2012;rates-rss;credit-rss;Pfizersafe;barack-obama;cfaglobal;merrilledge;aa48hours;ernstyoung;nonegative;citianniversary;HSBCGlobal;PrudentialInvestments;VanessaTest;greenpeace;MLGZero;fedex_neg;Prudential;MLedge;BNY;citgroup;Bosneg;Intel", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "With+IRS+under+fire%2C+Obama%27s+tax+man+choice+faces+Congress", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBRE9B813M20131209", "WT.cg_s": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131209&t=2&i=818882323&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B81S1F00", "news_keywords": "US;USA;TAX;KOSKINEN;Taxation;Government / Politics;United States;US Government News;Regulation;White Collar Crime / Fraud / Corporate Crime", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Patrick Temple-West", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/politics/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 2, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-politicsNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "West", "title": "With IRS under fire, Obama's tax man choice faces Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131209&t=2&i=818882323&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B81S1F00", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-koskinen-idUSBRE9B813M20131209", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "US,USA,TAX,KOSKINEN,Taxation,Government / Politics,United States,US Government News,Regulation,White Collar Crime / Fraud / Corporate Crime", "published_time": "2013-12-09T23:03:14+0000", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T23:03:14+0000", "author": "Patrick Temple-West"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Dec 09 23:03:14 UTC 2013", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131209&t=2&i=818882323&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B81S1F00"}, "article_summary": "Mark Everson, who served as IRS commissioner from 2003 to 2007 under Republican President George W.
