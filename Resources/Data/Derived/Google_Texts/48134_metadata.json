Read Part 1.\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS \u2014 Kara Bradley spent most of the past 10 years in mental health institutions in Iowa, Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nShe needed intensive treatment and supervision to control impulses to harm herself, often by swallowing objects such as pens and toothbrushes. Therapy, medication and strategies for staying busy have quelled those urges and made it possible for Bradley, 25, to live in a Marion house with three others and 24-hour staffing.\n\n\u201cWhat really turned my life around was a letter from my cousin,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cShe said, 'This is pathetic. You're better than this.'\u201d\n\nAlthough getting out of the Independence Mental Health Institute was a major milestone, Bradley knows there were times in her life she needed acute inpatient care that is difficult to find outside Iowa's four institutes. Gov. Terry Branstad plans to close two of those facilities this summer, shifting patients to institutes in Independence and Cherokee or to private programs.\n\nMental health advocates in Iowa understand the financial burden of running the facilities in Mount Pleasant and Clarinda, both of which date to the 1800s. And they agree helping people with mental illness live in the community, rather than in large institutions, is more humane and cheaper.\n\nA 1999 U.S. Supreme Court case reinforced the belief that people with mental illness have a right to live in residential environments with fewer restrictions.\n\nBut some lawmakers, advocates and families say Branstad acted too soon, without a plan for community services. They fear Iowa's most severely ill patients \u2014 some of whom are violent \u2014 won't get the care they need with fewer institutions.\n\nAnd while the federal Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act (ACA) has created budget surpluses now, mental health agencies want consistent funding.\n\n\u201cPeople don't realize how much time it takes to establish those services,\u201d said Nancy Hale, executive director of the Iowa chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nNEW FUNDING SOURCE\n\nFor years, Iowa families dealing with mental illness have been seeking a greater breadth of services. Needs include rural inpatient beds, residential programs with 24-hour staffing, day programs and work opportunities, respite care and specialized children's services.\n\nBut even with all this demand, suppliers are not lining up. Most families don't have the money to pay for mental health services on their own.\n\nAnd for the approximately one-quarter of Iowans on Medicaid, the federal reimbursement rate is so low that many providers have decided it's not worth their time.\n\nBut under the ACA, the federal government pays for mental health services for all low-income Americans, not just those with a documented disability. That freed up money counties previously were spending on psychiatrists, therapists medications and vocational services for people not on Medicaid.\n\nIowa's 15 mental health regions \u2014 charged with providing mental health care for Iowa adults \u2014 have a combined fund balances of $100 million because of the new health care law.\n\n\u201cThe onset of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid has become a resource for moving folks into residential communities and opened the doors to a lot of opportunities,\u201d said Ryanne Wood, chief executive officer of the region that serves the southeastern Iowa counties of Washington, Henry, Jefferson, Keokuk, Lee, Louisa and Van Buren.\n\nThe southeast Iowa region is developing a five-bed crisis stabilization transitional living program in Burlington to provide a short-term inpatient option that doesn't require hospitalization.\n\nThe East Central Region \u2014 which includes Linn, Johnson, Benton, Bremer, Buchanan, Delaware, Dubuque, Iowa and Jones counties \u2014 just signed a $950,000 contract with a Philadelphia-based not-for-profit to provide a residential support program for 25 mentally ill adults.\n\nResources for Human Development, which oversees 175 programs in 14 states, would help transition Eastern Iowans from mental health institutions and other congregant housing into apartments where services would be tailored to individual needs, said Stacy Olsen, its director of national business development and social innovation.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a system that works for them,\u201d Olsen said.\n\nThe not-for-profit's employees visited the Mental Health Institute at Independence, where they met with five or six adults from the region receiving treatment and talked with their counselors, Olsen said. The organization thinks it could help all but one of those people find residential care in the community.\n\nnot for everyone\n\nAdvocates worry about what may happen to severely-ill patients or those prone to violence.\n\n\u201cTwenty-five percent of our beds are occupied by people who have nowhere to go,\u201d Rep. David Heaton, R-Mount Pleasant and chairman of the Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee, said of Iowa's four institutes.\n\nAbout 90 percent of the patients at Iowa's mental health institutes are committed involuntarily, which means a court determines they are a danger to themselves or others. Employees at the Independence facility were injured by patients nearly 70 times in 2013, with half of those injuries considered assaults, The Gazette reported last year.\n\nIn some cases, mentally ill people with violent tendencies bounce back and forth between Iowa's prisons and mental health institutions.\n\nThirty Iowa hospitals offer inpatient psychiatric beds, but they are scarce and concentrated in urban areas.\n\nBradley, of Marion, has never been violent, but her bipolar disorder has been difficult to treat.\n\nIt started when she was 15 and confessed she'd been plotting to take a gun to school and shoot bullies. Her adoptive parents, Tammy and Scott, couldn't believe quiet, gentle Kara had been having these thoughts.\n\n\u201cKara was really good at hiding things,\u201d Tammy Bradley said.\n\nWhile living in an institution in Tulsa, Okla., Kara Bradley picked up the habit of swallowing foreign objects when she felt the need to harm herself, her mother said. That tendency made her hard to place once she turned 21.\n\nThe family tried residential living with 24-hour care in Des Moines, but one day Bradley tried to run out onto Interstate 35.\n\nPolice saved Bradley's life and eventually took her to a Des Moines hospital for care.\n\n\u201cI was really starting to give up,\u201d Tammy Bradley said. \u201cI didn't think we would be able to get our Kara back.\u201d\n\nBradley's swallowing of objects didn't get better until she went to the Independence Mental Health Institute. There, staff knew how to deal with the issues without granting attention that might encourage the habit, Tammy Bradley said.\n\nIn 2013, Bradley moved to the Abbe Center for Community Care Inc., 1860 County Home Rd., in Marion.\n\nWhen that center closed in September 2013, she moved into a house in Marion. The house is one of 16 shared housing sites staffed by the Penn Center, an Abbe Center affiliate.\n\nMedicaid pays for the services, while the client or region pays the rent, explained Mechelle Dhondt, chief executive officer for the East Central Region.\n\nBradley prepares meals and does chores. She recently started a job sorting clothes at Goodwill, which she can reach by bus.\n\n\u201cI'm learning new things and trying new foods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a blessing.\u201d\n\nThat may not always be the case. Although the mental health regions have cash reserves now, they don't have a consistent funding stream. In past years, counties' mental health budgets were about one-third federal, one-third state and one-third local from property taxes, Dhondt said.\n\nCiting the cash on hand for several regions, Branstad recommended no new funding this year. Lawmakers, including Heaton, are trying to figure out which regions need money so they can help just those regions.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Part 2 in a series on Iowa's treatment issues.
