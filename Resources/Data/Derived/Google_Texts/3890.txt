Speaking on Thursday at the conservative March for Marriage in Washington, D.C., Mike Huckabee said that there was “no basis in the law” that empowered judges to strike down state bans on equal marriage; the former governor of Arkansas also urged anti-LGBTQ activists to engage in mass civil disobedience to defy equal rights rulings. Huckabee then quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” to justify anti-LGBTQ discrimination.

“Nothing threatens your personal liberty more than the notion that you would bow your knee to the court system apart from the ultimate rule of the Constitution,” Huckabee told the crowd. “And all of the branches of government, all of which are not there to tell you what you cannot do, but to guarantee the freedoms that you are always empowered to have.

“We are under an obligation to obey God and the law, and if necessary, to defy an institution that is out of control,” he continued.

He then quoted King’s letter at length. Here is the excerpt Huckabee read:

“One may well ask, “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer is found in the fact that there are two types of laws: there are just laws, and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “An unjust law is no law at all.” We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was “legal” and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was “illegal.” It was “illegal” to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal.
