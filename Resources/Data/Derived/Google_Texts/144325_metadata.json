We already know it's been a violent area. We're not waiting for it to come back. We're just here now, we want a positive presence in this place,\" said McIntyre.\n\n\"We're letting the residents know that we're here for them and we just want to establish relationships. Relationship is the key to anything in life,\" said Pastor Toya Taylor from T.I. Taylor Ministries.\n\nNo arrests have been made in Jones' murder, who was shot multiple times.\n\nCrime Stoppers will pay up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 210-224-STOP.\n\nCopyright 2014 by KSAT - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/10/18/Quinton-Jones-community-event_22139_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Mariza Mendoza", "description": "Quinton Jones, 18, killed Aug. 18", "author": "Mariza Mendoza", "og": {"site_name": "KSAT", "description": "Quinton Jones, 18, killed Aug. 18", "title": "NE Side pastors unite community following teen's shooting death", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/ne-side-pastors-unite-community-following-teens-shooting-death", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/10/18/Quinton-Jones-community-event_22139_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quinton Jones, 18, killed Aug. 18", "title": "NE Side pastors unite community following teen's shooting death", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/ne-side-pastors-unite-community-following-teens-shooting-death", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/10/18/Quinton-Jones-community-event_22139_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@ksatnews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-19T02:50:42+0000", "sailthru.title": "NE Side pastors unite community following teen's shooting death", "sailthru.tags": "News,News,Local", "fb": {"app_id": 362904920453016}, "google-site-verification": "saKN_Rxj3pYzy5TY3_Llko_4hA3OUGCoya0vO4STuSc", "keywords": "News,News,Local", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2014-10-19T02:50:42+0000", "modified_time": "2014-10-19T02:50:33+0000", "author": "http://www.ksat.com/author/mzmendoza"}, "news_keywords": "NE Side pastors unite community following teen's shooting death", "content_id": 73842662, "sailthru.description": "Quinton Jones, 18, killed Aug. 18", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/10/18/Quinton-Jones-community-event_22139_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "SAN ANTONIO - It's been nearly three months since the shooting death of 18-year-old Quinton Jones, a high school senior from Roosevelt High School.\nThe shooting happened in the 4800 block of Ray Bon drive on the Northeast Side.\nMarcus McIntyre from New Method Church believes the event helps keep city streets safe.\nSince then, church members from the area have been organizing a \"Blessed the Block\" event once a month, advising people how to curb violence in their neighborhood.\n\"We're letting the residents know that we're here for them and we just want to establish relationships."}
