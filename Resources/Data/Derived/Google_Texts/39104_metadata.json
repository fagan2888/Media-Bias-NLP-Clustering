Therefore, many employers have implemented wellness programs to help combat escalating health care costs. Wellness programs have offered a beacon of hope to employers seeking to balance the cost of health insurance premiums with the provision of competitive and comprehensive health care programs to their employees. However, there are rising concerns that some wellness programs may encroach upon employee rights protected by anti-discrimination statutes.\n\nIn response to those concerns, on April 20, 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published a proposed rule that would amend its regulations and provide guidance regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to employer wellness programs. These proposed regulations provide much needed guidance to employers regarding the extent to which they may use incentives to encourage employees to participate in wellness programs and also offer guidance on the limited use of disability-related inquiries and medical examinations. The following is a summary of these proposals.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eileen Oakes Muskett", "description": "While these amendments have only been proposed, they provide critical guidance regarding the direction the federal government is headed in terms of regulating wellness programs.", "og": {"url": "http://www.insidecounsel.com/2015/06/02/time-for-a-wellness-program-check-up-new-regulatio", "image": "http://origin.media.sbmcloud.com/social-icons/social-share-ic-716x372.png", "type": "website", "description": "While these amendments have only been proposed, they provide critical guidance regarding the direction the federal government is headed in terms of regulating wellness programs.", "title": "Time for a wellness program check-up: New regulations on the horizon"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-02", "sailthru.tags": "insidecounsel, article, 556c84c9140ba07356ca0404, Counsel Commentary, Labor and Employment, L&E,labor,employment,wellness program,healthcare,health insurance,EEOC,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,confidentiality", "keywords": "Labor and Employment, labor, employment, federal government, L&E, EEOC, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, healthcare, confidentiality, health insurance, health insurance premiums, wellness program, Health insurance providers", "google-site-verification": "taA-AsTDqnL-gUE2YkrQ-AE8bLsQz3HBlhUTtFyJPas", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae54\"", "article_summary": "Health insurance providers often offer a significant reduction in health insurance premiums to employers utilizing wellness programs and incentives.\nHowever, there are rising concerns that some wellness programs may encroach upon employee rights protected by anti-discrimination statutes.\nTherefore, many employers have implemented wellness programs to help combat escalating health care costs.\nWellness programs have offered a beacon of hope to employers seeking to balance the cost of health insurance premiums with the provision of competitive and comprehensive health care programs to their employees.\nThese proposed regulations provide much needed guidance to employers regarding the extent to which they may use incentives to encourage employees to participate in wellness programs and also offer guidance on the limited use of disability-related inquiries and medical examinations."}
