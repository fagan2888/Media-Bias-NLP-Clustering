Do you think you own your home because you bought the land, built the house and paid taxes on them both?

So did 200 of your neighbors in Augusta County, until Dominion Transmission announced it will take their land for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) using eminent domain.

Some overlook this seizure—perhaps the largest confiscation in Augusta County’s history—due to our need for energy. While it’s easy to support using eminent domain for the ACP when it’s not on your land, there are reasonable alternatives to build the pipeline without eminent domain; however, if Dominion continues as planned your neighbors will be seriously exploited.

Existing easements offer one alternative. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission mandates, “The use, widening, or extension of existing rights-of-way must be considered in locating proposed facilities.” A web of existing rights-of-way covers Virginia, providing multiple routes on which Dominion could co-locate almost the entire ACP without significantly lengthening it. Dominion itself owns the most promising route. Yet, because this law has no teeth, Dominion has no incentive to avoid taking more private property.

In addition to more responsible routes, Dominion could also acquire land using more responsible methods, such as royalties instead of eminent domain. Negotiated royalties would entice willingly landowners by more fairly compensating them for their indefinite loss of rights while removing the threat of eminent domain. Because pipelines don’t need to go straight like highways, Dominion could easily route the ACP by negotiating agreements with willing landowners instead of forcing it over 2,500 helpless victims.

If Dominion paid landowners $0.00000002 per cubic foot of gas shipped, the average landowner would receive $10,950 annually ($547,500 over 50 years). Based on numbers from the American Gas Association, a royalty this large for all impacted landowners would raise the average household’s gas costs by only $2.54 annually.

Using eminent domain doesn’t change the project’s overall cost; it simply forces landowners to bear that cost for Dominion. Some contend Dominion will “take care” of landowners, but only the uninformed and unaffected have the luxury of such naiveté. Here are a handful of the abuses your neighbors will face:

•Property devaluation: Local realtors I’ve spoken with already see depressed prices and buyers cancelling contracts due to the pipeline.

•·Low-ball offers: Condemning authorities normally offer a fraction of “just compensation” outside of court.

•Taxation without rights: Owners will lose their property rights indefinitely, but still must pay property taxes on the easement.

•Utility corridor: Almost without exception, pipeline companies seek rights to install an unlimited number of pipelines on easements they take.

• “Quick take” power: Land can be taken before landowners receive payment or trial is held.

•No jury trial: While Virginia’s constitution guarantees jury trials for eminent domain cases, Dominion filing in federal courts skirts this protection, making it almost impossible to obtain “just compensation.”

•Business losses: If a farm or business loses future income the landowner will not be paid.

•Restrictions after construction: Not only will Dominion take almost all rights to land it confiscates for the easement, it will also attempt to control landowners’ remaining, surrounding property. For example:

Before any construction “in the vicinity” of the easement–as much as 100 feet on either side–landowners must obtain Dominion’s permission and pay Dominion for any studies or fieldwork it mandates.

Dominion can require landowners to purchase a $1 million liability policy, minimum, for construction on their own land.

Dominion can destroy paved driveways and “will have no responsibility for the restoration of the pavement […] or any other associated costs.”

Any road crossing built after installation will require very costly reinforced concrete slabs and other protection “at no expense to [Dominion].” This is especially important for farmers who require reinforced crossings for heavy equipment due to weight restrictions.

Big business can be just as coercive and abusive as big government. Our founding fathers built America upon the right to be secure in our property. As Samuel Adams said, “Now what liberty can there be where property is taken without consent?”

Smart and fair ways of pursuing energy development–including natural gas–do exist, but Dominion’s current route and methods are neither smart nor fair. Dominion must do what is right for all Virginian’s not just what is good for Dominion.

As a conservative myself, I daresay that subsidizing our heating bills by taking our neighbors’ land is no more legitimate than subsidizing Obamacare by taking our health insurance. Both provide for the wants of the masses by trampling on the rights of the individual.

Regarding the ACP, people have told me we all must make “small sacrifices” for the good of the country. I agree, perhaps we should all “sacrifice” one $2.54 cup of coffee next year and let our neighbors keep their land.
