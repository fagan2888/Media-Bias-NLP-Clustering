Photo: Dean Osland\n\nOrlando Burcham is 11 years old, has three mums, wants to be prime minister one day, and is something of a global phenomenon after giving Tony Abbott a piece of his mind on the subject of gay marriage.\n\nThe Prime Minister, according to the Cessnock primary school student, is wrong. Orlando wants to meet him to tell him so \u2013 boy to man.\n\n\u2018\u2018He just doesn\u2019t understand. If he\u2019s Prime Minister, he should understand,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOrlando Burcham's open letter to Tony Abbott asking the PM to reconsider his stance on gay marriage. Photo: Dean Osland\n\nOrlando\u2019s letter to Mr Abbott and the reply he received last week went viral after his mother, Cessnock councillor and Liberal branch vice-president Cordelia Troy, put them on her Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis harsh assessment of Mr Abbott\u2019s opposition to gay marriage \u2013 \u2018\u2018You were elected to represent our country, not yourself\u2019\u2019 \u2013 was lead the news item on Australian and international websites, including the prestigious US online site The Huffington Post.\n\nOrlando\u2019s challenge to Mr Abbott \u2013 \u2018\u2018Doesn\u2019t our opinions matter to you? Just because you\u2019re the Prime Minister, which by the way does not give you all the power\u2019\u2019 \u2013 became a rallying cry for Australian supporters of gay marriage.\n\nThe Prime Minister's reply to Orlando Burcham. Photo: Dean Osland\n\nAny suggestion that Orlando\u2019s mother, who flew to New York last year to marry wife Marissa, was behind the letter was scotched yesterday when Orlando calmly handled media interviews, and repeated that Mr Abbott needed to update his belief that marriage was restricted to a man and a woman.\n\n\u2018\u2018He just didn\u2019t think it through. That\u2019s what he needs to do as Prime Minister \u2013 think things through,\u2019\u2019 Orlando said.\n\nAs for Mr Abbott\u2019s famous admission in 2010 that he felt \u2018\u2018a bit threatened\u2019\u2019 by homosexuality, Orlando was dismissive.\n\nOrlando Burcham Photo: Dean Osland\n\n\u2018\u2018I think that\u2019s idiotic. How could you be threatened about it?\n\n\u2018\u2018There\u2019s no reason,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe wrote the letter six weeks ago while his twin sister, Ocean, wrote a letter to a bus company praising a bus driver.\n\nGay marriage was an important issue for him, because he was sad and angry his mother had to leave the country to wed, he said.\n\nHe wrote it \u2018\u2018because I\u2019m supporting her and encouraging her to make changes\u2019\u2019.\n\nOcean did not get a response from the bus company.\n\nHowever, Orlando received a signed letter from the Prime Minister, thanking him for his views, and noting that: \u2018\u2018Ongoing dialogue between government and citizens keeps our democracy strong.\u2019\u2019\n\nOrlando was happy for that ongoing dialogue to continue yesterday.\n\n\u2018\u2018He\u2019s an all-right Prime Minister, but I\u2019m not entirely happy with his decisions,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018His sister is gay. What kind of a brother is he?\u2019\u2019\n\nCr Troy said she was extremely proud of her \u2018\u2018beautiful son\u2019\u2019 for raising \u2018\u2018an issue that needs to be looked at\u2019\u2019.\n\nOrlando said he was happy to have three \u2018\u2018mums\u2019\u2019 \u2013 Ms Troy, her wife Marissa, and his father\u2019s wife.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s awesome,\u2019\u2019 he said, and gave a reason only an 11-year-old boy could get away with: \u2018\u2018They\u2019re very good cooks.\u2019\u2019\n\nNewcastle Herald", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "ORLANDO Burcham is 11 years old, has three mums, wants to be prime minister one day, and is something of a global phenomenon after giving Tony Abbott a piece of his mind on the subject of gay marriage.", "title": "A Newcastle boy with three mums challenges Abbott's stance on gay marriage", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/a-newcastle-boy-with-three-mums-challenges-abbotts-stance-on-gay-marriage-20140614-zs7t8.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/s/7/t/e/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zs7t8.png/1402723007221.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/s/7/t/e/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zs7t8.png/1402723007221.jpg"}, "description": "ORLANDO Burcham is 11 years old, has three mums, wants to be prime minister one day, and is something of a global phenomenon after giving Tony Abbott a piece of his mind on the subject of gay marriage.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A Newcastle boy with three mums challenges Abbott's stance on gay marriage"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "ORLANDO Burcham is 11 years old, has three mums, wants to be prime minister one day, and is something of a global phenomenon after giving Tony Abbott a piece ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafea\"", "article_summary": "Orlando Burcham,11, with his mum Cordelia Troy, wrote to Tony Abbott about his mum, who is gay, asking why the PM is against gay marriage.\nOrlando Burcham's open letter to Tony Abbott asking the PM to reconsider his stance on gay marriage.\nGay marriage was an important issue for him, because he was sad and angry his mother had to leave the country to wed, he said.\nJust because you\u2019re the Prime Minister, which by the way does not give you all the power\u2019\u2019 \u2013 became a rallying cry for Australian supporters of gay marriage.\nThe Prime Minister, according to the Cessnock primary school student, is wrong."}
