That falsehood has now been exposed many times over.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama, standing near Sen. Christopher J.

(CNS photo/Larry Downing, Reuters)\n\nPointing to the \u201cstupidity\u201d of the American voters, MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber, one of the creators of Obamacare, admitted at a videotaped conference with fellow academics in 2012 that the Obama administration went through \u201ctortured\u201d mechanisms to keep the truth about the health care legislation from the American people. Paid more than $397,000 of taxpayer money, Gruber served as primary spokesperson on the economics of the Affordable Care Act, playing the role of the earnest and disinterested professor reassuring everyone that the president\u2019s plan would provide tremendous financial benefits to all by streamlining health care delivery.\n\nHowever, this week\u2019s release of the videotaped statements from Gruber\u0097when he thought he was among fellow academics who would congratulate him on his cleverness\u0097reveal that from the beginning, Obamacare was based on lies. Claiming that keeping the facts from the American people was important, Gruber told his audience that the \u201clack of transparency is a huge political advantage\u2026basically that was really, really critical to get for the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nGruber knows\u0097as many of us knew back in 2009\u0097that the rhetoric surrounding the health care legislation was often misleading, and sometimes simply dishonest. Even the progressive PolitiFact.com awarded its \u201cLie of the Year Award\u201d for 2013 to President Obama\u2019s often repeated phrase: \u201cIf you like your health care plan you can keep it.\u201d According to PolitiFact, the \u201cyou can keep it claim has been a real hit to [Obama\u2019s] credibility.\u201d\n\nWhat is discouraging though is that Gruber is the only one who has actually publicly admitted to the \u201clack of transparency\u201d leading up to the passage of the health care law. Perhaps it is time now for the Catholic leaders who promoted the president\u2019s health care initiative\u0097replete with public funding for abortion\u0097to tell the truth also. For example, Nicholas Cafardi, dean emeritus of Duquesne University Law School and co-chair of Catholics for Obama in 2008 and again in 2012, promoted the preposterous assertion that in 2012 Barack Obama was the \u201conly true pro-life candidate for president.\u201d In an August 10, 2012 article in National Catholic Reporter, Cafardi stated, \u201cObama\u2019s Affordable Care Act does not pay for abortion.\u201d\n\nCafardi\u2019s incredible statement in 2012 was made after four years of the Obama administration\u2019s expansion of abortion here and abroad\u0097including the president\u2019s 2009 executive order overturning President Reagan\u2019s Mexico City Policy, which had banned funding for international family planning groups that provide abortion-related services overseas, as well as the HHS contraceptive mandate requiring Catholic colleges and universities such as Mr. Cafardi\u2019s own Duquesne University to provide free contraceptive care to all employees, including abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nCafardi was joined in his advocacy for the pro-abortion President Obama by Douglas Kmiec, dean of the law school at Catholic University and Pepperdine University law professor. In 2008, Kmiec published a book entitled Can a Catholic Support Him? Asking the Big Question About Barack Obama, which claimed, as did Cafardi, that Obama was the \u201creal\u201d pro-life candidate. In an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times before the 2008 election, Kmiec wrote that even though John McCain was a \u201cself-proclaimed pro-lifer,\u201d Obama was the real Catholic choice because \u201ca Catholic serious about preserving life could reasonably find Obama\u2019s educational and material assistance to mothers the practice, stronger alternative.\u201d\n\nBy 2012\u0097after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, including funding for abortion and the contraceptive mandate\u0097Kmiec continued to criticize bishops who he claimed \u201coverstated matters considerably\u201d with regard to the mandate. In an article published in the National Catholic Reporter in 2012, Kmiec countered the bishops\u2019 concerns about the contraceptive mandate, claiming that \u201cthe president has gone a good distance to make certain the Catholic Church and its auxiliaries are not the providers of contraceptive care.\u201d Kmiec also joined Gruber in the distortions surrounding the economics of Obamacare. In that same 2012 NCRpiece, Kmiec claimed that \u201cthe mandate results in more balanced risk pools and lower premiums.\u201d How could anyone who had read about the skyrocketing insurance costs have believed him? Still, Kmiec soldiers on\u0097now supporting Hilary Clinton\u2019s bid for the presidency in a September 2014 article entitled \u201cThe Indispensability of President Hillary Clinton to Marriage, Gender Equality, and Religious Freedom.\u201d\n\nBoth Cafardi and Kmiec must know that the rhetoric on abortion funding they deployed to help pass the health care legislation was misleading. A 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued earlier this year documents new public funding of abortion in the president\u2019s health care law. Despite the president\u2019s promise that under his plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortion, the GAO found that 1,036 plans do not itemize the required separate abortion surcharge on their bills\u0097ignoring the accounting scheme the president put in place to \u201cprotect\u201d taxpayers from paying for abortion. The GAO concludes that that some qualified health plans provide a \u201ccomprehensive package of health benefits\u0097including abortion services\u0097counter to what the president and his faithful helpers promised. The GAO report added that after providing a draft of its report to the HHS offices, the Obama administration responded that \u201cadditional clarification may be needed and CMS will use our findings to address issues of concern to better ensure that stakeholders understand the laws and regulations governing the provision of non-excepted abortion services coverages.\u201d\n\nFor faithful Catholics, the lie that federal dollars would not be used to fund abortion has been the greatest disappointment. Sr. Carol Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Association, contributed to the confusion when she contradicted the bishops\u2019 concerns about the legislation by saying that President Obama\u2019s health care reform drew on Catholic social teachings and was \u201can ethical necessity, a building block for the common good of the nation and the strength of its communities.\u201d Archbishop Charles Chaput responded by charging that Sr. Keehan had weakened the pro-life Catholic response and the response of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops by providing a cover for Catholic legislators and others who wished to support the law.\n\nArchbishop Chaput lamented the harm done by Catholic groups like the progressive organization Catholics United, which have \u201cdone a serious disservice to justice, to the Church, and to the ethical needs of the American people by undercutting the leadership and witness of their own bishops.\u201d Singling out the Catholic Health Association in particular, he stated, \u201cthe actions of the Catholic Health Association in providing a deliberate public counter-message to the bishops were both surprising and profoundly disappointing; and also genuinely damaging\u2026. CHA lobbyists worked directly against the efforts of the American bishops in their approach to members of Congress. The bad law we now likely face, we owe in part to the efforts of the Catholic Health Association and other similar Catholic organizations.\u201d\n\nWhether President Obama\u2019s \u201cfaithful helpers\u201d will ever acknowledge the role they played in helping to convince Catholics of the truth of the President\u2019s false promises on abortion remains to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Analysis Anne Hendershott", "description": "Will Progressive Catholics Finally Admit the Truth about Obamacare?
