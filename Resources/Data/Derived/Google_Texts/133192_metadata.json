State Democrats are, as expected, already courting the youth vote. But the GOP is hoping that, for a change, young people will provide its party with the edge it needs in 2014.\n\nATLANTA \u2014 One of the candidates at the top of the Georgia GOP\u2019s ticket this year is 71 years old. That\u2019s Gov. Nathan Deal. He faces a 38-year-old Democratic challenger, Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nAnd in the contentious U.S. Senate race, Democrat Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, has used a highly visible TV campaign ad to show off her young family as her older Republican opponents duke it out for the primary.\n\nBut many Republicans say the Democratic candidates\u2019 youth won\u2019t be as much of a factor in the midterm elections later this year. That\u2019s partly because turnout in non-presidential, off-year elections skews older.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nSo does Georgia\u2019s electorate. The state has nearly 900,000 voters aged 65 and older.\n\nJoe Pettit with the Cobb County Young Republicans group said Carter and Nunn are part of famous political families and that will help them reach voters, but only so much.\n\n\u201cThey have picked two strong candidates with obvious strong ties to Georgia\u2019s history and name [recognition],\u201d Pettit said. \u201cThe Democrats have done a good job over the last few election cycles of tapping into the youth vote and college students and young professionals. But with the right candidates coming out of the primaries, I think we will be able to energize the youth vote just as much as anyone else.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Josh McKoon, a Columbus Republican who was elected to the legislature the same year as Carter, said his colleague\u2019s youthful pedigree will only go so far. And that\u2019s because Georgia is still a red state.\n\n\u201cHe is a gifted politician, and I think he will run a very good race. [But] I think the problem that he\u2019s got is that Georgia remains a center-right state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge is trying to sell Georgians on an agenda that\u2019s out of step with their values.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans are also hopeful that the timing of the state\u2019s primary elections this year \u2013 the earliest ever \u2013 and its new online voter registration system will encourage young people to come out and vote. The primary elections take place Tuesday, and McKoon says that\u2019s early enough that many college students won\u2019t have left for summer travel or study.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp spearheaded the effort to streamline voter registration by putting it on the Web. Georgians can find all of the voting information they need at the Secretary of State\u2019s My Voter page. That should appeal to Web-savvy youth voters. And\n\nOfficials with the Democratic Party of Georgia say Carter in particular has an edge with young voters because, age-wise, he\u2019s closer to college graduates and can understand their struggles with finding employment and paying off loans.\n\nBut McKoon, who is Georgia\u2019s delegate to the Young Republican National Federation, said many young people are also facing the so-called Obamacare penalty if they choose not to buy health-care coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe people in my district, younger people, have expressed to me great concern about that, either fearing the penalty will be hitting them soon or people who are seeing higher premiums who frankly blame Obamacare for those higher premiums,\u201d he said.\n\nThat could hurt Democratic candidates, many of whom have been distancing themselves from the president.\n\nNon-presidential elections rarely galvanize younger voters, but it\u2019s not entirely clear how that will affect the gubernatorial race. Deal is doing well with younger voters, says Mark Rountree, a political strategist, whose firm, Landmark Communications, recently conducted a poll in conjunction with WSB.\n\n\u201cIn our survey, Gov. Deal was actually winning among young people, so low turnout could be a help to Sen. Carter,\u201d Rountree argued.\n\nThis post originally appeared on GPB\u2019s website on April 21.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans in Georgia are hoping to appeal to an unlikely demographic in this year\u2019s midterm election \u2014 young voters.
