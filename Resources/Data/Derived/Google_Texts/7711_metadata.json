Since this is a voluntary program, some providers who initially showed interest dropped out of the running. The program requires medical organizations to assume financial risk when contracting through these bundled payment models with CMS.\n\nTaking on risk-based contracting is expected to decrease healthcare spending and quality improvement goals are met. Value-based care reimbursement and bundled payment models are predicted to decrease medical errors, hospital admission rates, and hospital-acquired infections.\n\nHowever, many payers and providers are still struggling to adopt bundled payment models, which may be partially due to older technologies being utilized in the health insurance space, according to Ray Desrochers, Chief Marketing Officer of HealthEdge.\n\n\u201cMost of the organizations in the market, whether you like it or not, are still today using 35- or 40-year-old technology. That\u2019s how they\u2019re paying claims. That\u2019s how they\u2019re dealing with enrollment. That\u2019s how they\u2019re dealing with member services,\u201d Desrochers told HealthPayerIntelligence.com.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, they don\u2019t have anything that was built to address the needs of this new healthcare marketplace. They really have a culture that\u2019s built on the one-size-fits-all, fee-for-service models and so they have to fundamentally transform the business including claim processing and everything else they do on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the older legacy systems implemented among health payers, physicians can be penalized in a bundled payment structure when it comes to providing certain medical services they couldn\u2019t control.\n\nTo learn more about the challenges of bundled payment models and find necessary payer-provider contracting solutions, HealthPayerIntelligence.com spoke with Colin Luke, Attorney and Partner at the Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis law firm.\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What advice would you offer to health payers and providers seeking to form a bundled payment contract?\n\nColin Luke: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to align the incentives and make sure that the multiple parties to the bundled payment arrangement have equal incentive to make the arrangement work at the end of the day. Without aligned incentives, you would get short-term success for one of the parties, but long-term it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order for it to be successful, I think you\u2019ve got to have the ability to control the covered lives and to mandate or at least create incentives for using certain types of providers and for participation in the quality and health improvement initiatives.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What value-based alternatives to bundled payments are you finding providers and payers forming?\n\nColin Luke: \u201cI think they\u2019re forming some clinically-integrated networks to avoid duplication so that you\u2019re not seeing multiple tests provided on the same patient and you\u2019re seeing better coordination of primary care \u2013 particularly alternatives to emergency room care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing a growth in capitated arrangements where payers are pushing down the risk particularly where you have a specialty population, a chronic disease diagnosis, or an underserved population where you\u2019ve got to change patient behavior.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What are the biggest challenges payers and providers face when operating a bundled payment model contract?\n\nColin Luke: \u201cThe biggest challenge is probably plan design so that the patient and the multiple types of providers are all focused on the same thing. You\u2019ve got to have a level of fundamental fairness involving the patient in the decision-making. The patient needs to feel that they\u2019re not part of an overly closed network and remain confident that they\u2019re still getting quality care.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What concerns do healthcare providers have with regard to the CMS Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model?\n\nColin Luke: \u201cI think the concerns are, particularly from a hospital standpoint, that they\u2019re held accountable but don\u2019t have the control over post-acute care that the patient may be experiencing. Also, one concern is that there is much greater emphasis on the penalties than the upside.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd lastly, if the path for our health system employs the physicians and owns the post-acute care providers, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to manage the patient after discharge from the hospital. It seems to have too many punitive aspects and not enough in the way of rewards for better outcomes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bundled payment models are growing in popularity throughout the health insurance industry.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/bundled-payment-models-need-to-align-payer-provider-incentives", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Doctor_and_Patient.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Bundled Payment Models Need to Align Payer, Provider Incentives"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bundled payment models are growing in popularity throughout the health insurance industry.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Doctor_and_Patient.jpg"}, "title": "Bundled Payment Models Need to Align Payer, Provider Incentives", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The program requires medical organizations to assume financial risk when contracting through these bundled payment models with CMS.\nValue-based care reimbursement and bundled payment models are predicted to decrease medical errors, hospital admission rates, and hospital-acquired infections.\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What advice would you offer to health payers and providers seeking to form a bundled payment contract?\nCurrently, 1,500 healthcare providers are taking part in the CMS program called Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI).\nBundled payment models are growing in popularity throughout the health insurance industry partially due to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pushing forth alternative payment structures as well as the general goal of reducing healthcare spending."}
