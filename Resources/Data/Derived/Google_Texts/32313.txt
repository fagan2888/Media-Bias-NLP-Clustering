Story highlights In an unusual and lively talk, Roberts revealed his deep understanding of the court's history

Roberts discussed Charles Evans Hughes, who ran for president in between stints on the high court

New York (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts took a breather from a blockbuster docket of cases in Washington Friday night to travel to New York to discuss another chief justice from another time.

In an unusual and lively talk, Roberts revealed his deep understanding of the court's history but also his thoughts on the role of the chief justice, its limits and opportunities for leadership, and why no one on the current court will ever run for president.

The talk was sponsored by the Historical Society of the New York Courts and the subject was Charles Evans Hughes, a man who began his career in politics, served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, left for a failed bid for the presidency and then eventually returned as chief justice in 1930. Hughes guided the court through the tumultuous days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's controversial court-packing plan.
