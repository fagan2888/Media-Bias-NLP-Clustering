Senate Republicans are drafting a more than $1 billion response to the Zika virus, partially giving in to President Obama’s emergency funding request, Bloomberg reported.

The deal is being negotiated by both Democrats and Republicans, a Democratic aide told Morning Consult. Bloomberg reported the funding provision could be attached to an appropriations bill as soon as Thursday. The White House has requested $1.9 billion in additional spending.

Republicans have pushed for leftover Ebola funding to be used to respond to the Zika virus. However, the Zika threat has only grown over the past several weeks, putting more pressure on Republicans to act.

An Appropriations Committee spokesperson told Morning Consult there is no deal yet.

“We continue to work to scrub the request and assemble a responsible recommendation, but no final determination has been made,” the spokesperson said.
