The drama was innocuous and traditional but was built strongly enough that the film\u2019s effectiveness was seldom in doubt.\n\nGillespie has now followed that film up with The Finest Hours, another traditional but inspiring look at a man who overcame doubters to succeed beyond any doubt.\n\nInstead of a former sports agent serving as the lead, the main character here is Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) \u2014 a conservative member of the Coast Guard who never met a regulation he wasn't willing to follow. After falling in love with a kind-hearted woman named Miriam (Holliday Grainger), Webber plans to ask his supervisor\u2019s permission to get married in 1952. Unfortunately for him, his task is thwarted when he\u2019s asked to travel out to sea in the midst of a storm to rescue the members of a sinking oil tanker.\n\nThe SS Pendleton \u2014 a tanker located off the coast of Cape Cod \u2014 had been literally ripped in two during the storm. The crew is stranded as towering waves and a seemingly-unstoppable storm threatened their survival. Casey Affleck plays Ray Sybert, the even-keeled leader on the Pendleton who is forced to use every method he can think of to keep his boat afloat for as long as possible. With little communication coming from land, Sybert could only hope and pray that someone was trying to rescue them.\n\nOnce the situation is established, Gillespie maintains three main storylines in the drama. The camera moves from Webber\u2019s rescue attempt to Sybert\u2019s methodical mission to keep his ship afloat to Miriam\u2019s quest to find out her fiancee's status at sea. Miriam\u2019s journey \u2014 which finds her confronting her husband\u2019s supervisor (Eric Bana) \u2014 is the weakest of the three but it still provides a nice counterbalance to the dramatic ocean action sequences.\n\nLike in Million Dollar Arm, the story follows a very traditional and comforting path but does show without overcoming the viewer with sentimentality. There are few scenes showing the shipmates talking about their loved ones back home. Instead, they are completely focused on surviving.\n\nThe three men who accompanied Webber on the rescue mission are simply trying to do their jobs and when their equipment falters, they understandably question their mission (how, they ask, can they be expected to find a sinking ship without a compass or radio contact?) On the Pendleton, Sybert too faces doubters but needless arguments onboard are fortunately truncated after Sybert shows that their plans to escape on a small row boat are futile.\n\nThe screenplay written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson and adapted from the book by Casey Sherman and Michael J. Tougias could\u2019ve used a little tweaking. A side storyline about a failed mission that Webber previously participated in never offers the dramatic weight that it seemingly aimed to. Additionally, Miriam\u2019s journey doesn\u2019t work as well as it should\u2019ve, especially when it needlessly drags on a few scenes too long.\n\nThat being said, The Finest Hours is a modest and commendable achievement. Packed with great special effects and featuring two great subtle turns from Chris Pine and Casey Affleck, the drama captures the frustrations and pains of both the crew members of the Pendleton and the heroic rescue team that went in to save them.\n\nAs the text notes at the end of the film, this rescue remains the greatest small boat rescue in the history of the Coast Guard. The rescue is made even more impressive when you realize how many obstacles and situations these men had to face in their attempt to survive this deadly storm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2014, director Craig Gillespie turned an inspiring story about a sports agent coaching young athletes from India into great entertainment with his film Million Dollar Arm.
