During the campaign, he expressed a goal of ending gridlock and finding bipartisan solutions. The son of public school teachers, he said he favors fixing Obamacare rather than repealing it, while blaming Obamacare for rampant part-time jobs and underemployment.\n\nTrivedi, 40, of Birdsboro in Berks County, is a former military surgeon who served in Iraq and who now works as a health care consultant and part-time doctor at Pottstown Memorial Medical Center. He said his medical background made him suited to deal with health care issues, including fine-tuning Obamacare and Medicare.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, the national Democratic Congressional Committee reportedly opted not to pump money into the race in order to spend more on vulnerable Democrats around the country.\n\nTrivedi had run against Gerlach in 2010 and 2012. The district leans Republican, with 202,075 registered Republicans, 182,201 registered Democrats and about 79,000 people list themselves as some other affiliation.\n\nThe district also includes parts of Berks, Chester and Montgomery counties.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "elections,elections-2014,Manan-Trivedi,Ryan-Costello,us-house", "title": "Ryan Costello, Manan Trivedi: Results are in from 6th Congressional District in Lebanon County", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \" Ryan Costello, Manan Trivedi: Results are in from 6th Congressional District in Lebanon County \", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/11/costello_trivedi_pennsylvania.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/6th-mmmainjpg-fdddd1dad78fa6ea.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14402185\", \"pub_date\": \"\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@papolitics\",\"@topstories\",\"elections\",\"elections-2014\",\"Manan-Trivedi\",\"Ryan-Costello\",\"us-house\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@pennlive", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/16262556-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "During the campaign, Costello expressed a goal of ending gridlock and finding bipartisan solutions.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DavidRWenner"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, November 04, 2014, 10:34 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/6th-mmmainjpg-fdddd1dad78fa6ea.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "During the campaign, Costello expressed a goal of ending gridlock and finding bipartisan solutions.", "title": "Ryan Costello, Manan Trivedi: Results are in from 6th Congressional District in Lebanon County", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/11/costello_trivedi_pennsylvania.html", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_penn.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, November 04, 2014, 10:34 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "During the campaign, Costello expressed a goal of ending gridlock and finding bipartisan solutions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb3c\"", "article_summary": "Republican Ryan Costello, a county commissioner, bested physician Manan Trivedi in the race for the U.S. House seat representing the district that begins in eastern Lebanon County, according to unofficial results from The Associated Press.\nThe district leans Republican, with 202,075 registered Republicans, 182,201 registered Democrats and about 79,000 people list themselves as some other affiliation.\nAP called the race for the 6th Congressional District in Costello's favor around 10 p.m.\nAccording to the latest unofficial results available from the state as of shortly after 10 p.m. with 71 percent of votes counted, Costello had 80,460 votes, or 57 percent, to Trivedi's 61,317, or 43 percent.\nCostello, 38, a lawyer by profession, is chairman of the Chester County commissioners."}
