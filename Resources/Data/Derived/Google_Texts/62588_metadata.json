Across the country, as millions of baby boomers hit retirement age, they are beginning to feel the strain of paying for health care. A full 10,000 Americans have turned 65 every single day since 2011, and will continue to do so until 2030\u2014a trend that is dramatically altering the demographic landscape of the United States.\n\n\u201cThere's an important role for government to play,\u201d says Kevin Simowitz, the political director for Caring Across Generations, a national organization that aims to help people age with dignity and independence. \u201cMost people simply don\u2019t have the individual means to pay for the care they need.\u201d\n\nThese population trends have been particularly marked in Hawaii. While the number of seniors aged 75 and older increased by 47 percent nationally between 1990 and 2012, Hawaii saw a 116 percent increase in that age cohort during this same period.\n\nA coalition of retiree groups, labor unions, and religious organizations in Hawaii has been leading the public campaign for Hawaii\u2019s new health care program.\n\n\u201cI think if we have enough push from the public we can make it happen because the will of the people, I would hope, will supersede all potential barriers,\u201d says Clementina Ceria-Ulep, the chair of the Nursing Department at University of Hawaii at Manoa, and a leader with Faith Action for Community Equity, a faith-based community organization.\n\nAloha State residents boast a distinct cultural tradition of caring for and cherishing their \u201ckupuna\u201d\u2014a Hawaiian word that refers to the elderly. Indeed, Hawaiian leaders have been reckoning with the challenges of elderly care for far longer than most states on the U.S. mainland.\n\nNow, after decades of debates, state audits, and legislative campaigns, Hawaii residents and lawmakers say the time is right for action on the proposed universal care benefit. Supporters of the bill argue that it would not only help ease the financial burden on families caring for seniors, but also create more high-quality home care jobs for the mostly women and immigrant workers who tend to shoulder these responsibilities.\n\n\u201cHawaii has a tradition of being at the forefront of health care policy,\u201d says Simowitz, of Caring Across Generations. \u201cLong before the Affordable Care Act, Hawaiians had a plan to make sure that workers had quality affordable health care. This would not be the first time they\u2019ve done something a little bit provocative and groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nSimowitz says that the idea of a universal long-term care program could spread to other states, in the same way that grassroots movements to promote paid sick leave and increase the minimum wage have taken off.\n\n\u201cIt is a breakthrough to have legislators move this conversation from kitchen tables in peoples\u2019 houses to conference tables at the legislature,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need this to be a public policy conversation.\u201d\n\nHawaii\u2019s program would work like this: Every person who files a Hawaii state income tax for ten years would be eligible to receive $70 a day, for a total of 365 days. The benefit would be underwritten by a slight increase in the state\u2019s General Excise Tax, a tax on all businesses\u2019 gross income. Hawaii\u2019s thriving tourist industry would help boost the fund. That\u2019s because tourists, who also pay the General Excise Tax, would fund roughly 35 percent of the long-term care program but would never claim the benefit themselves.\n\n\u201cOur target was to look at what it would cost to help someone get four hours of home or community care,\u201d explains Dr. Lawrence Nitz, a political science professor at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa, who conducted research on long-term care financing for the state. \u201cSeventy dollars means you could plan to go to work, you could take time to meet your child\u2019s teacher. It\u2019s enough to help people avoid losing their jobs, while still balancing care responsibilities.\u201d\n\nMost people need some form of long-term care as they get older. Long-term care refers to assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating, using the toilet, and getting dressed. It also includes help with tasks like shopping, cooking, and cleaning. Despite a common misconception, Medicare does not cover the cost of long-term care services, meaning that the majority of Americans must pay out of pocket.\n\nHawaii\u2019s proposed social insurance program would not cover the cost of nursing homes or assisted living facilities, which can easily reach $100,000 per year. However, it would offer more money and flexibility to families that are already providing long-term care.\n\nIn 2011, the AARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute found that the average caregiver is a 49-year-old woman who works outside the home and spends nearly 20 hours per week providing unpaid care to a parent over nearly five years. The report found that two-thirds of family caregivers are women, and that the total economic value for all this unpaid work was an estimated $450 billion annually.\n\nHawaii State Senator Roslyn Baker plans to introduce the long-term care bill in the upcoming legislative session. It\u2019s not the first time that Baker, who has been active in elderly care issues since the 1990s, has introduced long term care legislation. But now, due to growing political support and a string of research studies supporting the program\u2019s the feasibility, Baker predicts that the bill has a good chance of passing.\n\n\u201cWe think the timing is right, even though it\u2019s an election year,\u201d Baker told The American Prospect. \u201cWe're going to work to help people understand exactly what the funding mechanism is, how small a tax burden it is, and just how it will help lots and lots of people afford the care they need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "Hawaii legislators are mulling an innovative new health plan that would offer universal long term care to the state's senior citizens, potentially serving as a national model.", "title": "Hawaii Long-Term Health Care Bill Serves as National Model", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/hawaii-long-term-health-care-bill-serves-national-model", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/long_term_care_1.jpg?itok=Qmu-MRTC", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "Hawaii State Senator Roslyn Baker plans to introduce the long-term care bill in the upcoming legislative session.\nLong-term care refers to assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating, using the toilet, and getting dressed.\n\u201cLong before the Affordable Care Act, Hawaiians had a plan to make sure that workers had quality affordable health care.\nHowever, it would offer more money and flexibility to families that are already providing long-term care.\nAcross the country, as millions of baby boomers hit retirement age, they are beginning to feel the strain of paying for health care."}
