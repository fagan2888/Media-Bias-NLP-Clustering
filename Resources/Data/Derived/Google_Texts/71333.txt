Chicago-based Huron Consulting Group on Tuesday said it will buy Studer Group for $325 million in a move that will create one of the largest healthcare consulting groups in the field.

The combined organizations will staff more than 1,500 healthcare professionals and will generate more than $904 million in annual revenue.

The deal, which is slated to close in February, will merge Studer with Huron Healthcare, a division of Huron.

Pensacola, Florida-based Studer Group, founded in 2000, serves more than 750 hospitals.

The acquisition will combine Huron’s performance improvement and clinical transformation capabilities with Studer Group’s evidence-based leadership framework, the companies announced.

"Our experience working with hospitals and health systems indicates that the key to success is combining a deep focus on operational excellence while optimizing human potential to provide the leadership needed for transformation," said Gordon Mountford, executive vice president of Huron, in a statement.
