His challenger in the Republican primary is Art Macomber.\n\nOkuniewicz said his PAC, Committee for Principled Government, is targeting Malek primarily because he works as an attorney for the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, which was responsible for introducing legislation to ban historic racing machines in the 2015 legislative session. Malek told The Press he is not employed with The Tribe, but in the past, his firm has done some work for some of the Tribe\u2019s holdings.\n\nIn 2013 the Idaho Legislature passed a law legalizing \u201chistoric racing machines\u201d that played old horse racing videos on which gamblers could bet. Lawmakers said they were led to believe, at the time, that the betting would be on a pari-mutuel platform, which is legal under state law.\n\nLast year, however, the Legislature learned the machines actually resembled video slot machines \u2014 which are specifically illegal in state law \u2014 and some lawmakers questioned whether the betting was in fact pari-mutuel. After weeks of political wrangling, and a botched veto attempt by Gov. Butch Otter, the Legislature successfully repealed the 2013 authorization bill that allowed the machines in the first place.\n\nThe ban forced Okuniewicz to retire 35 of those machines and forced Les Bois Race Track near Boise out of business. Les Bois had invested far more money into the historic racing machines.\n\nWhile that issue does have something to do with Okuniewicz\u2019s desire to unseat Malek, he said the PAC has a number of reasons to go after the two-term legislator.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we never get a fair shake with Malek,\u201d he said.\n\nMalek said, in an interview Friday, that he could only recall the one issue that Okuniewicz has brought before the Legislature, and that was historic horse racing, which was later dubbed instant racing.\n\n\u201cFrankly, it was his dishonesty that got the instant racing before the Legislature in the first place,\u201d Malek said. \u201cI don't know if he thinks copying Wayne Hoffman (with the Idaho Freedom Foundation) is the right approach.\u201d\n\nCoeur d\u2019Alene Racing, which owns the Greyhound Park, also donated $3,500 to Hoffman\u2019s other Idaho Freedom Action nonprofit. Idaho Freedom Action is also targeting Malek for supporting the state insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOkuniewicz\u2019s first mailer followed a similar attack by the Idaho Freedom Association a week earlier and used the same issue to attack Malek for the \u201cUnaffordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis flier said I brought the Affordable Care Act to Idaho,\u201d Malek said. \u201cAnd that is a lie that has nothing to do with the horse racing issue he brought down to Boise.\u201d\n\nMalek said despite the fact he believes the horse racing issue was brought before the Legislature dishonestly, he worked very hard to find a solution that would not have banned the machines at the Greyhound Park.\n\n\u201cWell, if he is going to continue to attack me, I hope he chooses tactics that are equally as ineffective as the first one,\u201d Malek said.\n\nWhen asked if he planned to bring the instant horse racing issue up again in the next legislative session, Okuniewicz said at this point he is just trying to keep the Greyhound Park up and running.\n\n\u201cRight now we are focused on today,\u201d Okuniewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about tomorrow when it gets here.\u201d\n\nCoeur d\u2019Alene Racing also spent more than $40,000 supporting a slate of candidates in the 2014 election cycle with a PAC called Winning For Idaho, which Okuniewicz said is a horse racing industry PAC that was created to donate to candidates.\n\nHe still supports that PAC, but he is not as involved in the decision-making for that PAC as he once was.", "article_metadata": {"description": "COEUR d\u2019ALENE \u2014 The manager of the Greyhound Park and Event Center in Post Falls has formed a new political action committee that is specifically targeting one Republican legislative candidate in the May 17 primary.", "og": {"site_name": "Coeur d'Alene Press", "description": "COEUR d\u2019ALENE \u2014 The manager of the Greyhound Park and Event Center in Post Falls has formed a new political action committee that is specifically targeting one Republican legislative candidate in the May 17 primary.", "title": "New PAC targets Malek", "url": "http://cdapress.com/news/local_news/article_ffc84555-3ed6-53f4-b8e9-1c549b206b21.html", "image": "http://cdapress.com/app/CDAPress_200x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 145597345537708}, "keywords": "local_news", "news_keywords": "local_news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02fd\"", "article_summary": "In 2013 the Idaho Legislature passed a law legalizing \u201chistoric racing machines\u201d that played old horse racing videos on which gamblers could bet.\nLes Bois had invested far more money into the historic racing machines.\n\u201cMost of that money is directed at Luke Malek.\u201dMalek, R-Coeur d\u2019Alene, is running for re-election for Seat 4A in the Idaho House of Representatives.\nOkuniewicz said his PAC, Committee for Principled Government, is targeting Malek primarily because he works as an attorney for the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, which was responsible for introducing legislation to ban historic racing machines in the 2015 legislative session.\n\u201cI don't know if he thinks copying Wayne Hoffman (with the Idaho Freedom Foundation) is the right approach.\u201dCoeur d\u2019Alene Racing, which owns the Greyhound Park, also donated $3,500 to Hoffman\u2019s other Idaho Freedom Action nonprofit."}
