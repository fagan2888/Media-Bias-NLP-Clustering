WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration says about 1 million Americans signed up for private insurance under the health care law in January.

That extends a turnaround from early days when a dysfunctional website frustrated consumers.

Numbers released Wednesday show nearly 3.3 million people signed up from Oct. 1 through Feb. 1.

Enrollment is gaining ground, but the government’s initial target of 7 million by the end of March still seems like a stretch.

Officials aren’t able to say how many of those who’ve signed up were previously uninsured — the law’s ultimate test.
