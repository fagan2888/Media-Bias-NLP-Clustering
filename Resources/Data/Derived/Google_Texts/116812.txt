Veteran Republican political consultant Mary Matalin is keeping her fingers crossed that Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016 — because she'll be soundly defeated."Everyone's so obsessed with Hillary running in 2016," Matalin told "The Steve Malzberg Show" on Newsmax TV."I hope she does — because we'll beat her soundly!''One reason is that Americans want to return to a "normal'' way of life and get away from the failed liberal policies of the Democrats, Matalin said Wednesday.."They want to get back to the old normal. The new normal of 16 percent effective unemployment and the greatest number of people dropping out of the workforce in our history, and college graduates not having any career opportunities, that's not the country we grew up in,'' she said.Matalin, who was campaign director for George H.W. Bush and an assistant to George W. Bush, is not impressed by President Barack Obama's professed fury over the Veterans Administration scandal, in which secret waiting lists may have caused the deaths of 40 ex-soldiers."Why would we believe any of his anger? I mean, this is what he says about everything, the wrongdoers will be prosecuted or punished, and it never happens," Matalin said."In this case the White House specifically compared it to 'This is real,' unlike the IRS [tea-party targeting scandal].''She said the VA's overburdened system shows what the Affordable Care Act is bound to become with "incentivized rationing.""They have these secret lists and they have delays and cover-up of the secret lists because [being] untreated is a death warrant in these cases," Matalin said. "It's a product of rationed healthcare, which is irrational.''Matalin says the results of Tuesday's Republican primaries — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's victory over tea party challenger Mark Bevin in Kentucky — indicates tea-party principles have infiltrated the GOP mainstream, and visa versa."Let's do a little thought exercise. Are the so-called establishment candidates running on the tea party message or were the tea party candidates running on the so-called establishment message?'' Matalin said."Whatever the electoral outcome, the philosophical outcome clearly, clearly demonstrates that the tea party message dominates, and now all of these candidates who are so-called establishment have won, they have won on tea party principles.''
