Even retirees whose medical issues dictate that they choose more extensive plans will only pay a modest amount more than what they pay now, she said.\n\nBut only time will tell if that\u2019s so, said Thomas Lauth, president of the University of Georgia Retirees Association.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the argument. I hope that\u2019s true. Logically, I understand it. But the proof is in the pudding,\u201d said Lauth, the retired dean of UGA\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs.\n\nUnder the plan the Regents adopted Wednesday, the University System of Georgia, which includes UGA, will do away with its own self-funded health insurance plan for retirees. Instead, the system will deposit $2,736 next year into a \u201cHealth Reimbursement Account\u201d which retirees can use to buy Medicare co-insurance or pay for other medical expenses, including dental costs. Medicare covers 80 percent of most medical costs; coinsurance helps retirees pay for the rest.\n\nThe new system goes into effect Jan. 1; retirees will have three months in which to choose a co-insurance policy from Aon Hewitt\u2019s retiree health exchange. The Aon Hewitt exchange is not related to the exchanges created in the federal Affordable Care Act, Fedrick said.\n\nAccording to a presentation Fedrick made to Regents at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the University System will avoid $6.8 million in additional retiree healthcare costs next year.\n\nInstead, the University System will budget $43.3 million for retiree health care costs next year \u2014 the same as this year.\n\nRetirees won\u2019t have to sift through literally hundreds of available plans on their own before making a choice in a three-month sign-up period that begins Oct. 1.\n\nWithout the change, retiree health expenses would increase to a projected $50.1 million in 2016, $54.5 million in 2017 and $58.9 million in 2018, according to Fedrick\u2019s presentation to the Board of Regents.\n\nIn telephone consultations, Aon Hewitt representatives will help narrow the choices, based on medical conditions, financial considerations and pharmacy needs, Fedrick said.\n\nIn addition, human resources professionals at University System colleges and universities are getting training in how to help, beginning today, Fedrick said.\n\nUGA is going a step further than many state colleges and universities, and will hire additional workers to meet with retirees and help them choose.\n\nRepresentatives of the University System and of Aon Hewitt will be in Athens for public meetings next Tuesday and Wednesday to explain the changes and talk about what\u2019s coming up in the sign-up period.\n\nThe meetings will be held in the theater of Athens\u2019 Classic Center at 300 North Thomas Street from 10 a.m.-noon and 2-4 p.m. on Tuesday, and 9-11 a.m. on Wednesday. University System officials underestimated attendance in April meetings they set up in the Georgia Center for Continuing Education to talk about the upcoming changes, and many retirees couldn\u2019t get in to listen and ask questions. The Classic Center Theatre is a much larger space than the Georgia Center meeting room.\n\nAccording to Lauth\u2019s calculations, retirees and their spouses will get slightly less subsidy next year than under the University System\u2019s self-insurance plan, in which the University System pays about 70 percent of the total cost of retiree co-insurance and the retiree or spouse about 30 percent. The University System is betting the move will work out to retirees\u2019 benefit, however, because of lower overall costs.\n\n\u201cThis is not unexpected or surprising to me because (1) this change in the way retiree health insurance benefits are provided is fundamentally about cost control, and (2) USG experts are assuming that with the expanded risk pool that comes with the change from the USG self-insurance approach to a private market insurance approach, insurance costs will be less for comparable coverage, Only time will tell if this assumption is correct,\u201d Lauth wrote in an email.\n\nCost containment became necessary because health care costs continue to rise, and because the financial contribution of state government \u2014 the governor and General Assembly \u2014 is providing higher education a declining share of state of state appropriations, Lauth said.\n\nThe Board of Regents approved the change in but most retirees didn\u2019t learn about it until this spring, which contributed to a lot of anxiety and uncertainty, Lauth said.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to move beyond that and make the transition as smoothly as possible, he said.\n\n\u201cI think the shift in the method of providing (retiree health insurance) is financially reasonable. The way in which it was rolled out was not very well done. But I think that is behind us. What\u2019s important is that retirees don\u2019t get hurt in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope we can get it done in three months.\u201d\n\nFollow education reporter Lee Shearer at www.facebook.com/LeeShearerABH or https://twitter.com/LeeShearer.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Lee Shearer", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "The state Board of Regents has approved a plan to switch University System of Georgia retirees over to private plans for Medicare co-insurance.", "title": "Regents approve plan to give retirees cash to buy own health insurance", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2015-08-12/regents-approve-plan-give-retirees-cash-buy-own-health-insurance", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/14637425.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "Under the plan the Regents adopted Wednesday, the University System of Georgia, which includes UGA, will do away with its own self-funded health insurance plan for retirees.\n\u201cI think the shift in the method of providing (retiree health insurance) is financially reasonable.\nThe state Board of Regents has approved a plan to switch University System of Georgia retirees over to private plans for Medicare co-insurance.\nInstead, the University System will budget $43.3 million for retiree health care costs next year \u2014 the same as this year.\nThe new system could actually save money for most retirees, according to Marion Fedrick, the University System of Georgia\u2019s Vice Chancellor for Human Resources."}
