There was a knock on the door and in they came with a stocking and she just explained that she was with a group of volunteers and during a certain time of the Christmas season they give these out to families. It was a nice gesture,\" new parent Paul Clifton said.\n\n\"That tradition has been going strong for lots of years here at Sanford. Each month a group of women get together and they sew Christmas stockings,\" Sanford Director of Volunteer Services Nona Bixler said.\n\nVolunteers make a handmade Christmas stocking new parents can take their babies home in.\n\n\"It's neat that they take their time to do this and give a special gift to families and to babies during this time of the year, it's nice,\" Clifton said.\n\nArnold has been sewing stockings for seven years now.\n\n\"It's something we've worked on all year and this is just the ice cream and cake of it,\" Arnold said.\n\nOnly parents who have babies the week before Christmas and the week after Christmas get the stockings. But it's a gift many hang on to for years.\n\n\"We have an employee that works here and she told me today that she hangs her stocking right by the fire place every year. I won't tell her age. People are proud of that even into their adult years,\" Bixler said.\n\nClifton says this gift is a memento they hope to pull out for many more Christmases.\n\n\"I think we'll keep it. It is a keepsake of the time and of her birth and on the inside it says, 'made by the volunteers at Sanford.' It has meaning to it,\" Clifton said.\n\nThe group is always looking for new recruits.
