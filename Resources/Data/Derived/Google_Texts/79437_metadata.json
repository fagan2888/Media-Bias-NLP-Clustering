I mean, it's important that people get health insurance, that's a really big deal, but one of the problems that we had in the market before we had the Affordable Care Act was that people felt tied to their jobs. Most people pre-Medicare age get insurance through their employer, so what that means is that, particularly if they are in bad health ... they are very worried that if they leave their job or if they lose their job, they're going to lose insurance for themselves and/or their family. Well, now that you can get insurance through the exchanges we see there's a big increase in voluntary part-time employment. ... These are people who choose to work part-time. It's particularly [apparent] among young parents and what we also see among people pre-Medicare age. ... To me, that is a great story, so they can spend time with their families, their kids.\"\n\nEconomist Dean Baker has noticed something about Obamacare and jobs that is pretty significant: it's giving people who want the flexibility to work part time the opportunity to do so . The growth in part-time employment has been a persistent and troubling aspect of the economic recovering from the great recession. But Baker says it doesn't have to be so troubling.The largest increases in people choosing to work part-time are among younger people with children, a 10.2 percentage point increase in the share of workers under 35 who have 1 or 2 kids and a 15.4 percent increase for those younger workers with three of more kids. Factored into this has to be the high cost of child care\u2014parents might still feel that they don't have much choice about one of them working part-time because they can't afford day care. At the same time though, now they have that option because they can get health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Economist Dean Baker has noticed something about ...", "title": "More good jobs and economy news from Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/8/10/1410589/-More-good-jobs-and-economy-news-from-nbsp-Obamacare", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/80597/story_image/RTR3JDM0.jpg?1398707095", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Economist Dean Baker has noticed something about Obamacare and jobs that is pretty significant: it's giving people who want the flexibility to work part time the opportunity to do so.
