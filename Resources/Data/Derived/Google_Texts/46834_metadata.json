Rand Paul ending his presidential bid Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz has moved in on his libertarian supporters.\n\nPaul finished fifth in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucus, with 4.5 percent of the Republican vote. He campaign had $5.63 million cash on hand.\n\n\u201cHe and I have been side by side in a great many fights in the U.S. Senate, standing for liberty,\u201d Cruz told reporters in New Hampshire Thursday. \u201cThey worked very, very hard.\u201d\n\nCruz was already courting libertarians, calling himself the heir to the legacy and supporters of Paul\u2019s father, three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul. At the Jan. 28 GOP debate Paul rejected the claim.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go for Ted,\u201d Paul said.\n\nCruz has already picked up support from several Paul backers in Texas. State Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, endorsed Cruz Wednesday. Huffines was Paul\u2019s Texas chairman and a major Texas booster for the campaign.\n\nHuffines said he was \u201cthrilled by the momentum Senator Cruz is gaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cTed Cruz will secure the border and fight daily to restore liberty and freedom, which is what our nation needs most at this critical juncture in our history,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nState Rep. Johnathan Stickland, R-Bedford, also threw his support behind Cruz Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz has championed liberty in the U.S. Senate and I\u2019m proud to endorse him to be the next president of the United States,\u201d Stickland said in a statement to The Texas Tribune. \u201cWe need a principled conservative leader to stand up against the Washington cartel and Ted Cruz is that man.\u201d\n\nRepublican megadonor Scott Banister, a Silicon Valley heavy weight, plegded his support to Cruz. Bannister, a major backer of pro-Paul super PACs, has not donated to PACs supporting Cruz.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve interviewed Ted, and while we don\u2019t agree on every issue, I believe he\u2019s one of us,\u201d Banister told CNN. \u201cLibertarians will discover that.\u201d\n\nCruz has already shifted the focus of his message in advance of the New Hampshire primary Feb. 9 from evangelicals to libertarians. Paul\u2019s exit will be an added boost.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason we are more competitive in New Hampshire than the typical conservative is, we\u2019ve got enough support on the libertarian side that it backfills,\u201d Cruz told reporters Tuesday, before Paul\u2019s announcement. \u201cThat\u2019s fairly unusual.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s New Hampshire staff immediately increased their efforts to court libertarians, although recent polls show only 2.7 percent of New Hampshire voters support Paul. Donald Trump has a major lead in New Hampshire with the support of 32.8 percent of voters, followed by Sen. Marco Rubio at 11.8 percent. Cruz is currently polling in third place at 11.3 percent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an openness to moving over Sen. Cruz. I think they recognize that if they\u2019re looking for a constitutional conservative, there\u2019s one remaining in the race,\u201d Bill O\u2019Brien, Cruz\u2019s New Hampshire co-chairman told Politico.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMi93aXRoLXJhbmQtcGF1bC1vdXQtb2YtdGhlLXJhY2UtdGVkLWNydXotemVyb3MtaW4tb24tbGliZXJ0YXJpYW5zLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christine Ayala", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2013 With Sen.
