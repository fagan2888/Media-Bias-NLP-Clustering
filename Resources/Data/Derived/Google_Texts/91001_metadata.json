Miriam uses the Autism Center as a resource center to ask questions about Jackson\u2019s symptoms and behavior.\n\nSince then, Jackson adjusted to being mainstreamed into public school.\n\n\u201cJackson is doing wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has been the best thing for him, to be in a classroom with typical peers. He has a wonderful teacher and a full-time aide.\u201d\n\nAll blue\n\nEmilee Kennedy, fundraising coordinator with the Autism Center, helped organize the event, which included a burger meal hosted by Parks and Recreation, face painting and a bracelet shop hosted by Public Works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had well over 200 people here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt cost $20 to pre-register and $30 to register today. Most of our funds go straight to the grants and scholarships we do for the therapy for the kids.\u201d\n\nTo continue autism awareness in April, local restaurants and the city have planned events to raise funds.\n\n\u201cThey have the buildings lit up in blue for the month of April at City Hall,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe have several restaurants that are going to do a Spirit Night where they donate a portion of their proceeds to the Autism Center.\u201d\n\nShe said the run lets people become more aware about autism.\n\n\u201cWe would love to get to a place where people know exactly what autism is and how to respond to it and how to help out,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe want to continue providing resources for families that have children with autism.\u201d\n\nMore sensory-friendly\n\nWhen Susan Hill, director of Bridge the Gap and volunteer at the Autism Center, found out her three children all had autism, she had to scour the Internet for information.\n\nLocally, not much awareness for autism was being done.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear much about it. You could see some help in public schools, but my son was diagnosed before school age,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt was difficult. Seeing this growing in awareness, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nHill appreciates that April is Autism Awareness Month, but for those families that \u201cdeal with it,\u201d she wants to see a culture of acceptance.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to be aware, she said, but people need to learn what autism is about.\n\n\u201cI know that April is just a month, but for people that don\u2019t deal with it, it kind of steps them into it in a general way,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThen, down the road, if the come across someone with autism, they are like, \u2018I know what this is,\u2019 and they don\u2019t feel clueless or uninformed.\n\nAs the director of Bridge the Gap, Hill promotes autism through a parent-led team of professions, both in education and experience, that seek to educate, equip and empower the community to become sensory-friendly, which means creating a calmer environment for children with autism.\n\nCurrently, Hill attends school for social work to help the community raise awareness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a mom with three kids with autism, so I have some experience with it, and I need a little education to back it up,\u201d she said. \u201cWith our support group, we try do sensory-friendly movies, and we create community events that sort of fills the gap that the Autism Center doesn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s main goal is to help other parents receive the services they need and show what the Autism Center can do.\n\n\u201cWe hope businesses can get on board and kind of learn how to adjust their businesses to create a supportive atmosphere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see this community become sensory-friendly.\u201d\n\nzack.orsborn@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @thedaily_zack", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Zack Orsborn Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Miriam Goodman found out her son, Jackson, had autism at the age of 3 after being misdiagnosed by three different medical experts.
