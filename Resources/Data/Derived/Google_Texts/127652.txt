A Canadian man appears to have posted a confession on Facebook that he killed his daughter, wife, and sister. Authorities have not publicly commented on the individuals involved, but reports say that Randy Janzen posted this pretty detailed and disturbing confession on his Facebook page:

The murder investigation is taking place at two houses, one of which caught on fire. A witness told CBC News, “There were two smoke bombs. One upstairs window and one through the living room window. I guess the drapes caught on fire and it was just a matter of minutes before the whole place went up.”
