Her doctor first diagnosed her with bronchitis. And later, asthma. But after months of treatment, her cough persisted and she began to feel pain in her lungs. An x-ray finally revealed that Taylor, at 28 years old, had a large and rapidly-growing tumor in her right lung. She had adenocarcinoma, a form of non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer found in young, non-smoking women. By the time it was diagnosed, it had advanced to Stage IV, meaning the disease had spread beyond her lung. \u201cI was very confused. I almost could not believe that someone my age, who was healthy and went hiking and played volleyball, could get lung cancer,\u201d Taylor says. In the young, who are otherwise healthy and not integrated into the medical system, symptoms, if there are any, are often ignored or mistaken for something else. Ingrid Nunez was also diagnosed with Stage IV adenocarcinoma. She was 19 years old. \u201cAt first we thought it was Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma [a form of blood cancer] because at least that\u2019s a little more common in people my age,\u201d she said. The average age of someone diagnosed with lung cancer is about 70. Only 2 to 3 percent of the 228,190 people diagnosed with lung cancer in 2013 are younger than 40.\n\nNunez says the only sign that something was wrong was a small bump on her left collarbone. \u201cIt had never bothered me and I felt fine,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it was nothing.\u201d No one was prepared for the biopsy result, which showed that the bump was actually a symptom of lung cancer that had spread to her abdomen, liver, lung, and pelvis. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wait what, but I\u2019ve never smoked,\u2019\u201d said Nunez. \u201cIt\u2019s just so random.\u201d Though lung cancer diagnoses in the young are rare and data on that age group is limited, \u201cit seems to be emerging as its own sub-type of lung cancer\u2014one for which new powerful treatments are needed to make it a livable disease,\u201d said Dr. Geoff Oxnard, a lung cancer specialist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. In 2013, 159,480 men and women in the U.S. will die from the disease\u2013more than those who die from breast, colon, and prostate cancer combined. Though smoking is, by far, the greatest risk factor in developing lung cancer, an estimated 10 to 15 percent of lung cancer patients in the U.S. have never smoked. Most of these patients are women and, like Taylor and Nunez, are diagnosed at a younger age than the typical lung cancer patient. \u201cYoung lung cancer patients we see are also more likely to be Stage IV at diagnosis. By the time their disease is discovered they are already pretty sick,\u201d Oxnard said. An Atlantic Special Report\n\nRead More Seventy-five percent of patients with lung cancer have advanced disease and a five-year survival rate of only 5 percent. \u201cIn older patients, the disease is often diagnosed incidentally through a scan or x-ray performed for some other reason,\u201d Oxnard explains. \u201cBut in the young, who are otherwise healthy and not as integrated into the medical system, symptoms, if there are any, are often ignored or mistaken for something else.\u201d Traditionally, lung cancer has been classified into two major types: small cell and non-small cell. Today, however, lung cancer is understood to be comprised of several distinct sub-types, each characterized by mutated genes and abnormal proteins that can increasingly be kept in check by targeted therapies.\n\nA targeted therapy is a treatment specifically designed for a specific mutation or other abnormality. In addition to being more effective than traditional chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy at slowing a cancer\u2019s growth and spread, targeted therapies often have fewer side effects and minimize damage to normal, healthy cells. For example, young people and non-smokers with lung cancer commonly have mutations in a gene called EGFR. Patients who test positive for that mutation respond better to the targeted therapy Tarceva than standard chemotherapy. Young people and non-smokers with lung cancer also frequently have mutations in the ALK and ROS1 genes, which respond well to a new targeted drug called Xalkori. \"We're confused when someone that hasn't smoked and hasn't even been alive long enough to be exposed to anything toxic gets lung cancer.\" Oxnard says than half of all young lung cancer patients have a mutation in their tumors for which a drug exists to block the mutation's actions. This was not the case for either Taylor or Nunez, both of whom were successfully treated\u2014for now\u2014with a standard course of chemotherapy to stay the disease. \u201cJust bad luck, I guess,\u201d Nunez says. But surely it is more than that. Some researchers suspect a hereditary base to the disease\u2019s development, as is the case in some patients with breast or colon cancer. Others suspect the cause lies in a genetic susceptibility combined with other factors, including hormonal changes or exposure to cancer-causing substances, such as radon or second-hand smoke. Still, \u201cthe answer is that we really don\u2019t know why people with seemingly no risk factors get lung cancer,\u201d Oxnard said. \u201cIn the young, we are even more confused when someone that hasn\u2019t smoked and hasn\u2019t even been alive long enough to be exposed to anything toxic gets lung cancer.\u201d The Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute (ALCMI), a partner organization of the San Francisco-based Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation (ALCF), is taking the lead on answering these questions. Later this year, ALCMI will launch the Genomics of Young Lung Cancer Study to determine whether lung cancer in young patients harbors a unique spectrum of genetic mutations that could be a potential target for treatment. It is the first multi-center, international study to prospectively analyze the genomes of young lung cancer patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest research on why \"anyone with lungs is at risk,\" and what&#39;s being done about it", "author": "Aimee Swartz", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The latest research on why \"anyone with lungs is at risk,\" and what&#39;s being done about it", "title": "Why Do Healthy Non-Smokers Get Lung Cancer?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/lungfaceBANNER/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/why-do-healthy-non-smokers-get-lung-cancer/281718/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf657\"", "article_summary": "She had adenocarcinoma, a form of non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer found in young, non-smoking women.\nThough smoking is, by far, the greatest risk factor in developing lung cancer, an estimated 10 to 15 percent of lung cancer patients in the U.S. have never smoked.\nLater this year, ALCMI will launch the Genomics of Young Lung Cancer Study to determine whether lung cancer in young patients harbors a unique spectrum of genetic mutations that could be a potential target for treatment.\nI almost could not believe that someone my age, who was healthy and went hiking and played volleyball, could get lung cancer,\u201d Taylor says.\n\u201cIn the young, we are even more confused when someone that hasn\u2019t smoked and hasn\u2019t even been alive long enough to be exposed to anything toxic gets lung cancer.\u201d The Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute (ALCMI), a partner organization of the San Francisco-based Bonnie J.
