The problem is with free trade you need smart leaders on our side,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have smart leaders, we have dumb leaders.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that not only is the country being hurt by illegal Mexican immigrants \u201cpouring in (over the border) like it\u2019s water,\u201d but also industrially too.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re also killing us economically, which a lot of people don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe also stressed that his success will mean he\u2019s immune to the influences of lobbyists, unlike other politicians.\n\n\u201cLobbyists don\u2019t mean anything to me because I don\u2019t need money,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe pledged that if he runs he will make the country \u201cgreat again\u201d and said the economy is in terrible shape, and the real unemployment rate is somewhere between 19-21 percent.\n\n\u201cThe country has tremendous potential,\u201d Trump said at the event. \u201cWe\u2019re really on the wrong track, I think we can be on the right track.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the unrest in urban America, including the recent riots in Baltimore and said \u201cthe word job is your best social program.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve created tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIf he runs, Trump said he will push for lower taxes, to repeal and replace Obamacare, to strengthen the military, improve how veterans are treated and create a strong border.\n\nAfter the event ended, he was mobbed by people trying to get a picture of him.\n\nTrump even weighed in on the recent four-game suspension of his friend and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t allow this to happen,\u201d Trump said of the suspension. \u201cFour games, it\u2019s nonsense. If you use probably in front of a jury you\u2019re innocent.\u201d\n\nAsked who he was going to work with to get things done on the Democratic side if he\u2019s elected president, Trump pointed to the success of the development he built on the west side of Manhattan when everyone said he couldn\u2019t get it done, but working with politicians from both parties, he did.\n\n\u201cAll of my life I\u2019ve dealt with politicians. I get along with Democrats. I get along with Republicans,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI get along with everybody.\u201d\n\nHe suggested Obama could learn a lesson on getting things done from the way the former Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill and Republican president Ronald Reagan were able to get things done, despite their political differences.\n\n\u201cHe plays hundreds of rounds of golf. Golf is a great game,\u201d Trump said about Obama. \u201cHe should play with people on the other side and get friendly with them and get deals done.\u201d\n\nNow, Trump said, Obama can\u2019t get along \u201cwith anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the Democrats don\u2019t like Obama anymore,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe developer also lashed out at Obamacare, repeating what he called the president\u2019s lies about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cYou can have your own plan and you\u2019ll never lose your doctor and you can have your own whatever you want, \u201c Trump said. \u201cTurned out to be a total lie and he lied 21 times. Some people say 24 but I\u2019m going to give him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nTrump, who described himself as an \u201canti-politician,\u201d described Washington politicians as a \u201cbunch of liars.\u201d\n\nTrump also didn\u2019t try to spare the feelings of his possible fellow Republican candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nHe reminded the packed audience that he was against going to war in Iraq in 2004, and when Bush was asked recently if he would still support the war in Iraq if he knew what he knew today, Bush said yes.\n\n\u201cI watched Bush on (Fox Television Show) Megyn Kelly the other night and I watched him fumbling around with the simplest questions,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn a short press conference after the event, Trump called Bush\u2019s comments \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\nHe also described U.S. Sen. Marco Antonio Rubio, R-Fla., as \u201cweak on immigration.\u201d\n\nAnd then Trump smiled and said, \u201cAnd I have better hair.\u201d\n\nAsked by a Portsmouth Herald reporter if the Republican party had to reach out to African Americans and Latinos to win the next presidential election, Trump said, \u201cI think it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrican Americans are in a position that\u2019s as bad as they\u2019ve ever been in,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTheir unemployment rate is through the roof especially (among) the young.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his experience with creating jobs throughout the country and the world and said blacks \u201chave been treated horribly under President Obama and with me they\u2019d be treated incredibly well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTSMOUTH \u2014 Billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump packed a luncheon event today and then let loose with his legendary bluntness on President Obama, the state of the nation and his fellow Republican candidates.\u201cPeople are disgusted with government, they\u2019re disgusted with politicians,\u201d Trump said during an event at the Pease International Tradeport hosted by Renee and Dan Plummer of Two International Group. \u201cThey\u2019re ashamed with what\u2019s going on", "vf": {"unique_id": "www.seacoastonline.com/20150514/NEWS/150519424"}, "author": "Jeff McMenemy jmcmenemy@seacoastonline.com", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://www.seacoastonline.com/storyimage/SO/20150514/NEWS/150519424/AR/0/AR-150519424.jpg", "height": 1203}, "site_name": "seacoastonline.com", "description": "PORTSMOUTH \u2014 Billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump packed a luncheon event today and then let loose with his legendary bluntness on President Obama,", "title": "Donald Trump sounds off on Obama, Tom Brady"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.seacoastonline.com/storyimage/SO/20150514/NEWS/150519424/AR/0/AR-150519424.jpg&MaxW=1200&MaxH=630"}, "description": "PORTSMOUTH \u2014 Billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump packed a luncheon event today and then let loose with his legendary bluntness on President Obama, the state of the nation and his fellow Republican candidates.\u201cPeople are disgusted with government, they\u2019re disgusted with politicians,\u201d Trump said during an event at the Pease International Tradeport hosted by Renee and Dan Plummer of Two International Group. \u201cThey\u2019re ashamed with what\u2019s going on", "site": "@seacoastonline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump sounds off on Obama, Tom Brady"}, "robots": "noarchive", "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-1593574B-4147-7AAC-E053-0100007F26EE-pub2328"}}, "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "googlebot": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf05\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe should play with people on the other side and get friendly with them and get deals done.\u201dNow, Trump said, Obama can\u2019t get along \u201cwith anybody.\u201d\u201cEven the Democrats don\u2019t like Obama anymore,\u201d Trump said.\nPORTSMOUTH \u2014 Billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump packed a luncheon event today and then let loose with his legendary bluntness on President Obama, the state of the nation and his fellow Republican candidates.\nTrump even weighed in on the recent four-game suspension of his friend and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\u201cPeople are disgusted with government, they\u2019re disgusted with politicians,\u201d Trump said during an event at the Pease International Tradeport hosted by Renee and Dan Plummer of Two International Group.\nTrump lashed out against the abuses of the free trade policy, stating \u201cChina is ripping us off.\u201d\u201cFree trade is great."}
