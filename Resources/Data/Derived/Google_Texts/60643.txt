Japanese cities are the top destinations for Asia-Pacific travelers next year, Hotels.com told CNBC.

Tokyo was ranked the number one vacation spot, followed by Osaka in second place, eclipsing previous favorite Hong Kong, according to data compiled from the accommodation booking site. The cultural capital of Kyoto came in at tenth on the list.
