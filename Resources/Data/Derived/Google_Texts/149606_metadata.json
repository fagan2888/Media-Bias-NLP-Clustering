Hodges. At issue is whether state laws which prohibit same-sex unions violate the 14th Amendment, which forbids state governments from denying the equal protection of the laws to any person within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nStanding before the Court, John Bursch, special assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan, argued that \u201cthis case isn't about how to define marriage. It's about who gets to decide that question. Is it the people acting through the democratic process, or is it the Federal courts?\u201d In Bursch\u2019s view, such regulatory decisions should be left in the hands of democratically accountable state lawmakers. The federal courts should butt out.\n\nMary Bonauto, the lawyer challenging those state bans on behalf of several gay couples, framed the case quite differently. \u201cIn terms of the question of who decides,\u201d she told the justices, \u201cit\u2019s not about the Court versus the States. It\u2019s about the individual making the choice to marry and with whom to marry, or the government.\u201d\n\nJudging by the outpouring of punditry, most liberals appear to agree with Bonauto. But there is at least one notable exception to that seeming liberal consensus. Writing at The Atlantic, the liberal legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen worries that the American left could suffer a Pyrrhic victory if gay marriage prevails in Obergefell. Why? Because \u201cthe right to dignity\u2014now celebrated by liberals for what it means to gay rights\u2014could ultimately produce other decisions in unrelated cases that they would not be so quick to celebrate.\u201d For example, Rosen notes, \u201cin the McDonald case, striking down gun possession laws under the Second Amendment,\u201d legal conservatives \u201crecognized a dignitary interest attached to the right to bear arms.\u201d Similarly, Rosen says, \u201clibertarian groups\u201d argued \u201cthat the Obamacare healthcare mandate unconstitutionally violated the dignity and autonomy of Americans by forcing them to buy health insurance.\u201d In short, Rosen fears, if the Supreme Court places individual dignity and autonomy above government power in this case, \u201cprogressive legislation\u201d could be similarly imperiled in future cases. Perhaps, Rosen implies, the fate of gay marriage is better left to the democratic process after all.\n\nIronically, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia employed a very similar argument back in 2003 when he dissented from the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark gay rights ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, in which the Court struck down that state\u2019s ban on gay sex. According to Scalia, Texas\u2019 Homosexual Conduct Law \u201cundoubtedly imposes constraints on liberty.\u201d But so do state laws which prohibit \u201cworking more than 60 hours a week in a bakery.\u201d In both instances, Scalia said, democratically accountable lawmakers should have the final say on whether or not the regulation gets to remain on the books. The federal courts should butt out.\n\nScalia\u2019s reference to bakeries in Lawrence was a subtle nod to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, the famous Progressive era case in which the justices invalidated the maximum working hours provision of that state\u2019s Bakeshop Act on the grounds that it violated the individual liberty secured by the 14th Amendment. If you ask most modern legal liberals, they\u2019ll tell you that Lochner was wrongly decided and in fact symbolizes the dangers of libertarian judicial activism. Scalia agrees. By invoking Lochner in a gay rights case, Scalia was trying to get his liberal colleagues to connect the dots and realize that government regulatory power is undermined whenever a federal judge invalidates a state law based on a libertarian reading of the 14th Amendment.\n\nRosen connected the dots. \u201cIf the Court strikes down same-sex marriage bans on the grounds that they violate a right to dignity,\u201d he writes about last week\u2019s Obergefell oral arguments, \u201cliberals may have second thoughts about empowering judges to decide whose dignity trumps when the interests of citizens with very different conceptions of dignity clash.\u201d\n\nIn other words, according to both Scalia and Rosen, strict judicial enforcement of the 14th Amendment could serve the twin ends of advancing gay rights and imperiling certain \u201cprogressive\u201d economic regulations. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re right.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The same individualistic jurisprudence that advances gay rights could also imperil \u201cprogressive\u201d economic reforms.", "title": "Liberal Pundit Fears 'Libertarian' Fallout from Pro-Gay Marriage Ruling by SCOTUS", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/05/liberal-pundit-fears-libertarian-fallout", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1430829343371.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The same individualistic jurisprudence that advances gay rights could also imperil \u201cprogressive\u201d economic reforms.", "title": "Liberal Pundit Fears 'Libertarian' Fallout from Pro-Gay Marriage Ruling by SCOTUS", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1430829343371.jpg", "creator": "@damonroot", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-05T13:10:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/damon-w-root"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Last week the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the gay marriage case Obergefell v.
