The doctor said it is only right to mandate in state law that all women be told that is an option.\n\nBut Sawyer acknowledged under questioning that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of that drug for that purpose, though what he did is not illegal. Instead, Sawyer said only that \u201cstudies are ongoing.\u201d\n\nAnd Sawyer also said there are no studies of whether the procedure has resulted in birth defects for women who make that choice.\n\nThe language approved by the House Committee on Federalism and States\u2019 Rights was added to a measure already approved by the state Senate which denies women who purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act the option of obtaining coverage for elective abortion. Sen. Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, said the purpose is to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to subsidize the procedure.\n\nBryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood Arizona, said SB1318 goes beyond subsidies. He said the legislation even blocks women from using their own money to purchase a \u201crider\u201d to that policy.\n\nAnd the same bill would require abortion doctors \u2013 and only abortion doctors \u2013 to provide their home addresses to the Department of Health Services, where they could be released as a public record.\n\nThat last provision drew derision by Rep. Rebecca Rios, D-Phoenix, who pointed out that Rep. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, who chairs the committee and who voted for the bill, had introduced legislation to make the home addresses of all elected officials off limits to the public.\n\n\u201cI find that a little embarrassing, personally, when legislators want their information held private from the public, but we\u2019re not willing to ensure the safety of physicians that we know have been murdered because of the procedures they offer,\u201d Rios said.\n\nTownsend\u2019s legislation never got a hearing.\n\nThe debate got so personal at one point that Townsend had to recess the hearing.\n\nIt started with Rep. Darin Mitchell, R-Litchfield Park, questioning Howard why he had written that this is a measure being pushed by \u201cextreme lawmakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only us sitting here,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cSo, I must be one of them,\u201d Mitchell continued. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that you\u2019re not an extremist,\u201d responded Rep. Bruce Wheeler, D-Tucson.\n\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Wheeler continued. \u201cYou prove it, you prove it to the public whether you\u2019re an extremist or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to discuss here who\u2019s extremist,\u201d Townsend interjected. \u201cThis is about the bill.\u201d\n\nWhat is in the bill is the new requirement that women be told at least 24 hours ahead that \u201cit may be possible to reverse the effects of a medication abortion if the woman changes her mind but that time is of the essence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, licensed in the state of Arizona for over a quarter of a century, I testify to you today that abortion is not health care,\u201d Sawyer told lawmakers. \u201cWomen who have initiated a medical abortion process and who change their minds for whatever reason should not have their babies stolen from them because Planned Parenthood or any abortionist withheld life-saving facts or withheld information.\u201d\n\nBut Ilana Addis, who chairs the Arizona section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said doctors are supposed to \u201cpractice medicine that is evidence-based.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the protocol that has been suggested for reversing a medication abortion has no evidence to support it,\u201d she told lawmakers.\n\nTownsend said foes were making too big a deal out of it, saying that progesterone is \u201ca simple hormone.\u201d But Addis said that doesn\u2019t make it any less of a drug.\n\n\u201cThough it is a hormone that\u2019s made in the body, the progesterone that women take is a medication that is made in a lab,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a medication is somebody is taking it to do something for them.\u201d\n\nAnd Addis said there are complications from progesterone and \u201cthe side effects are not necessarily minor.\u201d\n\nThe question of insurance goes to the argument by Cathi Herrod, president of the anti-abortion Center for Arizona Policy, that 90 percent of all people who obtain coverage obtained under the Affordable Care Act get some sort of government subsidy.\n\nHerrod acknowledged that coverage for elective abortion is offered under a separate \u201crider.\u201d\n\nBut she said insurers are charging just $1 a month, which she said is proof that insurers are using \u201can accounting gimmick\u201d to hide the fact that there are taxpayer funds involved. Herrod said that\u2019s why the legislation bars any coverage for abortion.\n\nThere are exceptions which allow coverage for situations involving the life of the mother, serious physical harm or cases rape or incest.\n\nHerrod, questioned about how a woman would prove rape, said that would be left to the insurance company. Rios found that answer unsatisfactory.\n\n\u201cWe will have situations where we have rape victims that are going to be revictimized, having to plead their case\u201d to get coverage, she said.\n\nThe legislation now needs approval of the full House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State lawmakers are moving to force doctors to tell women their medical abortions can be reversed if they act quickly, a procedure that even its anti-abortion proponents admit lacks medical proof that it works.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "State lawmakers are moving to force doctors to tell women their medical abortions can be reversed if they act quickly, a procedure that even its anti-abortion proponents admit lacks medical proof t...", "title": "\u2018Abortion reversal\u2019 disclosure required in anti-abortion bill", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2015/03/11/abortion-reversal-disclosure-required-in-anti-abortion-bill/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2015/03/abortion-hands-baby620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "\u2018Abortion reversal\u2019 disclosure required in anti-abortion billArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, abortion, abortion reversal, medical abortion, medical proof, allan sawyer, american association of pro-life obstetricians and gynecologists. progesterone, house committee on federalism and states\u2019 rights, nancy barto, bryan howard, planned parenthood arizona, sb1318,abortion,abortion reversal,allan sawyer,american association of pro-life obstetricians and gynecologists. progesterone,bryan howard,house committee on federalism and states\u2019 rights,medical abortion,medical proof,nancy barto,planned parenthood arizona,sb1318", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The doctor said it is only right to mandate in state law that all women be told that is an option.\nAnd the same bill would require abortion doctors \u2013 and only abortion doctors \u2013 to provide their home addresses to the Department of Health Services, where they could be released as a public record.\nHerrod said that\u2019s why the legislation bars any coverage for abortion.\nHe said the legislation even blocks women from using their own money to purchase a \u201crider\u201d to that policy.\nSen.
