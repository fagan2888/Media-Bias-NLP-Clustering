Long-neglected infrastructure compounds the situation, as executives will surely convince the California Public Utilities Commission that the consumer must pay for upgrades to the system.\n\nAnd regarding Blue Shield, the cost of medical insurance will rise as more people seek coverage and the smarmiest guys in the room get wealthier.
