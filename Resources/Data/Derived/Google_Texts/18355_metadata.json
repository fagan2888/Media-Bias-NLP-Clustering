(AP) - Luke Kuechly celebrated becoming the NFL\u2019s highest-paid middle linebacker by heading back into the film room to study more tape of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\u201cThen I will go to sleep and do it all over again tomorrow,\u201d Kuechly said at a press conference Thursday night.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the Carolina Panthers fourth-year linebacker in a nutshell - focused, always working to get better, and relentless in his pursuit of victory.\n\nThe humble 24-year-old Kuechly signed a five-year, $62 million contract extension that will keep with the Panthers through 2021, a person familiar with the situation said Thursday. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because financial terms weren\u2019t released.\n\nHis deal pales some in comparison to the six-year, $100 million-plus the Buffalo Bills gave defensive tackle Marcell Dareus earlier in the day, largely because the value the NFL puts on certain positions.\n\nBut teammate Thomas Davis said Kuechly is to the Panthers what Tom Brady is to the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cHe deserves to be the highest-paid defensive player in this league based on what he\u2019s done, what he\u2019s capable of doing and what I expect him to do,\u201d Davis said.\n\nKuechly\u2019s $12.4 million annual salary tops that of Seattle middle linebacker Bobby Wagner, who received a four-year extension worth $10.75 million a year in August.\n\n\u201cThat speaks to what Luke has been able to accomplish and what he\u2019s done,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHow can you argue with that? He deserves every cent of it, if not more.\u201d\n\nKuechly has an NFL-best 473 tackles since coming into the league as a first-round draft pick in 2012. He\u2019s one of only three players to win NFL Defensive Player of the Year award within his first two years, earning that honor in 2013.\n\nSince Kuechly arrival the Panthers have been a top 10 defense every season and coach Ron Rivera called him a \u201cperfect fit\u201d in Carolina.\n\n\u201cLuke is a special player and has been a big reason why we have had success on defense,\u201d Rivera said in a press release. \u201cHe has the skillset you want in a middle linebacker - a great first step, the ability to play downhill and drop into coverage - and he has great command of our defense and what we want to do schematically.\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Sean McDermott called him a \u201cservant leader,\u201d saying that he has helped build an unselfish atmosphere in the Carolina locker room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the greatest compliment I could give someone,\u201d McDermott said\n\nThe deal comes three days before the Panthers face the Jaguars in the regular season opener. The Panthers\u2019 long-standing stance is not to discuss contract extensions once the regular season begins, so there was a rush to get things done.\n\nKuechly said he was never worried though, knowing the deal would get done at some point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been about me,\u201d said Kuechly, who was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2012. \u201cI want to win. I\u2019m one guy on an 11-man defense that needs to do his job. I don\u2019t like talking about myself. I would rather talk about other people.\u201d\n\nKuechly becomes the fourth Carolina player to sign a big contract extension this offseason.\n\nQuarterback Cam Newton previously signed a five-year, $103.8 million deal, tight end Greg Olsen was handed a three-year, $22.5 million contract and Davis got $18 million over two years.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Luke Kuechly celebrated becoming the NFL's highest-paid middle linebacker by heading back into the film room to study more tape of the Jacksonville Jaguars.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Luke Kuechly celebrated becoming the NFL\u2019s highest-paid middle linebacker by heading back into the film room to study more tape of the Jacksonville Jaguars.", "title": "AP Source: Panthers make Kuechly NFL\u2019s highest-paid MLB", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/10/ap-source-panthers-make-kuechly-nfls-highest-paid-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/10/d4c045ebbb8ca328810f6a7067009828.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/10/d4c045ebbb8ca328810f6a7067009828.jpg", "description": "Luke Kuechly celebrated becoming the NFL's highest-paid middle linebacker by heading back into the film room to study more tape of the Jacksonville Jaguars.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "AP Source: Panthers make Kuechly NFL\u2019s highest-paid MLB"}, "Author": "STEVE REED", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca631\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s never been about me,\u201d said Kuechly, who was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2012.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.
