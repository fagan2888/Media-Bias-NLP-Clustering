(WOOD) \u2014 The details have been graphic: Nursing home patients dying of medication mistakes, of poorly treated bedsores, from falls that shouldn\u2019t have happened, or, in one case, being allowed to choke to death.\n\nTarget 8 uncovered mistakes that caused or contributed to 112 deaths over three years at Michigan nursing homes \u2014 numbers that surprised even the state agency that inspects nursing homes.\n\nTarget 8 also found a state frustrated with federal authorities and nursing homes that say harsher fines aren\u2019t the answer.\n\nThe obvious question is: Would it simply be enough to just hire more nurses and nurse\u2019s aides?\n\nCASHIER WAGES\n\n\u201cEverywhere you go, you\u2019re going to have staffing issues \u2014 everywhere, unless you\u2019re paying $18 to $20 an hour. But you\u2019re not, so you\u2019re always going to be short-staffed. Always,\u201d a former nurse\u2019s aide told Target 8.\n\nThe aide, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said all four of the nursing homes where she has worked were understaffed, including Laurels of Sandy Creek in Wayland, where a mistake in May 2012 led to a death and a $101,000 fine.\n\nShe said she has never made more than $11 an hour \u2014 about what a grocery store cashier makes \u2014 and said she cared for up to 14 patients at a time at Laurels.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough job. You really have got to have your heart in the right place when you\u2019re working with elderly,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile federal records show staffing at Laurels of Sandy Creek is average, patients there still get 13 minutes per day less licensed nursing care than at the average Michigan home. They also get a half-hour less of nurse\u2019s aide care a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d the nurse\u2019s aide said. \u201cIt means it\u2019s taking time away from them.\u201d\n\nThe average Michigan nursing home provides 1 hour and 41 minutes of licensed nursing care and 2 hours and 24 minutes of nurse\u2019s aide care daily for each patient \u2014 a few minutes more than the national average.\n\n\u201cThe more staffing you have on the front lines of nursing homes, the safer the residents\u201d \u2014 Brian Lee, Families for Better Care\n\nBut the head of a national nursing home watchdog group said that\u2019s not enough.\n\nFamilies for Better Care gives Michigan an F for nursing home care and ranks it fourth worst in the nation, in part because of its high number of serious violations. Families for Better Care Executive Director Brian Lee blames that mostly on what he calls mediocre staffing levels.\n\n\u201cThe more staffing you have on the front lines of nursing homes, the safer the residents,\u201d Lee said.\n\nCULTURE CHANGE\n\nThe head of the state agency that inspects nursing homes says it\u2019s more about training and culture.\n\n\u201cYou can have six people standing around the nurse\u2019s station or you can have every person out talking to people,\u201d Gail Maurer, director of the Michigan Long Term Care Division, told Target 8. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people you have on board if you don\u2019t have the right culture.\u201d\n\nThe wrong culture, she said, leads to mistakes.\n\nOn Mother\u2019s Day 2013, a woman stopped breathing after eating soup at Medilodge nursing home in Southfield. The unit\u2019s only nurse was eating lunch in her car, and nobody was filling in. The woman\u2019s daughter scrambled to find help. Ten minutes later, another nurse ran in, but the suction machine he hoped would save her wasn\u2019t working, federal records show.\n\n\u201cWhat does that tell you about the culture of the facility that that would be acceptable?\u201d Maurer said.\n\nDespite the troubles, Maurer said she believes nursing home care in Michigan is turning a corner. Complaints dropped 15% in the last year. The state, she said, has streamlined inspections based on a Michigan law passed in 2012.\n\nStill, in the worst cases, she wants harsher fines \u2014 but said that\u2019s up to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which has the final say on those penalties. The most the CMS can charge is $10,000 a day, which it hasn\u2019t changed for years.\n\nThe feds base fines on how serious the case is and a home\u2019s history. The longer it takes to fix the problems, the bigger the hit.\n\nIN THE RIGHT DIRECTION\n\nThe association that represents most of Michigan\u2019s nursing homes says it would consider boosting minimum staffing, but opposes bigger fines.\n\n\u201cThis sector of health care has been fined, has been put out of business, has seen all manner of sanctions over the years,\u201d David LaLumia, President and CEO of the Health Care Association of Michigan, said.\n\nThe association, he said, works closely with homes to make them safer.\n\n\u201cIt is an important issue and we should see a decline in serious adverse events if our quality improvement is effective. And I believe that it is, and I believe that we\u2019re going to see it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll always have adverse events, but the good places, the great places are the ones that learn from that\u201d \u2014 David LaLumia, Health Care Association of Michigan\n\nWhile acknowledging there are too many \u201cadverse events\u201d in Michigan nursing homes, LaLumia refused to believe that the state is fourth worst in the nation for nursing home care. He said the group that ranks the states \u2014 Families for Better Care \u2014 is funded by an attorney known for suing nursing homes.\n\n\u201cThat group has no credibility with us,\u201d LaLumia said.\n\nTax records from 2012 show that Families for Better Care got $130,000 in contributions from a Florida law firm that specializes in nursing home abuse.\n\nThat aside, an analysis of Medicare.gov records shows Michigan is tied with Arkansas for 10th in the nation in the number of serious deficiencies per home over the last three years and second in the number of nursing homes fined.\n\nLaLumia said the industry is going in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve learned about quality improvement is that it will never be there, because quality improvement is not an end, it\u2019s a process, and we\u2019ll always have adverse events, but the good places, the great places are the ones that learn from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just won\u2019t find any of my family there.\u201d \u2014 Gail Maurer, head of the Michigan Long Term Care Division\n\nThe state says any change in how Michigan and the feds police nursing homes would require legislation.\n\nMaurer, the nurse who oversees the Michigan Long Term Care Division, said there are homes in the state where she would not place a relative, though she wouldn\u2019t name them.\n\n\u201cYou just won\u2019t find any of my family there,\u201d she said.\n\nSharon DeWitt, 76, of Hastings.
