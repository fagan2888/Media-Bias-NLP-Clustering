Two missing Ft. Riley soldiers.

The father of one of two soldiers reported missing from Fort Riley has raised concerns about his son's disappearance.

A flier from the Kansas Missing and Unsolved Facebook page says Pfc. Richard "Connor" Ferguson and Pvt. Bradley Kappel were last seen July 21. Military records show the men were serving in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team "Dagger."

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports they're considered to be AWOL by Fort Riley officials.

Chris Grey, spokesman for the USA Criminal Investigation Command office in Quantico, Virginia, says the Army believes the two men didn't disappear under suspicious circumstances.

But Connor Ferguson's father, Steve Ferguson, says it's out of character for his son to go AWOL.
