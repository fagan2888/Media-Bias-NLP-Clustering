Chris Rock hosted last night’s “Saturday Night Live,” and he aimed his hilarious monologue at American consumerism and the gun lobby.

The Hollywood Reporter points out that much of the routine comes from Rock’s stand-up. Regardless, he brought some edgy material, discussing everything from the Freedom Tower to America’s inane consumerist attitude — especially concerning the holiday season or “Jesus’ birthday season.”

Rock rounded out his monologue with a shot at gun nuts, who posted threats on his website following a trip to Washington, DC to discuss firearm regulations. Watch Rock’s monologue below:
