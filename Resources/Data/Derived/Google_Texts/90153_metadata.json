So instead, Wilson is offering what he describes as a \u201cbounty\u201d to anyone who can get him MarkForged\u2019s new carbon fiber printer. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s got access to one, any reseller, any individual or business or entity that can deliver it to me, I will give them fifteen grand,\u201d says Wilson, who has also released a YouTube video advertising his offer. \u201cI\u2019m going to get this printer. I\u2019m going to make a gun with it. And I\u2019m going to make sure everyone knows it was made with a MarkForged printer.\u201d In a statement to WIRED, MarkForged cited terms of service that \u201climit experimentation with ordnance to the United States Government and its authorized contractors.\u201d In fact, the company\u2019s terms of service page doesn\u2019t include that statement. But it does reserve the right for the company to refuse sale to anyone, even after an order is placed.\n\nA professional provocateur as well as armament-maker, it clearly amuses Wilson watching how so many elements of the world of \"normal business\" try to run far from any connection to his projects.\n\nBut he knows it doesn't matter in the end; their very refusal both highlights aspects of the world he wants to highlight, and doesn't ultimately stop him from his goals. As Wilson said to me in my extensive December 2013 profile of him:\n\nThere hasn't been a roadblock in his path that he didn't in some way foresee, and none of them have yet have set back his goals. \"This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen,\" he says. \"Of course we are going to succeed-because you all are trying to stop me. That seemed natural and ended up being true.\"\n\nWilson video about his feud with MarkForged:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Offers $15,000 Bounty for Anyone Who Can Deliver Him a MarkForged carbon-fiber 3D Printer.", "title": "Cody Wilson, Pioneer of Homemade 3D Printed Guns, Calls Out Another Company For Refusing to Do Business with Him", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/03/cody-wilson-pioneer-of-homemade-3d-print", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14254097383062.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14254097383062.jpg", "description": "Offers $15,000 Bounty for Anyone Who Can Deliver Him a MarkForged carbon-fiber 3D Printer.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cody Wilson, Pioneer of Homemade 3D Printed Guns, Calls Out Another Company For Refusing to Do Business with Him"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2015-03-03T19:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0837\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m going to make a gun with it.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get this printer.\nwar front against MarkForged, for refusing to sell him a 3D printer using carbon fiber.\nSo instead, Wilson is offering what he describes as a \u201cbounty\u201d to anyone who can get him MarkForged\u2019s new carbon fiber printer.\nI reported last week about how FedEx refuses to help Cody Wilson ship his home CNC mill to make un-serial-numbered weapons at home, his \"Ghost Gunner.\""}
