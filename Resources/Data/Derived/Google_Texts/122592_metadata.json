Of organizations with 500 to 1,000 beds that number dropped to under 60 percent and for those 1000-plus, to 30 percent.\n\nOverall, more than one-third of hospitals are currently considering a merger or acquisition, according to the report.\n\n[Also: Bulk of healthcare not prepared for value-based payments, KPMG survey says]\n\nCEOs and CFOs said the greatest challenges were managing the switch to value-based reimbursement models, shortages of physicians and nurses, regulatory compliance and meaningful return on information techology purchases.\n\nOther concerns reported were coordinating care, managing patient population, patient engagement, managing data, improving information security, and reducing hospital acquired infections.\n\nConcerns varied by hospital bed size. Smaller hospitals have the biggest struggle attracting and retaining physicians and nurses. In larger facilities, security is listed as a higher concern.\n\nChallenges differed by title.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nSurprisingly, CIOs cited mergers and acquisitions as their second biggest challenge, after improving security. The report said a merger or acquisition would force new solutions and integrations.\n\nThe most innovative vendors and technology companies cited were Epic, Cerner, Apple, GE, Google, athenahealth and Theranos.\n\nMeditech leads the market share trends in enterprise clinical IT solutions; followed by Cerner, Epic, Evident, McKesson, Allscripts, Healthland and Medhost.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-execs-look-outside-innovation-fret-over-value-based-reimbursement-peer60-report-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/walmart-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Top hospital executives derive innovative ideas not only from each other but from organizations ranging from Epic to Wal-Mart and CVS, according to a new report, \"Into the Minds of the C-Suite 2015\" by Peer60.", "title": "Healthcare execs look outside for innovation, fret over value-based reimbursement, Peer60 report says"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/walmart-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "Top hospital executives derive innovative ideas not only from each other but from organizations ranging from Epic to Wal-Mart and CVS, according to a new report, \"Into the Minds of the C-Suite 2015\" by Peer60.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare execs look outside for innovation, fret over value-based reimbursement, Peer60 report says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Top hospital executives derive innovative ideas not only from each other but from organizations ranging from Epic to Wal-Mart and CVS, according to a new report, \"Into the Minds of the C-Suite 2015\" by Peer60.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca920\"", "article_summary": "Overall, more than one-third of hospitals are currently considering a merger or acquisition, according to the report.\nOther concerns reported were coordinating care, managing patient population, patient engagement, managing data, improving information security, and reducing hospital acquired infections.\nThe most innovative healthcare provider organizations were ranked as Mayo Clinic, Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Geisinger, Intermountain Heathcare and HCA, according to the report using feedback from 336 C-suite executives nationwide.\nThe report said a merger or acquisition would force new solutions and integrations.\nExecutives of larger systems were more likely to say they were undergoing or considering a merger or acquisition than those leading smaller hospitals."}
