The number of foreign students leaving the university, a public institution on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, without earning a degree was also on the rise.\n\nIn 2008, West Florida\u2019s retention rate for international students was 95 percent. Three years later, it was 83 percent. What, Ms. Errington wondered, was going on?\n\nShe is not the only one who has been asking. Late last month Nafsa, the association of international educators formerly known as the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers, released the findings of a United States survey on international-student retention at its annual conference in San Diego.\n\nWhile research has looked at the retention and academic success of foreign students on individual campuses or within university systems, the Nafsa study was the first to do so across many institutions. And the survey, conducted by World Education Services, a private organization that studies trends in international education, includes the perspectives of both international undergraduates and the college administrators who work with them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt turns out the two groups view retention issues quite differently.\n\nEducators attributed to a variety of causes foreign undergraduates\u2019 decisions to drop out or transfer, including financial and academic issues; English-language problems; and the desire to attend an institution that is a \u201cbetter fit.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the factors most cited by students were squarely financial: access to jobs or internships; affordability; and availability of scholarships. Rounding out the top five: dissatisfaction with the food and the dormitories.\n\nNeither perception is necessarily wrong, said Rahul Choudaha, the project\u2019s lead researcher. Rather, the survey results, based on responses from nearly 500 educators and 500 students at more than 100 colleges, underscored that \u201cthere may be a gap in understanding about what students want and what they\u2019re getting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd students may not understand what institutions want and what they\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nThe results also show some variability between different types of colleges. Administrators at doctorate-granting institutions, for example, were more likely to say academic and English-language difficulties were at the root of retention problems. Meanwhile, students at baccalaureate institutions were more concerned about affordability but reported greater satisfaction with the availability of scholarships than did their peers at other colleges. Baccalaureate institutions are defined as colleges where bachelor\u2019s degrees represent at least 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees and where fewer than 50 master\u2019s degrees or 20 doctoral degrees are awarded annually.\n\nThe research did not examine the full range of foreign students in the United States. It did not include graduate students or students who transfer to four-year institutions from community colleges, intensive-English courses, or so-called pathways programs.\n\nYet over all, the findings do suggest that American colleges need to do a better job of dealing with the mismatch between the expectations international students have of studying in the United States and their experience once on an American campus, said Sheila Schulte, Nafsa\u2019s senior director for international enrollment management and international student and scholar services.\n\nCollege recruiters should be upfront about academic requirements and about what it takes to succeed in an American college classroom, Ms. Schulte said, especially with students who come from very different educational backgrounds. They should also be transparent about college costs and financing, she said. If campus jobs are limited, for instance, international-admissions officers should make that clear to foreign students, who are forbidden under United States law to work off-campus.\n\nIn addition, international-student advisers may need to collaborate more with other campus offices, such as career services, to make sure those offices are prepared to handle the special needs of foreign students, Ms. Schulte noted. More than a third of the students surveyed singled out access to jobs and internships as one of the most effective ways to retain students.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite those concerns, retention and graduation rates for international students remain high \u2014 in many cases, higher than those of American students. More than 60 percent of the baccalaureate and master\u2019s institutions surveyed and more than half of the doctorate institutions said their retention rates were higher for foreign than for domestic undergraduates.\n\nStill, as the number of students from overseas continues to increase \u2014 the Institute of International Education reports there are 40 percent more foreign students at American colleges than a decade ago \u2014 their retention rates bear watching, Ms. Schulte said.\n\nAnd the Nafsa data hint at a lack of satisfaction even among international students who choose not to leave their institution. Just 60 percent of students who said they did not plan to transfer reported being satisfied with their experience.\n\nJill Munro, director of international student and scholar services at the College of Wooster in Ohio, said that while international retention rates remained strong, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose the few that I do or have those who stay have a less-than-great experience.\u201d\n\nWooster will begin offering a course this fall to new international students to help them adjust academically and culturally to American higher education. Ms. Munro said she hoped the class would allow her and other instructors to spot students who are struggling early, instead of \u201cwhen they fail their classes first semester.\u201d\n\nAt West Florida, Ms. Errington has conducted her own surveys to determine why retention rates fell.\n\nShe has used the findings to craft some possible fixes: Among them, starting a voucher program to cut the cost of taxi rides from the college\u2019s relatively isolated campus into downtown Pensacola and encouraging other offices and departments to offer more on-campus jobs and internships to foreign students. Her latest effort is a mentoring program that connects international students with American classmates.\n\nWest Florida\u2019s retention rate, she said, has now rebounded.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140608120131, "twitter": {"description": "The number of those leaving without a degree appears to be on the rise.", "title": "For U.S. Colleges, a Drive to Retain Foreign Students", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/for-us-colleges-a-drive-to-retain-foreign-students.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002924498"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/education/09iht-educled09-illo/09iht-educled09-illo-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/for-us-colleges-a-drive-to-retain-foreign-students.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002924498", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/for-us-colleges-a-drive-to-retain-foreign-students.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "For U.S. Colleges, a Drive to Retain Foreign Students", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 8, 2014", "edt": "Global", "keywords": "Education,Colleges and Universities,United States", "news_keywords": "Education", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Karin Fischer | The Chronicle Of Higher Education", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/education/09iht-educled09-illo/09iht-educled09-illo-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KARIN FISCHER | THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The number of those leaving without a degree appears to be on the rise.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/education/09iht-educled09-illo/09iht-educled09-illo-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The number of those leaving without a degree appears to be on the rise.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-06-09", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2014-06-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "09iht-educlede09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140609031204, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/us/for-us-colleges-a-drive-to-retain-foreign-students.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/09/education/09iht-educled09-illo/09iht-educled09-illo-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The number of those leaving without a degree appears to be on the rise.", "title": "For U.S. Colleges, a Drive to Retain Foreign Students"}, "pdate": 20140608, "des": "Colleges and Universities", "articleid": 100000002924498, "cre": "International New York Times", "hdl": "For U.S. Colleges, a Drive to Retain Foreign Students", "col": "International Education", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd450\"", "article_summary": "The number of foreign students leaving the university, a public institution on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, without earning a degree was also on the rise.\nPhotoSAN DIEGO \u2014 Like many American colleges, the University of West Florida has seen significant growth in recent years in its international-student enrollment.\nAnd the Nafsa data hint at a lack of satisfaction even among international students who choose not to leave their institution.\nIt did not include graduate students or students who transfer to four-year institutions from community colleges, intensive-English courses, or so-called pathways programs.\nBut another trend alarmed Rachel Errington, director of the university\u2019s Office of International Students."}
