Denver opened its season with sophomore Evan Cowley in net Friday at Magness Arena. But he won’t be there long.

After Cowley helped lead the Pioneers to a 3-0 victory over Rensselaer, he will go to the bench on Saturday.

DU coach Jim Montgomery said he will play 21-year-old freshman Tanner Jaillet in net on Saturday for Game 2 against RPI.

The Pioneers will likely play the first half of their season with a goalie platoon. Or a goalie battle. Depending on your outlook. Here’s a closer look the Cowley and Jaillet two-step in goal for DU.

Here’s your full DU-RPI game recap.

DENVER POST THREE STARS

1. Quentin Shore, Denver — Shore’s game-winner, a pretty wrist-shot from the right side that clanged in off the post, finally broke DU through in the second period. He also added an assist on the Pios’ second goal.

2. Jason Kasdorf, Rensselaer — The Engineers’ goalie was outstanding early on. He stopped 20 shots in the first 20 minutes. And he finished with 39 saves.

3. Zac Larraza, Denver — Larraza was everywhere, assisting on Shore’s goal and re-directing a Nolan Zajac shot in for DU’s second.

WHAT ELSE?

** DU’s Grant Arnold and RPI’s Mike Prapavessis scrumbled in the corner in the first period and the bumping busted open the glass at Magness Arena. Well, it took the plexi out of its frame anyway. The ice crew popped it back in on the quick.

** Montgomery said he agreed with the referee’s calling off Adam Plant’s seeming goal in the first period. On the play, DU’s Matt Marcinew threw a shot at Kasdorf and Plant hooked in a rebound in a scrum. But officials determined Plant was in the crease, even though it seemed he was pushed in by RPI.

Montgomery, after watching the replay, said it looked more like a defender pushed Plant off balance, and he fell into the crease. College refs have been asked this season to keep a closer eye on goalie interference.
