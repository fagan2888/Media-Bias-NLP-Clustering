(No, I\u2019m not doing interviews \u2014 I\u2019m spending my spare time with friends.) And I have been doing some homework about the terrible times Portugal has recently suffered. What especially caught my eye was this:\n\nPhoto\n\nWe used to think that high labor mobility was a good thing for currency unions, because it would allow the union\u2019s economy to adjust to asymmetric shocks \u2014 booms in some places, busts in others \u2014 by moving workers rather than having to cut wages in the lagging regions. But what about the tax base? If bad times cause one country\u2019s workers to leave in large numbers, who will service its debt and care for its retirees?\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s easy conceptually to see how a country could enter a demographic death spiral. Start with a high level of debt, explicit and implicit. If the work force falls through emigration, servicing this debt will require higher taxes on those who remain, which could lead to more emigration, and so on.\n\nHow realistic is this possibility? It obviously depends on having a sufficiently large burden of debt and other mandatory expenditure. It also depends on the elasticity of the working-age population to the tax burden, which in turn will depend both on the underlying economics \u2014 is there a strongly downward-sloping demand for labor, or is it highly elastic? \u2014 and on things like the willingness of workers to move, which may depend on culture and language.\n\nPortugal, with its long tradition of outmigration, may be more vulnerable than most, but I have no idea whether it\u2019s really in that zone.\n\nOne thing you might wonder is whether currency union makes any difference here. Can\u2019t adverse shocks produce emigration and a death spiral regardless of currency regime? Yes, but. With a flexible exchange rate, adverse shocks will cause depreciation and a fall in real wages; under a currency union, they will produce unemployment for an extended period, until the grinding process of internal devaluation restores competitiveness. And everything I\u2019ve seen says that migration is much more sensitive to unemployment than to wage differentials.\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that emigration in an economy with mass unemployment doesn\u2019t immediately reduce the tax base, since the marginal worker wouldn\u2019t have been employed anyway. But it sets things up for longer-run deterioration.\n\nOh, and Lisbon is really lovely despite all \u2014 and seems, justifiably, to be attracting a lot of tourists, which surely helps.\n\nNow off to my friends\u2019 house.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151212050642, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 12, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Debt and Demographic Debt Spirals ( 20151212 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Portuguese thoughts.", "title": "Debt and Demographic Debt Spirals", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/debt-and-demographic-debt-spirals/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Portuguese thoughts.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 12, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1449914802, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T10:06:42-05:00"}, "utime": 20151212100642, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151212, "pdate": 20151212, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Portuguese thoughts.", "title": "Debt and Demographic Debt Spirals", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/debt-and-demographic-debt-spirals/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/debt-and-demographic-debt-spirals/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Debt and Demographic Debt Spirals", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "If bad times cause one country\u2019s workers to leave in large numbers, who will service its debt and care for its retirees?\nIf the work force falls through emigration, servicing this debt will require higher taxes on those who remain, which could lead to more emigration, and so on.\nIt obviously depends on having a sufficiently large burden of debt and other mandatory expenditure.\nIndeed, it\u2019s easy conceptually to see how a country could enter a demographic death spiral.\nOh, and Lisbon is really lovely despite all \u2014 and seems, justifiably, to be attracting a lot of tourists, which surely helps."}
