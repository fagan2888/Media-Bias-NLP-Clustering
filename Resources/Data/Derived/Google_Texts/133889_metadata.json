We found plans in San Diego County that only gave you access to 10 dermatologists.\"\n\nThe root of the problem is that extra benefits offered on healthcare.gov were so expensive the only thing insurers could do to hold down costs was clamp down on providers.\n\n\"I found counties, for example, again in California, where the nearest urologist was 90 miles away,\" says AEI's Gottlieb. \"So if you think of the range of conditions, which you might need to see a urologist, sometimes you're not going to be able to drive 90 miles to see one.\"\n\nMatthew Eyles of the consulting firm Avalere Health says, \"Price is paramount when you're talking about a consumer market. The premiums are the first thing that a consumer sees, and for better or worse, many of them are making decisions based on premium rather than looking at the total cost of the plan and the provider network.\"\n\nThe end result is plans that employ a version of rationing -- either by distance or long wait times to get an appointment.\n\n\"You're promised a lot of benefits on paper, but when you go to try to schedule an appointment to actually get access to the services, you can't get that appointment,\" says Gottlieb.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have to drive farther, the list of specialists is much narrower,\" says Jim Capretta. \"It\u2019s going to feel a lot more like a public insurance program. A lot like Medicaid in terms of the selection of physicians and hospitals.\"\n\nBut Medicaid, health care for the poor, has notoriously bad access to doctors because it pays so little -- not exactly the way ObamaCare was advertised.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
