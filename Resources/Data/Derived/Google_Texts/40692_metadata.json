The Affordable Care Act, the national health care plan designed to increase the accessibility and affordability of health insurance, will provide coverage of pre-existing medical conditions to those who were previously uninsurable. The number of U.S. medical school graduates specializing in primary care has dropped precipitously in the past two decades, resulting in a dearth of family practice physicians.\n\nAmid all this turmoil, Ivy Alexander remains calm and focused. Alexander, clinical professor and director of advanced practice nursing in UConn\u2019s School of Nursing, is encouraged about the expanding role of nurse practitioners in an increasingly complex medical landscape.\n\n\u201cAs medical professionals,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are recognizing that on a national level, advanced practice nurses [APNs, those with master\u2019s degrees and board certification in a specialty area] are part of the solution to the health care access crisis. The only way that patients are going to get the care they need is if all parts of the medical team, including APNs, midwives, physician\u2019s assistants, physicians, and others, come together as partners.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cIt\u2019s not that nurse practitioners are going to replace any other clinicians. That\u2019s not our goal. But advanced practice nurses are extraordinarily well prepared to provide primary care. They are trained in managing multiple types of health problems and in promoting a healthy lifestyle. With the current challenges in patient care, I can only see the role of the nurse practitioner increasing.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s enthusiasm for nursing as a profession is partially what brought her to UConn from her previous position as professor of nursing and director of the adult, family, gerontological, and women\u2019s health primary care specialty at Yale.\n\n\u201cI looked at this position [at UConn] as an opportunity to work with a really dedicated faculty,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are superior clinicians who are devoted to their students and to the growth of our various programs \u2013 at all academic levels, from the bachelor\u2019s degree up through doctoral degrees in nursing. Our instructors, almost all of whom are also in clinical practice, reflect the commitment the School of Nursing has made to its students.\u201d\n\nShe says she was also attracted by the fact that UConn offers both master\u2019s level and doctoral level entry into its advanced practice programs. \u201cThat makes UConn different from many other nursing schools and it allows students to pick a course of study that really fits their career objectives. The growth of these programs has been steady, and this year we have 21 DNP [doctoral] students and 119 master\u2019s level students \u2013 that\u2019s quite an achievement.\u201d\n\nIn discussing the complexities of delivering quality health care, Alexander cites the findings of a 2010 Institute of Medicine report on the future of nursing that said nurses can and should play a fundamental role as the United States transforms its health care system.\n\n\u201cNurse practitioners can work independently in primary care settings and in acute care settings,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cThey can really help modulate health care costs by educating patients and providing front line primary care. They are already an integral part of the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) system providing care to the nation\u2019s veterans, and that role is expanding.\u201d\n\nAlexander points out that when students graduate from UConn\u2019s School of Nursing, they will be entering a profession that is in the midst of some seismic changes. She notes that nurses are playing a vital role in maximizing health care resources in this country.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we are in danger of losing in an era of specialization is the long-term relationship that physicians in family practice have traditionally had with their patients,\u201d she says, \u201cand nurse practitioners, who are on the front line of patient care, will help to maintain that continuity.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s research interests have focused on the areas of translation and dissemination of culturally relevant, evidence-based information and self-care strategies for midlife women, particularly in the areas of menopause and osteoporosis.\n\nShe has written two books for lay audiences that are widely read and have been translated into several languages: 100 Questions and Answers about Menopause (2005) and 100 Questions and Answers about Osteoporosis and Osteopenia (2009), both published by Jones and Bartlett. In addition, she is a Fellow in the American Academy of Nursing and has provided leadership to the National Association of Nurse Practitioners in the area of women\u2019s health, as founding chair of the organization\u2019s research committee.\n\nHer belief in the role that nurses play in providing quality health care is highlighted by an anecdote she relates.\n\nOne of her research studies on primary care of women included conducting focus groups with middle-aged black women discussing how they perceived midlife health risks and what they were doing to modify those risks. The women said that they got most of their health-related information from Oprah, their women friends, and the Internet.\n\n\u201cI was really alarmed,\u201d Alexander says, \u201cand right then and there I decided that one of the most important roles of nursing was the delivery of accurate, research-based information, as well as prompt patient care, to people who might not otherwise be getting what they need from the medical establishment.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, APNs and MDs work hand in hand, she says. \u201cFreeing up our colleagues to do the things they are best at \u2013 while we do the things we are best at \u2013 is a win-win situation. In the end, the person who benefits the most is the patient, and that\u2019s as it should be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "UConn Today", "description": "UConn's School of Nursing is helping prepare practitioners who will play a vital role in maximizing health care resources.", "title": "An Expanding Role for Nurse Practitioners - UConn Today", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://uconn-today.universityofconn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Alexander140116a010.jpg", "height": 420}, "updated_time": "2015-12-08T22:24:09-04:00", "url": "http://today.uconn.edu/2014/02/an-expanding-role-for-nurse-practitioners/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UConn's School of Nursing is helping prepare practitioners who will play a vital role in maximizing health care resources.", "creator": "@uconn", "image": "http://uconn-today.universityofconn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Alexander140116a010.jpg", "title": "An Expanding Role for Nurse Practitioners - UConn Today", "site": "@uconn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UConn/", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "UConn Health", "published_time": "2014-02-04T08:50:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T22:24:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc784\"", "article_summary": "Alexander, clinical professor and director of advanced practice nursing in UConn\u2019s School of Nursing, is encouraged about the expanding role of nurse practitioners in an increasingly complex medical landscape.\n\u201cNurse practitioners can work independently in primary care settings and in acute care settings,\u201d Alexander says.\n\u201cThey can really help modulate health care costs by educating patients and providing front line primary care.\nHer belief in the role that nurses play in providing quality health care is highlighted by an anecdote she relates.\nShe notes that nurses are playing a vital role in maximizing health care resources in this country."}
