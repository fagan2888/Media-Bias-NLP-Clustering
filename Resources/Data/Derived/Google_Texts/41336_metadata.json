CNN host Wolf Blitzer suggested this indicated a \u201csoftening\u201d on a key issue and perhaps an attempt to pivot toward the middle for a general election.\n\n\u201cHe now says that\u2019s a suggestion,\u201d Blitzer said. \u201cHe seems to be softening his position on tax policy. Is he now moving away from the right, shall we say, towards the center as he worries about a general election? Because that\u2019s what regular politicians, as you know, do.\u201d\n\nPierson, strangely, invoked Obama\u2019s infamous health care promise about doctors that was later proven to be false. Obama also consistently promised no Americans would lose their health care plans if they liked them, which also turned out not to be true.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Pierson said. \u201cWhat Mr. Trump is saying is that yes, all of his policies are suggestions like any other candidate. We all recall that time when if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Guess what? That actually didn\u2019t say the policy.\u201d\n\nPierson said \u201cMr. Trump is just being very honest with voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has not back-pedaled on his Muslim ban,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said he would back off of it in an instant if things have taken place to where we could properly vet individuals, so this media outcry of how Trump has somehow backed off of his Muslim ban, I find quite absurd because that is just simply not the case.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Katrina Pierson compared Donald Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country to President Obama's false Obamacare promise Friday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson compared Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country to President Obama's false Obamacare promise that \u201cif you like your doctor, yo", "title": "Pierson Compares Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban Proposal to Obama\u2019s False \u2018Keep Your Doctor\u2019 Promise", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/pierson-trumps-muslim-ban-proposal-obamas-false-doctor-promise/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson compared Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from e", "creator": "@DavidRutz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Pierson Compares Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban Proposal to Obama\u2019s False \u2018Keep Your Doctor\u2019 Promise", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Trump is just being very honest with voters.\u201d\u201cHe has not back-pedaled on his Muslim ban,\u201d she said.\nOn The Today Show earlier in the day, Trump said he was \u201calways flexible on issues\u201d and that his proposed Muslim ban was merely a \u201csuggestion\u201d from a presidential candidate.\nBY: Follow @DavidRutzDonald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson compared Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country to President Obama\u2019s false Obamacare promise that \u201cif you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\u201d in a CNN appearance Friday.\nWe all recall that time when if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\u201cWhat Mr. Trump is saying is that yes, all of his policies are suggestions like any other candidate."}
