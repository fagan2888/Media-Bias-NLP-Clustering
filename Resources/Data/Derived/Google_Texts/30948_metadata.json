That\u2019s just south of High Point - and 88.6 miles from downtown Raleigh.\n\nThe name on the race website was changed Tuesday from the \u201cRaleigh\u201d mud run to the \u201cRaleigh-Greensboro\u201d mud run.\n\nPlenty of angry racers contacted 5 On Your Side after they said organizers pointed to a written policy that \"aims to have venues within 90 miles of the advertised market.\" They were told the policy means the entry fees of up to $75 per person will not be refunded.\n\n\u201cI would have never signed up if I knew it was going to be someplace, like, outside of Greensboro,\" runner Kim Foresta said. \"I'm not thinking of driving an hour and a half and getting back in the car with mud all over me.\u201d\n\nRace organizers said they were bombarded with calls Tuesday and offered to waive parking fees at the event. They are also looking into transportation options for registered runners.\n\nTia Mattson, chief marketing officer with Dirty Girl Mud Run, said the group is \u201ctrying to take special consideration when possible\u201d in issuing refunds. About 2,000 people have signed up for the run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our policy to do mass refunds,\u201d she said. \u201c(We\u2019re) planning to contact every one that reached out to us.\u201d\n\nMattson said Archdale was chosen because there was no suitable or available venue in Raleigh for the date of the run. She said the company did not mean to misrepresent the area.\n\n5 On Your Side\u2019s Monica Laliberte said the incident should serve as a reminder for runners to check policies before they sign up and make sure the venue is clearly mapped out.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-02-04 18:45:00", "description": "The Dirty Girl Mud Run is a 5K obstacle course for women that was supposed to be held in Raleigh in May.
