This concept became an important part of the care redesign innovation opportunities built into the national strategy developed as a result of the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nIn a new study in the June 2015 issue of The Milbank Quarterly, an IHI team that has played a leading role helping organizations pursue the Triple Aim looks at how this work has progressed in the last seven years\u2014specifically, why some organizations have made progress implementing the Triple Aim and others have not. They describe three principles that are essential for health care organizations to successfully pursue the Triple Aim. The paper highlights numerous examples from around the country and the world, of health systems or communities that are making progress\u2014and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\n\u201cThe Triple Aim has had an influence beyond our wildest dreams\u2014in the nation and around the world,\u201d states John W. Whittington, one of the framework\u2019s original architects, and lead author of the study with IHI Senior Fellow Kevin Nolan, IHI Executive Director Ninon Lewis, and IHI Senior VP Trissa Torres. \u201cIt\u2019s the configuration that has caught on\u2014a simple framework focusing on three goals simultaneously.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2007, IHI began recruiting organizations from around the world to participate in a collaborative to implement what became known as the IHI Triple Aim. The 141 participating organizations included health care systems, hospitals, insurance companies, and others in health care. Other groups were represented, such as public health agencies, social service groups, and community coalitions. IHI\u2019s work with the collaborative provided a structure for observational research.\n\nFindings\n\nThe three principles essential for health care organizations to successfully pursue the Triple Aim:\n\nCreate the right foundation for population management\n\nFocus on a population or populations for which all three dimensions of the Triple Aim are important. Populations were chosen for economic, geographic or medical reasons. Overall, the IHI team noted that there was much success with enrolled populations (groups of individuals who are receiving care within a health system).\n\nManage services at scale for the population\n\nAssess the needs and assets of the population\u2014and create a portfolio of projects that meet the needs of this population.\n\nEstablish a learning system to drive and sustain the work\n\nBuild a learning system that fosters testing and provides feedback loops to compare performance with specific aims and measures for a specific population.\n\nAbout The Milbank Quarterly\n\nContinuously published since 1923, The Milbank Quarterly features peer-reviewed original research, policy review, and analysis from academics, clinicians, and policymakers. The Quarterly\u2019s multidisciplinary approach and commitment to applying the best empirical research to practical policymaking offer in-depth assessments of the social, economic, historical, legal, and ethical dimensions of health and health care policy. The Milbank Quarterly is published in March, June, September, and December on behalf of the Milbank Memorial Fund by John Wiley & Sons. www.milbank.org/the-milbank-quarterly\n\nAbout the Institute for Healthcare Improvement\n\nIHI is a leading innovator in health and health care improvement worldwide.
