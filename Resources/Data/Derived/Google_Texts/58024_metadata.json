But his statements about Medicaid have shifted over time. Early in his campaign, he said he would reverse the Medicaid expansion completely. More recently, including in several interviews since Election Day, he has said he would seek federal permission to tighten eligibility for the program and impose more rules and costs on the so-called expansion population.\n\nMany patients at Family Health Centers said they had heard little about any of his health care plans. But with Mr. Bevin preparing to take office, they were starting to ask questions.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne state that may offer a view of their future is neighboring Indiana. There, Gov. Mike Pence, also a Republican, agreed to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level, but only after winning federal permission to impose requirements on recipients that go well beyond the program\u2019s normal rules.\n\nMost significant, Indiana requires enrollees with incomes above the poverty level to make monthly payments, averaging about $11, toward their coverage. If they stop making these payments, they can lose dental and vision coverage or even be dropped from Medicaid temporarily.\n\nFor now, Kentuckians on Medicaid owe nothing for their coverage except minimal co-payments, typically $1 to $4, for certain drugs and services. But Mr. Bevin has repeatedly pointed to Indiana as an example of how Medicaid should work.\n\nMr. Jefferson, who works temporary jobs for minimum wage and has fallen into homelessness twice over the last two years, said his ability to pay would depend on how much work he could find and whether his chronic pain from working as a mover when he was younger would get in the way. He said he might be able to afford $30 a month.\n\n\u201cWhen I do find work, you\u2019re talking roughly 50-some dollars a day,\u201d Mr. Jefferson said. \u201cBut maybe, maybe I could do it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Osborne, who suffers from chronic pain from a series of on-the-job falls, said he had not worked recently because of a diagnosis of bladder cancer last year. But he had an offer from a boatbuilding company, and had come to ask for a doctor\u2019s note attesting that he could perform the work. Medicaid, he said, had saved his life when he used it for kidney stones care last year and the doctor found bladder cancer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t cost me a dime \u2014 the specialists, the hospitals, the surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the time \u2014 no money, no job, no nothing \u2014 I couldn\u2019t ask for better.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Bevin has softened his tone on the expanded Medicaid program, he has continued to say that the expansion as it stands now is unaffordable. The federal government is paying the full cost through next year, but Kentucky will have to start bearing a small share of it in 2017, growing to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nThe administration of his Democratic predecessor, Steven L. Beshear, has estimated that Kentucky\u2019s cost of covering the new Medicaid enrollees will start at $74 million in 2017 and grow to $363 million by 2021. But Mr. Bevin has called those estimates, from a state-commissioned report by Deloitte Consulting, \u201cnonsense.\u201d He has also dismissed Deloitte\u2019s finding that the expense of covering the new enrollees would be more than offset by the positive economic effects of expanding Medicaid.\n\nFor Bill Wagner, the chief executive of Family Health Centers, Mr. Bevin\u2019s election was \u201ca blow to the gut.\u201d The number of uninsured patients at the organization\u2019s seven clinics had dropped to 17 percent, he said, from 51 percent in 2013. While better than a complete repeal of the Medicaid expansion, the Indiana model might lead to financially fragile people losing coverage, Mr. Wagner said. Several studies have shown that charging premiums to Medicaid recipients leads to declines in enrollment.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Mr. Bevin did not win Louisville, a Democratic stronghold, Mr. Conway did not win by nearly as big a margin here as Democrats usually do. William Benton, a Family Health Centers patient who voted for Mr. Conway, said he was not an inspiring candidate even for committed Democrats.\n\n\u201cA lot of people felt really justified not voting,\u201d said Mr. Benton, a musician and part-time bakery worker who signed up for Medicaid this month to get help for his depression.\n\nAnd in a state where approval of President Obama hovers around 34 percent, enthusiasm for the health law is lacking even among some who stand to benefit from it. Rick Prario, 54, learned at Family Health Centers this month that he was eligible for Medicaid after losing his longtime job at a hardware store. But he was still furious about having to pay the law\u2019s tax penalty for going uninsured in 2014, when he was still working.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey could take Obamacare and get rid of it, and it would never bother me one bit,\u201d said Mr. Prario, who had been skipping treatment for diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis.\n\nMr. Prario, who did not vote in the election, said he hoped to qualify for disability soon because he saw it as a surer thing than Medicaid.\n\nAt another Family Health Centers clinic, Laura Miles, 49, was trying to sign up her husband for a subsidized private plan through Kentucky\u2019s online insurance exchange, and hating the law more with each passing minute. Her problem was a glitch that barred her husband from getting premium subsidies because the law considers her employer-sponsored insurance affordable. But adding her husband, a salvage yard worker with debilitating headaches, to that plan would bring her portion of the cost to $650 a month \u2014 impossibly expensive, Mrs. Miles said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s not right,\u201d said Mrs. Miles, a Democrat who voted for Mr. Bevin.\n\nSuch sentiments are familiar to Mr. Osborne. He said he knew a lot of people who despise the Affordable Care Act because they have to pay for their health insurance and resent people getting it for free. Having been on both sides, he has a different view.\n\n\u201cWhen I go back to work and have to pay something for my insurance, I won\u2019t holler and pout about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember the time this government insurance saved my life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151127175914, "twitter": {"description": "The only Southern state to embrace the Affordable Care Act appears headed in a different direction under a new governor, Matt Bevin.", "title": "Kentucky, Beacon for Health Law, Now a Lab for Its Retreat", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/kentucky-beacon-for-health-law-now-a-lab-for-its-retreat.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004054866"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "abbygoodnough", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/27/us/00kentucky-web01/00kentucky-web01-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/kentucky-beacon-for-health-law-now-a-lab-for-its-retreat.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004054866", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/kentucky-beacon-for-health-law-now-a-lab-for-its-retreat.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Kentucky, Beacon for Health Law, Becomes a Lab for Its Retreat", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 27, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Remaking Medicine (Series)", "keywords": "Series,Kentucky,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Bevin  Matthew,Medicaid,Health Insurance and Managed Care,HealthCare.gov,Remaking Medicine (Series)", "news_keywords": "Kentucky,Medicaid,HealthCare.gov", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Abby Goodnough", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/27/us/00kentucky-web01/00kentucky-web01-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Bevin, Matthew", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ABBY GOODNOUGH", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The only Southern state to embrace the Affordable Care Act appears headed in a different direction under a new governor, Matt Bevin.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/27/us/00kentucky-web01/00kentucky-web01-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The only Southern state to embrace the Affordable Care Act appears headed in a different direction under a new governor, Matt Bevin.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Kentucky", "slug": "28kentucky", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151204131206, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/kentucky-beacon-for-health-law-now-a-lab-for-its-retreat.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/27/us/00kentucky-web01/00kentucky-web01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The only Southern state to embrace the Affordable Care Act appears headed in a different direction under a new governor, Matt Bevin.", "title": "Kentucky, Beacon for Health Law, Now a Lab for Its Retreat"}, "pdate": 20151127, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/abby_goodnough/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-12-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Remaking Medicine (Series)", "published": "2015-11-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "articleid": 100000004054866, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Kentucky, Beacon for Health Law, Now a Lab for Its Retreat", "col": "Remaking Medicine", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Many patients at Family Health Centers said they had heard little about any of his health care plans.\nWilliam Benton, a Family Health Centers patient who voted for Mr. Conway, said he was not an inspiring candidate even for committed Democrats.\nBut with Mr. Bevin preparing to take office, they were starting to ask questions.\nRick Prario, 54, learned at Family Health Centers this month that he was eligible for Medicaid after losing his longtime job at a hardware store.\nPhotoWhile Mr. Bevin did not win Louisville, a Democratic stronghold, Mr. Conway did not win by nearly as big a margin here as Democrats usually do."}
