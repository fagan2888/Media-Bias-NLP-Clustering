A separate report issued by the White House estimated that nearly 10,000 Colorado jobs would be at risk if nothing was done; state transportation officials also have raised the possibility of potential delays to Interstate 25 work.\n\nYet in spite of these and other warnings, lawmakers so far have failed to agree on how they should refill the highway piggy bank.\n\nThe latest expectation, at least among Beltway insiders, is that Congress will pass a short-term fix that pumps a few more billion dollars into the Highway Trust Fund before legislators depart for their annual August recess.\n\nNevertheless, the last-minute negotiations have raised the stress level of state transportation officials \u2014 who have watched other big deals fall apart \u2014 and cast doubt on the ability of Washington policymakers to eventually develop a long-term fix.\n\n\u201cA short-term solution is better than no solution,\u201d said Tony Milo, executive director of the Colorado Contractors Association.\n\nStill, he said the whole process was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and urged lawmakers to find a new method of financing the Highway Trust Fund, which has been hemorrhaging money for years. Last year, the account took in about $37 billion but distributed about $50 billion \u2014 a $13 billion deficit.\n\n\u201cCongress absolutely needs to get serious about a long-term, fully funded transportation bill,\u201d Milo said.\n\nThe U.S. House took the first step toward a stopgap fix last week when it passed a $10.8 billion funding bill to bail out the Highway Trust Fund for another 10 months.\n\nBut the Senate has yet to pass its own version \u2014 an uncertainty that has prompted officials at the Colorado Department of Transportation to think about a Plan B.\n\nThe state agency gets about 40 percent of its $1.3 billion budget from the Highway Trust Fund, and any long-term disruption could cripple its ability to pay for future projects.\n\nAmy Ford, an agency spokeswoman, said the state could endure a few months without federal funding before it would be forced to delay one or more upcoming projects.\n\nWhile no decision has been made on which projects would be affected, she noted that future plans call for adding an express lane in each direction on Interstate 25 near Northglenn from 120th Avenue north to around Colorado 7. The agency also is looking at upgrading I-25 interchanges at both Fillmore Street in Colorado Springs and Arapahoe Road in Arapahoe County, she said.\n\nBut if Congress doesn\u2019t act by the end of the year, \u201cwe might put them on hold until things are better resolved,\u201d Ford added.\n\nThat type of lengthy impasse is unlikely, although Ford and other transportation officials warned that even the temporary fix now under consideration in Congress \u2014 the latest of many \u2014 only puts a patch on a much deeper problem.\n\nThe primary method of funding the Highway Trust Fund, a gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn\u2019t been adjusted since 1993.\n\nIn the 21 years since then, inflation has eroded its buying power while the improved fuel efficiency of cars has chipped away at the rate of money going into the fund. A similar problem is affecting Colorado\u2019s own 22-cent gas tax, which hasn\u2019t been increased since 1991.\n\nIn both cases \u2014 but especially at the federal level \u2014 lawmakers are reluctant to raise the rate because political opponents could use the move as campaign fodder.\n\nBut something must be done, said transit experts, or Congress will be faced with the stark choice of continually rescuing the Highway Trust Fund or allowing the nation\u2019s roads and bridges to slowly deteriorate.\n\nAccording to the White House, 17 percent of the nearly 90,000 miles of public roads in Colorado are in poor condition.\n\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t raise the gas tax, lawmakers have other options \u2014 from fees on imported oil to a new tax structure that would bill drivers for mileage, and not gallons consumed.\n\nAny proposal, however, must survive a congressional vote, a dicey proposition even when Republicans and Democrats are working together, which has not been the case very often this session.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely heavy lift in the current fiscal and political climate,\u201d said Joung Lee, of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.\n\nIndeed, even the fix that passed the U.S. House last week by a 367-55 vote found an opponent in the Colorado delegation: U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cThis short-term, status-quo bill relies on budget gimmicks and fee increases a decade in the future and does nothing to address the structural problems plaguing our broken Highway Trust Fund,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMark K.
