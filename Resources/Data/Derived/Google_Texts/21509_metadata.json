In fact, it already stands as one history\u2019s most successful pieces of public policy in reducing a racial disparity. Ad Policy\n\nIn its first year of full implementation, from 2013 to 2014, Obamacare reduced the white uninsured rate by 2.6 percentage points. However, its impact among African Americans has been nearly double that number: a reduction of 4.5 percentage points. This faster rate of decline for blacks has narrowed the gap with whites in health insurance coverage to 3.6 percentage points. In 2014, Obamacare increased the number of black people with health insurance by about 1.5 million.\n\nThe real remarkable stat, however, is seen among African-American children. Obamacare has eliminated the disparity between them and white children. In 2013, the uninsured rate for black children was 6.9 percent and 5.5 for white children. In 2014, the uninsured rate for both groups fell to 4.9 percent. While zero percent uninsured is the ideal, 4.9 percent is a relatively low rate. Hispanic and Native American children have uninsured rates of about twice that percentage.\n\nTo paraphrase Vice President Joe Biden, Obamacare\u2019s impact on African Americans is kind of a big deal. It is not easy to eliminate a racial disparity, even a relatively small one like the black-white health insurance gap for children. The sad reality is that people have been struggling for several decades with most of the issues racial justice advocates are still working on today.

Many people will think of the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative as a race-conscious effort. There has been a fair amount of discussion and debate about this initiative\u2014perhaps too much. The attention that the initiative has received exceeds its significance. No doubt many important and useful activities will occur under My Brother\u2019s Keeper, but it has too meager resources and too broad goals to move the needle on any disparity nationally.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Obama_State-of-Union-Address_Jan12_AP_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Algernon Austin", "description": "Few people think of the Affordable Care Act as an historic effort to bring about racial equity, but that is what it is turning out to be.
