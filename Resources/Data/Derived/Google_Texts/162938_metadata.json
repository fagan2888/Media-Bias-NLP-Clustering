Last year alone, seven states enacted eight new choice programs and nine states expanded 13 existing choice programs.\n\nData Source: Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice\n\nIn the last decade, the number of students receiving vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, or ESAs has more than tripled. Indeed, the number of students participating in educational choice programs has increased tenfold since 2001.\n\nData Source: Alliance for School Choice\n\nThe growth is impressive, but compared to the enrollment in traditional district schools, it looks more like John Kasich\u2019s delegate count. (Apologies to any stray Ricochetti who are feelin\u2019 the Kasich-mentum.) In 2015, the number of US students participating in private educational choice programs was only 0.7 percent of the number enrolled in district schools. You\u2019ll need your reading glasses to see the small blue slivers representing choice program enrollment in the chart below.\n\nData Source: National Center for Education Statistics\n\nNevertheless, opponents of school choice often decry these programs as \u201cthe camel\u2019s nose under the tent,\u201d to which I respond: if only! In reality, most private school choice programs are more like a camel\u2019s whisker.\n\nConsider some of the most recently adopted choice programs.\n\nMaryland just enacted a school voucher program for low-income students with a budget of $5 million. That might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a drop in the ocean next to the more than $13 billion Maryland\u2019s district school system spends annually. Roughly 1,000 low-income Maryland students could receive a voucher next year, which is great for them, but doesn\u2019t do anything for the other 99.9 percent of Maryland\u2019s 880,000 district school students.\n\nBack in March, South Dakota enacted scholarship tax credit program with a total budget cap of $2 million, which could provide up to 500 students with scholarships worth $4,000. Again, it\u2019s a good start, but what about the other 99.6 percent of South Dakota\u2019s 131,000 district school students?\n\nLast year, Montana also created a scholarship tax credit, but the program is hobbled by absurd restrictions. As in 16 other states, taxpayers receive tax credits for donations to nonprofit scholarship organizations. However, Montana not only caps the total number of credits at $3 million, it also caps the amount of each credit-eligible donation at $150, meaning that a single $5,000 scholarship will require 34 donors. No other state has such a restrictive per-donor credit cap. For scholarship organizations to raise enough funds to provide 600 students with $5,000 scholarships, they\u2019ll need at least 20,000 donors.\n\nThese programs are better than nothing, but they\u2019re far from the transformative markets in education that Milton Friedman envisioned decades ago. Of the recent educational choice laws, the closest is Nevada\u2019s nearly universal ESA for students switching out of their district schools, but several leftist groups immediately filed multiple lawsuits against it and a judge halted implementation pending the state supreme court\u2019s decision. However, most of the recent choice programs will merely fill empty seats at some private schools, but won\u2019t do much to spur growth or foster the sort of innovation and competition that we see in robust markets.\n\nEducational choice advocates should not be satisfied merely to \u201cput states on the map.\u201d When a smiling governor signs a bill that won\u2019t even provide enough scholarships for all the students standing on the stage with him, we should offer one cheer, or perhaps even two, but certainly not three. We should praise him for enacting a \u201cpilot program\u201d that is \u201ca good start\u201d but we must keep our eyes on the prize: a system that provides educational choice to every student.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Ricochet", "description": "In the era of Obamacare, EPA overreach, and job-killing minimum wage increases, the spread of educational choice policies seems like one of the few areas where conservatives and libertarians are succeeding.
