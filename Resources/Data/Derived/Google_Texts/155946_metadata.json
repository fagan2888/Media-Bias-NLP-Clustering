We will have to wait and see, while continuing to monitor and analyze the policy's impact,\" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine offers tips for healthy eating when dining out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/vitamins-and-nutrition-information-27/dieting-to-lose-weight-health-news-195/breaking-brief-emb-11-2-4pm-et-menus-calorie-labeling-nyc-langone-release-704781.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/FSF025H.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Affordable Care Act requires nationwide menu labeling in 2016", "title": "Fast-Food Menus With Calorie Counts Not Changing New Yorkers' Habits"}, "description": "Affordable Care Act requires nationwide menu labeling in 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "In the 2008 survey, calorie consumption averaged 783 per meal at restaurants with calorie counts and 756 per meal at restaurants without calorie counts.\nCalorie consumption in the 2013-14 survey averaged between 804 and 839 per meal at restaurants with calorie counts, and between 802 and 857 per meal at restaurants without calorie counts.\nIn 2008, New York City ordered chain restaurants to provide customers with calorie counts of menu items.\nThe findings suggest that menu calorie information alone is not enough to lower obesity rates, the NYU Langone Medical Center researchers said.\nThe findings could provide an early indication of the possible impact of nationwide menu labeling to be introduced in December 2016 under the Affordable Care Act."}
