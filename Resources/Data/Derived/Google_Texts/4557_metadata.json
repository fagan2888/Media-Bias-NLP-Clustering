He also said hitching Alice Hyde\u2019s wagon to a bigger team is an important strategy as big policy changes like the Affordable Care Act take root. \"With all the change and evolution that's happening in healthcare these days, particularly in the way that hospitals are going to be paid for the care they provide, and moving toward an outcomes-based reimbursement model, it's going to be criticall important for hospitals to have scale,\" DiVello said.\n\nPart of a growing trend\n\nHospitals in Elizabethtown and Plattsburgh have already joined UVM\u2019s network. In 2013, Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital CEO Stephens Mundy in Plattsburgh said, establishing a broader base of affiliation is crucial for hospitals. \"The ones that scare me are the organizations that are in the very rural areas that are totally unaffiliated or loosely affiliated and are struggling. That keeps me up all the time,\" Mundy said.\n\nHealthcare impact that affects big employers\n\nThese changes matter to healthcare, but also to local jobs. Hospitals are often the biggest private sector employers in their communities. Alice Hyde employs roughly 600 people in Malone. Doug DiVello said this partnership with UVM won\u2019t cost jobs \u2014 he said he hopes it will actually mean his hospital will grow. \"My objective is to see that job security actually improves as the success of Alice Hyde Medical Center benefits from this formal affiliation,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A third hospital in New York's North Country has established closer ties with the University of Vermont Health Network.
