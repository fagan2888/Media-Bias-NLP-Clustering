Last Thursday night, President Obama unveiled plans for immigration reform, and literally challenged Congress to stop him. The next day, Speaker of the House John Boehner said that the GOP would be suing the White House over unconstitutional changes to the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s a mess.\n\nBut for science\u2014and scientific research\u2014there\u2019s a silver lining. The House Committee on Appropriations, which bankrolls the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA, recently appointed two relatively science-friendly chairmen to powerful subcommittee seats.\n\nIn D.C. parlance, subcommittee chairs are known as \u201ccardinals,\u201d and in the powerful Appropriations committee, cardinals decide when the government spends and where it cuts. On Wednesday, Appropriations Chair Hal Rogers announced that Tom Cole would take over as cardinal of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and tapped John Culberson to be cardinal of Commerce, Justice and Science. Here\u2019s what that means for science:\n\nRepresentative Tom Cole (R-OK)\n\nTom Cole will be the cardinal in charge of Health and Human Services, which means that he\u2019ll be one of the key people holding the purse strings for the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is the largest source of funding for biomedical research in the world, and it gets its budget almost entirely from Congress.\n\nCole\u2019s appointment is a victory for the NIH. In 2007, Cole co-sponsored a bill to establish a national childhood cancer database, and in 2008 he voted in favor of the Lantos-Hyde bill, which funded efforts against global diseases like AIDS and malaria. This year, Cole threw his support behind legislation that would remove funds from political party conventions and instead put them toward pediatric disease research.\n\nHis environmental voting record is decidedly less science-friendly. In the past, Cole has voted against protecting wild horses and authorizing the \u201ccritical habitat\u201d title for endangered species. That shouldn\u2019t affect biomedical research. But it is a bit worrying that Cole, who voted against environmental education grants, will be influencing the federal education budget.\n\nRepresentative John Culberson (R-TX)\n\nJohn Culberson will be the cardinal in charge of Commerce, Justice and Science. His appointment has the space community excited\u2014Culberson is an outspoken proponent of a NASA mission to Europa. Culberson\u2019s district is home to NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center, and his new position means that he now has quite a bit of say over NASA\u2019s budget. On his web site, Culberson emphasizes his interest in advancing in spaceflight technologies, like the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion multipurpose crew vehicle.\n\nCommerce, Justice and Science also covers the National Science Foundation, which backs more than 20 percent of the basic research conducted at universities in the U.S. Culberson\u2019s NSF record is exemplary. Of note, Culberson once called science and technology funding a \u201cnational insurance policy\u201d and said that Congress needs to \u201cpour it on.\u201d This, from a well-known fiscal conservative.\n\nUnfortunately, Culberson\u2019s environmental voting record is about as disturbing as Cole\u2019s. That\u2019s bad news for NOAA, which his subcommittee is supposed to fund. It is likely that the NOAA will continue to receive substantial government funding\u2014Culberson has almost never cut scientific research\u2014but it is also likely that the NOAA\u2019s concerns about climate change will fall on deaf ears.\n\nCulberson was, after all, the sponsor of a 2013 amendment that claimed that carbon pollution is zero and produces no harm and no costs. Yikes.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Who Wins?\n\nThe new cardinals are basically good news for scientific research, with a few important exceptions. To sum it all up, here are your winners and losers:\n\nSpace Science: Win\n\nCulberson supports NASA, and loves Europa.\n\nBasic Science: Win\n\nCulberson supports the NSF, and loves basic research.\n\nBiomedical Research: Win\n\nCole will almost definitely throw money at the NIH.\n\nSTEM Education: Tie\n\nCole hasn\u2019t been enthusiastic about paying for kids to learn about the environment. At the same time, he has funded scholarship programs for low-income families in the past, and there\u2019s inevitably some STEM in there.\n\nClimate Science: Lose\n\nAt least for NOAA, there\u2019s some irony here. Culberson will probably fund NOAA, and then throw their findings about climate change in the trash.\n\nImage credit: Flickr/Colin Jagoe", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress can be...chaotic.
