Yes, they weren\u2019t detailed; they sounded focus-group tested; and they weren\u2019t different from the language you\u2019ll hear from 90% of Democratic downballot candidates. But they do give you a glimpse of the issues she\u2019ll run on over the next 19 months. And do remember, today is just the fifth day of her campaign. Here\u2019s the list of the seven issues, per NBC\u2019s Emily Gold:\n\nCampaign finance : \u201c[We need to] get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment.\u201d\n\nFree community college for qualified students : \u201cI fully support President Obama\u2019s plan to make community college free.\u201d\n\nExpand pre-K programs to more children : \u201cI think we have to start that in pre-kindergarten. I think we have to give more kids the chance to get ready.\u201d\n\nPaid family leave : We are the last developed country in the world that has no national paid leave for parenting or illness.\u201d\n\nBuilding on Obamacare : Health care: \u201cI am committed to trying to, you know, build on what works in the Affordable Care Act\u2026 Part of what I\u2019ll be doing during the campaign is looking for ways that we keep what works and what\u2019s lowering costs.\u201d\n\nImmigration reform : \u201cWe are really missing out on economic opportunity because we haven\u2019t been able to agree on comprehensive immigration reform\u2026 We are saying to all these other people who want the same dreams and the same aspiration and the same willingness to work hard just like our families did that, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to \u2026 make it legal for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nMake equal pay more enforceable: \u201cWere going to, I hope, continue to push legislation that would make equal pay more enforceable.\u201d\n\n*** Where she will and won\u2019t deviate from Obama: This is all a reminder that Hillary isn\u2019t going to deviate much from President Obama\u2019s agenda \u2014 in fact, it sounds a lot like a rehash of the president\u2019s State of the Union address this year. But there are two places where you will PROBABLY see her deviate from Obama: 1) foreign policy and 2) making Washington work. As Bloomberg\u2019s Josh Green wrote, Hillary can make a convincing case to Democratic voters, and some independents as well, that she has proved she can thrive in times when Republicans control Congress. Then again, that argument does emphasize how long she\u2019s been in Washington.\n\n*** Christie on whether his moment has passed: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d: In an interviewed conducted yesterday, NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie if his political moment has passed \u2013 given the Bridge-gate scandal and Christie\u2019s poor poll numbers among Republicans. Christie\u2019s answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know. And neither do you. We\u2019ll see. But I\u2019ll tell ya this much: I\u2019ve been the frontrunner before.\u201d Christie on the GOP field: \u201cI think a governor is gonna be the nominee, a governor or a former governor \u2014 because I believe that our party and our country need someone who\u2019s actually run something.\u201d On Jeb: \u201cIt seems to me that that train has slowed down pretty significantly from what I\u2019ve seen out and around the country.\u201d On Hillary: \u201cMrs. Clinton\u2019s gonna have to perform. She\u2019s gonna have to earn the nomination. Nobody is handed these things.\u201d\n\n*** A reminder of Christie\u2019s potential: On paper, Chris Christie should already be out of the 2016 presidential race \u2013 our March NBC/WSJ poll found 57% of Republican voters saying they could NOT see themselves supporting him. But the one reason he\u2019s not out of the race is because, to borrow a term from Pat Buchanan, he\u2019s a good political athlete. Christie excels on the stump and in interviews \u2013 like in his sitdown with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer.\n\n*** All-but-assured passage of Corker bill lowers temperature on the Iran negotiations: Turning away from the 2016 race and to the Washington battle over the Iran deal, it is worth noting how the all-but-assured passage of the Corker bill has lowered the DC temperature over the Iran negotiations. Congress is going to get a win over Obama and will have a \u201csay\u201d over the final-final deal. But as we wrote yesterday, it\u2019s UNLIKELY to thwart the deal from happening. The Obama White House probably didn\u2019t intend for this to happen, but the clear congressional \u201cvictory\u201d appears to have calmed things down on Capitol Hill. For now at least.\n\n*** Another Florida Republican declines to run for open Senate seat: Another day, another Florida Republican who has turned down the opportunity to run for Marco Rubio\u2019s open Senate seat. The latest to do so: former state House Speaker Will Weatherford. As Adam Smith from the Tampa Bay Times mused yesterday, \u201cAlways talking about the great bench of candidates for Fla GOP, and yet they can\u2019t seem to find top tier US Sen cand.\u201d This is a problem for Republicans and the NRSC. There is about a 70% chance that a Floridian is going to be on the 2016 presidential ticket, and the 2018 gubernatorial field is going to be crowded, but top-tier folks are declining to run for the Senate seat? Does this say something about the desirability of serving in today\u2019s U.S. Senate?\n\n*** O\u2019Malley speaks at Harvard: Today, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley is delivering an economic speech at Harvard University, and his team has issued this memo in advance of his remarks: \u201cAs he\u2019s traveled across the country, Gov. O\u2019Malley has heard from Democrats that they are looking for leaders who offer strong progressive values, new ideas, and the experience of getting real results. That\u2019s why he has spent the last few weeks getting specific and laying out some of his ideas for how we fix our economy. Already, he\u2019s talked about the need to raise wages, rein in Wall Street, expand Social Security, address the student loan debt crisis, make investments in critical priorities like education, and finally implement commonsense immigration reforms. While some of these ideas might not be popular, he\u2019s more interested in showing leadership than poll testing incremental economic reforms. His record in Maryland is one of real results, and demonstrates that he will not back down from making tough choices.\u201d\n\n*** On the trail: Elsewhere today, Jeb Bush is in Concord, NH; Carly Fiorina attends the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, Rick Perry has a trio of events in New Hampshire; and Joe Biden makes remarks at the National Fire and Emergency Services dinner.\n\n*** Introducing @MTP: Finally, our daily First Read Minute video has a new look \u2013 as well as a new name, @MTP. Follow it on Twitter and check out yesterday\u2019s video.\n\nOBAMA AGENDA: The latest court battle begins\n\nFrom the New York Times: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s most far-reaching regulation to slow climate change will have its first day in court on Thursday, the beginning of what is expected to be a multiyear legal battle over the policy that Mr. Obama hopes to leave as his signature environmental achievement.\u201d\n\nThe president is touting an Asia trade deal opposed by many in his own party, the Washington Post reports. Labor unions are working to turn Democrats against him on the issue, CNN writes.\n\nThe Russian defense minister \u201cblamed the United States and its allies for the conflict in Ukraine, saying their drive to bring Kiev closer to the West was a threat to Moscow and had forced it to react,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin took questions early Thursday, saying sanctions can actually boost the U.S. economy, per the BBC.\n\nReuters writes: \u201cA compromise allowing the U.S. Congress to vote on a nuclear deal with Tehran may prompt Iranian negotiators to drive a harder bargain, but does not drastically weaken President Barack Obama\u2019s ability to deliver on a final agreement.\u201d\n\nBut the deal also puts on display the limits of Obama\u2019s power, The New York Times writes.\n\nGood news for both President Obama and Hillary Clinton: Americans are feeling more optimistic about the economy, according to a new Bloomberg Politics poll.\n\nCONGRESS: Incoming on the Capitol Lawn\n\nThe Washington Post reports on why a Florida man landed a gyrocopter on the Capitol lawn on Thursday, temporarily shuttering the Capitol.\n\nA friend feared the pilot would get shot down.\n\nRepublican leaders are predicting a productive Congress, USA Today reports.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer is poised to break all kinds of fundraising records when he becomes the Senate\u2019s top Dem in 2017, the Hill writes.\n\nLoretta Lynch will need to keep waiting for that confirmation vote, the Huffington Post reports.\n\nOFF TO THE RACES: Clinton Foundation is back in the news\n\nCLINTON: From the Associated Press: \u201cIn spite of criticism over accepting money from foreign governments, the Clinton Foundation has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six. The change in policy comes as former board member Hillary Rodham Clinton undertakes her presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nShe said in a statement on Wednesday that same-sex couples should be able to marry, calling it a \u201cconstitutional right,\u201d NBC\u2019s Carrie Dann reports.\n\nShe paid tribute to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who progressives continue to hope will run for president, in Time\u2019s 100 Most Influential People list.\n\nAnd she didn\u2019t tip at Chipotle, the restaurant manager said.\n\nCHRISTIE: He told TODAY show\u2019s Matt Lauer that he and his wife have not made a decision about 2016. He was in New Hampshire on Wednesday hoping the \u201cTell It Like It Is\u201d town halls will help his potential 2016 run.\n\nBUSH: His brother, former President George W. Bush, weighed in his potential run on Wednesday, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s an easy line to say, \u2018Haven\u2019t we had enough Bushes?\u2019 \u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s why you won\u2019t see me out there, and he doesn\u2019t need to defend me, and he\u2019s totally different from me.\u201d\n\nO\u2019MALLEY: The former Maryland governor took a veiled shot at Clinton on gay marriage in a new video.\n\nGRAHAM: He\u2019s asking why Capitol Police did not shoot down the gyrocopter.\n\nRUBIO: He raised $1.25 million online in his first full day as a candidate, the AP reports.
