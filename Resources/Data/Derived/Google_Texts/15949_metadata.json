A: Wolf Trap Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nOne in a series of candidates\u2019 profiles.\n\nIt\u2019s just weeks before Election Day, and the contest to replace retiring Republican Congressman Frank Wolf in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional district has become one of the most watched, most expensive and most contentious races in the country.\n\nBut on this crisp fall October morning, Republican candidate Barbara Comstock is in her comfort zone.\n\nShe is campaigning door-to-door with Wolf, whom she counts as a longtime friend and mentor, in McLean, her hometown for the past 30 years, which she has represented in the Virginia House of Delegates since 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling great about the race,\u201d said Comstock, her voice a little hoarse from non-stop campaign events. \u201cI thoroughly enjoy meeting people from every walk of life. I\u2019ve been particularly touched by the reaction I get from young women. They notice a woman is out here campaigning.\u201d\n\nComstock is making a point.\n\nShe is aware of the criticism leveled by Democrats who assert that she is part of the GOP's \"War on Women,\" noting Comstock\u2019s vote in favor of the controversial \u201ctrans-vaginal ultrasound\u201d bill in the Virginia legislature.\n\nAnd while Comstock makes no apologies for her strong conservative presence in Richmond, she said she finds it ironic that anyone would label her \"anti-woman.\"\n\n\u201cReally, when I hear that, I think about the fact that I grew up ... surrounded by strong women,\u201d Comstock said. \"I think of my grandfather, who had four girls. He was a real feminist. I remember him telling us 'Don\u2019t let any man keep you down. You can do anything if you work hard enough.\u2019 He lived through the Depression, and was a very proud man. He was never able to go to college, but he was the smartest man I knew.\u201d\n\nComstock said she was inspired to establish a Young Women's Leadership Program in January 2013 after reading Sheryl Sandberg's 2013 book \"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.\u201d In the book, Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, advises women to seek mentors in the workplace and be more assertive with respect to their careers.\n\nAFTER READING THE BOOK, Comstock said, \"I wanted to start a program that provides young women, middle and high school girls, to meet and connect with professional women from a variety of sectors.\"\n\nSince the leadership program began, approximately 60 girls throughout McLean, Great Falls, Vienna and Loudoun County have participated, meeting professional women such as Donna Brazile, CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist; Erin Egan, chief privacy officer for Facebook, and Bobbie Kilberg, president and CEO of the Northern Virginia Technology Council.\n\nThe program was \u201cincredible and unforgettable\u201d said Danielle Hayden, a junior at Potomac Falls High School in Sterling. \"This program reassured me that there is opportunity everywhere you go in many fields, whether it is government service, running a small business or working for a government agency like NASA.\"\n\nComstock grew up in Springfield, Mass., but remembers the influence of her first visit to Virginia, a third grade family trip to Colonial Williamsburg.\n\nShe remembers sitting in the historic Capitol building \u2014 in the town where Jefferson studied law with George Wythe \u2014 and thinking for the first time that she could be a lawyer too.\n\n\u201cI think that was the first time I wanted to be a lawyer \u2026 I was struck by how these ordinary people did such extraordinary things.\u201d\n\nThe trip was typical of the influence of her mother, Sally Burns, a long-serving teacher and school administrator. \u201cWe would read biographies and then go visit the places we read about,\u201d she said. \u201cI developed a real sense of history.\u201d\n\nComstock says her mother has been the most influential person in her life. \u201cMy mom is definitely my best friend, that\u2019s been one of the great parts of my life.\u201d\n\nBurns introduced her daughter to politics as well as history, but from the opposite side of the aisle from where Comstock currently sits. \u201cMy mom was a Ted Kennedy girl \u2014 back when Rose Kennedy was doing teas\u201d for campaign events, said Comstock.\n\nNow Burns supports her Republican offspring. \"My mom has been very active since my first campaign. My parents live with us, and the fun thing is that our whole family campaigns together.\u201d\n\nComstock\u2019s politics are much different than those of the unabashedly-liberal Kennedy.\n\nShe worked for two terms as an aide to Wolf, and headed the public-affairs branch of President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department. The National Review, in its endorsement of Comstock, said, \u201cComstock\u2019s strong conservative presence in Richmond has earned her high marks from, among others, the National Rifle Association, the Family Foundation of Virginia, and the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which awarded her its 2012 Free Enterprise Award. She has also received the endorsement of pundits such as Mark Levin and Sean Hannity.\u201d\n\nPat Herrity, a Republican member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, said, \u201cBarbara is exactly the type of common-sense conservative leader we need to pull the party and district together and win this.\u201d\n\nBut despite her conservative credentials, Comstock seeks to emphasize her willingness to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats. She points to her work on human trafficking issues, where her bills toughening criminal penalties and increasing support for victims received near-unanimous support in the Virginia General Assembly.\n\nKate O'Beirne of McLean, a former Washington editor of the National Review and co-chair of the Catholics for Comstock Coalition, said, \"While seeking common ground for the common good, Barbara has remained deeply committed to her strong values. She is a staunch supporter of working to create a culture of life and has led the fight on behalf of victims of human trafficking.\u201d\n\nComstock has the endorsement of the outgoing incumbent, who was out knocking doors with her on the first Saturday in October.\n\n\u201cNo one will work harder for the 10th District than Barbara Comstock,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cShe\u2019s honest, ethical and her energy and ability to get results will make her a great congresswoman.\u201d\n\nUpdated, Oct. 14, to include Q & A.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2014/oct/11/comstocks-comfort-zone/", "type": "article", "title": "Comstock's Comfort Zone"}, "description": "It\u2019s just weeks before Election Day, and the contest to replace retiring Republican Congressman Frank Wolf in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional district has become one of the most watched, most expensive and most contentious races in the country.", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd117e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cReally, when I hear that, I think about the fact that I grew up ... surrounded by strong women,\u201d Comstock said.\nBut on this crisp fall October morning, Republican candidate Barbara Comstock is in her comfort zone.\nQ & A with Barbara Comstock Q: What are some of your favorite restaurants in your district?\n\u201cNo one will work harder for the 10th District than Barbara Comstock,\u201d Wolf said.\nThey have three children, Dan Comstock, Peter Comstock and Caity Roller."}
