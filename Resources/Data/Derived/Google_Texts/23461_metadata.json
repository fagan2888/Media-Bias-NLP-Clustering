He noted while the Hispanic community and other demographics and interest groups have made demands of the president (not all of which have come to fruition), the black community has made no demands of Obama.\n\nAnd to Smiley, that\u2019s a problem because of the serious problems facing the black community under Obama:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t celebrate this.
