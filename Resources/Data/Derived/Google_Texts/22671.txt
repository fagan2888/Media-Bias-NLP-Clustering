LONDON (AP) - New signing Bakary Sako scored in the 88th minute Saturday to give Crystal Palace a 2-1 win over Aston Villa in the Premier League.

Sako joined Palace from Wolverhampton Wanderers this month and was given his first start by Alan Pardew and scored with a left-footed shot from just inside the area to give his new team the win.

Scott Dann had given Palace the lead in the 71st minute only for Villa to equalize six minutes later through an own goal by Pape Ndiaye Souare.

The win gives Palace six points from three games, while Villa remained on three points.
