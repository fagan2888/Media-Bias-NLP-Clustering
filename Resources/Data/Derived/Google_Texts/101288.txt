Ben Carson appeared with Bill O’Reilly tonight to again defend his previous remarks about a Muslim president. A few segments later, O’Reilly––who thinks the whole controversy is ridiculous––asked Bernie Goldberg for his take.

Goldberg criticized Carson for his “pathetic disingenuous explanation” and said this is “only the latest ridiculous comment this man has made,” bringing up past comments by Carson about the Nazis and that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery.

But Goldberg really stuck the knife in when he said that Carson makes so many gaffes, “he makes Joe Biden sound like Winston Churchill.”

He told O’Reilly Carson’s a perfectly nice guy, just not qualified to be the president.
