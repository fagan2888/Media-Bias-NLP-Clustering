Hoping to add 1 million enrollees, President Obama and his top staffers have stopped at all the hip, happening places to recruit the youthful and healthy – using everything from whimsical GIFs to Ryan Seacrest to your mom to get their message out.

Next Monday marks the final day to register for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and the Obama Administration is still scrambling to meet its goal of enrolling 6 million Americans.

Ahead of the March 31 deadline, America Tonight is hosting a roundtable in Washington, D.C., with a group of so-called “young invincibles” – the very people the administration has been targeting of late. We've gathered a group of people with different perspectives – those who have signed up, those who chose not to and those who are still undecided.

But we also want to get insight from people of all ages across the country. You can tell us your answers in the form below, or you can email SharingMyStory@aljazeera.net or use the hashtag #TheLastWeek on Twitter. We’ll use some of your responses in our ongoing broadcast and online coverage. And tune in Monday at 9 p.m. and midnight ET on Al Jazeera America to hear from our roundtable participants.
