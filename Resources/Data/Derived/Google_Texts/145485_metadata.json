But that\u2019s slowly changing, as the nation\u2019s health care needs rise, and nurses fight for the right to practice everything they learned in school.\n\nThe most recent wins came in West Virginia and Florida, where after many years of trying, lawmakers passed measures freeing up \u201cadvanced practice\u201d nurses \u2014 those with more graduate education than just a nursing degree \u2014 to administer a wider range of care and prescribe most drugs without having to maintain a relationship with a physician.\n\nFor Beth Baldwin, president of the West Virginia Nurses Association, the measure was aimed at meeting the needs of people who live in rural areas where the nearest physicians might be miles away \u2014 especially as the Affordable Care Act has expanded the pool of those with access to insurance.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to provide the care for that? If there\u2019s nowhere for them to take the card and get the care, it\u2019s not helpful,\u201d Baldwin says. In some places, when a doctor retires, another has to be brought in on a temporary basis to make sure patients can still get their medications. \u201cWe in no way feel that we\u2019ll be replacing physicians,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cBut physicians can be focusing on the people they need to see.\u201d\n\nPhysicians, whom the nurses call \u201corganized medicine,\u201d are the main people standing in the way of bills that expand the scope of what nurses are allowed to practice.\n\nThe battle to allow nurses to fulfill all the functions for which they were educated began back in the 1960s, when degree programs for nurse practitioners were created to extend care to people rural areas. A few states gave them early on what\u2019s known as \u201cfull practice authority,\u201d but many didn\u2019t, and little changed for decades.\n\nThe American Medical Association, the powerful doctors\u2019 trade group, has long opposed granting nurses the ability to prescribe drugs or set up their own primary care offices. They say that physician-led medical teams provide better integration and coordination.\n\nNurses, however, say that they can form their own teams if doctors aren\u2019t available, and refer patients out to specialized services if needed. That perspective was bolstered by a seminal report from the National Academies of Science in 2010, which recommended that states remove barriers to nurses practicing \u201cto the full extent of their education and training.\u201d More states started moving in that direction after 2013. Twenty-one states plus the District of Columbia now have laws establishing full practice authority for nurses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid a flurry of legislation to pass in the final days of spring state legislative sessions last week, nurses won two more victories in a long war for independence.
