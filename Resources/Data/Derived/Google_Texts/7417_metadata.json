After enduring a two-hour, 15-minute rain delay in the first game of Saturday\u2019s doubleheader at Coors Field, right-hander Jordan Lyles mowed down the Giants for three innings. But misfortune struck with two out in the fourth inning when Lyles landed wrong on his left foot after delivering a pitch to Hunter Pence. Manager Walt Weiss and trainer Keith Dugger came to the mound to check on Lyles, who stayed in the game.\n\nAfter a third consultation on the mound, Lyles was removed from the game in the fifth inning after he hit Joe Panik. The diagnosis is a sprained toe on Lyles\u2019 left foot; he is listed as day to day.\n\nBy the time he was removed from the game, the Giants took control. Lyles, clearly hampered by the foot injury, gave up three more hits after suffering the injury and also committed a throwing error to first base that cost the Rockies a run.\n\nHis final line Saturday: six runs and seven hits allowed in four-plus innings.\n\nLast year, Lyles broke his left hand while covering a play at the plate and missed 54 games.\n\nBullpen moves. The Rockies shuffled their bullpen before the doubleheader, reinstating right-hander Brooks Brown from the 15-day disabled list.\n\nTo make room on their 25-man roster, the Rockies placed left-handed reliever Ken Roberts on the disabled list because of left elbow inflammation. The Rockies don\u2019t think it\u2019s a serious injury.\n\n\u201cI had a little bit of an issue with my shoulder during spring training, but I was still able to get loose then,\u201d said Brown, who is 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 appearances. \u201cBut over the last week or 10 days, I had trouble staying loose, especially when I had to sit back down after throwing.\n\n\u201cBut the three rehab starts were good, and then in the last one I threw really well and was able to stay loose.\u201d\n\nWeiss said he will continue to use Brown the same way he did before Brown went on the disabled list.\n\n\u201cHe will be in the same role,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cSometimes one inning, sometimes one-plus. He\u2019s a nice piece to have because you don\u2019t have to match up with \u2018Brownie.\u2019 He gets lefties and gets righties.\n\n\u201cIt makes it a lot smoother late in the game when you go to the \u2018pen.\u201d\n\nRoberts, who gave up three runs and four hits while facing just seven San Francisco batters in the series opener Friday, said it was the first time the elbow pain flared up during a game.\n\n\u201cI would usually feel it the day after,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s just some inflammation and I tweaked something in there.\u201d Patrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nGiants\u2019 Tim Hudson (2-3, 4.01 ERA) vs. Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (0-0, 5.73), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nBettis\u2019 line doesn\u2019t look very good, and he\u2019s 1-2 with an 8.37 ERA in 39 games (10 starts) at Coors Field. Now for the bright side: Colorado has won both of his starts this season \u2014 May 14 at the Los Angeles Dodgers and May 19 vs. the Philadelphia Phillies. Hudson is coming off a terrific outing against the Dodgers, pitching 6 scoreless innings while allowing just five hits and two walks. Coors Field, however, has chewed him up. The 17-year veteran is 0-2 with a 6.80 ERA in nine games in LoDo.\n\nMonday: Rockies\u2019 Eddie Butler (2-5, 4.38 ERA) at Reds\u2019 Jason Marquis (3-4, 6.91), 11:10 a.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (1-2, 6.51) at Reds\u2019 Michael Lorenzen (1-1, 3.79), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Kyle Kendrick (1-6, 6.58) at Reds\u2019 Mike Leake (2-3, 4.14), 10:35 a.m.\n\nThursday: Off", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies starter Jordan Lyles leaves game with sprained left toe", "title": "Rockies starter Jordan Lyles leaves game with sprained left toe", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/23/rockies-starter-jordan-lyles-leaves-game-with-sprained-left-toe/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__jordan-lylesp1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150523__jordan-lylesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T19:42:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:55:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The diagnosis is a sprained toe on Lyles\u2019 left foot; he is listed as day to day.\nManager Walt Weiss and trainer Keith Dugger came to the mound to check on Lyles, who stayed in the game.\nAfter a third consultation on the mound, Lyles was removed from the game in the fifth inning after he hit Joe Panik.\nBut misfortune struck with two out in the fourth inning when Lyles landed wrong on his left foot after delivering a pitch to Hunter Pence.\nLast year, Lyles broke his left hand while covering a play at the plate and missed 54 games."}
