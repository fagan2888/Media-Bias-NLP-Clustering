Because getting sharks to tweet their location apparently wasn’t enough to prevent attacks, Western Australia’s moved on to a controversial new policy of attacking back. On Sunday, the government claimed its first victim: a large female tiger shark, caught on a baited hook, was shot four times in the head, dragged out to sea and dumped.

Not even protected species are safe. Last week, the federal government granted state authorities a special exemption from environmental laws, allowing white sharks over 10 feet long to be targeted along with bull and tiger sharks. The approval cited “substantial public concern” over an above-normal spate of fatal attacks — 7 in the past 3 years.
