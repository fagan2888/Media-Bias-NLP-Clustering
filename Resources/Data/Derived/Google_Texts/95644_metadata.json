He was wearing his uniform at the time. Had he attended the event in civilian garb, there would have been no problem, but Klingenschmitt\u2019s use of his uniform was a clear violation of military regulations.\n\nKlingenschmitt\u2019s appearance at the rally was the final straw for Navy officials. He had been causing trouble for a long time and was not considered an effective chaplain. A 2004 poll of service personnel on the USS Anzio, where Klingenschmitt then served, reaped numerous negative comments, among them \u201cworst CHAP I have seen in 17 years,\u201d \u201cwould never seek counsel from CHAPS,\u201d and \u201che is one of the worst CHAPs I have seen.\u201d\n\nNavy officials decided to ease Klingenschmitt out of the service. After the Evangelical Episcopal Church pulled its endorsement of Klingenschmitt, Navy officials decertified him as a chaplain, and he was separated from the U.S. Navy.\n\nUnhappy about this, Klingenschmitt filed a number of administrative challenges and lawsuits, but they have not been successful. Last week, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims rejected his most recent suit.\n\nJudge Elaine D. Kaplan noted that Navy officials outlined in detail the reasons why they sent Klingenschmitt packing.\n\n\u201cBased on these recommendations and the entire record, the Assistant Secretary (acting pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Secretary) determined that Dr. Klingenschmitt was \u2018professionally unsuited for further service as a naval officer and chaplain,\u2019\u201d wrote Kaplan in the ruling for Klingenschmitt v.United States of America.\n\nKaplan noted that Navy officials criticized Klingenschmitt\u2019s \u201cperformance and disciplinary record (including his fitness reports and court-martial conviction) as well as the lack of support for him in his chain of command.\u201d The judged cited a 2006 fitness report that graded Klingenschmitt \u201cbelow average in the area of military bearing/character.\u201d The same report found that his \u201crecent professional performance has been unsatisfactory.\u201d\n\nThe assistant secretary of the Navy, Kaplan pointed out, \u201calso relied on Dr. Klingenschmitt\u2019s court-martial conviction for violating the lawful order of a superior commissioned officer in connection with the March 2006 media event at Lafayette Park. Finally, the Assistant Secretary also relied upon the fact that \u2018the Chief of Chaplains, your community leader, recommended denial of recertification and processing you for administrative separation.\u2019 He concluded that Dr. Klingenschmitt \u2018d[id] not possess the character, leadership, or professional traits needed to successfully serve as a naval officer.\u2019\u201d\n\nKaplan also rejected Klingenschmitt\u2019s claim that his religious-freedom rights were violated. She noted that he had been ordered not to wear his uniform at a political event and added, \u201cThe Order did not limit Dr. Klingenschmitt\u2019s right to engage in any religious practices (including presenting an opening prayer at the event or invoking the name of Jesus in his prayer). It simply prohibited Dr. Klingenschmitt from engaging in this activity while wearing his uniform at what was clearly a political event and not, as Dr. Klingenschmitt seems to suggest, a bona fide religious service.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Americans United wrote to Navy officials and pointed out that Klingenschmitt had started a website titled \u201cPray In Jesus\u2019 Name\u201d that included photos of him in a Naval uniform and that referred to him as a chaplain. The clear implication was that Klingenschmitt was still serving in the Navy. Klingenschmitt\u2019s response to this was to announce that he was praying for the death of Americans United Executive Director Barry W. Lynn.\n\nLast month, Klingenschmitt won election to the Colorado House of Representatives \u2013 despite his belief that President Barack Obama is possessed by demons and that the Affordable Care Act causes cancer. Remarkably, the race wasn\u2019t even close with Klingenschmitt taking 70 percent of the vote for a seat representing El Paso County.\n\nKlingenschmitt may be enjoying some political success right now, but his efforts to clean up the mess he left in the Navy aren\u2019t going well for him. Klingenschmitt will undoubtedly stir things up in Colorado, but at least the men and women serving in uniform will no longer by subjected to his unprofessionalism and grandstanding.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded2a\"", "article_summary": "After the Evangelical Episcopal Church pulled its endorsement of Klingenschmitt, Navy officials decertified him as a chaplain, and he was separated from the U.S. Navy.\nJudge Elaine D.
