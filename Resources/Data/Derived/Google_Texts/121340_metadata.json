John Kasich used his time in the spotlight at Thursday\u2019s Republican debate to promote Obamacare.\n\nYou may not have noticed, either because you tune Kasich out or because Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion isn\u2019t a policy you\u2019ve followed closely. But you can bet Obamacare advocates listened with rapt attention.\n\nFox News host Chris Wallace jokingly asked Kasich if he thinks \u2014 as his rhetoric suggests \u2014 Ted Cruz is going to Hell for opposing Obamacare. Cruz is just one of millions of Republicans who have been smeared by Kasich, but there\u2019s no need to split hairs with Wallace here.\n\nWatch and I\u2019ll try to unwind Kasich\u2019s spin:\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you for wondering if Kasich deserves the benefit of a doubt (Newt Gingrich still trusts his old pal, after all), but Kasich has been using variations of these same false talking points for three years.\n\nBack in April 2013, I asked prominent Obamacare supporters about Kasich\u2019s insistence Obamacare expansion would be paid for with \u201cOhio money.\u201d Even they conceded Kasich was wrong.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service have both confirmed Obamacare expansion is paid for with new federal spending, but Kasich keeps spinning away.\n\nKasich\u2019s dishonesty here is important for an obvious reason: this guy is running for president. It\u2019s more important for the less obvious reason that Obamacare expansion fights are still raging in many states.\n\nTo sum up without getting too far into the weeds, Obamacare includes an optional expansion of Medicaid that\u2019s supported by hospital lobbyists because it means billions in new federal welfare spending. It\u2019s supported by Democrats for essentially the same reason.\n\nObamacare expansion transforms Medicaid \u2014 a program meant for pregnant women, the elderly, the disabled, and children \u2014 into a sweeping poverty trap for millions of working-age Americans with no kids and no disabilities.\n\nKasich is the poster boy for Obamacare expansion because he bypassed Ohio\u2019s Republican legislature to implement it and gleefully bashes Republicans who oppose it.\n\nThe governor has poisoned debates over Obamacare expansion in neighboring states, paving the way for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and new Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin to bail on their promises to fight Obamacare.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kasich claims he\u2019s against Obamacare while propping up one of Obamacare\u2019s central pillars. Kasich has griped about heartless Obamacare expansion critics during stops in Iowa, South Dakota, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee.\n\nKasich praised Obamacare in a January 20 speech to the New Hampshire House of Representatives; as New Hampshire conservatives try to roll back Obamacare expansion, Kasich travels the state saying Obamacare saves lives.\n\nWith Kasich\u2019s help, last spring Democrat Montana Gov. Steve Bullock pressured Republicans lawmakers to surrender and enact Obamacare expansion after fighting the policy for years.\n\nRepublicans in Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and elsewhere have embraced Kasich\u2019s pro-Obamacare spin, and newspapers in holdout states love pointing to Kasich as proof Obamacare expansion is pragmatic.\n\nMind you, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has already cost $6.4 billion and enrolled more people than Kasich expected would sign up by 2020, but who cares about results when it feels so good to promise more people free stuff?\n\nJohn Kasich isn\u2019t likely to be in the presidential race much longer. But he\u2019ll still be governor of Ohio, and he\u2019ll still be helping Obamacare advocates grow government.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Preacher Kasich promotes Obamacare", "title": "Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Roadshow goes national", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/01/kasichs-obamacare-roadshow-goes-national/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rrwybQqnAho/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/rrwybQqnAho/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-01T21:41:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T16:11:46+00:00"}, "keywords": "GOP Debate, John Kasich, Medicaid expansion, ObamaCare, obamacare expansion,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bf9\"", "article_summary": "Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Roadshow goes nationalposted at 4:41 pm on February 1, 2016 by Jason HartOhio Gov.\nIt\u2019s more important for the less obvious reason that Obamacare expansion fights are still raging in many states.\nBack in April 2013, I asked prominent Obamacare supporters about Kasich\u2019s insistence Obamacare expansion would be paid for with \u201cOhio money.\u201d Even they conceded Kasich was wrong.\nKasich praised Obamacare in a January 20 speech to the New Hampshire House of Representatives; as New Hampshire conservatives try to roll back Obamacare expansion, Kasich travels the state saying Obamacare saves lives.\nKasich has griped about heartless Obamacare expansion critics during stops in Iowa, South Dakota, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee."}
