Ted Cruz may be best known for his anti-Obamacare Senate speech that lasted over 21 hours and included a reading of \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d (more on that later). But the fiery first-term senator played the politics game long before he trounced his establishment-backed rival, former Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, in the Republican Senate primary in 2012.\n\nThat race may have won him fans with tea partyers, as well as endorsements from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former South Carolina Sen. (and current Heritage Foundation head) Jim DeMint, but Cruz has been haunting the halls of government for over a decade. Cruz was a law clerk in the Supreme Court in 1996 for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and was the longest-serving Solicitor General in Texas. In between, he was a policy adviser on President George W. Bush\u2019s campaign team, which is how he met his wife, Heidi. They married in 2001 and have two young daughters.\n\nInsideGov takes a spin around the key facts and figures that define Cruz\u2019s political career and shape his persona. We love data-driven smart takes on politics, so we collected the 25 most critical points on Cruz, ranking them from smallest (1 namesake championship) to largest ($500 billion).\n\n1 Namesake Championship\n\nAfter a successful and decorated tenure on Princeton University\u2019s American Whig-Cliosophic Society debate team, the school named an annual competition the \u201cTed Cruz Living Memorial Novice Championship.\u201d\n\n1 of 3 Wacko Birds\n\nIn March 2013, Arizona Sen. John McCain designated three of his fellow Republican colleagues \u201cwacko birds\u201d in response to a filibuster related to the CIA\u2019s drone policy. McCain called out Cruz, along with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (also running for president in 2016) and Michigan Rep. Justin Amash.\n\n2 Countries\n\nCruz\u2019s American mother gave birth to him in Alberta, making him a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. He renounced his Canadian citizenship on May 14, 2014.\n\n2 Ivy League Schools\n\nAccording to his former law professor, prominent legal scholar Alan Dershowitz, \u201cCruz was off-the-charts brilliant.\u201d Indeed, Cruz\u2019s diplomas back up that assessment: He attended Princeton University for undergrad and studied law at Harvard.\n\n4 Books\n\nCruz has penned one book of his own, \u201cA Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America,\u201d which came out June 2015. He\u2019s also been the subject of three coloring books: \u201cTed Cruz to the Future,\u201d \u201cTed Saves America\u201d and \u201cWe \u2018C\u2019 Ted Cruz for President,\u201d the sales of which benefit his 2016 campaign.\n\n4 Top Debate Awards\n\nIn 1992, while a senior at Princeton University, Cruz scored four big-time awards as part of the university\u2019s debate team: North American Debating Championship Top Speaker, National Championship Top Speaker, Speaker of the Year, Team of the Year.\n\n5 Years\n\nFrom 2004 to 2009, Cruz taught Supreme Court litigation at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\n5 Super PACs\n\nCruz benefits from five different super PACs that support his presidential run: Stand for Principle PAC, Keep the Promise PAC, Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II and Keep the Promise III. As of the most recent campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission , the five groups have raised more than $38 million.\n\n6 Person of the Year Mentions\n\nAfter only one year on Capitol Hill, Cruz got six nods for person (or some variation) of the year. In 2013, a leader at the conservative advocacy group Americans for Limited Government named Cruz \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d in an opinion piece published in The Hill. Three conservative media outlets (The Blaze , FrontPage Magazine and the American Spectator ) named Cruz \u201cMan of the Year,\u201d and Townhall.com awarded him \u201cConservative of the Year.\u201d The Republican Party of Sarasota in Florida gave him the \u201cStatesman of the Year\u201d Award.\n\nThat same year, Cruz was a finalist for the Dallas Morning News\u2019 Texan of the Year designation and for Time\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d award.\n\nWhen it comes to the 2016 presidential race, Cruz is the second most conservative candidate, according to data from OnTheIssues .\n\n9 Cases\n\nCruz argued nine cases before the U.S. Supreme Court as the Texas Solicitor General. He held that position from 2003 to 2008, and won five of the cases.\n\n16 Days\n\nIn October 2013, the federal government shut down for 16 days after Congress didn\u2019t approve a budget. The Republican-led House provided resolutions that would have delayed or defunded the Affordable Care Act, but Democrats in the Senate and President Barack Obama refused to pass a bill with such language.\n\nAlthough Cruz maintained Senate Democrats were to blame for the shutdown, many in Washington faulted Cruz. He embarked on a 21-hour Senate speech against the healthcare law a few days before the government closed.\n\n17.3 Percent\n\nAs InsideGov reported last week, Cruz is crushing it in Iowa. Overall, he is in third place at 17.3 percent.\n\nBut one specific poll put out right before Thanksgiving", "article_metadata": {"isPremium": "false", "description": "Texas Sen.
