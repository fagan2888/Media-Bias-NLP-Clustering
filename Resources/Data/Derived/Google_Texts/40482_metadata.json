Everything. Americans are tired of politicians who accommodate everyone but Americans.\n\nWASHINGTON, May 5, 2016 \u2014 According to CNN, unsuccessful Republican candidates running for president spent $75 million making 64,000 television attack ads designed to \u201cstop Trump\u201d from winning the GOP nomination.\n\nOf that staggering amount, former Florida governor Jeb Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise USA, spent $10 million on anti-Trump TV spots.\n\nIn stark contrast, the Trump campaign spent nearly a half million dollars on hats.\n\nContrary to all the hysteria over the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United vs. FEC, money can\u2019t buy you the presidency.\n\nBeing that the left is so dogged in its two-dimensional thinking, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we hear demands for tight restrictions on the number of silly campaign hats distributed during presidential election years because of their undue influence on American politics.\n\nPundits on the right credit Trump\u2019s dramatic political success to angry, white, middle-aged workers whose jobs have gone overseas. Or anger among the GOP\u2019s conservative base at the party leadership\u2019s failure to deliver on promises to defund Obamacare, curb federal spending and debt and to get to the bottom of the worst of the many scandals swirling around the Obama presidency \u2013 Operation Fast and Furious and Benghazi.\n\nPundits on the left simply credit Trump\u2019s success to systemic American racism, homophobia, anti-transgender bathroom-ism, hatred of women and an abiding love of authoritarianism that beats within the hearts of all Americans \u2013 not them, of course.\n\nAll the above are wrong.\n\nCredit for Trump\u2019s rise belongs to Kate Steinle. She was the 32-year-old woman shot on July 1, 2015, by an illegal alien fresh out of county lockup in that beautiful \u201csanctuary city,\u201d San Francisco.\n\nCradled in her father\u2019s arms, Kate\u2019s last words were, \u201cHelp me, dad.\u201d\n\nA year earlier, San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi announced, \u201cMy long-held belief is that local law enforcement should not be in the civil immigration detainer business\u2026 Public safety is not advanced and could be hindered when immigrant communities fear the repercussions of cooperating with law enforcement.\u201d\n\nForty-five-year-old illegal alien Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a seven-time convicted felon who returned to the U.S. after five deportations, clearly felt unhindered by fear of repercussions stemming from the possible actions of Sheriff Mirkarimi and his deputies.\n\nIn fact, Sanchez was so comfortable he not only broke U.S. immigration law but also violated the sanctuary city\u2019s prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm \u2013 a .40-caliber handgun stolen from an agent of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.\n\nThe evidence clearly shows local and federal law enforcement were especially welcoming and extremely accommodating of Sanchez.\n\nThat\u2019s an accommodation extended to this day by the leaders of both political parties and a certain lame duck in the White House.\n\nBut a growing number of Americans are done accommodating these accommodating politicians.\n\nIn turning to Trump, they have abandoned the left-right paradigm of American politics in answer to a young woman\u2019s desperate call:\n\n\u201cHelp me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "What does Kate Steinle's murder have to do with the rise of Donald Trump?
