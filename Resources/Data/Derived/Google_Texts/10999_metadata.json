Still, he said police were working to determine whether the men were patients at the clinic.\n\nThe two men who were wounded were in serious condition and taken to Bellevue Hospital, the New York Police Department said in a statement. It did not identify the victims, saying the men's families had not yet been notified.\n\nStreets in the area were closed due to the investigation.\n\nPenn Station is a major railway hub, serving both the Amtrak national passenger rail service and commuter lines linking New York to New Jersey and its eastern suburbs.\n\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney in New York; Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Lisa Lambert in Washington; Editing by Scott Malone and Bernadette Baum)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Police said they were searching for the shooting suspect, a heavy-set man wearing a ho", "title": "One dead, two wounded in shooting at Manhattan's Penn Station", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/09/One-dead-two-injured-shooting-near-Manhattans-Penn-Station-CNN", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/new-york-shooting_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/09/One-dead-two-injured-shooting-near-Manhattans-Penn-Station-CNN", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/new-york-shooting_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Police said they were searching for the shooting suspect, a heavy-set man wearing a ho", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"We don't believe this had anything to do with the methadone clinic,\" Boyce told reporters.\nET in a McDonald's restaurant near Penn Station, where the gunshot victims were drinking coffee together, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters.\nSeveral people near the shooting scene told reporters they knew the victims from a local methadone treatment center.\nThe shooting suspect entered the restaurant and briefly spoke with the group before leaving, Boyce said.\nPolice said they were searching for the shooting suspect, a heavy-set man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and two other men who were possibly connected to the incident."}
