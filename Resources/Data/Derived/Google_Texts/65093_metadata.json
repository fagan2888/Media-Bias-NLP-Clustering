For purposes of threat assessment, the definition of a threat should be broad and inclusive so that potential sources of violence are not overlooked. As a result, there may be investigation of possible threats that do not turn out to be genuine or serious threats.\n\n2. Threats are communications of intent to harm someone. Threats can be communicated directly to the intended target or indirectly to third parties. Threats also may be expressed in private statements, such as journal entries or written plans, which have no third party audience.\n\n3. Threats can be explicit (\u201cI am going to kill him\u201d) or veiled (\u201cWait and see what happens, now\u201d).\n\n4. Threats can be expressed through any media (e.g., cell phones, radio, Internet).\n\n5. Threats can express through drawings or other visual representations.\n\n6. Threats can be expressed behaviorally, such as through gestures.\n\n7. Possession of a weapon, concealed or unconcealed, can indicate a threat and merits investigation.\n\n8. In some cases, threat assessments may be indicated when no explicit threat has been communicated, but is strongly suspected, for example, when someone has been highly angry and verbally abusive in a manner that suggests violent intentions.\n\n9. Threats must be identified and reported in order to be investigated. Therefore, organizations should train their staff to identify and report threats. When in doubt, possible threats should be reported so that they can be investigated. There should be clearly established and publicized means of reporting persons who have made threats or engaged in threatening behavior. Multiple reporting methods are desirable.\n\nSource: The Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services School Safety Center Recommended Practices for Virginia College Threat Assessment", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "BLACKSBURG \u2014 Hundreds of people are monitored annually at Virginia Tech by a school threat assessment team in a process both proven and imperfect.", "title": "Virginia Tech team works to assess threats before tragedies", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/crime/blacksburg/virginia-tech-team-works-to-assess-threats-before-tragedies/article_840ec54d-f9e1-5cd7-b77a-e91b5607be23.html", "image": {"width": 918, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/8b/28b873e9-3541-598b-8bc1-cabd05da0f7e/56d25ebc9d0df.image.jpg?resize=918%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "BLACKSBURG \u2014 Hundreds of people are monitored annually at Virginia Tech by a school threat assessment team in a process both proven and imperfect.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "nicole madison lovell,david edmond eisenhauer,natalie marie keepers,blacksburg,blacksburg,blacksburg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "nicole madison lovell,david edmond eisenhauer,natalie marie keepers,blacksburg,blacksburg,blacksburg"}, "article_summary": "As a result, there may be investigation of possible threats that do not turn out to be genuine or serious threats.\nSource: The Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services School Safety Center Recommended Practices for Virginia College Threat Assessment\nWhen in doubt, possible threats should be reported so that they can be investigated.\nThreats also may be expressed in private statements, such as journal entries or written plans, which have no third party audience.\nThreats can be explicit (\u201cI am going to kill him\u201d) or veiled (\u201cWait and see what happens, now\u201d)."}
