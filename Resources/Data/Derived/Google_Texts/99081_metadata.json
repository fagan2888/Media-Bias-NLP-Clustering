But a new survey has found that many U.S. adults who work on behalf of children think undocumented immigrant children should have access to healthcare equal to that of U.S.-born children.\n\nadd caption here\n\nAlmost half (42 percent) of survey respondents said they agree or strongly agree that undocumented children and U.S.-born children should have equal access to healthcare, while 33 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed and 25 percent were unsure.\n\nThe survey was conducted as part of the University of Michigan National Voices Project\u2014a five-year study of children\u2019s opportunities funded through the W.K. Kellogg Foundation\u2019s America Healing Initiative\u2014in partnership with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. The National Voices Project surveys a unique set of people who are particularly qualified to answer questions about children\u2019s opportunities\u2014adults who work and/or volunteer with children.\n\n\u201cPartnering with the National Voices Project gave us the opportunity to see how well people who work with children on a daily basis understand what immigrant children in the U.S. face,\u201d says Susan Reed, supervising attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. \u201cWhile we saw strong support for the health and welfare of all kids, there is still significant work to be done when it comes to ensuring that immigrant children specifically have equal access to the care they need.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reed, current federal policy restricts many poor noncitizen children, including all undocumented children and many children with various forms of legal immigration status, to a very limited form of Medicaid that only covers emergency treatment. Primary care and medical attention for care of chronic illnesses are not covered.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now surrounding healthcare for the immigrant population is gridlock because there are millions of children in our communities who are unable to receive necessary healthcare due to their immigration status,\u201d says Reed. \u201cIf the healthcare access issue isn\u2019t resolved, it could entrench a generation of children in poverty and health disparity.\u201d\n\nOpinions about healthcare access for immigrant children varied among respondents from different race/ethnic backgrounds. Sixty-one percent of Hispanic respondents agreed/strongly agreed that children should have equal access to healthcare, compared with 53 percent of multi-race/other respondents, 46 percent of African American respondents, and 37 percent of non-Hispanic white respondents.\n\nAdditionally, respondents who perceived many/some racial or ethnic inequities in their communities were more likely to favor equal healthcare access for undocumented immigrant children, a finding which held true even when controlling for the race/ethnicity of people who participated in the survey.\n\n\u201cThese findings echo what we\u2019ve seen in previous National Voices Project surveys about opportunities for children and teens,\u201d says Matthew M. Davis, M.D., M.A.P.P., director of the National Voices Project and a pediatrician at the University of Michigan\u2019s C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cAdults who see racial or ethnic inequities in their communities tend to more favorably endorse policies that would work toward improving opportunities for the children and teens they work with,\u201d says Davis, also a professor of pediatrics, internal medicine, public policy, and health management and policy at the University of Michigan and a member of the U-M Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.\n\nBut for immigrant rights advocates like Susan Reed and the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, there is much more work to be done to ensure healthcare access for the children of undocumented immigrants.\n\nLawful permanent resident children (\u201cgreen card holders\u201d) who have held that status for less than five years are generally ineligible for the full Medicaid program, explains Reed. \u201cSome states have exercised a federal option to provide full Medicaid coverage to lawful permanent resident children and pregnant women who have been in the U.S. for less than five years,\u201d says Reed. \u201cUndocumented children and children who have received relief from deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are excluded from participation in Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to affordable healthcare for children in the U.S. \u2013 both immigrant children and U.S.-born children \u2013 is a national issue that impacts all of us,\u201d says Davis. \u201cProviding children access to timely preventive care including vaccines, dental care, primary care, and management of chronic illnesses such as asthma has a remarkable impact on their long-term health and well-being and their ability to learn and participate in our communities.\u201d\n\nThese data are part of the fifth survey from the National Voices Project, conducted in March-April 2014.\n\nFull Report: http://nationalvoicesproject.org/healthcare-immigrant-children\n\nData Source: Data are based on responses from National Voices Project 2014 Partners Survey, fielded March-April 2014. The National Voices Project is conducted in partnership with GfK, an international survey research organization that maintains KnowledgePanel\u00ae, a nationally representative web-enabled panel of adult members of households across the United States. Survey respondents included 2,400 adults from 50 states and D.C. that work or volunteer with children. 1,253 respondents have jobs that affect education, healthcare, economic opportunities, or community and civic engagement for children. Another 1,147 respondents volunteer in ways that affect education, healthcare, economic opportunities, or community and civic engagement for children.\n\nAbout the National Voices Project: The National Voices Project is a new effort to bring the perspectives of thousands of people to the national dialogue about children. Children thrive on opportunity. But when opportunities differ because of children\u2019s race or ethnicity, where they live, or because of who they are, children face barriers in their health, education, and economic security and success. Measuring disparities for children is a key step toward addressing disadvantage. Careful measurement of sensitive issues can bring greater understanding. In turn, understanding informs new initiatives that can lead to meaningful changes for children. The National Voices Project is funded through the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as part of the America Healing initiative.\n\nAbout the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center: The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC) is a resource center for advocates seeking equal justice for Michigan's immigrants. MIRC works to build a thriving Michigan where immigrant communities are fully integrated and respected. This program is affiliated with the Michigan Poverty Law Program, the Michigan Elder Justice Initiative, and Michigan Legal Help. The work of the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is supported by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.\n\nConnect with the National Voices Project:\n\nWeb: NationalVoicesProject.org\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/nationalvoicesproject\n\nTwitter: @NatlVoices\n\nFindings from the National Voices Project do not represent the opinions of the investigators or the opinions of the University of Michigan.\n\nAbout the University of Michigan\u2019s C.S.
