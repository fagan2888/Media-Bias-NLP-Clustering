Lamar Sims, a Colorado prosecutor:\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that Rice's death was tragic and, indeed, when one considers his age, heartbreaking. However, for all of the reasons discussed herein, I conclude that Officer Loehmann's belief that Rice posed a threat of serious physical harm or death was objectively reasonable as was his response to that perceived threat.\u201d\n\nAnd the second report, written by a retired FBI agent named Kimberly Crawford:\n\n\u201cAccording to the Supreme Court, the standard that must be used to evaluate a law enforcement officer\u2019s use of deadly force is one of objective reasonableness. The question is not whether every officer would have reacted the same way. Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable officer, confronting the exact same scenario under identical conditions could have concluded that deadly force was necessary. Based on the proceeding discussion, and in light of my training and experience, it is my conclusion that Officer Loehmann\u2019s use of deadly force falls within the realm of reasonableness under the dictates of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d\n\nPeople who have seen the full video footage, or read about the other troubling details, might wonder how anyone could possibly reach the conclusion that the shooting was justified. To review: a tipster told the police dispatcher that Rice was playing with a \u201cprobably fake\u201d gun, but this detail was not relayed to the responding officers; rather than approaching from a distance, Garmback parked his vehicle nearly on top of Rice; Loehmann\u2014an officer-in-training who was fired from a previous police job because of incompetence with firearms\u2014pulled the trigger before Rice could properly react to the situation, ostensibly because the teen reached for the fake gun he was carrying inside his waistband; both cops allowed Rice to bleed on the ground for several minutes, doing nothing until an FBI agent turned up; they prevented Rice\u2019s sister from helping him, instead handcuffing her and placing her in the squad car while her brother\u2019s life drained away.\n\nBut according to the reports, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the shooting seems justified in hindsight\u2014it only matters whether a reasonable officer, in the same position as Loehmann, would have reacted in the same way. In other words, the multitude of factors suggesting the cops should have refrained from shooting Rice add up to nothing. The only thing that matters is Loehmann\u2019s own subjective view of the threat to his own person. That threat was nonexistent, but Loehmann didn\u2019t see it that way, which makes the shooting justified in the opinion of the only person who counts.\n\nOver at his blog, Simply Justice, Scott Greenfield laments that the conclusion in the Rice case is foregone because of the Supreme Court\u2019s deference to paranoid policing:\n\nBy eliminating from consideration any bit of information that didn\u2019t support the murder of Tamir Rice, you end up with a report that says killing him was reasonable. By applying caselaw that bends over backward to preclude any view that wasn\u2019t the killer\u2019s, there can be only one objectively reasonable conclusion. \u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t see it? I don\u2019t see it? We don\u2019t count. We\u2019re not trained to see what a cop\u2019s eye sees.\n\nGreenfield points out that despite the investigators\u2019 exhausting efforts to explain away inconvenient details as irrelevant to Loehmann\u2019s parsing of the situation, there is still one nontrivial fact that goes unaddressed: the cops never gave Rice verbal instructions before killing him:\n\nEven so, there was one stumbling block that Sims and Crawford were constrained to fudge, that in the one to two seconds between Loehmann jumping out of the car and leaving a dead boy on the ground, there was no shout of \u201cfreeze\u201d or \u201chands up.\u201d There was no order with which Tamir Rice refused to comply.\n\nMuch like the John Crawford case\u2014in which an officer gunned down a man for carrying a pellet rifle inside a Wallmart that sold those very weapons\u2014the totality of the circumstances just don\u2019t apply. Crawford\u2019s killers claimed they gave him orders that he ignored, but the video evidence established that they shot the man immediately, just like Rice. Crawford\u2019s grand jury declined to indict the cops, even though Crawford\u2019s family could credibly show that the officers lied about their justification for shooting him.\n\nThose who want justice for Rice should gird themselves for disappointment. In the eyes of the law, only one person\u2019s life matters\u2014irrespective of the actual threat to that life\u2014and it certainly isn\u2019t the 12-year-old boy\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The cop's life is the only one that matters, even if the threat is nonexistent.", "title": "We Live in a World Where Experts Say the Shooting of Tamir Rice Was \u2018Reasonable\u2019", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/12/we-live-in-a-world-where-experts-say-the", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14446674876258.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The cop's life is the only one that matters, even if the threat is nonexistent.", "title": "We Live in a World Where Experts Say the Shooting of Tamir Rice Was \u2018Reasonable\u2019", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14446674876258.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-10-12T16:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "In other words, the multitude of factors suggesting the cops should have refrained from shooting Rice add up to nothing.\nBy applying caselaw that bends over backward to preclude any view that wasn\u2019t the killer\u2019s, there can be only one objectively reasonable conclusion.\nRather, the relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable officer, confronting the exact same scenario under identical conditions could have concluded that deadly force was necessary.\nCrawford\u2019s grand jury declined to indict the cops, even though Crawford\u2019s family could credibly show that the officers lied about their justification for shooting him.\nBut according to the reports, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the shooting seems justified in hindsight\u2014it only matters whether a reasonable officer, in the same position as Loehmann, would have reacted in the same way."}
