It squandered taxpayer-backed handouts and loans, disappointed its customers and now has shuttered its operations.\n\nBut with an audacity that would make even Donald Trump blush, Health Republic of Oregon wants more taxpayer money. Its executives are suing the federal government to demand more government handouts.\n\nThe Obama administration just might settle the case and give Health Republic and hundreds of other insurers the $5 billion that the class-action lawsuit seeks.\n\nCo-ops like Health Republic were conjured into existence by Obamacare on the theory that people who didn\u2019t know much about insurance \u2014 fortified with good intentions and government money \u2014 could compete successfully against established and experienced health insurance companies. Oregon, New York and New Jersey were sister co-ops in the Health Republic alliance.\n\nHealth Republic had plenty of good intentions, boasting that it was \u201cmore than just an insurance company.\u201d It turned out to be quite a bit less. The New Jersey co-op is the only member of its alliance that continues to sell policies, after Oregon and New York folded.\n\nBut not before losing a lot of taxpayer money. The Oregon plan received $50 million in federal startup loans and millions of dollars in additional government handouts for 2014 alone.\n\nThe co-op\u2019s website blames its failure on the government \u201cnot following through on its promise\u201d of an additional $22 million in handouts.\n\nHealth Republic expected to get that money through Obamacare\u2019s \u201crisk corridors,\u201d a program in which the government transfers \u201cexcess profits\u201d from successful insurers to companies that suffered \u201cexcess losses.\u201d As it turned out, \u201cexcess losses\u201d among Obamacare plans in 2014 were $2.5 billion greater than \u201cexcess profits.\u201d The administration decreed that taxpayers would supply the difference.\n\nCongress said no. It has twice passed laws, both signed by the president, prohibiting the government from paying out more to unsuccessful insurers than it collected from successful ones.\n\nForbidden to spend taxpayer money, the administration reduced payments to companies that suffered \u201cexcess losses.\u201d The smaller payments accelerated Health Republic\u2019s insolvency and prompted the class-action lawsuit, which seeks $5 billion ($2.5 billion for 2014 and 2015) for itself and for hundreds of other insurers that lost money selling Obamacare policies.\n\nIn suing the administration, Health Republic might be pushing on an open door. The administration desperately wants to lavish billions on insurers. According to one expert, the lawsuit makes that possible.\n\nUniversity of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley argues that the suit has provided the administration with a way to bypass the funding restriction that Congress imposed. Were it to settle the case instead of contesting it, Bagley writes, the administration could pay insurers $5 billion out of the Judgment Fund, a permanently appropriated account from which the Treasury Department pays claims against the government.\n\nThe congressional funding restriction applies to the department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the co-ops, and not to the Judgment Fund, Bagley theorizes, clearing the way for a $5 billion windfall for insurers.\n\nBagley concedes that the government has a duty to defend a challenged law, even one it doesn\u2019t especially like. But that duty, he writes, is not absolute.\n\nThe administration frequently has refused to defend or enforce laws it doesn\u2019t care for. Settling this case would be a convenient way to evade another limitation on its power.\n\nIt would be almost too convenient. There\u2019s no evidence that the administration encouraged this lawsuit or mentioned it as a way to circumvent the law during the many discussions about risk corridors between White House officials and insurance executives.\n\nBut if the administration were to settle the case, reasonable suspicions could arise \u2014 something Congress might seek to explore. Taxpayers deserve to have their government protect them against even more Obamacare losses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oregon\u2019s health insurance co-operative is yet another Obamacare failure.
