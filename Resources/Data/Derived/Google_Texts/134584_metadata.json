The study said the surge in new Medi-Cal enrollments under the Affordable Care Act could make it harder for those patients to find care.\n\nRichard Thorp, the president of the California Medical Association, told KQED that that's because the low reimbursement rates may also drive many providers to stop seeing Medi-Cal-insured patients.\n\n\"There\u2019s overhead costs and employee costs, and just running the business costs,\" Thorp said. \"So when you\u2019re getting paid significantly less than it costs to actually keep your business open, there\u2019s a certain amount of that where you can\u2019t just continue to do that.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, State Senate Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) said restoring Medi-Cal rates is important, but he stopped short of calling it a top priority in his upcoming negotiations with the governor over the budget.\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s on the list,\" Steinberg said. \"Can we afford it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know at this point.\"\n\n\n\nHealth Access California estimates that restoring the earlier Medi-Cal rates would cost the state about $250 million. Wright said his group and others will be pushing the legislature to restore the rates as it finalizes the state budget in the coming weeks.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Advocates for the poor want the state to restore an earlier 10 percent cut to the reimbursement rate for doctors who treat Medi-Cal patients.", "title": "Advocates push for restoration of higher Medi-Cal reimbursement rates", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/05/14/44176/advocates-criticize-governors-budget-over-low-medi/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/111d0c3eb3da040bb4947f4b50dc07bc/84413-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 683}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
