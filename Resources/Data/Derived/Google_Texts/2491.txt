Investor Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio) has taken a 5.1% stake in a Texas-based, freestanding emergency room company called Adeptus Health Inc. (NYSE:ADPT). The billionaire’s new family office, Point 72 Asset Management, replaced his former hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, after it pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 2014.

Point 72 held 666 long positions at the end of 2015 and has been an avid buyer of greater than 5% stakes in companies this year. Its seventh such acquisition year to date, the fund purchased 721,066 shares of Adeptus Health on March 18 and will take a passive role, according to the regulatory filing.

Cohen has increasingly bet on health care stocks recently, boosting the sector's representation in his portfolio from 16% to 21% from the third to fourth quarter. Further, most of the companies in which he has the largest ownership are drug manufacturers, biotech or medical devices stocks, the largest being a 7.6% stake in drug maker Summit Therapeutics PLC (NASDAQ:SMMT).

Adeptus is a burgeoning emergency care company expanding in the competitive market on the premise that emergency-room demand has exceeded capacity, the population continues to age and more individuals have gained access to insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

Adeptus operates 81 locations across Texas, Colorado and Arizona, making it the largest freestanding emergency company in the U.S. It also plans to open 24 new sites per year including joint ventures, expanding to New Orleans and Ohio next, according to its 10k.

In its first two years as a public company, Adeptus grew rapidly. For 2015 it reported a 72.9% year-over-year increase in patient service revenue to $420.6 million, fueled by increased patient visits, expansion from 46 to 62 facilities and higher rates. Net income grew to $32.8 million from a net loss of $17.3 million.

For the full year 2016, Adeptus announced guidance of $635.0 million to $665.0 million in net patient services revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.60.

Adeptus faces competition from other emergency care providers, traditional medical providers and hospital ERs. Similar companies attempting the same thing include Elite Care, ER Centers of America, Neighbors Emergency Care, and others, none of which are publicly traded.

Several investors tracked by GuruFocus traded Adeptus in the fourth quarter. Of note, Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) sold out his position, Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio) also initiated a position, and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) sold 42% of his shares.

Adeptus has a P/E ratio of 46.9, P/B ratio of 12.4% and P/S ratio of 1.86.

Adeptus’ stock went public in June at $22 per share, rose to a peak of $116 per share in September and closed at $54.88 per share Wednesday.
