In a game called \u201cLip Flip,\u201d the guest star\u2019s lips are projected onto Jimmy Fallon\u2019s face, and vice versa, allowing them to interview each other with a twist. As the Huffington Post reported, the two comedians wasted little time getting to know each other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jimmy Fallon, look at me,\u201d Big Daddy star Sandler began when his mouth appeared over Jimmy Fallon\u2019s face. \u201cI injured my hand whacking off. It was so much fun. That\u2019s what I get for trying it with my left hand. I learned my lesson. Back to old righty!\u201d\n\nAfter Jimmy Fallon failed at a good comeback for the joke, Sandler continued to poke fun at the host\u2019s injury.\n\n\u201cOh, how I miss the hospital! I liked it when that old dude gave me a sponge bath.\u201d\n\nAnd what Adam Sandler segment would be complete without an impromptu version of a song? Certainly not this one as Jimmy Fallon joined him in singing a rendition of Willie Nelson\u2019s \u201cAll The Girls I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d reported Us Magazine.\n\nAfter the \u201cLip Flip\u201d game, the 48-year-old actor gave Jimmy Fallon some parenting advice, as both funnymen are parents to two daughters, the Belfast Telegraph reported.\n\n\u201cWhen you go swimming with the kids, when your kids go off the diving board, you have to\u2026 And they say, \u2018Daddy, watch this,\u2019 and they do something like a cartwheel off the diving board and into the pool. You have to delay your reaction cause I get yelled at. They did the cartwheel. I go, \u2018YEAH, WAY TO GO! THAT\u2019S AWESOME,\u2019 and then they come up out of the water, and I\u2019d be staring at them. They\u2019ll be like, \u2018You didn\u2019t like it?'\u201d\n\nThe Tonight Show host appeared on the show with heavy bandages around his left ring finger. The injury occurred nearly a month ago when Jimmy Fallon fell in his home. Jimmy Fallon seriously injured the hand as his finger\u2019s flesh ripped open from his ring catching the side of a table. According to People, JimmyFallon has worn a cast for a few weeks following the injury.\n\nAdam Sandler isn\u2019t the only actor to get into the act on \u201cLip Flip\u201d with Jimmy Fallon. In an episode earlier this year, Fallon and former Friends co-star Jennifer Aniston swapped lips for a short segment on the show.\n\nJimmy Fallon also made news recently when his guest Amy Schumer trolled Bradley Cooper on national television.\n\n[Photo: The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Official YouTube]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jimmy Fallon has swapped lips with Adam Sandler in his 'Lip Flip' game segment, during which Sandler gave his opinions on how Jimmy Fallon injured his finger.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Jimmy Fallon has swapped lips with Adam Sandler in his \u2018Lip Flip\u2019 game segment, during which Sandler gave his opinions on how Jimmy Fallon injured his finger.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon Swaps Lips With Adam Sandler: Hear Sandler\u2019s Thoughts On How Jimmy Fallon Injured His Finger", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2276719/jimmy-fallon-swaps-lips-with-adam-sandler-hear-sandlers-thoughts-on-how-jimmy-fallon-injured-his-finger/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jimmy-Fallon2.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-23T15:16:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T16:20:00+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jimmy-Fallon2.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-07-23T15:16:38+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "jimmy fallon,adam sandler,pixels,the tonight show with jimmy fallon,tv", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jimmy-Fallon2.png", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jimmy Fallon has swapped lips with Adam Sandler in his \u2018Lip Flip\u2019 game segment, during which Sandler gave his opinions on how Jimmy Fallon injured his finger."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m Jimmy Fallon, look at me,\u201d Big Daddy star Sandler began when his mouth appeared over Jimmy Fallon\u2019s face.\nOne of the more memorable segments Jimmy Fallon has produced in recent memory involved Pixels star Adam Sandler this week.\nJimmy Fallon, the host of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on NBC, is well known for his nightly game segment on the show, usually involving the featured guest.\nAdam Sandler isn\u2019t the only actor to get into the act on \u201cLip Flip\u201d with Jimmy Fallon.\nJimmy Fallon also made news recently when his guest Amy Schumer trolled Bradley Cooper on national television."}
