Watertown, SD

The Ceremonial Ribbon cutting for the South Dakota National Guard’s new Regional Readiness Center in Watertown, SD was held on Saturday, September 7.

The new $25-million, 85,000 square foot facility now houses units from Miller, Redfield, Sisseton, Webster and Watertown. The consolidation of these units to the new location will save money, maximize resources, provide better training opportunities and develop more cohesive units which will be ready to better support state and federal objectives and disaster response.

The facility is home to about 400 soldiers and replaces Watertown’s aging National Guard Armory that has been in use since 1958.
