Yoga\u2019s breath control and body postures are believed to help nourish self-awareness, control stress and develop physical strength and balance.\n\nThe more traditional Hatha style of yoga is the most widely practiced in the U.S. But many specialized yoga \u201cproducts,\u201d such as hot yoga, power yoga and yoga retreats are part of a billion-dollar yoga industry.\n\nOne study estimates that 15 million Americans have practiced yoga at least once, according to Chu and her co-authors.\n\nThey focused on yoga\u2019s effects on cardiovascular disease, as well as risk factors including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat and abnormal cholesterol levels that make up a profile - known as metabolic syndrome \u2013 that often leads to heart disease and diabetes.\n\nThe study team analyzed 37 randomized, controlled trials involving 2,768 people through December 2013. The trials either looked at yoga compared to no exercise or to aerobic exercises. Participants\u2019 average age was 50 and they were followed for anywhere from 12 weeks to one year.\n\nThose who did yoga had significant improvements in a range of risk factors. Systolic blood pressure (the top number) dropped by an average of 5.21 mm Hg, and diastolic pressure (the bottom number) dropped 4.9 mm HG. LDL \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol fell by an average 12.14 mg/dl and HDL \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol rose by an average 3.20 mg/dl. Average heart rate was lower by a little over 5 beats per minute and weight loss averaged a bit over 5 pounds.\n\nThese changes were similar to the improvements seen among people who did aerobic exercise instead.\n\nThere were no changes, though, in fasting glucose levels or A1C, a measure of long-term blood sugar control in diabetics.\n\nChu and her colleagues note that one weakness of the results is that the analyzed trials included various types of yoga that were practiced for different amounts of time. These included Silver yoga (for seniors), Iyengar yoga (a form of Hatha that emphasizes correct postures), Viniyoga (which includes chanting) and Vinyasa (breath-synchronized movements.)\n\nThere were also a wide range of populations, from the young and healthy to older people with histories of heart disease, Chu told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cWe are not recommending anyone ditch their medicines or established medical or physical practices,\u201d she said. \u201cIndividuals can talk to their doctors about whether yoga is a viable option for them.\u201d\n\nYoga classes may be offered at health clubs, spas, senior centers and in other settings. Individual classes at stand-alone yoga centers tend to range from $15 to $30.\n\nPhillips said he encourages his patients to develop a healthy lifestyle and exercise regimen, which could include yoga. He urges people to find a class that is appropriate for their comfort level and ability.\n\n\u201cI think the effects of relaxation do decrease stress levels and have a benefit to the heart,\u201d said Phillips, adding that he had found doing yoga boosted his own mood and energy level.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1GXfPdi European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, online December 15, 2014.\n\n(By Janice Neumann)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yoga, may, benefit, heart, health, much, aerobics", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study finds that yoga may benefit the heart just as much as aerobic exercise, with implications for the elderly.", "title": "Yoga May Benefit Heart Health As Much As Aerobics", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/yoga-may-benefit-heart-health-much-aerobics-315546", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/27/yoga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study finds that yoga may benefit the heart just as much as aerobic exercise, with implications for the elderly.", "title": "Yoga May Benefit Heart Health As Much As Aerobics", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/yoga-may-benefit-heart-health-much-aerobics-315546", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/27/yoga.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/27/yoga.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-12-27T10:20:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T10:21:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study finds that yoga may benefit the heart just as much as aerobic exercise, with implications for the elderly."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94e3\"", "article_summary": "But many specialized yoga \u201cproducts,\u201d such as hot yoga, power yoga and yoga retreats are part of a billion-dollar yoga industry.\nA new study finds that yoga may benefit the heart just as much as aerobic exercise, with implications for the elderly.\nAverage heart rate was lower by a little over 5 beats per minute and weight loss averaged a bit over 5 pounds.\nThere were also a wide range of populations, from the young and healthy to older people with histories of heart disease, Chu told Reuters Health.\nBased on 37 clinical trials, researchers found that doing yoga lowered blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate and other cardiovascular risk factors in increments comparable to those seen with aerobic exercise."}
