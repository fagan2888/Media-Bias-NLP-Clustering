Selling these drugs in \"one-size-fits-all\" vials means consumers end up paying for more than needed.\n\nThe unused portions get thrown out for safety reasons.\n\nIn one example, the study found that about a third of the drug rituximab, commonly used to treat lymphoma and leukemia, gets tossed nearly every time it's administered. Still, patients have no choice but to pay for the full vials, causing excess spending of $254 million annually.\n\nMore Information To comment: tuletters@timesunion.com or at http://blog.timesunion.com/opinion\n\nAn estimated $309 million worth of the drug bortezomib, used to treat multiple myeloma, is wasted annually, the researchers found. In the U.S., it is only available in 2.5 mg vials, but in the United Kingdom it is sold in 1 mg vials, substantially reducing waste.\n\nThese revelations come months after the infamous case of Martin Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who jacked up by 7,000 percent the cost of Daraprim, a medication used to help prevent infections among cancer and AIDS patients. Turing raised the price of a single pill from $13.50 to $750, yet the same pills can be purchased for pennies outside the U.S. \u2014 reportedly for less than 10 cents in India and only two cents in Brazil. Unfortunately, the U.S. prohibits the importation of prescription drugs.\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week how companies like Turing are able to get away with this \"hyperpricing\" by using tightly-controlled distribution systems that stifle competition and artificially keep the costs of even generic drugs high.\n\nDrug manufacturers routinely counter that high prices support the development of new and better drugs. The huge profits these high prices generate also support the industry's significant campaign contributions, allowing it to wield considerable clout in Congress and block reforms that would hold down costs for consumers and for expensive government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nYet, instead of changing the laws requiring various size doses to reduce waste, or opening the door to importing cheaper drugs while building in sensible safeguards, or enabling the government to negotiate directly with drug companies for better pricing, Congress has instead tried 55 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTalk about misplaced priorities. If Congress truly wants to rein in the high cost of health care, it should start by cracking down on Big Pharma's gouging of American consumers.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Price manipulation in one form or another is often cited as the reason prescription medications cost so much in the U.S. But pharmaceutical companies have hit a new low: limiting the way certain cancer drugs are packaged, forcing Americans to throw out billions of dollars in unused drugs each year.
