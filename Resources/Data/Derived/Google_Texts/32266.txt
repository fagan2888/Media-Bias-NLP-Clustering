New Zealand native Callum Millward last won a 70.3 Ironman triathlon in 2012 and it was a dramatic sprint finish.

On Saturday at Boulder Reservoir, Millward skipped the drama and separated from the field to win the Ironman 70.3 Boulder in 3:46:47. Of course winning a race like the Ironman 70.3 Boulder, which regularly draws top-level local and international talent, is never easy.

But on Saturday, Millward said winning wasn't as difficult as he'd expected.

"It was good to win one by myself," Millward said. "It's just funny how some days it's really hard and some days it just kind of clicks. Today, I didn't feel like I extended myself but I kept it pretty consistent throughout."

A New Zealand native who lives in Boulder during the summer, Millward said he just felt like everything came easily on Saturday. A free and easy day couldn't have come at a better time with his competition including the likes of three-time British Olympian Tim Don and Colorado's Ben Hoffman, who placed second at the 2014 Ironman World Championships.

Millward pulled away from Don and Hoffman early in the run portion of the race, which featured a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike and a 13.1-mile run. At the 12K mark of the run portion, Millward passed countryman Mark Bowstead, who ended up third with a time of 3:48:34, and cruised to win the championship.

After finishing third in 2013 and fourth in 2014 at the Ironman 70.3 Boulder, this year's win was exactly the jump Millward was looking for while trying to qualify for the world championships in 2015.

"I kind of surprised myself," Millward said. "I found it pretty comfortable. I've been working pretty hard on my bike because I'm doing the Ironman Coeur d'Alene (Idaho) in two weeks and the plan was to get a bunch of points here and a bunch of points in Coeur d'Alene to cement my place in the top 50 for the start list for the world championships."

"I was more worried about Tim Don, who was second here last year. But it's a new course so I just broke it down into the 5K segments and saw that about halfway, Tim hadn't really taken too much time out of me and I decided it was go time."

Don finished second for the second straight year, this time in 3:48:11. Colorado native Richie Cunningham placed fourth with a time of 3:50:57. Defending Ironman 70.3 Boulder champion Joe Gambles is competing in Europe this summer and did not race on Saturday.

"It's always tough racing here against world-class competition," Don said. "But I can't complain about having an average race to take second. I'm happy with that."

In the women's race, 32-year-old Alicia Kaye won by over five minutes with a time of 4:13:10. The Clermont, Fla., native, who is in Boulder to train this summer, pulled away with a strong push on the bike portion.

"I'm not always going to have a cushion like this but I had a special day today," Kaye said. "I just got on the bike and I never looked back. I destroyed myself on the bike so it was really hard to find the pace on the run. But the competition forced me to do that and it was a really good day all around."

Colorado natives Katy Blakemore (3:18:33) and Lesley Smith (4:2047) placed second and third, respectively.

Boulder Reservoir was closed on Thursday because of elevated bacteria levels in the water but was reopened Friday when tests concluded that the bacteria had declined to suitable level.
