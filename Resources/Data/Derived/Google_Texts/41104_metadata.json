That\u2019s because he used a powder, known in the media as Magic Pixie Dust, to regrow one horse jockey\u2019s digit \u2014 both tissue and bone \u2014 after it was bitten off by his horse while feeding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a certain powder, a dust that you sprinkle on your finger every other day, you wrap it up, and long story short, it grew back \u2014 the majority of it,\u201d Paul Halpern, the New Jersey-based horse jockey, who spends some of his time in Florida, told NBC6. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy.\u201d\n\nThe procedure is a form of xenotransplantation, more commonly known as cross-species transplantation, during which animal organs or tissue are transplanted into humans, and it's non-surgical and painless. ACell, a producer of the MatriStem powder, says that it is made from tissue of pig bladders because the \u201cprotein scaffold\u201d is \u201cnearly identical to that of human tissue.\u201d\n\nDr. Eugenio Rodriguez, of the Deerfield Beach Outpatient Surgical Center, gave Halpern the powder, telling him to apply it to where he lost part of his finger, along with a protective sheet containing a saline solution. Over the course of two months, the finger slowly grew back.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t notice at the time, but once everything had healed, and the fingernail grew back, which is quite miraculous, and the skin healed over, then you really notice,\u201d Halpern told NBC6.\n\nThe powder works by attracting stem cells to the wound site and then promoting growth, Rodriguez said. He\u2019s been using the powder for over three years, and believes he\u2019s the only one in South Florida to use it.\n\nOthers across the nation have used it too, however, with similarly \u201cmiraculous\u201d results, as one 51-year-old Nebraska patient, who had lost the tip of his thumb in a chainsaw accident, described it. \u201cThe best one thousand bucks I ever spent,\u201d he said, according to Burns & Levinson, LLP, who represents ACell.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "horse jockey, regrow finger, pig bladder, stem cells", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A procedure that uses powder made from pigs' bladders to regrow tissue and bone helped one man regrow his finger after his horse bit it off.", "title": "Horse Jockey Regrows Bitten-Off Finger With Powder Made From Pig Bladders [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/horse-jockey-paul-halpern-regrows-bitten-finger-help-powder-made-pig-bladders-video-257080", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/lost-finger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A procedure that uses powder made from pigs' bladders to regrow tissue and bone helped one man regrow his finger after his horse bit it off.", "title": "Horse Jockey Regrows Bitten-Off Finger With Powder Made From Pig Bladders [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/horse-jockey-paul-halpern-regrows-bitten-finger-help-powder-made-pig-bladders-video-257080", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/lost-finger.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/lost-finger.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-17T16:56:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-17T16:58:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A procedure that uses powder made from pigs' bladders to regrow tissue and bone helped one man regrow his finger after his horse bit it off."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc82a\"", "article_summary": "A procedure that uses powder made from pigs' bladders to regrow tissue and bone helped one man regrow his finger after his horse bit it off.\nHe\u2019s been using the powder for over three years, and believes he\u2019s the only one in South Florida to use it.\nOver the course of two months, the finger slowly grew back.\nThat\u2019s because he used a powder, known in the media as Magic Pixie Dust, to regrow one horse jockey\u2019s digit \u2014 both tissue and bone \u2014 after it was bitten off by his horse while feeding.\nThe powder works by attracting stem cells to the wound site and then promoting growth, Rodriguez said."}
