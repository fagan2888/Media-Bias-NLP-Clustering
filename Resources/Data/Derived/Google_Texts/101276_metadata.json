But some of those who signed up for Obamacare will need to take additional steps when filing their taxes this year.\n\nConsumers who signed up for health care through a marketplace will receive a new form this month, called 1095-A, which they\u2019ll have to fill out and will be needed for filing Federal taxes.\n\nOn that form, you\u2019ll be asked to figure out whether you received the correct amount of financial assistance, whether you have to be subject to a penalty and whether you can claim an exemption among other things.\n\nAdvance Premium Tax Credit\n\nThe government has been providing financial assistance to some Americans to lower the monthly cost of health insurance on an advanced basis. These credits have been applied directly to monthly health insurance premiums.\n\nHowever, since the tax credit is determined based on your estimate of your household income, it needs to be reconciled taking into account your actual household income when you file your tax return. So you may owe money if you\u2019ve underestimated your income, reducing your refund, while it could increase your refund if you\u2019ve overestimated it.\n\nThis could impact about 3.4 million, estimated H&R Block, which partnered with GoHealth to help explain to consumers the new overlap with health insurance and taxes.\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons to Get a Head Start on Your Taxes\n\nPenalty\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance and don\u2019t qualify for an exemption, you\u2019ll have to pay the higher amount between a flat fee penalty and a percentage penalty.\n\nThe penalty will be $96 for an adult and $47 for a child for 2014, up to $285 per household, or 1 percent of your annual household income. The penalty will increase in each of the next two years. This could mean a smaller refund or you might owe more in taxes.\n\n\u201cThis will be an unpleasant surprise to people who are still unaware that virtually everyone is now required by law to have health insurance,\u201d said Mahoney.\n\nExemptions\n\nYou could lower this penalty or eliminate it if you qualify for one of the exemptions based on financial hardships, religious affiliations and gaps in coverage among others. Just remember that you may need to apply for some exemptions and receive approval.\n\n\u201cManage your expectations regarding your tax refund, especially if you have received a tax subsidy or were uninsured for three or more months in 2014,\u201d said Mahoney.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is supposed to make health care coverage more affordable to millions of Americans, but this year, it might also make filing your 2014 more cumbersome and more expensive.", "title": "How Obamacare Will Impact Your 2014 Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/20/How-Obamacare-Will-Impact-Your-2014-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08112014_Obamacare_Website_Laptop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/20/How-Obamacare-Will-Impact-Your-2014-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08112014_Obamacare_Website_Laptop.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is supposed to make health care coverage more affordable to millions of Americans, but this year, it might also make filing your 2014 more cumbersome and more expensive.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe029f\"", "article_summary": "This could impact about 3.4 million, estimated H&R Block, which partnered with GoHealth to help explain to consumers the new overlap with health insurance and taxes.\nBut some of those who signed up for Obamacare will need to take additional steps when filing their taxes this year.\n\u201cManage your expectations regarding your tax refund, especially if you have received a tax subsidy or were uninsured for three or more months in 2014,\u201d said Mahoney.\n\u201cThis will be an unpleasant surprise to people who are still unaware that virtually everyone is now required by law to have health insurance,\u201d said Mahoney.\nThese credits have been applied directly to monthly health insurance premiums."}
