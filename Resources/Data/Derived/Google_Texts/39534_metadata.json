She tweeted she wouldn\u2019t know what to do if she found out her unborn child had Down Syndrome. Dawkins\u2019 reply: \u201cAbort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice.\u201d\n\nMeet Cheston Hearron, my brother. Cheston has Down Syndrome.\n\nI am not at all offended by the comments of Dawkins. His response is exactly what one would expect from an individual positing an atheistic worldview.\n\nDawkins is merely acting out the logical implications of his view. Dawkins\u2019 worldview is devoid of God, so when faced with such a moral dilemma, he does what he thinks is right for him. Furthermore, his moral answers will change from person to person and even culture to culture. He even has his own category of immorality: bringing a baby with Down Syndrome into the world. The implications of this view are obvious.\n\nAs a Christian with a biblical worldview, I would have given this woman a different answer. As a theist, when faced with a moral dilemma, I have a firm anchor-point: God\u2019s unchanging nature that grounds morality. I would challenge her to think about the God question. If God exists and has created human beings in his image then it would be immoral to end the life of this child just because he has Down Syndrome.\n\nThis answer does not change from person to person nor culture to culture. It is an objective moral value. To terminate the child\u2019s life, is to place oneself in a position reserved only for God. The image of God is a very powerful argument for equal rights for all human beings. There is no physical trait that all human beings share. There are tall people, short people, large people, small people, smart people, dumb people, those who are socially useful and those who are socially useless.\n\nYet, we all feel that every human deserves to be treated equally. I know of no one who thinks attractive people deserve more rights than unattractive people. So, since you cannot put your finger on a physical trait that grounds equal rights then perhaps what grounds them is non-physical.\n\nThe image of God is the perfect candidate for the grounding of equal rights. To be an image bearer, is to reflect certain characteristics of God. We are capable of relationships, we display emotions and we make choices. These are all characteristics of God. However, the image of God is tarnished because of sin and will one day be completely redeemed when Christ returns. Atheism eliminates the image of God and therefore has no justification for human rights.\n\nWhen I am around my brother, he makes me laugh. He is a wonderful uncle to my two children. They love him dearly. He is highly functional and genuinely loves people. My parents would inform you that it has not been easy rearing a child with Down Syndrome. But they also would tell you that the joy he has brought into their lives and the lives of others cannot be measured.\n\nThe world is a better place because of Cheston Hearron. I am reminded of Paul\u2019s first letter to the Corinthians (I Cor. 1:27-28) \u201cBut God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things \u2014and the things that are not \u2014 to nullify the things that are. ...\u201d\n\nHe chose Cheston!\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/guest-columnists/2014/12/29/syndrome-image-god/21000821/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We all feel that every human deserves to be treated equally", "og": {"site_name": "shreveporttimes.com", "description": "We all feel that every human deserves to be treated equally", "title": "Down Syndrome and the image of God", "url": "http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/guest-columnists/2014/12/29/syndrome-image-god/21000821/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/shreveporttimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We all feel that every human deserves to be treated equally", "title": "Down Syndrome and the image of God", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc457cb6c68e6ee790e0f4576f13bf8ede946317/c=0-0-500-500&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Shreveport/2014/12/29/B9315669588Z.1_20141229112602_000_G4B9HMMBV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@shreveporttimes", "site": "@shreveporttimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898368928", "fb": {"app_id": 170028863032820}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5c3\"", "article_summary": "Atheism eliminates the image of God and therefore has no justification for human rights.\nHowever, the image of God is tarnished because of sin and will one day be completely redeemed when Christ returns.\nIf God exists and has created human beings in his image then it would be immoral to end the life of this child just because he has Down Syndrome.\n1:27-28) \u201cBut God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.\nThe image of God is a very powerful argument for equal rights for all human beings."}
