He argued that Mr. Sanders was ducking arguments over his health care plan and other domestic proposals, then kicked his speech up a notch as he accused Mr. Sanders of resorting to name-calling with his tirades against the \u201cestablishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s killing America, that kind of politics,\u201d Mr. Clinton said after describing Mr. Sanders\u2019s rejection of skeptical reports by liberal economists on his Medicare-for-all plan. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Republicans do all the time \u2013 they just call each other names. Let\u2019s have a conversation.\u201d\n\nMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in a statement on Monday night that the campaign \u201chas been all about big ideas and specific proposals on how to change our rigged economy and corrupt political system,\u201d and that Mr. Sanders \u201chas a specific ideas that are resonating with grassroots supporters who have made a record 5 million donations to his campaign.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHe won three of the four states that held contests last weekend and is in this race to the convention in Philadelphia. It looks like President Clinton is understandably nervous about all that and it\u2019s causing him to say some things that don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders has at times responded to critics \u2013 usually Clinton allies \u2013 by calling them part of the political establishment, but he and his campaign have also put out details about higher taxes and potential savings associated with his heath care and he has defended the substance of it.\n\nWhile Mrs. Clinton is far ahead of Mr. Sanders in their race for delegates needed to win the nomination, and she leads in public polls in North Carolina, the Clinton campaign has remained on the offensive against Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, criticizing his policy record and questioning his openness to criticism.\n\nMr. Clinton was also blunt in assailing Republicans who have rejected Medicaid money to provide health care for more people under the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Clinton said some Republicans had used \u201ccoded racist language\u201d when they criticize Medicaid dollars as a kind of \u201cwelfare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160307161935, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Clinton, Bill;Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Sanders, Bernard", "org": "Elon University", "keywords": "Clinton Bill,Clinton Hillary Rodham,Sanders Bernard,Presidential Election of 2016,Elon University,Greensboro (NC),Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Patrick Healy", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Patrick Healy", "byl": "Patrick Healy", "twitter": {"description": "The former president said that Mr. Sanders was ducking arguments over his health care plan and other domestic proposals with his tirades against the \u201cestablishment.\u201d", "title": "Bill Clinton Has Tough Words for Bernie Sanders in North Carolina", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/07/bill-clinton-has-tough-words-for-bernie-sanders-in-north-carolina/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/08/us/07fd-billclinton/07fd-billclinton-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004257419, "description": "The former president said that Mr. Sanders was ducking arguments over his health care plan and other domestic proposals with his tirades against the \u201cestablishment.\u201d", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 7, 2016", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-03072016.jsonp", "article": {"published_time": 1457385575, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/patrick_d_healy/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T03:04:25-05:00"}, "geo": "Greensboro (NC)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160308030425, "PUD": 20160307, "pdate": 20160307, "des": "Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/08/us/07fd-billclinton/07fd-billclinton-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "The former president said that Mr. Sanders was ducking arguments over his health care plan and other domestic proposals with his tirades against the \u201cestablishment.\u201d", "title": "Bill Clinton Has Tough Words for Bernie Sanders in North Carolina", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/07/bill-clinton-has-tough-words-for-bernie-sanders-in-north-carolina/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/08/us/07fd-billclinton/07fd-billclinton-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Bill Clinton Has Tough Words for Bernie Sanders in North Carolina", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/03/08/us/07fd-billclinton/07fd-billclinton-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 7, 2016"}, "article_summary": "PhotoGREENSBORO, N.C. \u2013 As Hillary Clinton focused on Bernie Sanders in Michigan on Monday, the day before the primary there, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had some tough words for Mr. Sanders in North Carolina, where early voting is underway for the March 15 nominating contest.\nMr. Clinton said some Republicans had used \u201ccoded racist language\u201d when they criticize Medicaid dollars as a kind of \u201cwelfare.\u201d\nMr. Clinton was also blunt in assailing Republicans who have rejected Medicaid money to provide health care for more people under the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile Mrs. Clinton is far ahead of Mr. Sanders in their race for delegates needed to win the nomination, and she leads in public polls in North Carolina, the Clinton campaign has remained on the offensive against Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, criticizing his policy record and questioning his openness to criticism.\nIf Mr. Clinton\u2019s line of attack was familiar \u2013 that Mr. Sanders dismisses all critics as being part of \u201cthe establishment\u201d \u2013 the former president added some sharp language at a small rally here at Elon University law school."}
