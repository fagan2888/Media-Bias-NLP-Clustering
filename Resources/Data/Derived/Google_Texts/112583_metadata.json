O\u2019Malley said.\n\nThe Walgreens entities also agreed to pay agency investigative costs of $79,200 and civil penalties totaling $423,000, according to O\u2019Malley.\n\nShe said Walgreens and its counsel worked cooperatively with prosecutors to promptly resolve the matter and to implement the new compliance procedures.\n\n\u201cPharmacist consultations are imperative to make certain that prescriptions have been filled according to a doctor\u2019s order as well as to advise the patient of proper and safe usage of the medication,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMy office remains dedicated to ensuring that the public has access to knowledge and education regarding the use of all prescription drugs,\u201d she said.\n\nWalgreens said in a statement: \u201cOur settlement agreement is consistent with our company\u2019s long-standing commitment to make pharmacists available to patients for advice and consultation on their medications and any other health concerns they may have.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pharmacy chain agrees to pay $500,000 to settle consumer protection lawsuit.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Walgreens Settles With California Over Complaint About Pharmacists\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/19\\/walgreens-settles-with-california-over-complaint-about-pharmacists\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-19 08:31:12\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-19 08:31:12\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":64053,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/01\\/Pills.Credit_Grumpy-Puddin2.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Pharmacy chain agrees to pay $500,000 to settle consumer protection lawsuit.", "title": "Walgreens Settles With California Over Complaint About Pharmacists", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/19/walgreens-settles-with-california-over-complaint-about-pharmacists/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/01/Pills.Credit_Grumpy-Puddin2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ccf\"", "article_summary": "The Walgreens entities also agreed to pay agency investigative costs of $79,200 and civil penalties totaling $423,000, according to O\u2019Malley.\nShe said Walgreens and its counsel worked cooperatively with prosecutors to promptly resolve the matter and to implement the new compliance procedures.\nUnder the terms of the judgment in San Diego County Superior Court, which was entered without admission of liability, Walgreens is required to comply with California\u2019s standards for patient consultations and must fully implement an internal compliance program.\nShe said the three offices, working with the state board, conducted an undercover investigation of the consultation practices of a number of the major pharmacy chains in California.\nThe Walgreens Co. pharmacy chain has agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a consumer protection lawsuit that alleged that its pharmacies didn\u2019t properly consult with consumers of prescription drugs, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley said today."}
