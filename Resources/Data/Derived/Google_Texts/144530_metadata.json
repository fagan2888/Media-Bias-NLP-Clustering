For more than eight years, Molesky and a bunch of supporters have worked to make it a community center of Alstead, albeit a tough-to-find one. It\u2019s hosted regional bands, charity events, live theater and even multi-media performance art.\n\nAnd when people do find the place, not only do they stay, they keep coming back \u2014 bringing friends, coolers of homemade hooch and a dish to pass.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a tremendous transformation in Dennis and the community in terms of him transforming that space,\u201d said Mole Hill co-founder Peter C. Hendrick, who by day runs a scientific association, but at heart and at night is an acting coach at Mole Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat Dennis has really done is taken that space and has really provided a vital spark to a very small, rural community. And now what we\u2019re seeing are events where families and young musicians and old musicians and folk musicians, blues, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the acting performances are all in this small unique theater. And so, it\u2019s been very exciting.\u201d\n\nMolesky, 52, grew up on the property, just as his father did. Molesky\u2019s father, Ben, was the son of immigrants \u2014 his mother from Sweden, father from Lithuania \u2014 and one of 12 siblings. Ben Molesky\u2019s father bought the 8 acres of property at 789 Gilsum Mine Road in 1924 for $250 and paid it off a little bit per year, working in the mines, Dennis Molesky said.\n\n\u201cMy dad said they had so many kids in such a small house that they had to sleep in drawers, in shifts,\u201d Molesky said. \u201cMy dad was prone to exaggeration, but you get the idea of how small it was.\u201d\n\nThe sons eventually learned how to use their hands and set to work building a slightly bigger, but still modest, house on the property. It\u2019s the house Dennis Molesky still lives in today, with a few additions built over the years.\n\nWhen Ben Molesky was a young man he made his way 11 miles every day from Alstead to Keene to learn the tool and die business. By 1955, his father had died and Ben Molesky promised his siblings he would care for their mother. Eventually, he was able to borrow some money, buy a few pieces of machinery on credit, kick the cows out of the barn and set up his own shop \u2014 named Triple M after his wife, Marjorie Marie Molesky, whom he\u2019d married that year.\n\nIn 1961, Dennis Molesky was born, the middle of two brothers.\n\n\u201cGrowing up was idyllic,\u201d Molesky said. \u201cThere were fields around and dogs and summers. We were lower middle class I\u2019d say, but there were still vacations to the White Mountains.\u201d\n\nBy the late 1960s, Molesky\u2019s father expanded the buildings and the business to include metal stamping. The boys all helped their dad at the shop, but that was it.\n\n\u201cI did not learn the trade,\u201d Molesky said. \u201cMy mother\u2019s attitude was ... she wanted to offer us the freedom so that we weren\u2019t obligated to be in the shop. And we also didn\u2019t run the machines in the shop, the presses, because, you know, there are certain dangers involved in that. So we weren\u2019t necessarily steered away from the business, but we certainly weren\u2019t steered towards it.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime Molesky graduated high school and went on to the University of New Hampshire to study chemical engineering and earned his MBA at the school. At the end of it he was offered a partnering interest in a start-up business doing applied research in flame technology in Lee, and lived and worked there for seven years.\n\nBut then, well, he shifted gears. He headed West. He worked in the skiing industry, built log homes, conducted wilderness trips for kids, and went exploring.\n\nHe eventually came to Vermont, where he dabbled in the renewable energy business.\n\n\u201cIt was prompted perhaps when my mother passed. And I just wanted something different,\u201d Molesky said. \u201cFrom the time I was in high school, I had no clue what I wanted to do. We had so many opportunities handed to us on a silver platter \u2014 not that we were rich by any means, I don\u2019t mean that \u2014 but everything my parents did, they did so that we had choices. And sometimes when you\u2019re given all these choices, it takes a while to sort through them.\u201d\n\nAfter five years, he spent a summer back in Alstead with his dad. And for the first time, he could imagine himself settling down there, if only to be closer to his father. Molesky started learning a little more about the business and where his father was at with it. Like the rest of the industry, Triple M was getting by, but definitely not thriving.\n\nMolesky\u2019s dad died in 1999 and left the property to him. Molesky settled into life back in Alstead and started sorting through the business, determined to continue it long enough to get its two full-time employees to retirement. It was important, he said, because his dad was an old-school employer, a man of loyalty. He wanted to honor that. That said, tool and die making just wasn\u2019t his calling. He just had to make it through.\n\nAnd he was making it through when, at the suggestion of his girlfriend Jackie Hensen in 2003, the couple decided to have a karaoke party in the shop. But just three days before, war broke out in Iraq. The party went on, complete with beer, karaoke, and, soon, differing opinions on the war.\n\n\u201cThings got kind of tense,\u201d Molesky said.\n\nThough it didn\u2019t come to fisticuffs, a fight broke out. To settle the tension, one of the party-goers got up and sang Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s, \u201cWang Dang Doodle,\u201d which broke the ice. Out of the chaos came inspiration.\n\n\u201cPeter (Hendrick) said, \u2018This is great theater. Let\u2019s build one,\u2019 \u201d Molesky said.\n\nSo they did.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, they loaded up a truck with some wood and built a stage between two of the biggest presses.\n\nThey started out by giving free weekly acting classes, which turned into full-scale productions, including an original musical adaptation of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d called \u201cDorothy\u2019s Road to Oz,\u201d written by Alstead Selectman Matthew Saxton.\n\nMusic was the next natural step, and bands started agreeing to play the off-the-beaten-path venue, with almost all the proceeds going to local charities. And as word has gotten out about Mole Hill, it\u2019s developed a loyal following of regulars, who\u2019ve helped keep the light lit at the place most Friday nights.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been a very, almost mythical journey,\u201d Hendrick said. \u201cDennis has taken it in his own way and created a performance space for the entire community. ... I think it\u2019s really his spirit and Jackie Kensen who\u2019s been partnering with him who have really transformed that space from an industrial, masculine, oil and machinery tool shop into something very special.\u201d\n\nJust as it has over and over again in its long and storied history, the venue is going through yet another iteration: Nonprofit.\n\nNot only did they recently expand the stage, but Molesky said they are in the process of making the Mole Hill Theatre a nonprofit performing arts center for Alstead, where productions will continue to benefit local charities. Molesky would act as landlord and the shop, with all its equipment, would be preserved for an on-site museum.\n\n\u201cThe fulfillment (for me) is in having taken my dad\u2019s world and morphed it into a place that resonates with me, and I had a lot of help with that,\u201d Molesky said. \u201cThe fulfillment was and is in the transformation of space and in what happens when people gather and are able to celebrate. I\u2019ve been able to honor the hard work of my parents through this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "It turns out all that was needed to awaken the cultural heart of a tiny town in the Monadnock Region was a war, a fight and \u201cWang Dang Doodle.\u201d Well, that and Dennis Molesky.", "title": "Molesky finds fulfillment and way to honor his parents in Alstead", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/news/local/molesky-finds-fulfillment-and-way-to-honor-his-parents-in/article_8fed0208-878c-5d16-b816-5b6f3d852a0b.html", "image": {"width": 310, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/e3/9e382d2b-62f7-57e0-89af-292532ad1572/522ab6f779c98.preview-300.jpg?resize=310%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary"}, "description": "It turns out all that was needed to awaken the cultural heart of a tiny town in the Monadnock Region was a war, a fight and \u201cWang Dang Doodle.\u201d Well, that and Dennis Molesky.", "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local,featured,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local,featured,top_story"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s the house Dennis Molesky still lives in today, with a few additions built over the years.\nIn 1961, Dennis Molesky was born, the middle of two brothers.\nWhen Ben Molesky was a young man he made his way 11 miles every day from Alstead to Keene to learn the tool and die business.\nIt turns out all that was needed to awaken the cultural heart of a tiny town in the Monadnock Region was a war, a fight and \u201cWang Dang Doodle.\u201d Well, that and Dennis Molesky.\nMolesky would act as landlord and the shop, with all its equipment, would be preserved for an on-site museum."}
