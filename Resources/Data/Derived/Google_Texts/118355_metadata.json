Nothing gets done,\" said Roy Gustafson, 61, of Camden, South Carolina, who lives on disability payments. \"The state would be better off handling things on its own.\"\n\nScottish unionists won by a wider-than-expected 10-percentage-point margin.\n\nFalling public approval of the Obama administration, attention to the Scottish vote and the success of activists who accuse the U.S. government of overstepping its authority - such as the self-proclaimed militia members who flocked to Nevada's Bundy ranch earlier this year during a standoff over grazing rights - is driving up interest in secession, experts said.\n\n\"It seems to have heated up, especially since the election of President Obama,\" said Mordecai Lee, a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, who has studied secessionist movements.\n\n'OBAMACARE' A FACTOR\n\nRepublicans were more inclined to support the idea, with 29.7 percent favoring it compared with 21 percent of Democrats.\n\nBrittany Royal, a 31-year-old nurse from Wilkesboro, North Carolina, said anger over the \"Obamacare\" healthcare reform law made her wonder if her state would be better off on its own.\n\n\"That has really hurt a lot of people here, myself included. My insurance went from $40 a week for a family of four up to over $600 a month for a family of four,\" said Royal, a Republican. \"The North Carolina government itself is sustainable. Governor (Pat) McCrory, I think he has a better healthcare plan than President Obama.\"\n\nBy region, the idea was least popular in New England, the cradle of the Revolutionary War, with just 17.4 percent of respondents open to pulling their state out.\n\nIt was most popular in the Southwest, where 34.1 percent of respondents back the idea.\n\nThat region includes Texas, where an activist group is calling the state's legislature to put the secession question on a statewide ballot. One Texan respondent said he was confident his state could get by without the rest of the country.\n\n\"Texas has everything we need. We have the manufacturing, we have the oil, and we don't need them,\" said Mark Denny, a 59-year-old retiree living outside Dallas on disability payments.\n\nDenny, a Republican, had cheered on the Scottish independence movement.\n\n\"I have totally, completely lost faith in the federal government, the people running it, whether Republican, Democrat, independent, whatever,\" he said.\n\nEven in Texas, some respondents said talk about breaking away was more of a sign of their anger with Washington than evidence of a real desire to go it alone. Democrat Lila Guzman, of Round Rock, said the threat could persuade Washington lawmakers and the White House to listen more closely to average people's concerns.\n\n\"When I say secede, I'm not like (former National Rifle Association president) Charlton Heston with my gun up in the air, 'my cold dead hands.' It's more like - we could do it if we had to,\" said Guzman, 62. \"But the first option is, golly, get it back on the right track. Not all is lost. But there might come a point that we say, 'Hey, y'all, we're dusting our hands and we're moving on.'\" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Additional reporting by Mimi Dwyer in New York; Editing by Douglas Royalty)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Secession Attempts Secession Attempts\n\n1 of 9 Baja Arizona Left-leaning Arizonans attempted to get a measure on the ballot in 2011 that would create a new bastion for liberals in the state. Though ultimately unsuccessful, the measure would have given voters a choice to decide whether to chip off Pima County from the rest of Arizona, creating another state: Baja Arizona. It's an idea that's long been discussed, but The Tucson Sentinel reports that the most recent action was spurred by a desire for greater control over local issues and discontent with proceedings at the Phoenix statehouse. \"Every bill we've heard about here is either anti-abortion laws or anti-Mexican laws. These are not laws that are geared toward solving the real problems that we have,\" David Euchner, treasurer of Start Our State , the group behind the secession push, told the Arizona Daily Star.
