Saturday the public was given the opportunity to purchase some valuable items. Not from your typical department stores, but from the backyard of the Bay County Sheriff's Office.

"I've been looking for a truck," said Robert Hayden, an auction attendee. "I need a pickup truck."

Cars and jewelry were some of the items for sale, which had hundreds ready to bid.

Captain Steve Harbuck of the Bay County Sheriff's Office said, "Once we build up a surplus of former vehicles that are no longer good for service for us, we get them ready to auction them off to the public."

At one point in time these items were either used by sheriff's officials or seized by them.

"It was a police car at one time so I know they maintain it," said Hayden. "I don't know how many people got shot inside though, but I hope its going to be clean when I get it and take it home."

Bid after bid, the public competed to take the items home.

"It's anxious," said auction attendee Richard Fenlon. "When your bidding it gets anxious you think someone is going to outbid you and all."

"You get a chance to have a real good look at it," said Hayden. "Research the price and everything before you bid on it."

Over 75 cars, and jewelry were purchased on Saturday, and all of the money will go toward the Bay County Sheriff's Office.

For one lucky retired police officer, the day was about family and getting a new car.

"We've always been into cars," said Fenlon. "Me and my son so we like to get cars at reasonable prices and this turned out to be a good car at a reasonable price."
