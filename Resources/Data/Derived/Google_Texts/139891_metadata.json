Yet, as ThinkProgress laid out shortly after Boehner announced that he would file the lawsuit, Rivkin\u2019s legal theory rests upon \u201ca glaring misrepresentation of a recent Supreme Court decision that undermines much of the basis for this lawsuit.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Boehner decided to hire Rivkin to represent the GOP-led House in its suit against the president. Rivkin\u2019s price? $500 an hour, all charged to the American taxpayer.\n\nThe contract caps Rivkin\u2019s fees at a total of $350,000, although, if past is prologue, this cap will rise quickly. During the litigation challenging the Defense of Marriage Act, Boehner hired former Solicitor General Paul Clement to defend anti-gay discrimination at a fee of $520 per hour. Although an early iteration of Clement\u2019s contract capped his total fees at $500,000, the total cost of Boehner\u2019s legal services rose to $2.3 million. Clement\u2019s legal fees were also charged to the American taxpayer.\n\nHowever much money Rivkin ultimately collects from the American people, he is unlikely to win his lawsuit if the judges who consider it follow existing law. As a general rule, a plaintiff bringing a lawsuit must have actually been injured in some way by the person they are suing. Neither Boehner nor any other member of Congress, however, has been injured by President Obama\u2019s decision to delay implementation of the provision of the Affordable Care Act at issue in this case. Additionally, in a 1997 case called Raines v. Byrd, the Supreme Court explained that suits brought by members of Congress alleging that their institutional rights as lawmakers have been injured are highly discouraged.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s worth noting that the Roberts Court has shown a willingness to abandon established law when Obamacare is involved, so there is no guarantee that Rivkin will lose.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The contract caps the attorney's fees at a total of $350,000, although, if past is prologue, this cap will rise quickly.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The contract caps the attorney's fees at a total of $350,000, although, if past is prologue, this cap will rise quickly.", "title": "Speaker Boehner\u2019s Lawyer Is Charging The American Taxpayer $500 An Hour To Sue Obama", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/08/25/3475566/speaker-boehners-lawyer-is-charging-the-american-taxpayer-500-an-hour-to-sue-obama/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BoehnerObama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The contract caps the attorney's fees at a total of $350,000, although, if past is prologue, this cap will rise quickly.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BoehnerObama-321x214.jpg", "title": "Speaker Boehner\u2019s Lawyer Is Charging The American Taxpayer $500 An Hour To Sue Obama", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BoehnerObama.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/BoehnerObama.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T17:27:42+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "$500 an hour, all charged to the American taxpayer.\nJustice Speaker Boehner\u2019s Lawyer Is Charging The American Taxpayer $500 An Hour To Sue Obama CREDIT: White House/Pete SouzaLast January, a Washington attorney named David Rivkin co-authored an article in Politico Magazine that laid out a legal theory that Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) now plans to use to sue President Obama because the president is not implementing Obamacare fast enough.\nThe contract caps Rivkin\u2019s fees at a total of $350,000, although, if past is prologue, this cap will rise quickly.\nAlthough an early iteration of Clement\u2019s contract capped his total fees at $500,000, the total cost of Boehner\u2019s legal services rose to $2.3 million.\nClement\u2019s legal fees were also charged to the American taxpayer."}
