Many have already been interpreters, such as Khang, or former patients who draw on their own experience, Obermark said. The system subsidizes their education toward certification. As a child growing up in Minnesota, Foua Khang helped her immigrant parents and grandparents cope in a place where few people spoke their native Hmong language.Now, as a community health worker employed by St. Paul-based HealthEast Care System, she helps those in her Hmong community navigate the complex and confusing U.S. healthcare system, communicate with their providers and meet their daily needs.Khang helps area refugees and providers bridge the cultural gaps that can lead to miscommunication.

Wages vary from $10 to $28 an hour, according to federal data from 2013.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act called for grants to encourage the use of community health workers to improve health among underserved Americans. Under the law, at least two dozen innovation grants have been awarded to states to promote expanded community health-worker services, according to the Urban Institute.Their services may become more in demand under accountable care and global-budget contracts that financially reward hospitals and medical groups for controlling medical spending. Such contracts enable provider systems to provide care-coordination services that aren't paid for under traditional fee-for-service models. Randall Bovbjerg, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute, said delinking payment from specific services will free providers to develop more innovative and effective ways to help their enrolled populations, including using community health workers.One argument for using such workers is that they are typically paid far less than registered nurses or social workers.

Many have already been interpreters, such as Khang, or former patients who draw on their own experience, Obermark said. The system subsidizes their education toward certification.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System launched its community health-worker program after researchers interviewed high-risk patients about their perceived barriers to healthcare and good health. Patients cited a lack of connection and trust with healthcare workers as critical, said Dr. Shreya Kangovi, who helped conduct the research. \u201cWe trained community health workers to do the things that high-risk patients said would help,\u201d said Kangovi, executive director of the Penn Center for Community Health Workers, which provides tools and training for organizations seeking to employ community health workers. The university currently is expanding its model to total 24 community health workers for 1,500 Penn Medicine patients.\n\n\n\nAt Kangovi's center, community health workers meet with hospitalized patients to set health goals before discharge, support them for a month with home visits, and accompany them to medical appointments and community events. Kangovi and her team found that patients who were paired with community health workers were more likely to quickly seek primary care after leaving the hospital. They also reported better mental health than patients without that support and were less likely to return to the hospital more than once within 30 days after discharge.\n\n\n\nBut she acknowledged that evidence is limited so far on how much community health workers can help with chronic-disease management and hospital visit prevention. Last year, her team reported in an article in JAMA Internal Medicine that it found no difference between patient groups that received community health-worker support and groups that did not receive such support, relative to overall medication adherence and the likelihood of a readmission within 30 days of initial discharge.\n\n\n\nReimbursement is a barrier to the expanded use of community health workers. Insurance often does not cover their services under the prevalent fee-for-service model. Medicaid programs in only seven states cover services provided by community health workers, according to a 2012 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nAnother challenge is pressure from other professional disciplines, such as nursing and social work, to define and limit lay community health workers' scope of practice. \u201cIt's important to understand the professional boundaries,\u201d said Anne Ganey, director of the community health worker program at South Central College in North Mankato, Minn. \u201cBecause it's a new role and it's different, nurses and social workers question how it's different from their role.\u201d Ganey helped develop a scope of practice, curriculum and certification for Minnesota community health workers under a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded initiative.\n\n\n\nSo far, 700 community health workers in the state have been trained and earned certification.\n\n\n\nCommunity health workers also need to learn how to set personal boundaries on their time with patients and recognize when they need professional support. \u201cThat's important to prevent burnout,\u201d Ganey said. \u201cIt's also important to know where their authority ends and when they need to refer to someone else.\u201d\n\nFollow Melanie Evans on Twitter: @MHmevans\n\nRelated content", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Facing greater financial incentives to keep patients healthy and out of the hospital, some health systems and health plans have hired community health workers to improve care delivery and address the multiple social factors that can affect health.", "title": "Community health workers help grow provider-patient ties", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Facing greater financial incentives to keep patients healthy and out of the hospital, some health systems and health plans have hired community health workers to improve care delivery and address the multiple social factors that can affect health.", "title": "Grass-roots network: Community health workers help grow stronger provider-patient ties", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150207/MAGAZINE/302079983", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150207/MAGAZINE/302079983/H2/0/Community-Health-Chart-EXPAND.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Facing greater financial incentives to keep patients healthy and out of the hospital, some health systems and health plans have hired community health workers to improve care delivery and address the multiple social factors that can affect health.", "title": "Grass-roots network: Community health workers help grow stronger provider-patient ties", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150207/MAGAZINE/302079983/H2/0/Community-Health-Chart-EXPAND.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150207/MAGAZINE/302079983", "published_at": "2015-02-07", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150207/MAGAZINE/302079983/H2/0/Community-Health-Chart-EXPAND.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c99\"", "article_summary": "About 48,000 community health workers are working inSome of these workers have earned certification, while others have received workplace training.\nAbout 48,000 community health workers are working in public health and health systems.Some of these workers have earned certification, while others have received workplace training.\nSome states, including Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and Texas, have sought to define a scope of practice for community health workers.\nSo far, 700 community health workers in the state have been trained and earned certification.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics first recognized the occupation in 2010 and projects a 21% employment growth for community health workers and health educators through 2022."}
