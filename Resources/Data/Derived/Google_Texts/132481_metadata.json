Scott missed all seven of his field goals that night and finished with just two points.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to win against CSU,\u201d said Scott, who has 27 double-doubles in his career. \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t have a very good taste in our mouth when they beat us at our house and this year we come out with a win. I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nWesley Gordon scored a season-high 15 points with 12 rebounds and three blocks for Colorado, which outscored the Rams 49-25 after intermission to win its seventh in a row.\n\n\u201cWhen two bigs have double-doubles, with the perimeter firepower we have on this team, that\u2019s what makes this team special,\u201d Colorado coach Tad Boyle said.\n\nColorado (7-1) trailed by 13 at halftime but used a 15-1 run at the start of the second to take a 54-53 lead. The Buffaloes extended it to six but a pair of 3s by Antwan Scott got the Rams within 64-62.\n\nThe game was tied at 68 when Josh Scott hit a layup and Gordon two free throws to put Colorado ahead 72-68. After two free throws by the Rams, Scott hit another jumper and Josh Fortune converted a 3-point play to make it 77-70 with 3:45 left.\n\nScott hit another shot in the lane, Gordon sank two free throws and Dominique Collier\u2019s layup with 1:44 left made it 83-72.\n\nGian Clavell led Colorado State with 18 points and John Gillon had 16 points, all in the first half. The Rams (5-3) have lost three straight.\n\n\u201cThis is the most frustrating game I\u2019ve coached,\u201d Colorado State\u2019s Larry Eustachy said. \u201cYou saw the team we are in the first half and just the opposite in the second half.\u201d\n\nColorado went on a first-half scoring drought of 4 minutes, 14 seconds and saw a 12-5 lead turn into a 25-18 deficit. The Buffaloes missed 11 straight field goals over a span of 9:06 while Colorado State found its rhythm. The Rams were 7 of 10 from 3-point range in the first half and hit 59.4 percent from the field to take a 52-39 lead at halftime.\n\nTIP INS\n\nColorado: Fortune finished with 16 points and six assists. \u2026 The Buffaloes are now 89-37 all-time against the Rams. \u2026 Collier led the team with seven assists.\n\nColorado State: The 52 points in the first half were a season high for the Rams. \u2026 Eustachy is now 7-8 overall against Colorado and 1-3 since arriving at Colorado State in 2012.\n\nX FACTOR\n\nGordon hit two 3-pointers at the start of the second half to pull the Buffaloes within three. They were his first two of the season and the only one in the second half for Colorado.\n\n\u201cI felt comfortable after that (first) jumper,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nGordon, who is averaging 10.4 rebounds in the last five games, has given Colorado another presence on the block.\n\n\u201cHe has the ability to make us go from a good team to a great team,\u201d Josh Scott said. \u201cWes is super talented and it\u2019s what he\u2019s capable of. You\u2019ll probably see some big games from him this year.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nColorado hosts BYU on Saturday.\n\nColorado State hosts Arkansas-Fort Smith on Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado rallies past Colorado State, 88-77, in Fort Collins", "title": "Colorado rallies past Colorado State, 88-77, in Fort Collins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/06/colorado-rallies-past-colorado-state-88-77-in-fort-collins/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206_034518_josh-scott.jpg", "height": 559}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206_034518_josh-scott.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T15:46:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:47:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Scott had 21 points and 11 rebounds and Colorado rallied past Colorado State 88-77 on Sunday.\n\u2026 Eustachy is now 7-8 overall against Colorado and 1-3 since arriving at Colorado State in 2012.\n\u201cHe has the ability to make us go from a good team to a great team,\u201d Josh Scott said.\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 Josh Scott made sure his last game against his in-state rival was a winning one.\nThe Buffaloes missed 11 straight field goals over a span of 9:06 while Colorado State found its rhythm."}
