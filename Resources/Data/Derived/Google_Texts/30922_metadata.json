In a 1999 study, researchers found that infants who were breastfed for over six months had a lower risk of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to those who weren\u2019t breastfed. Another study, published in 2012, came to another interesting finding: The longer babies are fed infant formula, the higher their risk for ALL.\n\nBreastfeeding has also been linked to various other health impacts \u2014 from protecting the baby against chronic disorders later in life, to improving their cognitive ability and even IQ. It\u2019s also important for proper digestive development (balancing out the baby\u2019s gut bacteria). Breastfeeding also has beneficial aspects for the mother herself, by lowering her risk of recurring breast cancer, keeping her connected with her baby, and possibly even preventing her from relapsing back into smoking after she quits.\n\nIn the most recent research, the authors reviewed 18 studies that had previously examined the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia. They found that breastfeeding for six months or more had a 19 percent lower risk compared to babies who breastfed for a shorter amount of time, or didn\u2019t breastfeed at all. While scientists aren\u2019t entirely sure what explains this association, they posit that breast milk may contain certain anti-inflammatory components that help boost an infant\u2019s immune system, and thus reduce their risk of cancer.\n\nThe authors argue that breastfeeding should be considered a public health initiative, as it\u2019s an easy way to ensure safety and health among most infants and mothers.\n\n\u201cBecause the primary goal of public health is prevention of morbidity, health care professionals should be taught the potential health benefits of breastfeeding and given tools to assist mothers with breastfeeding, whether themselves or with referrals to others who can help,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThey continue, \u201cThe many potential preventive health benefits of breastfeeding should also be communicated openly to the general public, not only to mothers, so breastfeeding can be more socially accepted and facilitated. In addition, more high-quality studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this association between breastfeeding and lower childhood leukemia morbidity.\u201d\n\nSource: Amitay E, Keinan-Boker L.
