State employees could lose an option to their health insurance and see costs rise under changes to be considered by the North Carolina State Health Plan board of trustees.

Executives who run the health plan have recommended to the trustees that they consider eliminating coverage for spouses, meaning they would likely have to seek coverage through the Affordable Care Act.

The changes would also include the elimination of what's known as the 80/20 plan.

The board is scheduled to vote on Friday. Although the proposed changes wouldn't take effect next year, board members could vote to have their staff work on putting those changes in place by 2018.

Chuck Stone, director of operations for the State Employees Association of North Carolina, said the changes would make the state's health plan the worst in the nation.
