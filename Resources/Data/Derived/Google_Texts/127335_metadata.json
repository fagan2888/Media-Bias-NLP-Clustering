The bill was one of two passed Thursday that lawmakers and health care advocates hope encourage Navajos to give up junk food in favor of fresh, healthy food.\n\nThe Healthy Din\u00e9 Nation Act increases the sales tax to 7 percent on sweetened beverages and snacks low in essential nutrients and high in salt, fat and sugar. This includes chips, candy, cookies and pastries. The bill also states that the revenue collected from the tax hike will be deposited into a special fund to develop wellness centers, parks, basketball courts, trails, swimming pools, picnic grounds and health education classes.\n\nBill sponsor Danny Simpson, who represents eight chapters in the Eastern Navajo Agency, said the tax increase will help promote healthy living and bring awareness to the diabetes epidemic on the reservation.\n\n\u201cEach one of us here has a relative that\u2019s diabetic, and we face that fact every single day,\u201d he told council members prior to the vote.\n\nAn estimated 10 percent of the Navajo population has diabetes, said David Foley, an epidemiologist for the Navajo Nation Division of Health. In numbers, that\u2019s about 24,600 people. Another 75,000 people are pre-diabetic.\n\nThe junk food tax is unprecedented, not just in Indian Country but in the nation as a whole, said Crystal Echo Hawk, executive director of the Notah Begay III Foundation, a non-profit organization that combats obesity and diabetes among Natives.\n\n\u201cThis is the only one in the country, so the national significance of this cannot be underplayed,\u201d she said. \u201cBigger cities have been trying to get something like this passed for years, and the Navajo Nation is the first to get it done.\u201d\n\nPassage of the Healthy Din\u00e9 Nation Act began two years ago as a grassroots effort from members of the Din\u00e9 Community Advocacy Alliance who studied rates of obesity and diabetes on the reservation and decided existing prevention programs weren\u2019t doing enough.\n\n\u201cEven though there was a lot of education, people seemed to not be listening,\u201d said Gloria Ann Begay, project manager for the Din\u00e9 Community Advocacy Alliance. \u201cSo we looked at policies like the tobacco tax or the seat belt laws and we decided that taxing junk food might discourage the purchase of it.\u201d\n\nBegay estimates that between 55 and 85 percent of all food available in grocery or convenience stores on the reservation can be considered junk food. Store owners argue they are simply selling what the people want to buy, she said.\n\n\u201cStore owners claim it\u2019s supply and demand,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just giving us what we want.\u201d\n\nThe tax does nothing to curb the purchase of junk food in border towns, where many residents already shop, Begay said. Some people drive as far as 200 miles round-trip to get to a grocery store in towns like Farmington or Gallup, N.M., or Flagstaff, Ariz.\n\nCalling the tax a \u201cfirst step,\u201d Begay said she hopes it acts as a deterrent in check-out lines. Proponents of the tax also hope it persuades store owners to carry more healthy food so low-income residents who can\u2019t afford to drive to border towns aren\u2019t forced to shoulder the extra financial burden.\n\nThe 2-percent increase in sales tax for junk food expires at the end of 2018 unless the Navajo Nation Council votes to extend it.\n\nThe council also approved a second bill Thursday to eliminate the existing 5-percent sales tax on fresh fruits and vegetables, water, nuts, seeds and nut butters sold on the reservation. The purpose, according to the bill, is to \u201cdiminish the human and economic costs of obesity and diabetes on the Navajo Nation.\u201d\n\nThe vote on this bill was 17 to 1. Navajo President Ben Shelly has 10 days to sign the bills into law.\n\nBoth bills cite staggering statistics on the cost of living with diabetes \u2013 it can cost one person an estimated $13,000 per year to treat the disease and $100,000 or more per year to treat complications related to diabetes.\n\nThe Indian Health Service reports that American Indians and Alaska Natives experience diabetes at 2.3 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. Obesity also can lead to increased risks of heart disease, hypertension, arthritis, respiratory or reproductive problems, sleep apnea and some types of cancer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Navajo Nation Council on Thursday approved a 2-percent increase in sales tax for junk food sold on the 27,000-square-mile reservation, becoming the first tribe in the countr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/01/navajo-nation-council-approves-junk-food-tax-fight-obesity-153376", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/chips.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Navajo Nation Council Approves Junk Food Tax to Fight Obesity"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-01T12:22-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/01/navajo-nation-council-approves-junk-food-tax-fight-obesity-153376", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Nation Council Approves Junk Food Tax to Fight Obesity"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Navajo Nation Council Approves Junk Food Tax to Fight Obesity"}, "article_summary": "The 2-percent increase in sales tax for junk food expires at the end of 2018 unless the Navajo Nation Council votes to extend it.\nAn estimated 10 percent of the Navajo population has diabetes, said David Foley, an epidemiologist for the Navajo Nation Division of Health.\nThe bill was one of two passed Thursday that lawmakers and health care advocates hope encourage Navajos to give up junk food in favor of fresh, healthy food.\nThe Healthy Din\u00e9 Nation Act increases the sales tax to 7 percent on sweetened beverages and snacks low in essential nutrients and high in salt, fat and sugar.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just giving us what we want.\u201dThe tax does nothing to curb the purchase of junk food in border towns, where many residents already shop, Begay said."}
