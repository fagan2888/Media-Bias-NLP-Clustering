Our Lady Regional does not charge for any additional care within 30 days of a hip or knee replacement, covering readmissions, infections, rehab and postoperative care \u2014 everything except deficiencies in the joint devices.\n\nThe aim is to eliminate the need for or to simply not charge post-surgical follow-up care, said Scott Wester, CEO of the 800-bed teaching hospital, the flagship facility in the Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System. \u201cWe believe enough in our clinical care and our surgeons to offer something like this,\u201d he said.\n\nAs part of the program, hip and knee replacement patients are asked to be active participants in care and recovery, and agree to attend pre-operative classes and evaluations. Neither they nor their insurer are asked to pay anything extra, even though certain incidents like surgical site infections could be billed, Wester said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for any more reimbursement from any payer; it\u2019s the default.\u201d\n\n[Also: Medicare penalizes 721 hospitals over medical errors [full list]]\n\nThe Our Lady health system includes the regional hospital, a children\u2019s hospital, a 350-physician primary care network, an urgent care clinic network, outpatient imaging and surgery centers, plus a healthcare college. Like others around the country, Our Lady is trying to find its place in new era of health reform. This especially difficult in Louisiana, a state that is so far not expanding Medicaid eligibility and where residents are among the most likely in the nation to suffer from obesity and diabetes, use tobacco and live without health insurance until they turn 65.\n\nThe value guarantee, though, is a way to align the hospital with patients\u2019 best interests and to \u201creduce variations of care and variation of outliers,\u201d said Wester, who\u2019s spent his whole career at Our Lady. It creates an incentive for the hospital to offer hip and knee replacements to the most appropriate patients, those who can most benefit in the long-term and who are healthy enough to make it through surgery, which bring increased complication risk in patients with multiple chronic conditions.\n\nThe total joint replacement guarantee started in January, building off a Medicare pilot Our Lady began last year, and it could be the starting point for more value-based programs, Wester said.\n\nOur Lady Regional is participating in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 bundled payment program, for both total joint replacement and coronary bypass surgery. Our Lady\u2019s program is the only bundled payment pilot with both upside and downside potential \u2014 that is a risk of losing money along with a possibility quality-based incentive payments, something the system\u2019s physicians embraced.\n\n[Also: These 779 hospitals actually scored Medicare bonuses]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that they could potentially lose money.\u201d\n\nAs that was getting underway last year, Wester thought about applying that beyond Medicare, to commercially insured patients. \u201cI asked our team, \u2018What would happen if we would just guarantee all of those that are involved in our total joint for the hospital to assume risk post-discharge?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is no data yet available on Our Lady\u2019s bundled payment demonstration or the total joint replacement value guarantee, although Wester said that in 2013, the hospital met or exceeded quality benchmarks for total joint replacement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing when you see clinicians say, \u2018Let\u2019s standardize care. Maybe we don\u2019t need to do as much rehab. Lets standardize the devices we put in, instead of 10 vendors lets use four,\u2019\u201d Wester said. \u201cThey sit around and talk and come up with evidence-based practices or agree to their own convictions.\u201d\n\nSome insurers were a little skeptical in the beginning, wondering if there was a catch, Wester said.\n\n\u201cHealth plans have a hard time doing bundle payments; their systems aren\u2019t set up for it.\u201d\n\n[Also: These states had the most Obamacare grants]\n\nSabrina Heltz, the senior vice president for quality at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, said the insurer is studying the impact of Our Lady\u2019s value guarantee closely, and not yet decided on going to a bundled payment. But she believes the hospital\u2019s move is admirable and indicative of the increasing scrutiny patients themselves are applying.\n\n\u201cAs a consumer, you expect good outcomes from your provider, you expect no complication rates,\u201d Helz said.\n\nFor Our Lady of the Lake, the value guarantee looks promising enough that Wester said the system\u2019s leaders are considering expanding into other clinical areas. \u201cI would like to start another one before the end of the year and another one in 2016 and 2017,\u201d Wester said.\n\nOur Lady of the Lake is also in the midst of an expansion to compete with Louisiana's largest hospital network, Ochsner Health System, Our Lady is undergoing a $23 million renovation of a multidisciplinary oncology center, building a new $180 million Heart and Vascular Institute and plans to build a new children\u2019s hospital.\n\nWester said the system is also trying to embark on a business and cultural shift, embracing the move away fee-for-service along with a high-interest in quality and choices.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty progressive,\u201d Wester said of Our Lady\u2019s programs. \u201cWe\u2019re not a Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic, but for Louisiana, we want to be the destination for care.\u201d\n\nThe Our Lady health system is also growing its Health Lives wellness program for employers, offering analytics, health risk assessments health coaching, and trying to work around the constraints of the lack of Medicaid eligibility expansion to offer better healthcare options to the uninsured.\n\nIn 2013, following the closure of Baton Rouge\u2019s Earl K Long charity care hospital, Our Lady and a number of other providers partnered with the state to receive charity care funding and serve the uninsured through a network of ambulatory care clinics offering urgent care and chronic disease management\n\n\u201cOur goal is to protect the integrity of our community for all of our citizens,\u201d Wester said.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/our-lady-lake-sets-value-guarantees-stops-charging-some-post-op-care", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/our%20lady%20of%20the%20lake%20hospital-facebook-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Hospital does not charge for any additional care within 30 days of a hip or knee replacement, covering readmissions, infections, rehab and postoperative care \u2014 everything except deficiencies in the joint devices.", "title": "Our Lady of the Lake sets up 'value guarantees,' stops charging for some post-op care"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/our%20lady%20of%20the%20lake%20hospital-facebook-feature.png"}, "title": "Our Lady of the Lake sets up 'value guarantees,' stops charging for some post-op care", "description": "Hospital does not charge for any additional care within 30 days of a hip or knee replacement, covering readmissions, infections, rehab and postoperative care \u2014 everything except deficiencies in the joint devices.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Amid reimbursement upheaval, a sick and uninsured population, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana\u00a0 is pushing ahead with a number of ambitious plans to align its payment structure more with value than traditional fee-for-service.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d37\"", "article_summary": "For Our Lady of the Lake, the value guarantee looks promising enough that Wester said the system\u2019s leaders are considering expanding into other clinical areas.\nOur Lady Regional is participating in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 bundled payment program, for both total joint replacement and coronary bypass surgery.\nLike others around the country, Our Lady is trying to find its place in new era of health reform.\nThe facility recently became the state\u2019s first hospital to offer a guarantee to patients receiving hip and knee replacements and their insurers.\n\u201cWe believe enough in our clinical care and our surgeons to offer something like this,\u201d he said."}
