Channel 4's Rob Sweeting was there to kick off the walk.\n\nAccording the the American Heart Association, heart attacks are the No. 1 killer of Americans. So far the event has raised more than $1.1 million to fight heart disease.\n\nTy'Meisha Sloan was the face of this year's heart walk. She was born with a congenital heart defect and had a pacemaker installed with in days of her birth.\n\nHer father says she's 10 years old now and that she's doing well.\n\n\"I'm going to walk the whole thing and I'm going to have fun with all of my friends and all of my teachers and family out here,\" said Sloan.\n\nThe walk's goal is to teach people how to live a better lifestyle, to raise money for research to find a cure, and to understand the impacts of heart disease. Money raised from the walk stays in the River City.\n\nTo be heart healthy doctors say it's important to watch our cholesterol and blood pressure and to walk and make simple changes to our diet.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars helped raise money for the cause, agreeing to match every dollar their fans donated up to $75,000.\n\n\"Prevention is key and we can provide the resources and our brand that's so strong in the market to help people with education and prevention,\" said Chad Johnson with the Jaguars.\n\nDarnell Smith will be the chair of next year's walk.\n\n\"We think it's important to get involved because it's something that impacts all of us. If it hasn't impacted you yet, it's only a matter of time,\" said Smith.\n\nNews4Jax is a proud sponsor of the Heart Walk.\n\nIf you'd like to donate to the First Coast Heart Walk visit Firstcoastheartwalk.kintera.org\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.
