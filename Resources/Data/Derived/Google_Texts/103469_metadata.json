Broken body parts. Broken souls. Rape. Fear. Missing. Murdered. All these words and more describe the violence many Native American and First Nations women experience every day, usually at the hands of someone they know. Nearly 40 percent are intimate partners, many of whom are non-Natives.\n\nHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nHighly touted (and debated) laws and policies, such as the Violence Against Women Act, currently do little to combat the staggering rates of violence against Indigenous women, although many promise change is coming.\n\nU.S. statistics show Native Americans experience violent crimes \u2013 including stalking, rape, and sexual assault \u2013 at rates more than double those of women of other races. One in three Native women report having been raped during her lifetime. The murder rate for Native women is 10 times the national average. Many experts agree these numbers are woefully underreported for several reasons, including distrust of a justice system that so often fails Native American people.\n\nThe situation isn\u2019t any better for Canada\u2019s Aboriginal women, who are three-to-five times more likely to experience violence than non-Aboriginal women ages 15 or older. According to Statistics Canada, in about half of all homicides the Aboriginal identity of the victim is reported by police as unknown. For instance, between 2005 and 2009, police reported 726 homicides where the victim was a woman aged 15 or older. Of these, the victim was identified as Aboriginal in 54 homicides, as non-Aboriginal in 292 homicides, and as Aboriginal identity unknown in 380 homicides.\n\nTherein lies what many see as an overarching issue to getting justice for Indigenous women who experience violence: It\u2019s not enough that many lose their life to violence; their tribal identities are stripped from them, too.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting, then, that the movement doing the greatest work to identify, acknowledge and honor victims, survivors, and their families is one founded by First Nations women. Celebrating 23 years of advocacy, the February 14 Women\u2019s Memorial March began after the grisly murder of a Coast Salish woman in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside.\n\n\u201c\u2026Her body parts were strewn about in various places,\u201d said Marlene George, chair of the memorial march committee and citizen of the Tsimshian Nation. \u201cHer family from the Coast Salish community of Sechelt came with a seer, or visionary, who was used to find her remains; it was a very powerful ceremony where prayers were offered at each site her remains were found.\u201d\n\nFed up with the violence and lack of justice, Aboriginal women organized the first march to raise awareness on Valentine\u2019s Day, just a few weeks after the Coast Salish woman\u2014whose name the family asks not to be spoken or published for spiritual purposes\u2014was discovered.\n\n\u201cThey chose February 14 as the date because it is recognized internationally as the day when loving, kindness and caring is shown to one another,\u201d George explained. \u201cThat first march was attended by about 28 community women, who carried placards of women's names who were murdered. They carried photographs and the march was led by an elder woman who performed ceremony at the hotels and alleyways where women's bodies were found.\u201d\n\nThousands now march in Vancouver after an elder performs a respectful ceremony and prayer songs go up in Downtown Eastside, George said. Ribbons of lavender and yellow, traditional colors of healing and hope, are worn by marchers; medicines \u2013 including tobacco \u2013 and single roses are left throughout the march route at sites where women were last seen or murdered.\n\nThe movement and its message have spread. Now dozens of communities across Canada and the United States hold solidarity marches to honor missing and murdered Indigenous women, and to organize around community accountability, restoring sovereignty, and move away from oppressive legal systems.\n\nThe memorial marches call to the hearts of Indigenous feminists and allies like me for several reasons, but primarily because it is dedicated to ending the erasure of Indigenous women and the issues we face.\n\nLauren Chief Elk, a member of the Nakota and Blackfeet nations who lives in Montana, is a personal hero of mine for several reasons, but this time of year because of her vocal and active role in calling out non-Indigenous groups that steal the spotlight from the memorial marches and solidarity events.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is about launching a war against figureheads like Eve Ensler, who is bulldozing Indigenous people all over the world,\u201d said Chief Elk, co-founder of the Save W\u012fy\u0105bi Project, which is promoting a memorial march solidarity event in Billings, Mont., to honor women like Hanna Harris, a Northern Cheyenne woman found murdered last summer near her home in Lame Deer, Mont. Federal authorities still have not solved the case.\n\n\u201cI believe in grassroots work, especially work by other Indigenous women that fights against settler colonialism and helps heal us within our own communities,\u201d Chief Elk said.\n\nSo do I.\n\nI don\u2019t know Eve Ensler personally, and while I\u2019m sure she has good intentions like most who fall into the White Savior Industrial Complex, her One Billion Rising and V-Day anti-violence campaigns - which both fall on Feb. 14 and have global audiences - completely overpower and erase the work being done by the memorial marches for Indigenous women.\n\nSupporters of Ensler and her movement will say there is enough room on Valentine\u2019s Day to share the spotlight. Normally I\u2019d agree, but once you figure in the sheer volume of marketing and PR that goes into Ensler\u2019s campaigns, there is no spotlight left for a group that was operating well before One Billion Rising or V-Day.\n\nMany indigenous activists, including Chief Elk, called Ensler out in open letters and voiced concerns on social media, demanding Ensler end her piggy-backing on the memorial marches as a sign of respect and solidarity. Something must have clicked, at least partially, because a small paragraph buried on the One Billion Rising\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page appeals to its Canadian activists, asking them to postpone their dances until March 8, International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nBut what about solidarity memorial marches and events for non-Canadians like Hanna Harris? Surely she deserves remembrance on a global scale.\n\nTo this end, Chief Elk\u2019s Save W\u012fy\u0105bi Project created a database to illustrate the importance of giving the spotlight fully to murdered or missing Indigenous women. In addition, other Indigenous feminists and allies will be picketing Ensler\u2019s campaigns, including productions of her play, \u201cThe Vagina Monologues,\u201d and handing out packets of information on the First Nations memorial marches, solidarity events, and other organizations led by Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cI think the importance of doing our work on Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014fighting for that day to belong to Indigenous women \u2013 is because our lives and the lives of those murdered and missing women matter,\u201d Chief Elk said. \u201cVery specific violence happens to us; this is not all women experiencing what we experience. Violence against Indigenous women is settler colonialism at work, because you destroy tribes by destroying Indigenous women.\u201d\n\nTat\u00e9 Walker, Mniconjou Lakota, is a freelance writer and blogger.
