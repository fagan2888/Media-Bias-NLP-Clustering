Sarah Palin condemned President Obama\u2019s decision to get further involved with the ongoing civil war in Syria.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re bombing Syria because Syria is bombing Syria? And I\u2019m the idiot?\u201d Mrs. Palin asked on Friday. \u201cPresident Obama wants America involved in Syria\u2019s civil war pitting the antagonistic Assad regime against equally antagonistic Al Qaeda affiliated rebels. But he\u2019s not quite sure which side is doing what, what the ultimate end game is, or even whose side we should be on.\u201d\n\nMrs. Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, argued that though Americans sympathize with the plight of innocent civilians in the war-torn country, the United States has \u201cno clear mission in Syria,\u201d and the president\u2019s advertised war plan \u201chas given Assad enough of a heads-up that he\u2019s reportedly already placing human shields at targeted sites.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Syrian state media call Obama\u2019s move a \u2018retreat\u2019\n\n\u201cOur Nobel Peace Prize winning President needs to seek Congressional approval before taking us to war,\u201d she added.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Obama sent a letter to congressional leaders and draft legislation on the Authorization for the Use of U.S. Armed Forces (AUMF) in connection to the Syrian conflict. The draft resolution authorizes the president to use the U.S. military \u201cas he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria[.]\u201d\n\nHouse Republican leaders said they\u2019ll wait until the end of their summer vacation, which ends a week from today, before returning to Washington to vote on authorizing a strike on President Bashar Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nThe GOP leadership said the coming days will give Mr. Obama some time to make a more convincing case than he has laid out so far.\n\n\u201cAs I said before,\u201d Mrs. Palin concluded Friday, \u201cif we are dangerously uncertain of the outcome and are led into war by a Commander-in-chief who can\u2019t recognize that this conflict is pitting Islamic extremists against an authoritarian regime with both sides shouting \u2018Allah Akbar\u2019 at each other, then let Allah sort it out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a Facebook post titled \"Let Allah Sort It Out,\" former Alaska Gov.
