It\u2019s so close to where we live and it\u2019s so nice and quiet and peaceful,\u201d said Oberst.\n\nMany use Gayle\u2019s Trails, which is more than 30 miles long.\n\nThe city is expanding the trails to the Hathaway Bridge, down to St. Andrews State Park and out to camp Helen.\n\nBut it all takes time and money.\n\n\"We are paving it and doing it as we can. Most of it has been paid with grants and it's a long-range project. we have about 9 miles of it paved,\u201d said Oberst.\n\nDale Colby is working to restore the inside of the park.\n\n\"Many different animals and plants species can survive in the long leaf ecosystem, that's why we're trying to bring them back, said Dale Colby, Parks Resource Officer.\n\nThe restoration includes controlled burns, to allow the natural growth to flourish.\n\n\"So many of the pines were planted were for timber, paper later on, what we'll do is put the native pine back in there. We\u2019re also preserving all the swamps,\u201d said Oberst.\n\nMany groups are coming out and helping plant.\n\n\"We will be working on it for the next 20 years,\u201d said Oberst.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Panama city beach officials are in the process of restoring the conservation park.", "language": "english", "author": "Tiffany Huertas", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Panama-City-Beach-Conservation-Park-Restoration--248087211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/199018434B8D4B2E968C82558685D81A1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Panama city beach officials are in the process of restoring the conservation park.", "title": "Panama City Beach Conservation Park Restoration"}, "twitter": {"description": "Panama city beach officials are in the process of restoring the conservation park.", "title": "Panama City Beach Conservation Park Restoration", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Panama-City-Beach-Conservation-Park-Restoration--248087211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/199018434B8D4B2E968C82558685D81A1.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Panama City Beach Conservation Park Restoration", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Panama City Beach Conservation Park"}, "article_summary": "Panama City Beach officials are committed to restoring the Conservation Park to the same state it was in, long before this area was settled.\nThe city is expanding the trails to the Hathaway Bridge, down to St. Andrews State Park and out to camp Helen.\n\u201cWe have a management agreement with the state of Florida and D-E-P and in that management agreement our efforts are to return that park to how it looked 100 years ago,\u201d said Gayle Oberst, Panama City Beach Mayor.\nThe park, located northwest of highway 79 and back beach road, is currently offers hiking, biking and much more.\nDale Colby is working to restore the inside of the park."}
