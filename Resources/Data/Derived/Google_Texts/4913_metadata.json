That is not partisanship talking, that is history and science. And when Obama says, as he did Tuesday in Chicago, I\u2019m not going to \u201ctake everyone\u2019s guns away,\u201d that means he\u2019s coming for them.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDid I mention Barack Obama is a liar? Not only is Obama a liar, this \u201cnot gunna-gunna\u201d ploy is a tactic the President has effectively used many times before. It\u2019s a two-pronged assault that requires the cooperation of his DC Media allies.\n\nBy lying and saying he\u2019s \u201cnot gunna,\u201d Obama lulls his opponents into a false sense of security. By lying and saying he\u2019s \u201cnot gunna,\u201d it allows Obama\u2019s DC Media allies to attack as liars and extremists those who say Obama will take their guns.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the science, shall we?\n\nI\u2019m Not Gunna Force People To Buy Health Insurance\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cnot gunna\u201d lies started during the 2008 presidential campaign when he said he was \u201cnot gunna\u201d force people to buy health insurance. Here\u2019s video of a 2008 debate between Obama and Hillary Clinton where he criticizes, not just the mandate in her health care plan that forces people to purchase health insurance, but the fact that they are fined and therefore \u201cworse off\u201d if they don\u2019t purchase insurance.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to put on adults a situation where we are mandating them to purchase insurance and if the subsidies are inadequate the burden is on them and they will be penalized, and this is exactly what Senator Clinton\u2019s plan does \u2026 If healthcare is affordable you don\u2019t need a mandate.\n\nExcept, from the mandate to the penalty, this is exactly what ObamaCare does.\n\nI\u2019m Not Gunna Take Away Your Health Insurance or Your Doctor\n\nWhile he was trying to shove ObamaCare into law in 2009 and win re-election in 2012, dozens of times Obama said, I\u2019m \u201cnot gunna\u201d take away your health insurance and I\u2019m \u201cnot gunna\u201d take away your doctor.\n\nObama was lying.\n\nObama knew he was lying.\n\nThe DC Media knew he was lying.\n\nAnd those of us who called out his lie were accused of racism by Obama and the DC Media.\n\nBy the time the fallout hit, millions and millions of people lost their insurance, and with it, their doctors.\n\nThe lie, and the DC Media\u2019s willing complicity in covering up the lie, was necessary to get the monstrosity passed. Had the president told the truth, or the DC Media exposed what they knew was the truth, ObamaCare never would have passed.\n\nI\u2019m Not Gunna Sign Executive Orders Changing Immigration Law\n\nMore than 20 times President Obama reassured Americans he would not override Congress as a means to change or ignore immigration laws. Again and again, Obama told us he would not and could not unilaterally ignore or rewrite these laws.\n\nHe lied.\n\nI\u2019m Not Gunna Take Away Your Guns\n\n\u201cI believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in the people\u2019s lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I won\u2019t take your handgun away.\u201d \u2014 Then-Senator Obama, September 9, 2008.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nWhile running for president, Obama was desperate to wrist-flick away the gun issue knowing it could hurt him in the general election.\n\nIn 2008, Obama also voted in favor of an amendment that would prohibit the confiscation of guns, even during a national emergency.\n\nThis was all a lie.\n\nTwice this year, although the DC Media ignores this in order to protect him, Obama has said that he backs Australia\u2019s gun laws, the spine of which is outright confiscation. Democrats and the DC Media always lie about Australia\u2019s government-mandated confiscation by couching it as a buyback program \u2014 which it most certainly was not. Sure, the Australian government paid people for their guns but they were forced to turn them in. A buyback program is voluntary.\n\nIn June of 2014, Obama praised the Australia law:\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nIn June of 2015, Obama again praised the Australia law.\n\n\u2014\n\nIn summation, Obama said\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not gunna force you to buy health insurance. He did.\n\nI\u2019m not gunna penalize you for not buying health insurance. He did.\n\nI\u2019m not gunna take away your health insurance. He did.\n\nI\u2019m not gunna take away your doctor. He did.\n\nI\u2019m not gunna unilaterally rewrite immigration law. He did.\n\nI\u2019m not gunna unilaterally ignore immigration law. He did.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re supposed to trust him when he says he\u2019s not gunna take away our guns.\n\nP.S. The DC Media is also covering up Hillary\u2019s endorsement of Australia\u2019s gun laws.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Obama Says He Won't Take Your Guns, History Proves He's Lying", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "When Obama Says He Won't Take Your Guns, History Proves He's Lying", "title": "When Obama Says He Won't Take Your Guns, History Proves He's Lying - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Obbama-vetos-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-28T05:40:53-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/28/when-obama-says-he-wont-take-your-guns-history-proves-hes-lying/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Obama Says He Won't Take Your Guns, History Proves He's Lying", "title": "When Obama Says He Won't Take Your Guns, History Proves He's Lying - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Obbama-vetos-Getty.jpg", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, gun ban, Media Bias,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-28T05:23:31-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T05:40:53-07:00", "tag": "Media Bias", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "By lying and saying he\u2019s \u201cnot gunna,\u201d Obama lulls his opponents into a false sense of security.\nBy lying and saying he\u2019s \u201cnot gunna,\u201d it allows Obama\u2019s DC Media allies to attack as liars and extremists those who say Obama will take their guns.\nIt\u2019s a two-pronged assault that requires the cooperation of his DC Media allies.\n\u2014\u2014While running for president, Obama was desperate to wrist-flick away the gun issue knowing it could hurt him in the general election.\nAnd those of us who called out his lie were accused of racism by Obama and the DC Media."}
