Among lower-income Americans, 44% say paying for out-of-pocket health care costs is a very or somewhat significant source of stress, compared with 34% of those with higher incomes, according to the report.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the economic climate, money and finances have remained the top stressor since our survey began in 2007. Furthermore, this year\u2019s survey shows that stress related to financial issues could have a significant impact on Americans\u2019 health and well-being,\u201d Norman B. Anderson, the APA\u2019s CEO and executive vice president, said in a press release.\n\nThe survey also discovered that more than one in five Americans reported experiencing extreme stress about money.
