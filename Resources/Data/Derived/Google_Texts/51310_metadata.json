Luz Robles (left) and Rep. Chris Stewart (right) prepare to begin a 2nd congressional debate at SUU, Cedar City, Utah, Sept. 25, 2014 | Photo by Devan Chavez, St. George News\n\nCEDAR CITY \u2014 United States Congressman Chris Stewart, for Utah\u2019s 2nd congressional district, faced off against Utah state Sen. Luz Robles Thursday in a candidate debate for the office up for election Nov. 4, hosted by the Utah Debate Commission and the Michael O. Leavitt Center for Politics & Public Service at Southern Utah University in Cedar City.\n\nAround 200 students, supporters and community members packed into the Sterling R. Church Auditorium on the SUU campus for a debate \u2014 moderated by former KTVX anchor Barbara Smith \u2014 that included topics such as common core standards in education, public lands, gay marriage and the country\u2019s debt.\n\nIn his opening statement, Stewart, currently running as the Republican nominee, said his hope was that the debate would help answer some questions that are on the minds of many Americans. These included: Who is going to keep them safe? Who is going to create jobs? What does the future now hold with the Affordable Care Act in place.\n\n\u201cI believe in the American dream, I believe in the inherited goodness of the American people and I believe in the resilience of the American economy,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut we can only protect those things if we are willing to fight for those things.\u201d\n\nIn her opening statement, Robles, the Democratic nominee, said it is important to continue to push for change in what the United States Congress is doing, as well as to push for the working man\u2019s voice to be represented.\n\n\u201cI get to work every day at Zion\u2019s Bank, working with small business, helping them develop \u2026,\u201d Robles said. \u201cI get to be a mom, I get to be a wife and I get to serve in the state Senate. I know I can bring more to Congress.\u201d\n\nCommon Core Education\n\nThe first topic of debate was addressed to Robles, centering on her opinion of common core standards in education.\n\nIn her position as state Senator, Robles said, she has had much experience speaking on these standards and said they originally came about as a way to ensure students who move from one state to another were being placed into the correct educational programs.\n\nThese standards are being implemented across the state, she said, but always around the local school boards. The key is ensuring decisions regarding educational curriculum remain on a local level.\n\n\u201cI believe there is a role of the federal government, but it\u2019s limited when it comes to education \u2026,\u201d Robles said. \u201cBut when it comes to these standards, I don\u2019t see how they could hurt anybody.\u201d\n\nIn response, Stewart said the tradition of each area being in control of educating their own local children is the way it should be. Some of those decisions could and maybe should be made by the state, he said, but they should never be made by the federal government.\n\nWhile Stewart said he agreed with much of what Robles said regarding keeping these decisions local, he has heard a large amount of varying opinions from educators throughout the state regarding how these decisions should be made.\n\nRobles said it is important for Utahns to realize that their children are part of a competitive global market, and that ensuring American children are kept to a certain standard regarding education is important because it will help them compete with others in the world.\n\nManaging the wild horse population\n\nThe federal government manages these wild horses, Stewart said. There are supposed to be about 26,500 of these horses, but right now the number is closer to 55,000. Because there are so many, the horses are destroying the range and causing many of them to starve.\n\n\u201cIf you care about these animals then you have to recognize that this situation right now is intolerable,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management\u2019s proposal will take 12 years to implement, Stewart said, and meanwhile the horse population doubles every four-five years. The answer is to let the state manage this issue.\n\n\u201cWe know that the state can manage herds like this,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt managed our elk and it managed our deer. If you care about these animals like I do, then let us manage them.\u201d\n\nIn response to Stewart\u2019s remarks, Robles said she agreed with what Stewart had to say about Utah becoming involved in managing the horses. There has been conversation at the state Legislature, she said, about a possible partnership between the state and federal government to ensure the animals are taken care of.\n\n\u201cWe can take care of them,\u201d Robles said. \u201cThey are part of our backyard.\u201d\n\nWhat to do with Utah\u2019s national parks and public lands\n\nNo one is proposing that the state take over control of the national parks, Stewart said. If there was a push for that he would not support it. It is an issue however, he said, that so many bureaucrats who have never stepped foot inside the state are making decisions about lands in Utah.\n\nMany Utahns choose to live in the state because of the amazing mountains and deserts we have, Stewart said, and the people of Utah want to protect these lands.\n\n\u201cWe are smart enough to do that and the people of Utah care enough to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us manage these lands.\u201d\n\nRobles disagreed with Stewart, and said it has been a matter of discussion as to who these lands actually belong to. Robles said it is important that we protect our access to public lands that make Utah so attractive to tourism.\n\n\u201cOur number one revenue maker \u2026 is tourism, it\u2019s the outdoor industry and all the employment that it brings to the state of Utah,\u201d Robles said. \u201cWe\u2019d be very concerned if we privatized that or sold it to the state and don\u2019t have the resources to take care of (the land).\u201d\n\nOpinions on same-sex marriage\n\nThe issue itself is one of equality, Robles said. There is a history within this country of ensuring every human is seen and respected. In this case, she said, she thinks it will come down to a Supreme Court decision that hopefully makes a change to how the nation recognizes an individual\u2019s ability to be with the person they love without government interference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why people should limit what other people have just based on their sexual orientation,\u201d Robles said. \u201cAt the same time, we are in the middle of a process \u2026 but I will continue to support equality for all Utahns.\u201d\n\nStewart took a different angle of the situation than Robles and laid out his personal view on the issue of same-sex marriage. Stewart said he thinks all people should be treated with respect and courtesy, but he does not agree that the concept of marriage should deviate from how it has been viewed for thousands of years.\n\n\u201cI believe that marriage is between one man and one woman,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThat is my moral teaching and that is my faith teaching. I don\u2019t know how I could possibly turn my back on that.\u201d\n\nStewart said he thinks there is another element to the conversation: that is, giving states the right to decide how they define marriage. If other states would choose a different path than Utah, he would be okay with that; but as of now, Stewart said, the people of Utah have already spoken on this.\n\nIn her rebuttal, Robles said getting the federal government involved with issues involving equality is not a new idea, citing the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1968.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we are talking about human beings and children who belong to those families,\u201d Robles said, \u201cand I know many of them are hurting.\u201d\n\nProblems and plans to fix the immigration system\n\nWe are a nation of immigrants, Stewart said. We built the greatest nation in the world because of all the hard work of people who wanted to come here and wanted to be part of that. The difference between then and now, he said, is that it was done legally.\n\nIn order to fix problems within the current system and counter the issue of illegal immigration, Stewart said, the first step we must take is securing the border. After that, Stewart said, it would be great to begin working on making the citizenship and visa process more friendly and efficient.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can argue that (fixing the system) doesn\u2019t start with securing our borders,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cA nation has to be able to protect its sovereignty.\u201d\n\nIn response, Robles said that Congress\u2019 incompetence of not acting within the last 40 years is sad because the issue is a public policy issue. She said the \u201cBand-Aid solution\u201d of fixing little aspects of the system here and there is not working.\n\nCongress\u2019 failure to take action, Robles said, has caused some states to move forward with passing unconstitutional laws. This has caused multiple lawsuits to take place against these states as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not blaming one specific political party,\u201d Robles said. \u201cIt\u2019s just devastating and it\u2019s devastating for the states. We have to pay the bills on many of their lack of enforcement, lack of their work towards bringing real policy.\u201d\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nTo end the debate, both candidates thanked all in attendance for taking the time to come and get involved and learn about current issues.\n\nBoth Robles and Stewart said they were proud to serve in a diverse district of both urban and rural communities and hope a large number of people register to vote in the upcoming Nov. 4 elections. Both candidates also took time to thank one another.\n\nPublic service is hard, Robles said, and I appreciate and respect anyone who has their name on a ballot; putting their families and themselves out there.\n\n\u201cI think it is time we continue to seek the American dream,\u201d Robles said. \u201cI came here to this country looking for that dream and I know it\u2019s alive. I want to make sure my kids have the same opportunities I had 18 years ago when I came to America.\u201d\n\nStewart chose to close his portion with a quote.\n\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln said, \u2018We are the last best home on earth,\u2019\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThat was true when he said it, and it is still true today.\u201d\n\nThe next debate offered though the Utah Debate Commission will be between candidates for attorney general and will be held on Oct. 1 at Brigham Young University\n\nThose wishing to learn more about candidates running in their areas, viewing a sample ballet or registering to vote can visit the Vote Utah website.\n\nResources\n\nRelated Posts\n\nEmail: dchavez@stgnews.com\n\nTwitter: @STGnews\n\nCopyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2014, all rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/wp-content/themes/st_george_utah_2015/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "application-name": "stgnews", "og": {"site_name": "St George News", "description": "CEDAR CITY \u2014 United States Congressman Chris Stewart, for Utah\u2019s 2nd congressional district,\u00a0faced off against Utah state Sen.\u00a0Luz Robles Thursday in a candidate debate for the office up for election Nov. 4, hosted by the Utah Debate Commission and the Michael O.
