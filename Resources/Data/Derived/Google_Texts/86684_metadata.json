(Politifact has deemed this assertion to be true.) Sanders also said the wages Walmart offers are so meager that employees need to rely on taxpayer-funded social programs such as Medicaid and subsidized housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA rigged economy,\u201d Sanders declared, \u201cis when the middle class pays to subsidize the wealthiest family in this country.\u201d\n\nThe power of Sanders\u2019 presidential bid lies in the stark diagnosis he offers of America\u2019s economic condition. We\u2019re in trouble, he\u2019s saying, because of the staggering level of income and wealth inequality in the country. But even if you agree with him about the seriousness of the problem \u2014 I do \u2014 it doesn\u2019t follow that the heartless plutocrats he singles out are the only ones responsible for it.\n\nWalmart, of course, has made a decision to distribute money in a certain way. If it wanted to do so, the company could presumably steer more of its revenue toward its workers and less toward the Walton family and other shareholders.\n\nBut shareholders\u2019 demands aren\u2019t the only reason Walmart behaves as it does. The company\u2019s business model involves relentless downward pressure on costs \u2014 by limiting wage growth and fighting worker unionization, yes, but also by cutting tough deals with suppliers, and developing hyper-efficient inventory and distribution systems. This model attracts customers because they like the \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d that result.\n\nCompanies, in theory, can offer discount prices without putting the squeeze on employees. Indeed, the privately held grocery chain Market Basket has a reputation for being inexpensive while also paying well and treating workers decently. Yet consumers don\u2019t appear to reward such virtue in and of itself. They regularly seek out bargains from retailers that minimize labor costs by keeping wages low \u2014 or by cutting out human workers to the greatest extent possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world\u2019s mightiest retail chain itself faces competition from online stores; it\u2019s telling that last year Amazon\u2019s market capitalization surpassed Walmart\u2019s. Walmart, if nothing else, operates brick-and-mortar retail spaces that employ actual humans. Amazon moves lots of goods around with robots; someday, it\u2019ll deliver them with drones. Not coincidentally, Amazon generates five times as much revenue per employeeas Walmart does.\n\nWhich hints at a quandary Sanders isn\u2019t addressing: Yes, chains like Walmart could and should pay employees more, but what happens when Internet companies cut out human workers altogether?\n\nIronically, there are socially conscious consumers who would never set foot in a Walmart but order from Amazon all the time. For Sanders to get the America he wants, it\u2019s not just the Waltons who\u2019ll need to have a change of heart.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2314930211", "eomportal-id": 308650, "description": "The \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d retailer makes a fat target for Bernie Sanders, but there\u2019s more to the story.", "eomportal-instanceid": 15, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d retailer makes a fat target for Bernie Sanders, but there\u2019s more to the story.", "title": "Bernie Sanders vs. Walmart - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/02/06/bernie-sanders-walmart/qSKxgDWc8HwVuXRJuPthGN/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/02/06/BostonGlobe.com/EditorialOpinion/Images/bb49802a30744e3bb7807350c2832b44-bb49802a30744e3bb7807350c2832b44-0.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 08:05:38 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders,Amazon,Walmart,Sam Walton,Walton family,income inequality, Dante Ramos, Bernard  Sanders, Sam  Walton,Facebook.com, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "7b8262f2-ccf3-11e5-b887-1b50baa90359", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders,Amazon,Walmart,Sam Walton,Walton family,income inequality, Dante Ramos, Bernard  Sanders, Sam  Walton,Facebook.com"}, "article_summary": "MANCHESTER, N.H.Other than Wall Street, there\u2019s no easier target for Bernie Sanders than Walmart and the family that\u2019s profited most from it.\nSanders also said the wages Walmart offers are so meager that employees need to rely on taxpayer-funded social programs such as Medicaid and subsidized housing.\nWhich hints at a quandary Sanders isn\u2019t addressing: Yes, chains like Walmart could and should pay employees more, but what happens when Internet companies cut out human workers altogether?\nIronically, there are socially conscious consumers who would never set foot in a Walmart but order from Amazon all the time.\nFor Sanders to get the America he wants, it\u2019s not just the Waltons who\u2019ll need to have a change of heart."}
