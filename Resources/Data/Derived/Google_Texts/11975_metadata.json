But veteran healthcare CFOs have learned a few valuable lessons on how to make meetings as productive as possible, even if they can\u2019t make them go away.\n\nIn a typical week, Mark E. Erath, interim CFO at Parkland Health & Hospital System in Dallas, the former CFO of Geisinger Medical Center in Pennsylvania, and a retired PricewaterhouseCoopers Healthcare partner who worked with hospitals nationwide, frequently finds himself attending meetings eight hours a day \u2013 \u201c\u2026 which means the other eight hours I get to do my work,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course, meetings are an important part of teamwork,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I think I can safely speak for all of my colleagues, myself and probably everybody in the healthcare industry: The [time spent in meetings] is way too much.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, meetings are on the rise, said Karen A. Shadowens, director of finance and CFO at West Chester Hospital in West Chester, Ohio.\n\nShadowens currently spends upwards of 30 hours of every week in meetings, 80 percent of which are called by others. The increase in meetings is driven \u201cby changes in the industry and developing responses to those changes,\u201d she said.\n\nIn order to curb meeting overload, Shadowens and Erath suggest:\n\nDistribute materials ahead of time. Too many meeting moderators waste time revisiting what should be the obvious \u2013 the basic facts, said Erath. That information should be shared in concise read-aheads prior to the meeting so that everyone shows up informed and ready to act on that information.\n\n\u201cToo much meeting time is spent just trying to report out on basic facts and respond to uncertainties about the facts rather than cutting to the chase,\u201d Erath said. \u201cIt\u2019s a symptom of lack of alignment around what the facts are or what the purpose is.\u201d\n\nKeep track of time. Announce when there\u2019s 10 minutes left to the meeting, said Shadowens, and use that time to assign follow-ups to people. Wrapping up a few minutes before the hour is up also allows people to get to their next meeting, she noted.\n\nMaintain control and keep focused. If you\u2019re moderating the meeting, maintain control, Shadowens said, by not allowing digressions during discussion and keeping to a set agenda. Keeping focus means presenting a simple statement of the essential facts and placing those facts in context, then moving to actions by addressing the implications of the facts, said Erath. Answer questions such as: What are we doing about the implications of the facts to enhance our processes and results? What are the responsive actions being taken, aligned with our goals and strategies? What is our performance plan to manage risks? And then wrap by evaluating how the plan will be achieved or how things are progressing towards achieving your goals.\n\nLimit meetings. Only have a meeting if it is essential to meet, and only invite those people that need to be there. \u201cThere should be structured quiet periods, or meeting free zones, so that everyone has the ability and time to do real work and time to process information and act between meetings,\u201d Erath said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/vanquishing-endless-meetings", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/business_people_in_meeting_100_dpi_thinkstock_creatas.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "No matter which healthcare CFO you ask, you will no doubt get the same response -- they spend the lion\u2019s share of their workweek in meetings.
