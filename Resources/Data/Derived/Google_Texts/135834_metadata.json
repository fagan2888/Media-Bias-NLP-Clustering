The annual study shows how one\u2019s county compares with other counties in the same state and how it compares with the state as a whole.\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, began the study across Wisconsin, but expanded its study to the entire country in 2010. It\u2019s now in its fifth year.\n\nThe annual study measures vital health factors which include high school graduation rates, obesity, smoking, unemployment, access to healthy foods, air and water quality, income and more. It takes statistics from every county in America. It shows how health is influenced by where people live, learn, work and play.\n\nThis year, Morrison County ranked 80th out of 87 counties in Minnesota for overall health outcomes and 75th for overall health factors. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, 84 counties participated in the survey. Morrison County ranked 80th, 80th and 78th respectively in health outcomes and 68, 78, 76 in health factors. In 2013, it ranked 82nd out of 87 counties in health outcomes and 75 in health factors. Bonnie Paulsen\n\n\u201cPeople think of the clinical reasons for our ranking,\u201d said Morrison County Public Health Director Bonnie Paulsen. \u201cLots goes into this (study). The community needs to change. People need to look at how to change their community to become healthier. Lots more goes into health than seeing a doctor.\u201d\n\nHealth Outcomes\n\nPremature deaths, or the years of potential life lost for those who died before age 75, were measured between 2008-2010. There were 5,929 premature deaths per 100,000 in Morrison County and 5,126 across Minnesota.\n\nIn surveys, 17 percent of Morrison County residents said they were in poor or fair health. Across Minnesota it was 11 percent. On average during a 30-day period, people said they had 3.4 poor physical health days compared to the average 2.8 days across the state.\n\nMorrison County residents reported 3.9 unhealthy mental health days in a 30-day period compared to an average 2.6 across Minnesota. Low birth weights came in at 6.6 percent compared to 6.5 percent in the state.\n\nThese quality of life statistics placed Morrison County 86th in the state.\n\nHealth Factors\n\nHealthy behavior put Morrison County\u2019s ranking at 65th among the state\u2019s 87 counties. Twenty-one percent of adults said they smoked compared to 16 percent of adults in the state. The survey showed 28 percent of adults reported they were obese as compared to 26 percent in Minnesota.\n\nTwenty-two percent of adults reported no leisure time physical activity. The average in Minnesota was 20 percent. This is compared to the statistics which say 41 percent of adults in Morrison County have adequate access to exercise opportunities.\n\nMorrison County residents reported 23 percent drank excessively or participated in binge drinking. That\u2019s compared to an average of 19 percent in Minnesota.\n\nThirty-seven percent of driving deaths had alcohol involvement in Morrison County as compared to Minnesota\u2019s 32 percent. These statistics were from 2008-2012.\n\nMorrison County ranked 74th in clinical care. Twelve percent of those surveyed said they were uninsured compared to 10 percent in the state. There were 1,749 people for each doctors/physician compared to an average of 1,116 people per doctor in Minnesota.\n\nThere were 3,358 people per dentist in Morrison County compared to an average of 1,602 per dentist in the state. Also, there were 2,583 people per mental health provider in Morrison County compared to 766 across the state.\n\nThe statistics said 82 percent of Morrison County students graduated, compared to 77 percent in the state. Sixty-one percent of adults aged 25-44 had some college, compared to an average of 73 percent in Minnesota.\n\nThe average unemployment for 2012 in Morrison County was 7.2 percent compared to 5.6 percent in the state. The percentage of Morrison County children in poverty was the same as the state\u2019s average \u2013 15 percent.\n\nViolent crime was low, 79 incidences per 100,000 population from 2009-2011 as compared to 234 per 100,000 across Minnesota.\n\nThe ranking for social and economic factors put Morrison County at 68.\n\nMorrison County\u2019s physical environment placed the county at 40, better than 50 percent of the state. Air pollution (only by .4 percent) and long commutes were the only two factors higher than the state average. Drinking water, severe housing problems and driving to work alone all had lower percentages than the state average.\n\n\u201cPublic Health is working on obesity through the Statewide Health Improvement Program (SHIP) and a Community Transformation grant. Both focus on chronic disease and obesity,\u201d said Paulsen. \u201cThe county also strives to decrease underage drinking, teaching better choices for teens and educating young drivers on distracted driving.\u201d\n\nPaulsen said that by changing health factors, people will be able to change the mortality (incidences of death in a population) and morbidity (the incidences of illness in a population) in Morrison County.\n\nOther programs implemented locally to improve the health of residents include the Farm to Table and Farm to School programs, reducing second-hand smoke, promoting active living and vehicle passenger safety awareness.\n\nPaulsen said that it\u2019s important to teach young people healthy choices to improve the health of the county. She also said the study helps her department and the community as a whole see where the county is at and what needs to be done to make improvements.\n\nTo see a full report, go to www.countyhealthrankings.org.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5388\"", "article_summary": "Morrison County ranked 80th, 80th and 78th respectively in health outcomes and 68, 78, 76 in health factors.\nThis year, Morrison County ranked 80th out of 87 counties in Minnesota for overall health outcomes and 75th for overall health factors.\nBonnie Paulsen\u201cPeople think of the clinical reasons for our ranking,\u201d said Morrison County Public Health Director Bonnie Paulsen.\nAlso, there were 2,583 people per mental health provider in Morrison County compared to 766 across the state.\nIn 2013, it ranked 82nd out of 87 counties in health outcomes and 75 in health factors."}
