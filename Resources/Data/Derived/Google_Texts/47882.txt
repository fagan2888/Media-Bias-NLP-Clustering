Tinejdad, Morocco – The High Council of Ulemas estimated the cash value of Zakat Alfitr, a charity that every Muslim has to pay at the end of Ramadan, for this year at MAD15 per person.

The Council explained that the ideal time to perform this religious duty has began since last Thursday night and will continue until early morning before the “Eid” prayer. After this period, the payment will be regarded a charity but not a Zakat.

As Islamic legislation enforce it. this act of great solidarity is not an optional charity but a divine duty that is obligatory for every Muslim, old and young, female and male.

“Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah ‘s blessings] upon them.” God confirms in His holy book, Surat At-Tawbah, 109

The aim from this Zakat is to help the most deprived and stop pan-handling during the days of celebration.
