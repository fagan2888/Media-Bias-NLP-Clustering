SOMERSET, Ky. (CBS DC) — A Kentucky doctor took out a newspaper ad stating he will be closing his medical practice due to President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.

Dr. Stephen Kiteck of Somerset, Ky., placed the ad in the Commonwealth Journal.

The ad states: “Due to the policies of Obamacare, Stephen Kiteck, MD will be closing his medical practice on December 31st, 2013.”

The ad continued: “Dr. Kiteck wishes to thank all his patients that have visited his office over the past 20 years, and apologizes for this inconvenience.”

CBS DC has reached out to Dr. Kiteck for comment.
