Under a sweltering sun last year, Thomas consumed 36 and \u00be hot dogs in 10 minutes \u2013 winning $10,000 in the women\u2019s competition and snagging her third straight title in Nathan\u2019s famous publicity-hogging contest, held every Independence Day since the early 1970s.\n\nRelated: Odd Job of the Day \u2013 She Packs Up Kids\u2019 Camp Trunks\n\n\u201cI love Sonya. She\u2019s an awesome eater. She pushes her body to the limit every time,\u201d said another competitive eater last year. \u201cShe\u2019s the Ayn Rand of the salivary gland,\u201d added a broadcaster oddly.\n\nThis July 4, Thomas is going for her fourth straight title, and if the past is any guide, she\u2019ll take swigs of water and bounce from foot to foot as she eats \u2013 helping to nudge down all those hot dogs and buns.\n\n\u201cI was born to be a competitive eater,\u201d she enthused in an email on Thursday. \u201cNot only is eating my hobby \u2013 I am blessed with a natural ability to eat large quantities of food quickly.\u201d\n\nRelated: How One Man Makes a Fortune from...Sticks\n\nA native of Alexandra, Virginia, Thomas averages one competitive eating contest a month. The rest of the time, she works full time as a store manager at a Burger King restaurant in the D.C. area. \u201cIt\u2019s my managerial job that puts food on my table and helps me make ends meet,\u201d she says on her website.\n\nShe sees a doctor regularly and has \u201cnever had to take prescription medication for cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., in my entire life.\u201d Her list of competitive eating awards currently numbers 40, though no one should count her out for more. She\u2019s in excellent shape, she\u2019s relatively young \u2013 and, after all, there are so many more dogs to eat.\n\n\u201cI eat a lot of very healthy foods each day \u2013 though slowly, for enjoyment \u2013 so I don\u2019t need vitamins,\u201d she said.\n\nHot dogs are not Thomas\u2019s only cup of tea, however: In December 2012, she ate 15 extra-large hard-boiled eggs in one minute. In July 2010, she downed 53 Taco Bell soft tacos in 12 minutes. In April 2008 she nibbled 32 \u00bd ears of sweet corn in 12 minutes. (Need we go on?)\n\nRelated: Meet the Architect of the Real House of Cards\n\nThomas does aerobic exercise for nearly two hours a day, five days a week, to stay in shape. It takes her body about 8 to 12 hours to recover from an eating contest, and \u201cby the next day, or later that same day, I\u2019m usually good to go.\u201d Does she ever purge after a match? \u201cAbsolutely not! I love my food, and I need what I eat.\u201d She says her stomach has \u201cbeen trained to stretch quite a bit\u201d over the years and \u201ccan handle up to 19 pounds of food and liquid overall, within 10 minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cStomach capacity, jaw strength and hand speed\u201d \u2013 these are the most important physical assets for great competitive eaters, she says. She rarely trains before a contest \u2013 although she did back in 2003, when she first became competitive. Her goal overall? To be the best competitive eater in the world and to \u201cremain very competitive in this sport for many more years.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Sonya Thomas was upset this morning by fourth-ranked Miki Sudo, who ate 34 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Thomas placed second with 27 and 3/4 hot dogs.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "She\u2019s petite, she\u2019s pretty, and no one on this planet, just by looking at her, would e", "title": "This Woman Eats More Hot Dogs in 10 Minutes Than Most of Us Eat in a Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/04/Woman-Eats-More-Hot-Dogs-10-Minutes-Most-Us-Eat-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07032014_Sonya_Thomas_Competitive_Eating.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/04/Woman-Eats-More-Hot-Dogs-10-Minutes-Most-Us-Eat-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07032014_Sonya_Thomas_Competitive_Eating.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "She\u2019s petite, she\u2019s pretty, and no one on this planet, just by looking at her, would e", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a43\"", "article_summary": "Hot dogs are not Thomas\u2019s only cup of tea, however: In December 2012, she ate 15 extra-large hard-boiled eggs in one minute.\nThomas placed second with 27 and 3/4 hot dogs.\nShe\u2019s in excellent shape, she\u2019s relatively young \u2013 and, after all, there are so many more dogs to eat.\nThat is, unless they\u2019ve seen the 100-pound leader of \u201cThe Four Horsemen of the Esophagus\u201d in action at Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island on the Fourth of July.\nTo be the best competitive eater in the world and to \u201cremain very competitive in this sport for many more years.\u201dUpdate: Sonya Thomas was upset this morning by fourth-ranked Miki Sudo, who ate 34 hot dogs in 10 minutes."}
