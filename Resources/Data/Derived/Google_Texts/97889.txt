The Baltimore Ravens’ defense had a lot to talk about about, but linebacker Elvis Dumervil said there was nothing to celebrate on his return to Denver Sunday.

The sour point was a Ravens’ possession in the last 2:55 that came up short when Broncos safety Darian Stewart intercepted a pass by Joe Flacco in the end zone in the waning seconds to give Denver a hard-fought 19-13 victory. Baltimore’s defense kept the Broncos out of the end zone, but it wasn’t enough.

“Give them credit, they got the W,” said Dumervil, a former Broncos star. “It was a tough one. Peyton (Manning) always has been a great player. He made some plays, we made some plays.”

Baltimore’s defense stymied Manning, who two years ago in the season opener threw seven touchdown passes against Baltimore. On this day, however, the Ravens frustrated the Broncos’ offense, holding it to four field goals.

The lack of a touchdown pass wasn’t the only blemish on Manning’s statistical line. He completed only 24 of 40 passes for 175 yards, was sacked four times and cornerback Jimmy Smith intercepted him and returned it for a touchdown.

Smith, a first round draft choice in 2011 from Colorado, made an acrobatic move to catch the ball while defending Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood. He returned it 24 yards for a score that gave Baltimore a 10-9 lead early in the third quarter. Smith is remembered at CU for making a big interception for a touchdown against Nebraska in 2007.

“It kind of floated, and thought I could jump over the receiver and catch it,” Smith said. “That’s pretty much what I did.”

Flacco, like Manning, failed to lead his team to a touchdown drive on a day when defense took center stage. The Ravens’ only drive into the red zone came on their last possession, which Stewart ended with an interception after the ball bounced off the hands of tight end Crockett Gillmore, who was hit by safety David Bruton.
