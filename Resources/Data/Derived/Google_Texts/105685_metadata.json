But Paulsen, the Rockies\u2019 farm system leader in home runs with 15 and in runs scored with 62, has yet to get his shot with the Rockies.\n\nNext week, he will be the only player from the Sky Sox represented on the Pacific Coast League roster for the Triple-A All-Star Game. He will be in Durham, N.C., a little closer to his home in Florida. And he will have the opportunity to see family members for the first time this season.\n\nPaulsen has strived to show consistency in his performance and for the most part has done just that. His batting average has stayed at about .300 or better. He\u2019s also near the top of the Rockies\u2019 farm system in hits and RBIs. He mentioned spring training from two years ago as he talked Friday about his upcoming trip to the Triple-A All-Star Game.\n\nTwo years ago his mentor in Arizona was Jason Giambi, who was gearing up for what would be his last season with the Rockies.\n\n\u201cHe told me that I would be my best hitting coach,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cHe said I had to learn that because your coaches always aren\u2019t going to be there. That stuck with me. He was one of the best players in the game, and I was around him a lot because we played the same position.\u201d\n\nPaulsen doesn\u2019t want to take all of the credit for his success this year, noting that Sky Sox manager Glenallen Hill and hitting coach Dave Hajek have been invaluable in helping him with the mental part of baseball and understanding his swing at the plate.\n\nAfter the Rockies made him a third-round pick in the 2009 draft out of Clemson, Paulsen started his journey up the franchise\u2019s player development ladder. Batting averages of .241 and .255 with Double-A Tulsa in 2011 and 2012 didn\u2019t help, but he still managed to hit 29 and 18 home runs.\n\nAnd even with his success in Triple-A, his major-league service line still says zero.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that former American League MVP Justin Morneau has nailed down first base for now in the Rockies\u2019 post-Todd Helton era, and the Sky Sox\u2019s Kyle Parker got the call to back up Morneau when Michael Cuddyer went on the disabled list.\n\n\u201cWith Justin Morneau at first base, it creates a bigger challenge for Ben,\u201d said Zach Wilson of the Rockies\u2019 player development department. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t see him as a major-leaguer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get too frustrated,\u201d said Paulsen, a left-handed hitter, as is Morneau. \u201cKyle\u2019s a right-handed hitter and he hits lefties. That\u2019s going to be his calling. He\u2019s versatile and plays the outfield as well.\u201d\n\nPaulsen has his future mapped out.\n\n\u201cIf I keep doing the good things, something good will happen,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cIf I keep playing hard and getting results, someone will notice.\u201d\n\nOut of loyalty, he would like it to be the Rockies, the team that drafted him. But there are 29 other teams looking for players too.\n\nFootnote. Christian Friedrich, who was rushed into service as an emergency starter for the Rockies, is moving to the bullpen after returning to the Sky Sox. In his first relief appearance for them, Friedrich, a first-round pick in the 2008 draft, pitched 3 \u2153 innings against Round Rock (Texas) and allowed two home runs.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss\n\nOrganization leaders\n\n(Statistics through Thursday)\n\nHITTING: (64 games) Raimel Tapia, Ashe- ville, .324; Michael Benjamin, Asheville, .316.\n\nRUNS: Ben Paulsen, Colorado Springs, 62; Ryan McMahon, Asheville, 60.\n\nHITS: David Dahl, Asheville, 102; Tapia, Asheville, 101.\n\nDOUBLES: McMahon, Asheville, 30; Correlle Prime, Asheville, 28.\n\nTRIPLES: Trevor Story, Modesto-Tulsa, 8; David Kandilas, Modesto-Tulsa, 7.\n\nHOME RUNS: Paulsen, Colorado Springs, 15; Prime, Asheville, 14.\n\nRBIs: McMahon, Asheville, 70; Paulsen, Colorado Springs, 57.\n\nSTOLEN BASES: Jason Pridie, Colorado Springs, 20; Story, Modesto-Tulsa, 20.\n\nPITCHING VICTORIES: Johendi Jiminian, Asheville, 10; Antonio Senzatela, Ashe- ville, 10.\n\nLOSSES: Yohan Flande, Colorado Springs, 9; Christian Friedrich, Colorado Springs, 8; Richard Castillo, Tulsa, 8; Zach Jemicia, Asheville, 8.\n\nSAVES: Scott Oberg, Tulsa, 15; Dylan Sta- mey, Asheville, 10.\n\nINNINGS: Alex Balog, Asheville, 102; Konner Wade, Asheville, 98 \u2154 .\n\nWALKS: Castillo, Tulsa, 30; Jiminian, Asheville, 29.\n\nSTRIKEOUTS: Jon Gray, Tulsa, 81; Balog, Asheville, 69.\n\nERA: (starters) Tyler Anderson, Tulsa, 2.78; Carlos Hernandez, Tulsa, 2.84; (relievers) Troy Neiman, Asheville, 1.72; Cole White, Tulsa-Colorado Springs, 2.27.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ben Paulsen is hitting his stride with Colorado Springs Sky Sox", "title": "Ben Paulsen is hitting his stride with Colorado Springs Sky Sox", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/11/ben-paulsen-is-hitting-his-stride-with-colorado-springs-sky-sox/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140711_102436_ben-paulsen.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140711_102436_ben-paulsen.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-11T21:31:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:18:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff78\"", "article_summary": "LOSSES: Yohan Flande, Colorado Springs, 9; Christian Friedrich, Colorado Springs, 8; Richard Castillo, Tulsa, 8; Zach Jemicia, Asheville, 8.\nRUNS: Ben Paulsen, Colorado Springs, 62; Ryan McMahon, Asheville, 60.\nRBIs: McMahon, Asheville, 70; Paulsen, Colorado Springs, 57.\nHOME RUNS: Paulsen, Colorado Springs, 15; Prime, Asheville, 14.\n\u201cWith Justin Morneau at first base, it creates a bigger challenge for Ben,\u201d said Zach Wilson of the Rockies\u2019 player development department."}
