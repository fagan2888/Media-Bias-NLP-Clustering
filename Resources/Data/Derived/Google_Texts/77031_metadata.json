Brat went on to a surprise defeat of incumbent House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the June 10 primary. (Jay Paul/Getty Images)\n\nIn the three months since Virginia Republican David Brat stunned the political world and defeated then-House majority leader Eric Cantor, he has figured out quickly that it\u2019s not easy being the front-runner and a darling of the tea party all at once.\n\nThe balance between cultivating his national profile and impressing local Rotary clubs is especially important given Cantor\u2019s reputation for being out of touch, which contributed to his ouster.\n\nBrat\u2019s critics say he lost his outsider credibility as soon as he hired a high-powered Republican consultant. They have labeled him a hypocrite for shying away from debates not long after dinging Cantor for the same behavior.\n\nBut in a conservative district stretching from suburban Richmond north to the rural Shenandoah Valley, Brat is favored to win the seat and join Congress in an enviable spot: a freshman with a David-and-Goliath narrative and national name recognition.\n\nOn Friday evening, Brat reveled in his rising stature at the Omni Shoreham hotel in Northwest Washington, appearing at a private reception for a political committee associated with the Family Research Council, an influential conservative Christian group.\n\nThen-candidate David Brat attends a campaign event at the Golden Corral with members of Heaven's Saints motorcycle ministry April 26 in Glen Allen, Va.

(Jay Paul/Getty Images)\n\nBrat was seen passing out business cards to GOP operatives and mingling alongside Republicans Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, both potential 2016 presidential candidates.\n\nBrat\u2019s high-wattage tour continued on Saturday when he rallied with nationally syndicated radio host and Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a hard-line opponent of comprehensive immigration reform, at a campaign event in Hanover County, north of Richmond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay down to earth,\u201d Brat said in an interview Friday. \u201cI know it\u2019s a mistake if you get national attention to take your eyes off the district, and my focus is on the ground game. What I\u2019m doing is meeting as many people as I can, people I\u2019ve respected for years.\u201d\n\nBrat said that he has made several recent trips to Washington, and he cited the Heritage Foundation, a think tank, and FreedomWorks, a group that organizes activists, as two conservative groups he has connected with. He has also met with the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Rifle Association, his office said.\n\n\u201cTalking to the think tank folks and the political folks is exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I get to Congress, I want to use my economics background and go straight to [the] American people and tell them what the numbers are about the federal budget and entitlements.\u201d\n\nIn the district, Brat has mostly kept a low profile, meeting with civic groups and businesses organizations receptive to the message that resonated during the primary: Reduce the debt and deficit, stop illegal immigration and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSpokesman Brian Gottstein said the groups that Brat meets with all request that their meetings are closed to reporters. He provided a list of more than two dozen events Brat has attended that were open to reporters, such as the Louisa Bluegrass Festival, a town hall in New Kent County and a tea party meeting in Goochland.\n\nBaird Stokes, a campaign volunteer from Goochland, has seen other changes since the days when Brat dutifully attended Henrico GOP meetings with an eye on the treasury.\n\n\u201cDavid was pretty much the quiet guy over in the corner. If you wanted to know what the numbers were, he had the numbers, but he wasn\u2019t out front. So it\u2019s interesting to see him as the rock star now,\u201d Stokes said.\n\nBrat also impressed earlier this month at an evening meet-and-greet for 65 people hosted by Mike and Margaret Mickel at their Henrico home.\n\n\u201cHe gave a very inspiring speech,\u201d Mike Mickel said, calling Brat \u201ca principled person\u201d who won\u2019t make a career out of politics.\n\nYet Brat, who has promised to serve a maximum of 12 years in Congress, has taken heat from his opponents Democrat Jack Trammell and Libertarian James Carr, who call it ironic that Brat has turned down several chances to debate them.\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a primary makes,\u201d Trammell said in a phone interview Friday. \u201cA few short months ago, Brat was the outsider, and he was demanding debates. Now he\u2019s the front-runner and he\u2019s refusing formal debate.\u201d\n\nIn addition to public debates scheduled for October in Goochland and at Randolph-Macon College \u2014 where Brat and Trammell are professors \u2014 Brat appeared Friday morning at a closed-press forum sponsored by the Richmond chapter of the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors.\n\n\u201cDave is doing and has pledged to do three debates or forums in the district,\u201d Gottstein said. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty of opportunity for these guys to debate.\u201d\n\nAccording to an audio clip of last week\u2019s event provided by someone who was there, Brat spoke of his biography and the millions Cantor spent in the primary, but mostly stuck to a message that often plays well with his conservative base.\n\n\u201cThe press is the toughest opponent these days, the national press particularly just wants to do \u2018gotcha\u2019 to both sides, they just go constantly after you on these little things. They never ask you about the big issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always want to define you and kind of pigeon-hole you.\u201d\n\nGottstein said Brat is focused on issues important to 7th District voters and for that reason has done fewer interviews with national outlets.\n\nBrat stumbled in his first major interview the day after the primary, when NBC reporter Chuck Todd asked him to clarify his positions on several foreign policy issues. Soon after that, he parted ways with campaign manager Zachary Werrell and hired Tim Edson.\n\nEdson was previously campaign manager for Allen West, the former one-term House member from Florida who turned his fleeting national prominence as a rhetorical bomb-thrower into books and deals with conservative media organizations.\n\nThere was also an early misstep with his next campaign manager, Amanda Chase, who was replaced after three weeks. Gottstein said Brat\u2019s current lieutenants, Phil Rapp and Nancy Smith, were key volunteers throughout the primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like going from a shoestring budget to a small corporation,\u201d Brat said of the transition from the primary to general election. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept on a lot of talent and have roughly the same support. But you\u2019ve got to make some changes and keep moving along.\u201d\n\nBrat, who has yet to air television or radio ads, amassed $600,000 through the end of June and has been steadily raising money since then. The National Republican Congressional Committee gave him $5,000, as did NRCC Chairman Greg Walden (Ore.) from his campaign account.\n\nBrat has also used his newfound political capital to make a mark in the House he has yet to join, refusing coyly on Friday to say whether he would endorse House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) for another term in that position and speaking fondly of the \u201cliberty caucus,\u201d a group of libertarian-leaning Republicans who have often blocked GOP initiatives.\n\nBrat\u2019s early moves suggest that he is looking to be more than a rank-and-file, head-down freshman if elected in November. House GOP leaders, perturbed at potentially having to deal with another outspoken tea party favorite with national ambitions, have taken notice.\n\nBrat said to expect more conservative and GOP heavyweights to show up in central Virginia to stump for him in the closing days of the campaign. \u201cSome major names, people you know,\u201d Brat said with a chuckle. \u201cStay tuned for some fun announcements.\u201d\n\nBut he insisted he\u2019s trying to stay humble.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep it real, to keep it at the ground level,\u201d Brat said. It\u2019s not always easy, however, to do so. At GOP gatherings, he is often swarmed by well-wishers and even for autograph requests. Same goes for the local mall.\n\n\u201cI go into Wal-Mart to get my kids stuff and it\u2019s always, \u2018Hey, Dave!\u2019 and all that. Folks come up to me and chat, ask me questions.\u201d\n\nBrat said he doesn\u2019t mind the attention.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After his defeat of then-House majority leader Eric Cantor, he navigates national and local politics.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/costareports", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "After his defeat of then-House majority leader Eric Cantor, he navigates national and local politics.", "title": "Virginia GOP candidate Dave Brat looks for balance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-gop-candidate-dave-brat-looks-for-balance/2014/09/27/9f063838-457d-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/13/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Images/450461060.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@costareports"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "vapolitics, Dave Brat, Eric Cantor, Jack Trammell, Congress", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/costareports"}, "news_keywords": "vapolitics, Dave Brat, Eric Cantor, Jack Trammell, Congress", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "9f063838-457d-11e4-9a15-137aa0153527"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf83a\"", "article_summary": "House GOP leaders, perturbed at potentially having to deal with another outspoken tea party favorite with national ambitions, have taken notice.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee gave him $5,000, as did NRCC Chairman Greg Walden (Ore.) from his campaign account.\nBrat said to expect more conservative and GOP heavyweights to show up in central Virginia to stump for him in the closing days of the campaign.\nBaird Stokes, a campaign volunteer from Goochland, has seen other changes since the days when Brat dutifully attended Henrico GOP meetings with an eye on the treasury.\nSpokesman Brian Gottstein said the groups that Brat meets with all request that their meetings are closed to reporters."}
