(For legal nerds out there, the case is titled Halbig vs. Burwell.)\n\nThe panel ruled, 2-1, that the Internal Revenue Service acted illegally in approving subsidies for people who obtained their health insurance through a federal exchange. Strictly construing language in the Affordable Care Act, the majority said that subsidies were available only to customers who buy their insurance through exchanges established by states.\n\nThe two judges in the majority, Judge Thomas Griffith and Senior Judge A. Raymond Randolph, were appointed by Republican presidents. The dissenter, Senior Judge Harry Edwards, is a Democratic appointee.\n\nIt's a fallacy to assume that the party of the president who appointed a judge is a surefire indication of how that judge will rule.\n\nBut now the panel\u2019s ruling has been vacated and the case will be decided by an \u201den banc\u201d court comprising 13 judges --the 11 active judges plus two senior judges who sat on the panel. Eight of the 13 are Democratic appointees (including three confirmed after Senate Democrats eliminated the filibuster for most presidential nominations).\n\nHad the court not decided to rehear the case en banc, the three-judge panel\u2019s decision would have remained on the books and presented a conflict with a ruling by another appeals court, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. That would have increased the likelihood that the Supreme Court would hear the case to resolve what lawyers call a \u201ccircuit split.\u201d\n\nBut if the en banc D.C. Circuit also upholds the rule there would be no conflict \u2014 and maybe no review by the Supreme Court.\n\nThat\u2019s why supporters of the healthcare law are so pleased that the Democrat-heavy en banc court will now revisit the issue. \u201cDo the math,\u201d they say, and the Obama administration wins.\n\nOr maybe not. I have written before that it\u2019s a fallacy to assume that the party of the president who appointed a judge is a surefire indication of how that judge will rule. (Probably the nation\u2019s best-known Republican-appointed appeals court judge, Richard Posner, wrote the opinion this week striking down bans on same-sex marriage in Indiana and Wisconsin.)\n\nThe question in the Halbig case is not whether universal healthcare is a good; it\u2019s whether a court should read a sloppily drafted law with an emphasis on the wording of individual provisions rather than the statute\u2019s overarching purpose.\n\nEven on that point, Democratic appointees may be more likely as a group than Republican appointees to take the broad reading. But it\u2019s not a slam dunk. And it\u2019s insulting to the judges on the court to say that it is.\n\nFollow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "On Obamacare ruling, don't insult these judges", "date": "2014-09-05", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The fix is in.", "title": "On Obamacare ruling, don't insult these judges", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-ol-court-obamacare-democrats-20140905-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-540a3ab2/turbine/la-ol-court-obamacare-democrats-20140905", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "court, obamacare, health exchange, affordable care act, Halbig vs. Burwell", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81282537", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "court, obamacare, health exchange, affordable care act, Halbig vs. Burwell", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will rehear a decision by a three-judge panel in July that threw an important part of Obamacare into confusion."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda5a\"", "article_summary": "But now the panel\u2019s ruling has been vacated and the case will be decided by an \u201den banc\u201d court comprising 13 judges --the 11 active judges plus two senior judges who sat on the panel.\nThat\u2019s why supporters of the healthcare law are so pleased that the Democrat-heavy en banc court will now revisit the issue.\nThe two judges in the majority, Judge Thomas Griffith and Senior Judge A.
