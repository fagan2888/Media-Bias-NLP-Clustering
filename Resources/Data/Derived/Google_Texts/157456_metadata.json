Called the \u201cSoutheast\u2019s Interactive Festival,\u201d it also celebrates what\u2019s happening in Charleston.\n\nTalks are based on a wide range of business topics such as money, recruitment and gender. Outside of serious business, musical performers are scheduled throughout the conference. It attracted about 5,000 attendees last year.\n\nThe 2015 events start Tuesday and run through Saturday morning. Tuesday night there will be a \u201cDig Space Walk\u201d where attendees can tour local tech companies. Scoop \u2014 an electric car service \u2014 will take attendees from company to company on the peninsula, said Nina Magnesson, community relations and outreach manager at BoomTown.\n\nDig will be a base for introducing a few new startups, including Vouch! and Geekin Radio.\n\nAlso being introduced this year is Charleston Open Source, a new effort to help work on the region\u2019s tech talent pool. Local companies will work together as opposed to taking people from each other, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to help them ... put that on the map,\u201d Gray said, adding, \u201cHopefully that\u2019ll just help us attract talent.\u201d\n\nFriday will be Dig Demo Day, where startups will have the chance to win money through two different \u201cWild Pitch\u201d programs, one geared toward students and early-stage startups, the other for companies that have been through business accelerator programs. Two of the companies participating in the competition are coming from California, he said.\n\nLast year, the pitch money was structured as an equity investment, Gray said, but this year it\u2019ll be cash. Each winner will get $7,500.\n\n\u201cEarly-stage startups oftentimes don\u2019t really know if they even want an investor yet,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThere will also be a job fair Friday for those looking for work and those looking to hire. Gray said last week that they had eight companies participating.\n\nThe \u201cInvestor Bash\u201d will be an event for investors at the conference and those participating in Friday\u2019s \u201cWild Pitch\u201d events, Gray said, but others can buy tickets. Something similar was available last year, but Gray said this year\u2019s is more extensive.\n\n\u201cWe offered it last year, but it was very small,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThe number of venture capital firms venturing to Dig South has also gone up, Gray said. One such firm is Revolution, the same firm where venture capitalist Steve Case works. Case, who partly founded AOL is coming to Charleston in early May to give $100,000 to a startup as part of a tour he\u2019s doing.\n\nErnest Andrade, director of the Charleston Digital Corridor Foundation, said the Dig South conference lets people see Charleston through a different lens, as opposed to just a nice vacation spot.\n\nGray\u2019s scale for measuring the success of this year\u2019s conference boils down to what the businesses get out of it.\n\n\u201cIf people connect with each other and ... companies recruit talent, they raise capital and then they get brilliant ideas that they turn into successful businesses, then we\u2019ve succeeded,\u201d Gray said. \u201cOur job really is to just create that platform for them to broadcast that story, and then we invite a ton of national media in to project that.\u201d\n\nThe Post and Courier is one of the sponsors of Dig South.
