After the Obama administration announced HealthCare.gov had been upgraded and is now functional, CNN put it to the test Sunday – and came up short.

CNN business correspondent Alison Kosik attempted to set up a health insurance account on live television, with disastrous results.

“We know the first thing you have to do when you go to this website [is] you have to select your state,” “New Day” host George Howell said. “Is that working?”

Kosik, working with CNN medical producer Matt Sloane, said it seemed to be working while logging on.

“But then came the road blocks,” Kosik said. “So tell me about what happened, because we’re getting another error message here, and it’s supposed to be running smoothly. We’re just not seeing that.”

Sloane confirmed problems persisted with the site.

“Yeah, so, you know, we’ve been trying to get into the site since Oct. 1 on and off again,” he said. “I have to say it did work a lot more smoothly this morning. I got through. I picked my state. I put in all of my information, and I got through the whole process in eight minutes. And then it said my status was in progress. So I went to refresh it, and I got the error message.”
