MILAN (AP) — It’s no time to be shy about color, men.

Milan Fashion Week previews opened Saturday for next summer’s menswear, and already a trend is coming into focus: bold, electric colors.

Economic indicators suggest men have become as fashion-conscious as women. Now Milan fashion designers are offering fashion-forward men ever more daring looks, digging into sartorial embellishments that long have been the playthings of women’s fashion: brocade, embroidery, sequins and jewel tones.

Versace and Philipp Plein are showing their newest looks Saturday night. Milan Fashion Week ends Tuesday.

RAGING BULL

Since a group of butterflies is a flutter, it seems only fair to call a parade of Dolce&Gabbana models in tailored crimson suits a flourish.

The designing pair have departed, if briefly, from their fabled Sicily for Spain’s bullfighting country to gather inspiration for next summer’s looks. Still, their matador jackets embellished with swirls of lace, rutsched ribbon and velvet lapels offer the sort of baroque elements that often underpin Dolce&Gabbana style. Instead of traditional gold, these new accents are black. The jackets are worn with cropped trousers and slippers.

The designers offer a new version of their boxy top, often worn with skinny trousers, this one with pictures of charging bulls. Worn around the neck to accompany this fierce image is a delicate rosary, suggesting either the fervor it must take to enter an arena with a raging bull or gratitude for having survived.

The designers have incorporated decorations from the matador costumes into more urban suits, with swirls of ribbon and piping, worn with skinny ties. Shoes range from fuzzy sandals to high-top sneakers.

They distill these elements into a series of shiny three-piece suits with coop-neck gilets and skinny ties in a series of colors: cornflower blue, evergreen, emerald, purple and salmon pink — all giving way to a finale of crimson red.
