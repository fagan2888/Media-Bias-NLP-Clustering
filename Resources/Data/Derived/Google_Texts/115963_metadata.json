Charlie Baker said the performance of the MBTA was unacceptable and that he planned to sit down with transit officials after the latest storm to discuss service disruptions.\n\nIn one incident earlier Monday, nearly 50 commuters had to be evacuated from a disabled Red Line train in Quincy after being stranded for more than two hours. No one was injured. Officials said the train lost connection to the electrified third rail because of the buildup of snow on the tracks.\n\nBaker said his administration spent a lot of time during the weekend talking to public transit officials to make sure they could run an at least a scaled-back schedule during the latest storm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been disappointed by the fact that even that abbreviated schedule hasn\u2019t been able to be maintained. Once it stops snowing, we plan to have a long conversation with the folks at the T about improving performance,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThere are a lot of people at the T who I know have been working extremely hard, but this performance is simply not acceptable.\u201d\n\nBaker said after the announcement that rail service was being suspended that transit officials made the right call if they believed they could not deliver adequate service on Tuesday. He also said he did not want to engage in a \u201cblame game\u201d over who was responsible for the breakdowns.\n\nTransit officials have said aging equipment has exacerbated the weather-related problems at the MBTA, a semi-independent agency and not under the direct control of the governor.\n\nJoseph Dell\u2019Erario was among those commuters catching one of the last Red Line trains out of Boston\u2019s Park Street station. The 24-year-old salesman and Somerville resident said he didn\u2019t blame the MBTA for the decision to suspend subway and rail service Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly doing it for the safety of the public,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to be operating well, then they shouldn\u2019t be operating at all.\u201d\n\nBut frustration was setting in for many riders.\n\nEarlier Monday at the T\u2019s Red Line station in Cambridge\u2019s Kendall Square, Cassie Smith said a delay had forced her to cut short a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\n\u201cI only got to see him for 10 minutes, so I\u2019m just really frustrated,\u201d Smith said as she headed home to Boston\u2019s Beacon Hill neighborhood. \u201cIt said it was arriving in 15 minutes but took a lot longer. I could have walked across the river faster if I had known.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority suspended all rail service on Monday amid an unprecedented onslaught of snow that has crippled the nation's oldest public transit system, frustrating commuters and even stranding some on disabled trains.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority suspended all rail service on Monday amid an unprecedented onslaught of snow that has crippled the nation\u2019s oldest public transit system, frustrating commuters and even stranding some on disabled trains.", "title": "MBTA shuts down trolleys, trains amid snow", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/9/passengers-stranded-on-boston-area-train/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/09/5b7a1bb673a5a9066d0f6a706700fe17.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/09/5b7a1bb673a5a9066d0f6a706700fe17.jpg", "description": "The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority suspended all rail service on Monday amid an unprecedented onslaught of snow that has crippled the nation's oldest public transit system, frustrating com", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "MBTA shuts down trolleys, trains amid snow"}, "Author": "STEVE LeBLANC and PHILIP MARCELO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe169d\"", "article_summary": "The 24-year-old salesman and Somerville resident said he didn\u2019t blame the MBTA for the decision to suspend subway and rail service Tuesday.\nBOSTON (AP) - The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority suspended all rail service on Monday amid an unprecedented onslaught of snow that has crippled the nation\u2019s oldest public transit system, frustrating commuters and even stranding some on disabled trains.\nTransit officials have said aging equipment has exacerbated the weather-related problems at the MBTA, a semi-independent agency and not under the direct control of the governor.\nOfficials said the train lost connection to the electrified third rail because of the buildup of snow on the tracks.\nCharlie Baker said the performance of the MBTA was unacceptable and that he planned to sit down with transit officials after the latest storm to discuss service disruptions."}
