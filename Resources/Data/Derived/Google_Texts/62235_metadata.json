None of that is accurate.\n\nThe latest draft recommendations \u2014 the public comment period for which ended in late May \u2014 are virtually unchanged from the independent task force\u2019s 2009 recommendations on breast cancer screenings. For asymptomatic women who are not at high risk for breast cancer, the recommendations suggest \u201cbiennial screening mammography for women ages 50 to 74 years,\u201d and they say for women age 40 to 49, the decision to have a mammogram \u201cshould be an individual one.\u201d The task force said it couldn\u2019t evaluate benefits and harms for women 75 and older because of insufficient evidence. That\u2019s the same language used nearly six years ago.\n\nHowever, if these 2015 recommendations become final, they would change the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement for insurers to cover annual mammograms without any copays or deductibles. Specifically, insurance companies no longer would be required to cover free annual mammograms for women age 40 to 49, a requirement that went into effect for non-grandfathered health plans in the fall of 2010.\n\nSome politicians concerned about this change have described the potential impact correctly, but they misplace the blame on the Preventive Services Task Force, which doesn\u2019t issue any kind of insurance mandates or policy decisions. Instead, it was lawmakers who added a provision to the ACA tying the task force\u2019s future recommendations to coverage requirements in the health care law.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, some claims misrepresent what the task force has said and what it means for women and access to mammography. We don\u2019t know when the task force\u2019s final recommendations on mammography will be released, but \u2014 if we were to venture a guess \u2014 we would expect to see another round of misleading claims then. We have already fact-checked false assertions about the task force\u2019s mammography recommendations in 2013 and back in 2010.\n\nHistory, when it comes to fact-checking, definitely repeats itself.\n\nDoctors, Not \u2018Bureaucrats\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s start with some background on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and what it does. The USPSTF, created in 1984 under Ronald Reagan, is an independent, volunteer panel of primary care physicians and experts in preventive medicine.\n\nThe panel examines peer-reviewed evidence and makes recommendations \u201cintended to help primary care clinicians and patients decide together whether a preventive service is right for a patient\u2019s needs,\u201d as the panel\u2019s website says. The recommendations are for patients \u201cwho have no signs or symptoms of the specific disease or condition under evaluation\u201d and pertain to \u201conly services offered in the primary care setting or services referred by a primary care clinician.\u201d\n\nIts members are not \u201cbureaucrats,\u201d as Republican Sen. David Vitter called them in a statement opposing the latest recommendations. Vitter, and 61 other lawmakers of both parties, wrote a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, urging the USPSTF to \u201cnot jeopardize access to these screenings.\u201d Vitter said in his May 6 press release: \u201cGiven the widespread risk of breast cancer, we shouldn\u2019t let bureaucrats in Washington limit access to prevention and early detection resources. These decisions should be left to women and their doctors.\u201d\n\nIn the same press release, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said: \u201cI am extremely concerned about the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s draft recommendation to limit insurance coverage of mammograms for women between 40-49 years old. When the government is making the calls on what must be covered \u2013 not the patient or doctor \u2013 patients find their care rationed and their choices limited \u2013 this time among women under 50. When 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime, it is imperative we put the patients in the driver\u2019s seat of their health care choices \u2013 not the government.\u201d\n\nThe task force does, in fact, recommend that women and their doctors make the appropriate decisions on mammography on an individual basis, and it didn\u2019t make any recommendation to \u201climit insurance coverage of mammograms.\u201d It does not make any insurance coverage recommendations at all. (And patients and doctors were never making the calls on insurance coverage, as McMorris Rodgers suggests; that was up to insurance companies.)\n\nThe task force\u2019s preface to its draft recommendations states: \u201cClinicians should understand the evidence but individualize decisionmaking to the specific patient or situation. Similarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and coverage decisions involve considerations in addition to the evidence of clinical benefits and harms.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s recommendations do have an impact on what federal law now requires insurers to cover at a minimum \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t the panel\u2019s doing. Instead, it was lawmakers\u2019 decision.\n\nThe task force had no direct ties to what insurers covered until the Affordable Care Act used its recommendations as the basis for determining what preventive services health plans would be required to cover for free \u2014 without charging a copay or deductible to consumers.\n\nThe law says that group and individual health insurance coverage \u201cshall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements\u201d for several preventive items, including immunizations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and services with an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating from the USPSTF.\n\nSome associated with the task force weren\u2019t happy about its work being linked to insurance requirements in the ACA. Dr. Steven H. Woolf, a former task force member, and Dr. Doug Campos-Outcalt, a liaison between the American Academy of Family Physicians and the USPSTF, wrote in 2013 in the Journal of the American Medical Association that the arrangement exposes the board to political pressure and threatens its independence.\n\n\u201cCoverage decisions, like other aspects of public policy, should not always be dictated solely by science,\u201d they wrote, saying that \u201c[t]he role of the USPSTF has never been to make these policy choices but, rather, to give decision makers who consider the evidence an impartial assessment of its quality.\u201d\n\nAnd, in fact, the USPSTF recommendations on mammography were exposed to political maneuvering immediately, before the law was even enacted.\n\nIn 2002, the task force had recommended \u201cscreening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1-2 years for women aged 40 and older.\u201d But in November 2009, the task force issued new mammography recommendations, saying that it recommended biennial screening starting at age 50. For women younger than 50, it said, the decision to have a mammogram should be an \u201cindividual one and take patient context into account, including the patient\u2019s values regarding specific benefits and harms.\u201d The harms were mainly false positive tests.\n\nThat recommendation for women under 50 was a \u201cC\u201d recommendation, which means providing the service depends on \u201cindividual circumstances,\u201d but for most symptom-free patients \u201cthere is likely to be only a small benefit from this service.\u201d That \u201cC\u201d rating would have meant that mammography for women under 50 wouldn\u2019t be part of the no-cost-sharing coverage requirements of the ACA, except that lawmakers, including Vitter and Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, were able to amend the law to say it would require such coverage and would simply ignore the 2009 USPSTF recommendations.\n\nIn early December 2009, the Senate passed an amendment to the health care legislation by Mikulski of Maryland that would require full coverage of yearly mammograms, including for women under 50, and the same day, the Senate agreed, without a vote, to an amendment by Vitter that said: \u201c[F]or the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any other provision of law, the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009.\u201d\n\nThat language was in the final legislation that became law in late March 2010, and it meant that the ACA would revert to the 2002 mammography recommendations for purposes of determining what services would be required to be covered without any out-of-pocket costs by women.\n\nThe letter from Vitter and other lawmakers says that \u201ca provision was signed into law that was meant to prevent the 2009 USPSTF recommendation from going into effect,\u201d but that twists the facts. The USPSTF\u2019s recommendations don\u2019t go \u201cinto effect\u201d at all: They\u2019re evaluations of peer-reviewed scientific evidence intended to serve as a resource for primary care doctors and their patients, who are under no obligation to follow the recommendations. Instead, Vitter\u2019s provision was meant to prevent the ACA from using the 2009 recommendations to determine insurance coverage requirements.\n\nIt\u2019s 2009 All Over Again\n\nThe language in the law \u2014 \u201cthe current recommendations\u201d of the USPSTF on mammography \u201cshall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009\u2033 \u2014 means that any recommendations issued after 2009 would now be the \u201ccurrent\u201d ones applicable to the ACA.\n\n\u201cIt was really about ignoring 2009,\u201d Dr. Richard Wender, the American Cancer Society\u2019s chief cancer control officer, told us in a phone interview. The law didn\u2019t say, \u201cignore 2015.\u201d\n\nMikulski, who also wrote a letter to HHS about the draft recommendations, said in a press release that the task force\u2019s latest release \u201cdiverges from a previous recommendation that women aged 40 to 74 receive an annual mammogram to screen for breast cancer.\u201d That\u2019s only true if we compare the draft recommendations to 2002.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the 2015 draft recommendations largely mirror what the task force said in 2009. The only difference is that the latest version goes into more detail on the recommendation for women 40 to 49, saying: \u201cWomen who place a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years.\u201d It continues: \u201cScreening mammography in women ages 40 to 49 years may reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer, but the number of deaths averted is much smaller than in older women and the number of false-positive tests and unnecessary biopsies are larger.\u201d It says that women with a close relative with breast cancer \u201cmay benefit more than average-risk women from beginning screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years.\u201d\n\nSo the controversy that existed in 2009 is erupting all over again. Back then, cancer groups, including the American Cancer Society and the advocacy group Susan G. Komen for the Cure, reiterated their long-term advice for women over 40 to be screened every year. Even Kathleen Sebelius, who was then the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said women should \u201ckeep doing what you have been doing for years.\u201d\n\nWender says a yearly screening for women over 40 is still the ACS\u2019 recommendation, but it is currently evaluating its guidelines, a process that will be finished later this year. \u201cWe have a lot of respect for the members of the task force,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of agreement\u201d between the ACS and the task force on this issue.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor, wrote in an April 23 op-ed in the Washington Post: \u201cI urge the USPSTF to reverse its recommendation and avoid the needless deaths that will inevitably result when women between 40 and 50 don\u2019t get mammograms, believing that the experts said it would be unnecessary.\u201d The experts \u2014 in this case the USPSTF \u2014 didn\u2019t say mammograms for women under 50 were \u201cunnecessary\u201d (though that false interpretation was pushed by an ad we debunked in 2010). Instead, as we\u2019ve explained, the USPSTF said mammography for that age group, and for women of \u201caverage\u201d risk, should be an individual choice.\n\nThe USPSTF could change the language when it makes its final recommendations, but Wender says that he thinks \u201cmost likely their final rating will be the same as the draft.\u201d What impact would that have on what insurers cover?\n\nWasserman Schultz wrote: \u201cTheir recommendations could lead to insurance companies dropping coverage of mammograms for women under age 50.\u201d But plenty of insurance plans covered mammograms for women under 50 \u2014 albeit with copays \u2014 before the ACA put into place legal requirements. Dania Palanker, senior counsel for health and reproductive rights at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told us that \u201cwe do know that issuers generally covered mammograms for women age 40 and over prior to the ACA, including after the 2009 recommendations, although most charged cost sharing as they did with other preventive services prior to the ACA.\u201d\n\nWender, who notes that the American Cancer Society knows that even small copays are enough to dissuade people from getting screenings, says he thinks few major insurance carriers would reduce their coverage even if they were no longer required to pay for mammograms without cost-sharing by policyholders. His reasoning: Those companies have already accounted for those costs.\n\nBut we can\u2019t predict the future. Lawmakers, and the Department of Health and Human Services, also could take some action, as they did in the past to follow older USPSTF recommendations when it comes to insurance coverage mandates. Mikulski, in her letter to HHS, urged the department to take \u201call appropriate action\u201d and said that if the draft recommendations become final, \u201cI will actively and aggressively pursue all legislative options available to ensure that women aged 40 and older are able to continue receiving free annual mammograms.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0ef\"", "article_summary": "We have already fact-checked false assertions about the task force\u2019s mammography recommendations in 2013 and back in 2010.\n\u201cWe have a lot of respect for the members of the task force,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of agreement\u201d between the ACS and the task force on this issue.\nInstead, Vitter\u2019s provision was meant to prevent the ACA from using the 2009 recommendations to determine insurance coverage requirements.\nDoctors, Not \u2018Bureaucrats\u2019Let\u2019s start with some background on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and what it does.\nSome associated with the task force weren\u2019t happy about its work being linked to insurance requirements in the ACA."}
