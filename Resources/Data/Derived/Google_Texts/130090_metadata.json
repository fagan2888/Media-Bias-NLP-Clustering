Drive it around for five years, get plenty of use out of it. Then one day you decide you paid way too much. You really should have paid half what you did. Or even less. So you go back to the dealership and say the car is worth less now, and you want a refund.\n\nThink you\u2019d get it?\n\nPrecisely. Yet this is just the kind of stunt the Virginia Department of Transportation is trying to pull on James and Janet Ramsey.\n\nThe Virginian-Pilot told the tale a few days ago. In 2009, VDOT took a chunk of the Ramseys\u2019 property to build an on/off ramp for I-264. Through a process called quick take, VDOT obtained title to part of their yard. The transportation agency brought in an appraiser, who estimated the value of the Ramseys\u2019 land and damages at just under a quarter-million dollars. VDOT put the money in an escrow account and moved forward with the project.\n\nThe Ramseys wanted more. The disagreement went to court and, as the trial approached, VDOT brought in another appraiser \u2014 who said the Ramseys were entitled to only around $92,000. So VDOT asked for the difference back. By then the Ramseys had withdrawn the original deposit and invested it, as they are legally entitled to do. They couldn\u2019t pay the difference back even if they wanted to, because they don\u2019t have $158,000 in spare cash lying around.\n\nMaking matters worse: The rules of evidence prohibited the Ramseys from introducing either the original state appraisal, or the state\u2019s escrow deposit, as evidence at trial. So it was their word against the state\u2019s \u2014 instead of the state\u2019s word against the state\u2019s. Late last Tuesday, a jury awarded the Ramseys $234,000 \u2014 much more than VDOT's second appraisal but still short of its first.\n\nOfficials with VDOT say this isn\u2019t intentional \u2014 the state isn\u2019t deliberately lowballing later estimates as a litigation tactic. Appraisers retire before cases get to trial. Some die. They\u2019re no longer available to give testimony \u2014 so the highway department has to bring in a new appraiser. And it\u2019s perfectly natural for two appraisers to value a property differently. That doesn\u2019t mean VDOT is putting the muscle on anyone.\n\nSome lawyers in the field beg to differ. Paul Terpak told the Pilot the state is trying to discourage landowners from going to court \u2014 and that the maneuver is unique to VDOT. \u201cI don\u2019t have this problem with any other entity,\u201d he said. He\u2019s currently representing a client who is being asked to repay more than $232,000. WAVY-TV in Virginia Beach found other examples of VDOT coming in with astoundingly lower second appraisals \u2014 such as one that went from $210,000 to $17,000 and another that dropped from $214,000 to just $14,0000.\n\nYou could say the landowners who withdraw quick-take deposits are taking a risk \u2014 that they should leave the money in escrow until all the dust from a case has settled. Prudence might counsel just such a course. On the other hand, that means VDOT gets to take a citizen\u2019s land right away, but the citizen has to wait for years to collect the compensation that\u2019s rightfully his.\n\nThere\u2019s another problem, too: Not every property owner gets to keep part of his land. Some are evicted outright. Gideon Kanner, a lawyer with more than four decades in eminent-domain law, points out that in those cases, the property owner has to use the escrow money to find another place to live: \u201cSince the owner is being displaced, the owner has to draw the money out.\u201d He or she can\u2019t afford to let it sit in an account year after year.\n\nWhen the government seizes private property, it has to meet two conditions spelled out in the Fifth Amendment: The property must be taken for public use, and the government must reimburse the owner with just compensation. Starting around the middle of the last century, the courts began to stray from the Constitution\u2019s plain language. \u201cPublic use\u201d became \u201cpublic purpose\u201d \u2014 if, say, the state wanted to condemn property to eradicate blight or break up a real-estate oligopoly.\n\nThen came the 2005 Kelo case, in which the town of New London, Conn., took private property to give it to other private interests it hoped would use the land better. The Supreme Court gave that the green light, ruling that that any ostensible future benefit to the public \u2014 such as more government revenue \u2014 qualified as a public purpose and therefore justified condemnation.\n\nAs Sandra Day O\u2019Connor noted in dissent, this new view did not \u201crealistically exclude any takings,\u201d and therefore did not \u201cexert any constraint on the eminent domain power.\u201d Earlier this month Justice Antonin Scalia, noting that the redevelopment hoped for by New London never materialized, told law students at the University of Hawaii that Kelo eventually will be overturned.\n\nIn the meantime, reaction to Kelo was ferocious. Most states \u2014 including Virginia \u2014 adopted legislation and even constitutional amendments intended to corral the power of eminent domain in the paddock where it belonged. Virginia\u2019s constitutional amendment, for example, forbids using eminent domain for private gain, private benefit, private enterprise, increasing revenue or economic development.\n\nThat was a badly needed and welcome reform. But it still addresses only part of the problem. As the Ramsey case shows, government bodies often will take private property for genuinely public uses, such as a road \u2014 and then try to stiff the owners, especially if they don\u2019t take the first offer that\u2019s put in front of them.\n\nThat happened to a beachfront property owner in Virginia Beach a couple of years ago: After a jury awarded him 38 times the amount he had been offered, the city decided it really owned the property all along.\n\nMuch the same thing happened to Wanda Beavers, who lost part of her land a few years ago to the widening of German School Road in Richmond. The state offered her less than $7,000. She asked for $30,000. The jury gave her $52,000 \u2014 and the state spent $61,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees on top of that.\n\nAlan Ackerman, a Michigan lawyer, tells the Pilot \u201ca lot of the government agencies \u2026 across the country\u201d are doing what VDOT has done \u2014 \u201clowering their offers to punish people for fighting them.\u201d\n\nGideon Kanner agrees \u2014 he tells me the practice is \u201cvery, very common.\u201d In California, where Kanner fought many such cases, it even goes by a special term: sandbagging. Kanner says it sends a powerful signal to the owner that if he doesn\u2019t settle, he runs the risk of having to cough up cash he hasn\u2019t got. Many owners choose to settle.\n\nThe battle to end eminent domain abuse won\u2019t end until this gets fixed.\n\nThis column originally appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/17/when-eminent-domain-is-just-theft", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Government bodies often will take private property for genuinely public uses, and then try to stiff the owners.", "title": "When Eminent Domain Is Just Theft"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "Say you buy a car.
