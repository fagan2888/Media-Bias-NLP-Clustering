A new study from Penn State University may have found why it\u2019s harder for some people to quit \u2014 it essentially comes down to their brains\u2019 chemistry, and willpower.\n\n\u201cWe believe that our findings may help to explain why some smokers find it so difficult to quit smoking,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Wilson, an assistant professor of psychology at the university, in a press release. \u201cNamely, potential sources of reinforcement for giving up smoking \u2014 for example, the prospect of saving money or improving health \u2014 may hold less value for some individuals and, accordingly, have less impact on their behavior.\u201d\n\nCategorized in a grey area between a disease and a behavioral condition, addiction affects the brain in complex ways. People who smoke, or take virtually any drug, allow that drug to tap into their brain\u2019s reward system. Thus, facilitating the release of dopamine and serotonin, the molecules responsible for feeling good and subsequently bringing a drug user back for more. This is evident in smokers who are most in need of a pull from their cigarettes whenever they\u2019re sad, distressed, or angry, and say that it makes them feel more calm and relaxed.\n\nBut it turns out that these may be the only times these smokers are able to have such activity in their brain\u2019s reward systems. The Penn researchers found that smokers who showed less activity in these areas, were unable to intrinsically produce such high quantities of the reward molecules. So, when given the opportunity to abstain from smoking a cigarette in return for a reward, some of them still went ahead and smoked.\n\nThe researchers discovered this with the help of functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, a kind of brain-imaging technology. For their experiment, they looked at the brains of 44 smokers, paying specific attention to the ventral striatum, where reward molecules are released and addiction is believed to be triggered. \u201cIt is the area of the brain that is important for motivation and goal-directed behavior \u2014 functions highly relevant to addiction,\u201d Wilson said in the release.\n\nAll of the participants were nicotine deprived, having not smoked a cigarette for at least 12 hours before the experiment. While they underwent brain scans, they played a card-guessing game with monetary prizes. They were also told at the beginning of the experiment that they\u2019d have to wait two hours to smoke, which was when the experiment would end. About halfway through the experiment, they were told differently, and given the opportunity to smoke during a 50-minute break that was 15 minutes away. When the time came to take the break \u2014 by this point, they were probably itching for a cigarette they thought they wouldn\u2019t get until later \u2014 they were told that for every five minutes they didn\u2019t smoke, they\u2019d get $1, with the potential to collect as much as $10.\n\nWith that, the researchers were able to see who was able to resist a cigarette and who couldn\u2019t. The fMRI scans showed that participants who exhibited less activity in their ventral striatum at the prospect of earning money were the ones more likely to go ahead and smoke. Conversely, those whose brains showed more activity were able to abstain.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that it may be possible to identify individuals prospectively by measuring how their brains respond to rewards, an observation that has significant conceptual and clinical implications,\u201d Wilson said in the release. \u201cFor example, particular \u2018at-risk\u2019 smokers could potentially be identified prior to a quit attempt and be provided with special interventions designed to increase their chances for success.\u201d\n\nWith over 393,000 Americans dying each year from smoking, any intervention may be better than none at reducing the number of smokers. Smoking doesn\u2019t only kill people but it also costs the U.S. over $193 billion in 2004 from health care expenditures and lost productivity, among other things.\n\nSource: Wilson S, Delgado M, Grigson P, et al.
