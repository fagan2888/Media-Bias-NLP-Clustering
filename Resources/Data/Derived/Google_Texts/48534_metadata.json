I can't do it.\"\n\n\n\nEach time she tried to sign up, she got the same message right at the end of the application. It tells her there is a problem with the site and to return in 24 hours. She has continued to do that since October and has had no success.\n\n\n\n\"I've memorized the whole application basically. I know exactly what they're going to ask me, so I just click, yes, yes or no, no. I know all the numbers and I could probably tell you the whole application,\" said Borgat.\n\n\n\nBorgat now worries if she and her family will ever make it in to see a doctor. It has been years.\n\n\n\n\"It's still far from seamless,\" said John Foley, a Healtcare.gov navigator.\n\n\n\nFoley said he is still hearing about problems daily.\n\n\n\nHe thinks it will be sorted out eventually, but said people who attempted to sign up before the December deadline will not be penalized.\n\n\n\n\"They need to get it fixed fast because time is running out,\" said Foley.\n\n\n\nPeople who are experiencing problems should call 1-800-318-2596. They could also go to healthcare.gov and locate their local navigator.\n\n\n\nFoley also said people should contact the insurance they have signed up with to ensure they are all on the same page.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "A new year but the same old headaches for many people trying to sign up for the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare as many call it.
