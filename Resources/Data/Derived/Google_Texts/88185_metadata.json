Getty Images\n\nChristopher Lambert doesn\u2019t really like movie awards. He is, though, on a judging panel this week at the 38th Hong Kong International Film Festival.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to have a different point of view about movies \u2014 so is it fair to give a prize to this one, that one or the other one? The only thing that matters to me is what it projects as a pure entity,\u201d the 57-year-old Frenchman said.\n\nMr. Lambert, who is most famous for playing Connor MacLeod in the \u201cHighlander\u201d movies, is judging the Young Cinema Competition at the HKIFF, along with South Korean screenwriter-director Bong Joon-ho, film historian David Bordwell of the U.S., and Hong Kong actress Karena Lam.\n\nThe competition features eight movies by filmmakers from around the world. The winner will be announced on Saturday after the jury meets for deliberation. Mr. Lambert had seen six of the movies by the time we met on the 18th floor of the Sheraton in Kowloon on Thursday. He ordered a diet Coke. I had water. In hindsight, we didn\u2019t make the most of that wine lounge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some really interesting stuff on a sensitive level, something that can touch and really move you. \u2026 They all have something to say,\u201d Mr. Lambert said, adding that an Austrian-Slovakian coproduction was particularly powerful. \u201cIt will be interesting to see what everybody else in the jury has to say. Eight movies will take a few hours to discuss.\u201d\n\nFans wait for actors at the Hong Kong Film Festival, March 25. Getty Images\n\nMr. Lambert has a broad taste in cinema, praising movies such as \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\u201d \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d and \u201cA Separation.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what the genre is, he said: \u201cIt could be action, it could be anything \u2014 the power of the movie business is to draw emotion from the audience, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nHe said three directors \u2014 John Woo, Wong Kar-wai and Johnnie To \u2014 helped him discover Chinese-language cinema in a very powerful way. \u201cI\u2019ve been a great fan of John Woo for a long time; he does exactly my type of movie \u2014 a combination of action and feelings. Johnnie To is a master also, such a range. He can do extreme violence and then move to something totally different. Wong Kar-wai, too, in a different vision.\u201d\n\nMr. Lambert spends his time between Los Angeles, Switzerland and Paris. There is a movie festival around 250 miles southeast of the French capital that seems to suit Mr. Lambert\u2019s taste. \u201cThere is a festival in Lyon where it\u2019s just a feast. Actors, producers and directors are mixed within the audience. There\u2019s no judgment, there\u2019s no prize \u2014 it\u2019s only happiness, about enjoying watching the movies.\u201d\n\nHe has his hands full with work. On the acting side, Mr. Lambert will next be seen in the movie \u201cElectric Slide,\u201d which will have its world premiere at this month\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival. Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Jim Sturgess and Patricia Arquette also star in the film, which is directed by Tristan Patterson, the man behind 2011 documentary \u201cDragonslayer.\u201d\n\nChristopher Lambert and Sophie Marceau at Paris Fashion Week on Jan. 21. Getty Images\n\nMr. Lambert last year appeared in the French television series \u201cLa Source\u201d as well as several episodes of \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles.\u201d He is impressed by high-powered TV drama series like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d with Kevin Spacey. \u201cIt is very, very clever \u2014 a constant manipulation of the audience.\u201d\n\nHe says he is producing a couple of French films and directing an American movie \u2014 a love story called \u201cAll We Have Is Now.\u201d\n\nGood, imaginative scripts are more important now than ever, he said. \u201cIn France, we\u2019ve been doing over and over the same romantic comedies. Very few of them work because people have seen them for the past five, six, seven, 10 years. It\u2019s like in music, you only have seven notes, so it is difficult to suddenly come up with the greatest tune of the year or of the decade.\u201d\n\nI ask what his favorite movie was from last year. After a pause, he said, \u201cDallas Buyers Club,\u201d for which Matthew McConaughey won the best-actor Oscar. But, he said, Leonardo DiCaprio should have won for his performance in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors, but the guy who is holding up that movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. \u2026 He\u2019s an amazing actor. He should have won, in my point of view, because the performance is so incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying the other guy, Matthew McConaughey, shouldn\u2019t have won. That\u2019s where it becomes difficult, McConaughey should\u2019ve won as much as DiCaprio. \u2026 Maybe they should\u2019ve shared it. But you can\u2019t do that,\u201d he added, laughing.\n\nOh this judging business.\n\nFollow WSJ Asia on Twitter @WSJAsia.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Christopher Lambert, movie producer and star of 'Highlander,' talks about the Hong Kong International Film Festival, his favorite films, and why Leonardo di Caprio should have won an Oscar.", "title": "Christopher Lambert: The Trouble with Judging Movies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2014/04/04/christopher-lambert-the-trouble-with-judging-movies/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CF571_lamber_P_20140404054543.jpg"}, "site": "WSJAsia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Life and Style", "article.headline": "Christopher Lambert: The Trouble with Judging Movies", "description": "Christopher Lambert, movie producer and star of 'Highlander,' talks about the Hong Kong International Film Festival, his favorite films, and why Leonardo di Caprio should have won an Oscar.", "article_section": "Life and Style", "author": "Will Davies", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Scene Asia Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Scene Asia", "article.summary": "Christopher Lambert, movie producer and star of 'Highlander,' talks about the Hong Kong International Film Festival, his favorite films, and why Leonardo di Caprio should have won an Oscar.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-04-04T10:05:14-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2014/04/04/christopher-lambert-the-trouble-with-judging-movies/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SJB-14032", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Life and Style", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Christopher Lambert, movie producer and star of 'Highlander,' talks about the Hong Kong International Film Festival, his favorite films, and why Leonardo di Caprio should have won an Oscar.", "title": "Christopher Lambert: The Trouble with Judging Movies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2014/04/04/christopher-lambert-the-trouble-with-judging-movies/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CF571_lamber_P_20140404054543.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Scene Asia", "article.id": "BL-SJB-14032", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-05T10:57:13-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05e5\"", "article_summary": "He is, though, on a judging panel this week at the 38th Hong Kong International Film Festival.\n\u2026 They all have something to say,\u201d Mr. Lambert said, adding that an Austrian-Slovakian coproduction was particularly powerful.\nMr. Lambert had seen six of the movies by the time we met on the 18th floor of the Sheraton in Kowloon on Thursday.\nChristopher Lambert at the Venice Film Festival in 2009.\nEight movies will take a few hours to discuss.\u201dFans wait for actors at the Hong Kong Film Festival, March 25."}
