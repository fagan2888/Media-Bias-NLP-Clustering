In 2007 he was wrongly accused of murdering Miller and Jackson.\n\nREAD: Newly-Released Search Warrant Affidavits For Lykken Farm\n\nThe documents released Friday say investigators interviewed up to nine of Lykken\u2019s ex-girlfriends and victims who accused Lykken of stalking, physical abuse and several sexual assaults. Most also said he would be capable of murder. One of them had recollections that she saw Miller and Jackson and their Studebaker on the Lykken farm.\n\nA woman referred to as Victim #6 was interviewed twice before the initial search of the Lykken farm in August of 2004. She told authorities she not only saw the Studebaker but saw, 'Cheryl lying over the steering wheel...and Pam with her head on the passenger window.'\n\nVictim #6 was interviewed a third time in October 2004 by a state-hired psychologist while under hypnosis and recalled even more details. She even said she believed Miller and Jackson were ground up and fed to the cattle at the Lykken farm.\n\nThe documents also say state agents got other tips about the Lykken family including one tip from the former secretary of the old Union County Sheriff. She said the former sheriff confronted David Lykken's father about the disappearance just a few days after the girls were reported missing in 1971. She said the former sheriff thought the Lykkens might have something to do with the case but never had enough evidence.\n\nBut last September, when the remains of the girls and the Studebaker were pulled out of Brule Creek, it showed that all of those tips simply led investigators down the wrong path.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "A decade-old South Dakota court file was opened for the first time Friday.
