Matt Cartwright, of Moosic, who was running unopposed for the Democratic nomination on Tuesday.\n\nConnolly ran in 2014 for the Republican nomination, losing the primary to Dr. David \u201cDoc\u201d Moylan, who lost to Cartwright in the general election.\n\nConnolly has said he is running because he doesn\u2019t like the changes he has seen in the country in recent years.\n\n\u201cGovernment is too intrusive,\u201d Connolly told the Times Leader Opinion Board earlier this month. \u201cThere are too many regulations/taxes that are driving jobs overseas, while wages in the U.S. have not increased.\u201d\n\nHe said President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 also labeled \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 has caused many people to work two jobs and does not give people a choice of health care.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to change this,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis can\u2019t be allowed to stand.\u201d\n\nConnolly is anti-abortion and is running \u201c100 percent pro-family, pro-traditional marriage, and pro-Second Amendment,\u201d according to his website.\n\nIf elected, Connolly said, he would work to repeal Obamacare and decrease insurance premiums across the board. He also would work to reduce welfare benefits and to make working a requirement for receipt of those benefits. And, he said, he is pro-pipeline and would work to make the United States \u201cenergy independent.\u201d\n\nCartwright likely will be standing on his record when he faces Connolly in November.\n\nHis website touts his introduction of a leading-number of pieces of legislation, the majority of which have been introduced with bipartisan support. He has introduced bills that have proposed expanded rights and benefits for veterans, seniors, consumers and college students, according to his official website.\n\nCartwright\u2019s legislative portfolio has also focused heavily on protecting the environment from exemptions and loopholes in fundamental environmental protections statutes and promoting equity for wage-grade federal workers at federal installations like VA hospitals, federal prisons and military depots, according to his website.\n\nThe 17th district includes all of Schuylkill County and parts of Carbon, Luzerne, Lackawanna, Monroe and Northampton counties. Major locations in the district include Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Tobyhanna, Bangor, Easton and Pottsville.\n\nThe primary races in the 11th Congressional District on Tuesday were uncontested.\n\nFormer Hazleton Mayor Mike Marsicano was the sole Democrat on the ballot and will seek to unseat U.S. Rep Lou Barletta, also a former mayor of Hazleton, in November. Barletta was unopposed for the Republican nomination.\n\nThe 11th Congressional District is comprised of all of Columbia, Montour and Wyoming counties and parts of Carbon, Cumberland, Dauphin, Luzerne, Northumberland and Perry counties. Major locations in the district include Harrisburg, Sunbury, Carlisle, Tunkhannock, Hazleton, Bloomsburg and Danville.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to the report.\n\nCartwright http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Cartwright_Matt-2.jpg Cartwright Barletta http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Barletta_Lou_2-4.jpg Barletta Marsicano http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Marsicano_Mike_mug-2.jpg Marsicano Geissinger http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Geissinger_Glenn-2.jpg Geissinger Connolly http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Connolly_Matt-2.jpg Connolly\n\nBy Steve Mocarsky [email protected]\n\nCongress 17th District Republican Matt Connolly \u2013 64%\n\nGlenn Geissinger \u2013 36%\n\nReach Steve Mocarsky at 570-991-6386 or on Twitter @TLSteveMocarsky.\n\nReach Steve Mocarsky at 570-991-6386 or on Twitter @TLSteveMocarsky.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-PA", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Wilkes-Barre", "og": {"site_name": "Times Leader", "description": "It appears that Bethlehem Township resident Matt Connolly easily snagged the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 17th Congressional District.As of 11 p.m. Tuesday, Connolly had snapped up 64 percent of the vote compared to challenger Glenn Geisinger\u2019s 36 percent, with 212 of 443 precincts reporting, according to the Associated Press.Both [...]", "title": "Connolly takes 17th Congressional District by a landslide, will face Cartwright in November", "url": "http://timesleader.com/news/local/535771/connolly-takes-17th-congressional-district-by-a-landslide-will-face-cartwright-in-november", "image": "http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Barletta_Lou_2-2-250x300.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"image": "http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Connolly_Matt-2.jpg", "site": "@TLNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Times Leader - timesleader.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Times Leader", "DC.publisher": "Times Leader", "DC.identifier": "http://timesleader.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "DC.language": "en_US", "article": {"section": "Local", "tag": "PAPrimary2016", "published_time": "2016-04-26T23:12:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:51:50+00:00", "author": "http://timesleader.com/author/englewoodindependent"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre PA - www.timesleader.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce40d\"", "article_summary": "More Info: Congress 17th District Republican Matt Connolly - 64%Glenn Geissinger - 36%It appears that Bethlehem Township resident Matt Connolly easily snagged the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 17th Congressional District.\nCartwright http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Cartwright_Matt-2.jpg Cartwright Barletta http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Barletta_Lou_2-4.jpg Barletta Marsicano http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Marsicano_Mike_mug-2.jpg Marsicano Geissinger http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Geissinger_Glenn-2.jpg Geissinger Connolly http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Connolly_Matt-2.jpg ConnollyBy Steve Mocarsky [email protected]Congress 17th District Republican Matt Connolly \u2013 64%Glenn Geissinger \u2013 36%Reach Steve Mocarsky at 570-991-6386 or on Twitter @TLSteveMocarsky.\nThe 17th district includes all of Schuylkill County and parts of Carbon, Luzerne, Lackawanna, Monroe and Northampton counties.\nConnolly ran in 2014 for the Republican nomination, losing the primary to Dr. David \u201cDoc\u201d Moylan, who lost to Cartwright in the general election.\nConnolly has said he is running because he doesn\u2019t like the changes he has seen in the country in recent years."}
