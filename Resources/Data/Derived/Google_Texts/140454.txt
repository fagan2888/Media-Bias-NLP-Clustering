Donald Trump will return on Monday, headlining a rally at Valdosta State University.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich spent Tuesday at Kennesaw State University.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made a stop in Atlanta Friday, talking with supporters at the state Capitol.

Hundreds in attendance heard Clinton say she wants to increase the minimum wage and expand the Affordable Care Act.

“And make sure the progress President Obama has made is secure, is defended and we go even further, because he has built a good foundation for us to stand on,” she said.

Clinton also said she wants to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of Americans reaching their potential.

“And I think it’s way past time for us to guarantee equal pay for woman’s work, don’t you think?” she said.

Channel 2 Action News visited her Georgia campaign headquarters in southwest Atlanta where volunteers worked the phones encouraging people to vote.

"If they're not going to early vote, we’re asking them to come out for Super Tuesday and definitely make sure they get out and vote,” said volunteer Yvonne Gamble.

Senator Bernie Sanders spent Thursday in Flint, Michigan, where residents are facing a water crisis.
