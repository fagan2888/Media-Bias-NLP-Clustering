John Cornyn, R-Texas., during a Senate Finance Committee hearing. It was the second time in a week Sebelius was on Capitol Hill, forced to defend the problem-plagued ObamaCare website.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background check,\u201d Cornyn asked her.\n\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d Sebelius answered. \u201cStates could add in additional background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement.\u201d\n\nCornyn pressed, \u201cSo a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual unbeknownst to them?\u201d\n\nSebelius answered, \u201cThis is possible.\u201d\n\nThe nearly three-hour hearing had Sebelius once again shouldering much of the blame for the rocky rollout of the ACA, commonly referred to as ObamaCare. Last week she testified before a House panel on the growing concerns about President Obama\u2019s landmark legislation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sebelius also acknowledged that the early enrollment figures for ObamaCare scheduled to be released next week will be \u201cvery low.\u201d\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, demanded monthly progress reports from her.\n\n\u201cNo more excuses,\u201d Hatch told her. \u201cNo more spin, just give us the truth.\u201d\n\nDuring her opening statement Sebelius said, \u201ca number of fixes have already been completed\u201d to the glitch-ridden website HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, the tech team put into place enhanced monitoring tools for HealthCare.gov, enabling us to get a high-level picture of the marketplace application responding, and to measure how changes improve user experience on the site.\u201d\n\nOn the panel is Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who was one of the architects of the 2010 law.\n\nUntil now, Baucus has been a very vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act, but even he has had his share of doubt in recent days over the HealthCare.gov site.\n\nSpecifically, Baucus has a problem with security testing of the site that could potentially expose millions of Americans to cyberfraud or identity theft.\n\nDocuments have surfaced that seem to indicate Obama administration officials cut corners on security testing while rushing to meet a self-imposed Oct. 1 deadline to launch online health insurance markets.\n\nThe administration has been struggling in recent days to knock back a wave of criticism that has been mounting since the rollout.\n\nWhile the White House has promised the site would be up and glitch-free by Nov. 30, Baucus challenged Sebelius to beat the deadline.\n\n\u201cYou said recently that you expect the website to be running smoothly for a majority of users by late November,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no room for error. You must meet -- and I prefer you beat -- that deadline.\u201d\n\nThe last time Sebelius testified before a House committee, she fell on the sword, personally apologizing for the failures.\n\n\u201cHold me accountable for the debacle,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m responsible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-12-17 12:40:36 EST", "dcterms.abstract":
