Kansas lawmakers plan to discuss two marijuana bills when the Legislature reconvenes April 27. The GOP-dominated legislature is considering ways to lessen the impact of marijuana offenses on the state's prison population and offer medical hemp treatment to some patients.

One bill under consideration would lessen penalties for first- and second-time marijuana possession. Another proposal being discussed would allow cannabis oil to be used to treat seizures.

Sixteen states allow the use of oil from the cannabis plant as a medical treatment. The oil would offer the benefit of medical treatment without the high.
