The end of the year is a busy time for insurance agencies, especially involving medical insurance.



Many deductibles will start over at the beginning of the year, so lots of people are squeezing in doctors visits before January 1st.



There are also other matters to consider, like open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, for example.



Talking with an expert may help.



"Whether it's your taxes, you want to have a good accountant. Whether you're buying a home, you want to have a good realtor. If you get sick, you want to have a really good doctor. Insurance is not much different than that," explained The Insurance Center Sales Manager Jeff LeClaire.



LeClaire said he sees people make common mistakes when it comes to insurance. He said many people don't plan for emergency coverage or use the emergency room for non-life threatening situations. They also fail to shop around for the best rates.



"The most common mistake would not be understanding what they have. There's a lot of questions that come up after a claim versus prior to. A lot of times, they take the insurance at face value, but don't actually look into what it does cover or it doesn't cover."
