Overall mortality declined by 45 percent, even with no decrease in the severity of illness. ICU length of stay fell 26 percent, and transfers from intermediate care to intensive care dropped by 67 percent. The study estimated annual cost savings of $2.29 million based on average ICU rates of $2,500 per day.\n\nThe study credited collaboration between the emergency department and ICU to lower the ICU admission thresholds and standardize ICU admission criteria for patients with sepsis.\n\n\"Although ICU level of care is costly, earlier inclusion of borderline patients may improve mortality,\" lead researcher Joseph Carrington, M.D., said in a study announcement. \"It may also significantly decrease resource utilization, as our study found.\"\n\nThe findings could have a profound impact for hospitals, as sepsis is a major driver in hospital mortality and readmission rates.\n\nThe infection contributes to roughly half of all U.S. hospital deaths despite being present in only 1 in 10 patients, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Sepsis accounts for as many readmissions and deaths as heart attacks and congestive heart failure, both of which are monitored closely under the Affordable Care Act. It also costs twice as much to treat as the other two combined, research has shown.\n\nPart of the problem may be that the blood infection doesn't fall cleanly under a typical hospital department such as cardiology or respiratory care. \"No one really owns\" treatment of the condition, Martin Doerfler, M.D., senior vice president of clinical strategy and development at New York's North Shore-LIJ Health System, previously told FierceHealthcare.\n\nA separate study also found that collaboration between the ED and ICU improved mortality rates among patients with sepsis. In that study, Kennedy Health System in New Jersey followed an evidence-based care model to implement new processes across the hospital to use in detecting and treating sepsis.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSepsis contributes to half of hospital deaths\n\nSepsis major driver of readmissions, mortality and costs\n\nThe sepsis threat: Why it's more 'insidious' than other conditions\n\nEvidence-based care, culture change reduced sepsis, complications at NJ hospital\n\nCritics complain proposed sepsis reporting rules could lead to overtreatment\n\nResearchers use data for early sepsis detection", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lowering the threshold for admitting sepsis patients to the ICU from the emergency department lowers mortality, lengths of ICU stays and transfers from intermediate care to intensive care, according to new research.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Lowering the threshold for admitting sepsis patients to the ICU from the emergency department lowers mortality, lengths of ICU stays and transfers from intermediate care to intensive care, according to new research.", "title": "Emergency room-ICU collaboration key to better sepsis outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/emergency-room-icu-collaboration-key-better-sepsis-outcomes/2015-10-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,emergency department,Intensive Care Unit,Patient Care & Outcomes,Sepsis,sepsis mortality rates", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The study credited collaboration between the emergency department and ICU to lower the ICU admission thresholds and standardize ICU admission criteria for patients with sepsis.\nThe findings could have a profound impact for hospitals, as sepsis is a major driver in hospital mortality and readmission rates.\nA separate study also found that collaboration between the ED and ICU improved mortality rates among patients with sepsis.\nLowering the threshold for admitting sepsis patients to the ICU from the emergency department lowers mortality, lengths of ICU stays and transfers from intermediate care to intensive care, according to new research.\nPart of the problem may be that the blood infection doesn't fall cleanly under a typical hospital department such as cardiology or respiratory care."}
