The proposed legislation would prohibit the use of federal funds for any support of abortion in the United States.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, the Hyde Amendment has been added to federal appropriations bills in order to prevent federal funds from being used for most abortions. However, pro-life politicians argue that it has been implemented inconsistently and note that it does allowing funding of abortion in limited cases.\n\nMost recently, controversy has arisen over fungible federal funding of organizations that perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, as well as health-care plans purchased under the Affordable Care Act that cover abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s 2012-2013 fiscal report has drawn criticism from the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, which issued an analysis charging that the organization received $540.6 million in taxpayer funding, reporting $58.2 million in excess revenue and more than $1.3 billion in net assets.\n\nIn 2012, Planned Parenthood performed 327,166 abortions, bringing the total number of abortions performed by the organization to nearly 1 million between 2010 and 2012.\n\nIn addition, the Susan B. Anthony List said, abortions composed 93.8% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s pregnancy services during the 2012-2013 fiscal year, while prenatal care and adoption comprised only 5.6% of these services \u2014 a 32% drop from the 2011-2011 fiscal year.\n\nDoerflinger also argued that several sections of the Affordable Care Act bypass the Hyde Amendment in appropriating their own funds for plans covering abortions.\n\n\u201cAmericans are finding it difficult to find a plan without abortion coverage or even to get clear answers as to which plans those are,\u201d he said, adding that many families \u201cmay be forced by the government to subsidize other people\u2019s abortions as a condition for obtaining the health care their families need.\u201d\n\nPassing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, he underscored, \u201cwould prevent problems and confusions on abortion funding in future legislation,\u201d allowing bills to be \u201cdebated in terms of their ability to promote the goal of universal health care, instead of being mired in debates\u201d surrounding abortion.\n\nDoerflinger also addressed concerns that the bill would challenge \u201cprivate coverage for abortion.\u201d Based purely on fiscal calculation, \u201cinsurance companies have an economic incentive to include abortion coverage, and they do it,\u201d he observed. Unfortunately, he said, \u201cabortion is cheaper than a live baby.\u201d\n\nAlvare asserted that, given current research and legal decisions, \u201cabortion is not part of any women\u2019s health agenda\u201d and should not be covered as health care.\n\nShe pointed to instances in which prominent abortion advocates have acknowledged abortion to be a \u201cgruesome\u201d procedure that ends a human life.\n\nIn addition, she observed, European studies on hundreds of thousands of women are finding links between abortion and various health issues, challenging the appropriateness of classifying abortion as a \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d procedure.\n\nFurthermore, Alvare said, polls indicate that women are \u201cmore pro-life than men,\u201d and \u201cthe poor are more pro-life than the wealthy.\u201d\n\nThis means that \u201cthe well-off support abortion funding for the poor more than the poor support abortion funding for themselves,\u201d she explained, pointing out that \u201crefusing to fund something is not doing away with something,\u201d and prohibiting federal funding of abortion is not dismantling the procedure in the country.\n\nAlvare said that, when negative health risks are considered alongside the poor\u2019s opposition to abortion funding, it becomes apparent that banning federal funding of abortion would \u201cserve women\u201d and allow for a greater focus on the issues that matter most to women.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A House subcommittee addressed the proposed No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "A House subcommittee addressed the proposed No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would prohibit federal funds for support of abort...", "title": "Federal Abortion Funding Harms Women, Experts Tell Congress", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/federal-abortion-funding-harms-women-experts-tell-congress/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/Helen_Alvare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/federal-abortion-funding-harms-women-experts-tell-congress/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/Helen_Alvare.jpg", "description": "A House subcommittee addressed the proposed No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would prohibit federal funds for support of abort...", "card": "summary", "title": "Federal Abortion Funding Harms Women, Experts Tell Congress"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4bb\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A proposed law blocking federal funding of abortion would be a big step towards \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d and a true \u201cwomen\u2019s agenda,\u201d experts told members of Congress at a recent hearing.\nAlvare said that, when negative health risks are considered alongside the poor\u2019s opposition to abortion funding, it becomes apparent that banning federal funding of abortion would \u201cserve women\u201d and allow for a greater focus on the issues that matter most to women.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time once and for all to settle the matter of abortion funding across federal legislation and move on to a real women\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Helen Alvare, law professor at George Mason University.\nIn addition, she observed, European studies on hundreds of thousands of women are finding links between abortion and various health issues, challenging the appropriateness of classifying abortion as a \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d procedure.\nHowever, pro-life politicians argue that it has been implemented inconsistently and note that it does allowing funding of abortion in limited cases."}
