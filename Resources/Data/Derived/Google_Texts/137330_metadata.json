It came to $63 per covered person in 2014 and $44 for each person in 2015. The money is used primarily to fund a temporary financial pool that protects insurance companies issuing individual policies in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, marketplace. Insurers can tap into the reinsurance fund when they have to pay out particularly high medical claims.\n\nThis is one of several fees or taxes that Democrats in Congress built into the new health insurance system in an effort to start the new market -- targeted to individuals and families that lacked workplace coverage -- on sound financial footing. The reinsurance fee was designed to get the system started and to phase out after 2016.\n\nBut state employers, cities and public universities had to pay the fee too if they insured their employees under group plans. | Read Stephen Koff's story\n\nAngela Stokes is out and Gov.
