(Photo: Brian Powers/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nIf ever there was any doubt as to the absurd nature of Iowa\u2019s new law on cannabis oil, that doubt can now be put to rest.\n\nSo far, the state\u2019s new cannabis-oil authorization program has spent more than $100,000 to create and issue registration cards, indicating the bearer is authorized to possess the oil, to about 50 people. That translates to an average of $2,000 per card.\n\nThis expense, and the amount of bureaucratic red-tape in acquiring a card, would be excusable if the cards had any real value.\n\nUnfortunately, these cards are an outgrowth of a new state law that only in theory allows people with severe epilepsy to legally use doctor-approved cannabis oil. Practically speaking, this new law conflicts with a longstanding state law that makes it illegal to manufacture or distribute cannabis oil in Iowa, and with a largely unenforced federal law that bars its transport across state lines.\n\nSo what is a patient to do?\n\nThose in border areas simply travel to other states, despite laws that require purchasers to show evidence of in-state residency.\n\nThen there\u2019s Jennifer McFadden of Dubuque, who obtained a cannabis-oil card to facilitate the treatment of her 12-year-old epileptic son, Liam.\n\nMcFadden has found a Colorado company that\u2019s willing to send her the oil, but the federally regulated care facility where Liam lives can\u2019t allow the oil inside. As a result, McFadden takes Liam to the facility\u2019s parking lot twice each day, rain or shine, administers the cannabis oil, and then brings him back into the facility.\n\nThis is the direct result of the Iowa Legislature\u2019s nonsensical approach to cannabis oil.\n\nSadly, things aren\u2019t expected to change anytime soon. In fact, Republican Rep. Clel Baudler says the new law isn\u2019t likely to be tinkered with next year since it represents something of a compromise between opponents of any form of legalized cannabis and those who favor a much less regulated approach.\n\n\u201cSo I think we\u2019ll stay right where we\u2019re at,\u201d he says.\n\nThat stance might make sense if the new law didn\u2019t represent the worst of all possible worlds: It has created a program that is both ineffective and costly.\n\nUsually, when the Iowa Legislature fouls its nest, it does so by passing a bill that either creates bad public policy or needlessly increases state spending. In this instance, our industrious lawmakers somehow managed to do both.\n\nWhen Gov. Terry Branstad signed the legislation, he said it signified the work of \u201cpeople talking to their legislators and to their governor about important issues to them, to their families and to their children.\u201d\n\nBut the bill also illustrates the unwillingness of lawmakers and the governor to listen to those people when they\u2019re talking. Advocates had repeatedly warned state officials the bill they were contemplating would do very little for Iowa families, since they would still face all of the medical, legal, financial and practical hurdles of obtaining and administering the drug.\n\nIf our elected leaders are sincere in their desire to help Iowa families, they need to pass a law that allows for the distribution \u2014 not just the possession \u2014 of cannabis oil for medical purposes. Other states, including Illinois, have taken this common-sense path. Iowa needs to do so, as well.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1SyH1dN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lawmakers must help families, fix costly, ineffective law", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Lawmakers must help families, fix costly, ineffective law", "title": "The Register's Editorial: Law creates cannabis oil craziness", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/08/02/editorial-law-creates-cannabis-oil-craziness/31020835/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers must help families, fix costly, ineffective law", "title": "The Register's Editorial: Law creates cannabis oil craziness", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a46e612c9e0311c28b6bd0b2bee2cd94d227e62/c=514-0-1847-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Epilepsy", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Epilepsy", "title": "The Register's Editorial: Law creates cannabis oil craziness", "author": "The Register's editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/588d56b735066e692c58352c3d5adc6797c04a18/c=973-0-1973-1333/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa1f4447a82e6c4b4568d1c2cab33d9f20f7db93/c=514-0-1847-1333/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d0720ef9745ce7895417f2ee1588fda387d07107/c=32-0-1805-1333/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f18f13127bc0b7b9acc9c6216e581f76ac6c1df/c=0-102-2000-1232&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-08-02T22:16:54.463000-05:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Law creates cannabis oil craziness", "articleid": 31020835, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/84de89d94c58e3446288642c313aba4eab6b8f24/c=0-102-2000-1232/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b933fa0b8e63269dda9240c164cfb3c6845e59eb/c=1106-0-1852-1333/local/-/media/2015/07/11/IAGroup/DesMoines/635722372850160174-20150709-cannabisoil-bp-02.JPG"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcceea\"", "article_summary": "Practically speaking, this new law conflicts with a longstanding state law that makes it illegal to manufacture or distribute cannabis oil in Iowa, and with a largely unenforced federal law that bars its transport across state lines.\nUnfortunately, these cards are an outgrowth of a new state law that only in theory allows people with severe epilepsy to legally use doctor-approved cannabis oil.\n(Photo: Brian Powers/The Register)Buy PhotoIf ever there was any doubt as to the absurd nature of Iowa\u2019s new law on cannabis oil, that doubt can now be put to rest.\nAs a result, McFadden takes Liam to the facility\u2019s parking lot twice each day, rain or shine, administers the cannabis oil, and then brings him back into the facility.\nThis is the direct result of the Iowa Legislature\u2019s nonsensical approach to cannabis oil."}
