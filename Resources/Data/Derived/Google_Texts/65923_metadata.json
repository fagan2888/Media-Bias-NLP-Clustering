But a pile of sockeye salmon changed all that on Saturday August 23, when a First Nations fisherman donated 500 of the fish to organizations and a homeless encampment in the downtrodden neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time for a lot of those people to have salmon in East Vancouver and a lot of those people are First Nations,\u201d said Joshua Duncan, a commercial fisherman with R.A. Roberts Fishing Ltd. in Campbell River, to The Province. \u201cI was doing this as a gesture to people who really would like and appreciate the fish, and are trying to make a stand for themselves in their small part of the world.\u201d\n\nThe encampment holds 150 people who have been living in Vancouver\u2019s Oppenheimer Park for weeks to protest the city\u2019s dearth of affordable housing. Friendship centers and women\u2019s centers in East Vancouver also received fish, The Province reported.\n\nRecipients were moved.\n\n\"Bless that man's heart. What a glorious day for the people of Oppenheimer Park,\" said Karen Clark, who has been homeless for two years after fleeing an abusive relationship, to APTN News. \u201cThis is going to bring what we commonly refer to as the inside circle and the outside circle together, finally, with a feast of fish given by a man\u2014obviously a humble man\u2014who wants nothing more than to see us fed and happy and family and housed.\"\n\nThe fish donation project started when Tlatlasikwala First Nation Hereditary Chief John Wallace put out a call on Facebook for donations, APTN reported. Duncan, who has fished for the past 15 years on a boat owned by another hereditary chief, Tony Roberts Sr, heeded.\n\n\u201cWe just like to say pay it forward to the people who don't have access and I'm sure haven't had a fresh salmon in a very long time,\u201d Duncan told APTN. \u201cWe're just happy to help out whatever little bit we can, and there\u2019s enough fish to go around.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside is known as one of the poorest areas of one of British Columbia\u2019s best-known cities, its reputation one of forgotten souls.Aboriginal fishermen give back and donate part of record sockeye salmon run to homeless on Vancouver Downtown Eastside.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/28/first-nations-fisherman-donates-500-sockeye-vancouver-homeless-156645", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/salmon_donation-aptn_news.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "First Nations Fisherman Donates 500 Sockeye to Vancouver Homeless"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-28T17:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "First Nations Fisherman Donates 500 Sockeye to Vancouver Homeless"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/28/first-nations-fisherman-donates-500-sockeye-vancouver-homeless-156645", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Philanthropy, Sockeye, Vancouver, First Nations, Charity, Homeless, Homelessness, Native American Homelessness, Native American Homeless", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.title": "First Nations Fisherman Donates 500 Sockeye to Vancouver Homeless"}, "article_summary": "But a pile of sockeye salmon changed all that on Saturday August 23, when a First Nations fisherman donated 500 of the fish to organizations and a homeless encampment in the downtrodden neighborhood.\nWhat a glorious day for the people of Oppenheimer Park,\" said Karen Clark, who has been homeless for two years after fleeing an abusive relationship, to APTN News.\nFriendship centers and women\u2019s centers in East Vancouver also received fish, The Province reported.\n\u201cWe're just happy to help out whatever little bit we can, and there\u2019s enough fish to go around.\"\nDuncan, who has fished for the past 15 years on a boat owned by another hereditary chief, Tony Roberts Sr, heeded."}
