EDITOR: Are you ready to vote? Judging by the headlines, you might think the only election this year is to name President Obama’s successor. In fact there will be four important elections in Wisconsin in 2016.

■In the Feb. 16 primary, voters will select the two top candidates for Wisconsin Supreme Court as well as any local and county races with more than two contenders. Voters in Wisconsin Rapids will select the top two candidates in the mayoral race.

■On April 5, we will elect the final winner for those contests and also vote for our favorite presidential candidate to be the nominee of his/her party.

■The Aug. 9 partisan primary election will be held for U.S. Congress and the Wisconsin Legislature. In districts that are heavily Democratic or Republican, the primary election is particularly decisive.

■On Nov. 8, we will elect the next president along with our state and federal representatives.

Now is the time to get ready to vote. If you have not voted in Wisconsin before, or if your registration has lapsed, you will need to register. If you have a Wisconsin driver’s license or state ID card, you will have to provide that number. You will also need proof of residence.

Once you are registered, you will need a photo ID when you vote. If you have a Wisconsin driver’s license or state ID with an expiration date of Nov. 4, 2014 or later, you are all set. For more information, contact your municipal clerk or go to the Wisconsin voter information website at myvote.wi.gov.
