Contrary to the New York Post\u2019s initial report, Tencher said, Weiner will not advise clients but will serve on its advisory board.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAnthony Weiner\u2019s primary role at MWW will be as a part time consultant primarily focused on policy and new business development. He will not be serving clients directly, but rather serving as an advisor to our leadership team,\u201d Tencher wrote in an email to POLITICO.\n\nMichael Kempner, the founder and leader of the company, is one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s so-called Hillblazers, or top campaign bundlers, raising more than $100,000 for her presidential campaign since her April announcement. He was also one of Clinton\u2019s top 2008 bundlers.\n\nWeiner\u2019s wife, Huma Abedin, is a longtime Clinton confidante who served as a top adviser to the secretary of state during her time at Foggy Bottom and continues to play a prominent role in her latest campaign.\n\nMWW told the Post that it is \u201cpleased to welcome\u201d Weiner to its \u201cboard of advisers,\u201d where he will advise on issues related to Congress and New York politics.\n\n\u201cHe is a brilliant strategist [with] expertise on many issues,\u201d the company told the Post.\n\nWeiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after tweeting a photo of his penis from his public Twitter account, ostensibly meant to be a direct message to a female college student. He admitted to exchanging \u201cmessages and photos of an explicit nature over the last three years\u201d over the phone, email and social media with \u201cabout six women over the last three years.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Weiner became embroiled in a separate scandal when he ran for mayor of New York City. Gossip website The Dirty published more pictures and sexts, allegedly from Weiner under the alias \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d to a 22-year-old woman later reported to be Sydney Leathers. He finished with just 4.9 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary.\n\nThis article has been corrected to reflect that MWW is based in New York.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Kat Borgerding @ 07/23/2015 11:11 AM CORRECTION: This article has been corrected to reflect that MWW is based in New York.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Weiner will advise clients at the PR firm MWW, according to a report from the New York Post on Thursday.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Weiner will advise clients at the PR firm MWW, according to a report from the New York Post on Thursday.", "title": "Anthony Weiner joins crisis PR firm", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/anthony-weiner-new-job-public-relations-120524.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Congress,Public Relations,Anthony Weiner,Politics,Scandals,Business", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NickGassReports"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Anthony Weiner joins crisis PR firmA crisis communications firm has enlisted the services of none other than Anthony Weiner, the former Democratic lawmaker whose well-documented sexting scandals sank his once-promising political career.\nWeiner will serve on the advisory board at the New York-based PR firm MWW, the firm\u2019s D.C. managing director, Paul Tencher, confirmed to POLITICO on Thursday.\nContrary to the New York Post\u2019s initial report, Tencher said, Weiner will not advise clients but will serve on its advisory board.\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Kat Borgerding @ 07/23/2015 11:11 AM CORRECTION: This article has been corrected to reflect that MWW is based in New York.\nMWW told the Post that it is \u201cpleased to welcome\u201d Weiner to its \u201cboard of advisers,\u201d where he will advise on issues related to Congress and New York politics."}
