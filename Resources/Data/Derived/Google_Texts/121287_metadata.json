He had three goals and three assists in 25 games for the Sabres last season. The young Russian spent the rest of the time with Rochester of the American Hockey League and was a restricted free agent after the expiration of his entry-level deal.\n\nColorado also acquired defenseman Nikita Zadorov, the rights to forward J.T. Compher (who will be a junior at Michigan) and a second-round pick this year for O\u2019Reilly and Jamie McGinn.\n\nThe Avalanche also announced the signings of two players considered to be organizational depth. Forward Andrew Agozzino, who spent the previous three seasons with the American Hockey League\u2019s Lake Erie Monsters, signed a one-year contract. Defenseman Mat Clark, who was born in Lakewood, but raised in Ontario, signed a two-year deal. He has played most of the past five seasons in the AHL and the Avalanche acquired him from the Anaheim organization in March. He had filed for salary arbitration, so his signing avoids that process.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche signs center Mikhail Grigorenko", "title": "Avalanche signs center Mikhail Grigorenko", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/16/avalanche-signs-center-mikhail-grigorenko/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150716__grigorenkop1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150716__grigorenkop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-16T15:18:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:14:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe257b\"", "article_summary": "He has played most of the past five seasons in the AHL and the Avalanche acquired him from the Anaheim organization in March.\nThe 12th pick in the 2012 NHL draft, Grigorenko, 21, played three seasons of major junior hockey for Avalanche coach Patrick Roy with the Quebec Remparts.\nThe Avalanche Thursday announced the signing of center Mikhail Grigorenko, who was acquired from Buffalo in the deal that sent Ryan O\u2019Reilly to the Sabres, to a one-year contract for $675,000.\nForward Andrew Agozzino, who spent the previous three seasons with the American Hockey League\u2019s Lake Erie Monsters, signed a one-year contract.\nThe Avalanche also announced the signings of two players considered to be organizational depth."}
