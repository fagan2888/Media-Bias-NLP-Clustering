The Affordable Care Act remains both unpopular and misunderstood among the American public \u2014 a combination that makes it likely fodder for holiday conflicts.\n\nSo, if your Tea Party uncle starts making wild assertions about the Affordable Care Act, here are some key points that will help keep your conversation on track:\n\nObamacare is not causing premiums to skyrocket.\n\nSince the rollout of Obamacare last year, GOP lawmakers have predicted that premiums would continue to escalate for the millions of Americans purchasing health insurance on the marketplaces. However, according to a recent Center for American Progress analysis, the premium rates for individual market in states with federally-run marketplaces will increase by an average of less than 4 percent between 2014 and 2015. Compare that to the the years before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, when average health care premiums increased more than 10 percent annually.\n\nPlus, more of the nation\u2019s largest insurers will participate in the exchanges for the first time this year, which will increase competition and ultimately lower rates for Americans shopping for plans. While rates remain high in some rural regions of the United States \u2014 including Tennessee and West Virginia \u2014 those areas have had low competition among insurers historically. And recent report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said that premiums in those states too will likely decrease under the health care law.\n\n\u201cThe dark predictions of widespread, quickly escalating premiums appear not to have materialized for 2015,\u201d that reported concluded.\n\nJonathan Gruber did not expose the \u201creal truth\u201d about the law.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Obamacare intensified earlier this month, after videos surfaced of health care economist Jonathan Gruber attributing the law\u2019s success to \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d Gruber \u2014 who\u2019s often credited as an \u201carchitect\u201d of the health law, even though some Democratic lawmakers take issue with that assessment \u2014 suggested that Obamacare would not have passed if more people realized that its individual mandate is essentially a tax, or that it requires healthy people to subsidize care for sicker people.\n\nBut, despite the headlines about \u201cGruberGate,\u201d this controversy hasn\u2019t actually revealed a fundamental truth about the Affordable Care Act. As the legislation moved through Congress, the debate over Obamacare thoroughly addressed the aspects of the policy that Gruber claims lawmakers were hiding. The Congressional Budget Office did score the individual mandate as a mechanism to increase revenue, and President Obama was open about the fact that young and healthy people are necessary to balance out the cost of providing coverage for older and sicker people.\n\nThe website was a disaster last year, but it\u2019s actually working better this time around.\n\nThe ongoing controversy over Gruber\u2019s comments has largely obscured the fact that open enrollment is going much more smoothly than it did when Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces first launched last year. During the first enrollment period, catastrophic website glitches prevented people from signing up, and the rocky rollout made a lot of people rightfully skeptical about whether the new marketplaces were ready for business. But, as the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, the second enrollment period opened to \u201clargely positive reviews,\u201d and people were able to sign up for plans in just minutes. Although some people have reported issues with the site, it\u2019s going much better.\n\nOver the past few weeks, there\u2019s been a lot less coverage of HealthCare.gov\u2019s successful operations that there was about its glitches \u2014 probably because a functioning website makes for a pretty boring story.\n\nObamacare has successfully lowered the uninsured rate.\n\nWhile nearly half of the respondents in Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s recent tracking poll said they have an unfavorable opinion about Obamacare, there\u2019s one positive effect of the landmark legislation that\u2019s hard to argue with. Millions of the poor, people of color, women, and those with preexisting conditions were able to attain coverage for the first time when the market places opened last year.\n\nThe effects since then have been significant. The number of uninsured people fell by at least 10 million, according to data compiled by Commonwealth Fund. In low-income communities, the uninsurance rate dropped nearly 10 percentage points. There\u2019s no doubt that newly insured people are putting their coverage to use. Another Commonwealth Fund study in July found that 60 percent of enrollees have used their new insurance to seek services.\n\nAnd Obamacare has the potential to drive the uninsured rate down even further. If every state accepted Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion \u2014 a policy that 20 GOP-led states continue to block \u2014 the national rate of uninsured people would be two percentage points lower, according to a recent New York Times analysis.\n\nBusinesses are not cutting back on workers\u2019 hours or coverage because of Obamacare.\n\nObamacare is not creating a \u201cpart time economy.\u201d The vast majority of employers say the law has had no impact on their workers\u2019 hours. An analysis released by the Urban Institute and the Robert Johnson Wood Foundation last month found that number of part-time jobs have increased since 2011 because of the slow economic recovery, while the availability of benefits to part-time workers has only slightly changed. And according to a survey of employer benefits conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the portion of businesses that offer health benefits to their part-time workers has remained stable over the last 15 years, increasing by three percentage points.\n\nIf businesses are saying that the law is forcing them to cut back hours and drop coverage, they\u2019re probably just using Obamacare as a convenient scapegoat. Employers have a long history of shifting health care costs onto their employees and cutting back on coverage to help their bottom lines. This practice continues under the Affordable Care Act. According to a survey conducted earlier this year, one in six employers are still providing skimpy plans to their workers to save money.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Read this before you get trapped in a debate about premium costs or Jonathan Gruber.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Read this before you get trapped in a debate about premium costs or Jonathan Gruber.", "title": "How To Talk To Your Tea Party Uncle About Obamacare This Thanksgiving", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/25/3596358/obamacare-argument-uncle/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shutterstock_154349468.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Read this before you get trapped in a debate about premium costs or Jonathan Gruber.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shutterstock_154349468-321x214.jpg", "title": "How To Talk To Your Tea Party Uncle About Obamacare This Thanksgiving", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shutterstock_154349468.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shutterstock_154349468.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T13:41:05+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda527\"", "article_summary": "Compare that to the the years before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, when average health care premiums increased more than 10 percent annually.\nBut, despite the headlines about \u201cGruberGate,\u201d this controversy hasn\u2019t actually revealed a fundamental truth about the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Affordable Care Act remains both unpopular and misunderstood among the American public \u2014 a combination that makes it likely fodder for holiday conflicts.\nSo, if your Tea Party uncle starts making wild assertions about the Affordable Care Act, here are some key points that will help keep your conversation on track:Obamacare is not causing premiums to skyrocket.\nHealth How To Talk To Your Tea Party Uncle About Obamacare This Thanksgiving CREDIT: ShutterstockAs your family gathers around the table this Thanksgiving, the conversation may get a little heated if your right-wing relatives bring up President Obama\u2019s signature health law."}
