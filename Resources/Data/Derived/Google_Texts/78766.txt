SINJAR, Iraq (AP) — Iraqi Kurdish fighters, backed by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes, pushed their way Sunday into the town of Sinjar, captured by the Islamic State militants last summer.

Further to the east, near the Syrian border, Iraqi security forces battled the IS extremists as they tried to retake the strategic military airport of Tal Afar.

The battle for Sinjar and the surroundings has become the latest focus in the campaign to take back territory lost to the Islamic State during the militants’ summer blitz that captured large swaths of northern and western Iraq and neighboring Syria.

Last week, Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters launched the operation to retake Sinjar and opened up a passageway to Mt. Sinjar, which overlooks the town.

The development was an incremental step and helped evacuate some of the thousands of Yazidis trapped on the mountain following the town’s fall in August.

On Sunday, loud explosions and intense gunbattles were heard from inside the town as coalition aircraft bombed Islamic State targets. The president of the self-ruled northern Kurdish region, Masoud Bazani, vowed to crush IS fighters.
