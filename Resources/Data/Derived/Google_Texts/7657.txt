Peter Hill, an educator and the language coordinator for Lakota Immersion Childcare, located in Oglala, South Dakota on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation recently shared his expertise on the Lakota language during a TEDx Talk.

He started the Immersion Daycare program with five children at his house with no full-time staff. Three years later, the program has 20 children, 8 full-time staff, and a school building. He says it is still the only Immersion Daycare in Lakota Country.

“There’s a diverse array of world-changers speaking here at this event—then there’s me,” he says in the video. “Working with a language spoken by a dwindling number of speakers in a remote corner of this prairie state. So it’s worth asking why… someone out there is probably thinking it.”

He goes on to speak about how the average age of a Lakota speaker is currently 70 years old, and the average life expectancy on Pine Ridge is 55 years old.

“The language is being lost daily, weekly, tangibly,” he says. “We can feel it slipping away.”

He goes on to discuss the effects immersion learning has on children throughout their school years, and how difficult creating immersion curricula is.
