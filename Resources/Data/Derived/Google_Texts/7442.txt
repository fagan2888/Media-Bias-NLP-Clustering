A long-deferred plan to raze the P.J. Whelihan's restaurant in South Whitehall Township and replace it with one more than twice the size will be delayed a little longer.

The township Planning Commission was supposed to review a sketch plan for the project Thursday, but it was removed from the agenda at the request of the developer. No reason for the withdrawal was offered.

The project would consolidate two properties — 4595 Broadway and 4570 W. Tilghman St. — to make room for an 8,633-square-foot restaurant with a 109-space parking lot.

The existing restaurant, one of 13 in a regional chain known for its chicken wings, is 3,502 square feet and has a 60-space lot.

The plan has been scaled back from the original version introduced in April 2013, which called for a 9,240-square-foot building and a 114-space lot. That plan had an estimated cost of $4 million.

The plan has prompted controversy. Some township residents say they don't want to lose another old building — it dates from 1870 — to the wrecking ball. But, while the building is old, it isn't on any historic registries that might help protect it from demolition.

Some adjacent business owners are also concerned that the expanded parking lot will be insufficient for the size of the new restaurant, prompting patrons to park in their lots.

The owner of Josh Early Candies, across Hausman Road from Whelihan's, has told the Planning Commission he has seen as many as 22 cars parked in his lot, with their occupants crossing the busy road to get to the restaurant.
