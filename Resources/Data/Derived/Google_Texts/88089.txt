Pop idol Madonna is apologizing for using a racial slur to describe her white son in an Instagram photo, The Associated Press reported.

She posted a picture of her 13-year-old son Rocco boxing on Friday night captioned it with “No one messes with Dirty Soap! Mama said knock you out! #disn**ga.”

The hashtag, containing a variation of the N-word, garnered hundreds of comments on Instagram. The singer changed the caption which now reads “Ok let me start this again. #get off of my d*ck haters!”

In a statement to the AP on Saturday, she was contrite, saying “Forgive me.”

Madonna said she is not a racist and she did not mean to use the word as a slur but said she knew there was no defense for its use. She said she used it as a term of endearment and apologizes if it gave the wrong impression.

Madonna has four children total including two black children adopted from Malawi.
