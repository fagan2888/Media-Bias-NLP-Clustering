High school seniors around the country look forward to their senior trip. It’s a chance to spend some quality time with people you’ve spent nearly every day with for the past four years, but now they get to do so outside of the classroom. Seniors at Profile Junior-Senior High School in New Hampshire worked harder than most senior classes to earn their senior trip, but when something much more important came up they knew what they had to do. Warning: Altruism on fleek.

“Every one of us has a connection with her, and she has given so much to us that we just wanted to give back,” Christopher Sirois, the senior class president, told WMUR.

Sirois is referring to his high school’s principal, Courtney Vashaw, who was recently diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer. Vashaw’s diagnosis coincided with the week before her senior class left for Rydin’ Hi Ranch in New York. Although no one told them, the senior class knew they had a decision to make. After raising around $8,000 over the course of the past four years to fund their senior trip, the class decided there was a better purpose for all that money.

“She is one of the strongest, most determined women I know and if it can happen to her, you know anything can happen to anyone,” senior Hunter Leighton said.
