Calls typically generate about $4 million a year for the department.\n\nUnder state law that money goes toward schooling, law library supplies for prisoners and a building renewal fund.\n\nDepartment spokesman Andrew Wilder says the ruling does not take effect for 90 days.\n\nThe FCC argues that exorbitant rates make it nearly impossible for prisoners to stay in touch with loved ones.\n\nDonna Hamm runs prisoner advocacy group Middle Ground Prison Reform, and says prisoners\u2019 families shouldn\u2019t have to fund these programs.\n\n\u201cThe actual revenue stream will be reduced and everyone is going to have to live with that - the phone companies and the departments of corrections - they\u2019re just going to have to look elsewhere to have revenue streams,\u201d Hamm said.\n\nIn 2013, the FCC decided to limit charges for out-of-state calls, calling the fees \u201cunjust and unreasonable.\u201d\n\nThe FCC has been considering the same for in-state calls for over a decade. Retired nurse Martha Wright\u2019s grandson was incarcerated when she petitioned the commission in 2003. Now deceased, she said at the time that she wanted the FCC to do something about the exorbitant rates.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Arizona Capitol Times, http://www.arizonacapitoltimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Federal Communication Commission is lowering the rates for in-state telephone calls for prisoners, leaving the Arizona Department of Corrections with a potentially large financial hit.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/1/fcc-to-limit-cost-for-arizona-prisoners-telephone-/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Federal Communication Commission is lowering the rates for in-state telephone calls for prisoners, leaving the Arizona Department of Corrections with a potentially large financial hit.", "title": "FCC to limit cost for Arizona prisoners\u2019 telephone calls"}, "twitter": {"title": "FCC to limit cost for Arizona prisoners\u2019 telephone calls", "description": "The Federal Communication Commission is lowering the rates for in-state telephone calls for prisoners, leaving the Arizona Department of Corrections with a potentially large financial hit.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Prison calls, which normally cost 24 cents per minute, will now cost 11 cents per minute.\nPHOENIX (AP) - The Federal Communication Commission is lowering the rates for in-state telephone calls for prisoners, leaving the Arizona Department of Corrections with a potentially large financial hit.\nIn 2013, the FCC decided to limit charges for out-of-state calls, calling the fees \u201cunjust and unreasonable.\u201dThe FCC has been considering the same for in-state calls for over a decade.\nThe FCC argues that exorbitant rates make it nearly impossible for prisoners to stay in touch with loved ones.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision earlier this month to cap call rates will likely take money away from prison education programs, the Arizona Capitol Times reports (http://bit.ly/1P4GUUH)."}
