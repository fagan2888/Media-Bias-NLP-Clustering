These charges have been rebutted item by item by the IRS Inspector General, congressional witnesses who have no political ax to grind, and by Rep. Issa\u2019s counterpart, Representative Elijah Cummings (D-MD), most recently on July 27, 2015 (available athttp://democrats.oversight. house.gov/news/press-releases/ cummings-issues-statement-on- republican-video-letter-and- press-conference-on-irs). (Seehttp://democrats. oversight.house.gov/ investigations/investigation- of-irs for more information.)\n\nRemember that when these 501(c)(4) PACs have overtly politically partisan names and rhetoric, whether from a Tea Party or progressive viewpoint, the IRS should give them closer scrutiny.\n\nIn this letter, I wish to address your constituents about your utter ignorance or hypocrisy \u2013 you choose \u2013 in complaining about government deficits while strip-mining the already small tax collection budget of the IRS, which is supposed to collect over $3 trillion for all three branches of the federal government. Cutting the IRS budget to the bone means it cannot adequately address and collect more of the roughly $300 billion in tax evasions each year.\n\nWhen the Republican\u2019s yearly reductions in the IRS budget angers someone like conservative economist Jerry Jasinowski, who served as the President of the National Association of Manufacturers for 14 years, and was a frequent witness at congressional hearings, you\u2019d better listen.\n\nMr. Jasinowski says that cutting the IRS budget for five consecutive years by a total of $1.2 billion and lowering the budget to $10.9 billion \u2013its lowest level, adjusted for inflation, since 1998 \u2013 \u201cpromotes cynicism [and] encourages cheats.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cAs a result, the IRS has lost 13,000 employees, 11 percent of the total [employees],\u201d initiated \u201c19 percent fewer criminal investigations than the year before,\u201d and completed \u201c46,000 fewer audits.\u201d Consequently, billions of dollars will, of course, go uncollected every year.\n\nPeople cannot reach the IRS with their questions. There are not enough IRS agents to answer the phones; millions of calls go unanswered. You have helped cause this mass irritation and waste of time for the people back home.\n\nThe increased complexity of the tax laws and the surging number of identity thefts are putting more burdens on the diminishing number of IRS staff, who are resorting to spending their own money on office supplies in order to keep things running. (The Affordable Care Act alone has generated many questions for the taxpayers.)\n\nMr. Jasinowski charges that \u201cCongress is undermining that trust [known as voluntary compliance], shortchanging the treasury and encouraging illegal behavior. This is a serious mistake.\u201d\n\nIt is more than a mistake. Republicans are to blame here because they are running the Congress and passing these cuts despite the opposition from the Democrats. They are knowingly and willfully making it impossible to have the IRS crack down on big corporate tax evasion and large individual violators. No doubt some of these tax cheats are gratefully contributing to the campaign coffers of the Republicans.\n\nIt gets worse. While the Republicans are calling for the impeachment of the capable, turnaround expert, John Koskinen, the Commissioner of the IRS, these same Republicans have fashioned a tax code that allows dozens of major corporations, like GE and Verizon, to pay no income taxes at all on billions of yearly profits in the U.S. (see http://www.ctj.org/ for more information).\n\nRepublicans do not hesitate when taking money from commercial interests in return for providing tax laws with so many lucrative loopholes that the rich and powerful can become legal tax avoidersinstead of remaining illegal tax evaders. The tax code has been wholly shaped by political influence. Fewer tax dollars are being collected even though our country has a huge federal deficit, leaving taxpaying Americans to ultimately pay the price for the flaws in the tax code.\n\nHow can you collect your sizable pay check with that kind of grotesque performance? Try disagreeing with Mr. Jasinowski, who accuses the Congress of presiding over an indecipherable tax code that results in \u201cbig time tax cheats getting off scot free.\u201d\n\nThe rumble from the people gets louder and louder in Left-Right alliances. The gerrymandering of single-party congressional districts that allows members of Congress to avoid the consequences of these actions is ripe for change. Your day of reckoning is approaching. You will be held accountable for your ruinous actions.\n\nMeanwhile, enact President Obama\u2019s partially restored IRS budget to slightly over $12 billion next year \u2013 still less expensive than the cost of the latest, redundant aircraft carrier.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRalph Nader", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) 2236 Rayburn House Office Building Washington DC 20515 Representative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) 308 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Representative J\u2026", "title": "Republicans Support Massive Tax Evasion by Starving IRS Budget", "url": "http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/08/03/republicans-support-massive-tax-evasion-by-starving-irs-budget/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-03T08:40:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T02:41:52+00:00"}, "description": "Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) 2236 Rayburn House Office Building Washington DC 20515 Representative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) 308 Cannon House Office Buil", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce143\"", "article_summary": "Cutting the IRS budget to the bone means it cannot adequately address and collect more of the roughly $300 billion in tax evasions each year.\nMeanwhile, enact President Obama\u2019s partially restored IRS budget to slightly over $12 billion next year \u2013 still less expensive than the cost of the latest, redundant aircraft carrier.\nThey are knowingly and willfully making it impossible to have the IRS crack down on big corporate tax evasion and large individual violators.\nNo doubt some of these tax cheats are gratefully contributing to the campaign coffers of the Republicans.\nRepublicans are to blame here because they are running the Congress and passing these cuts despite the opposition from the Democrats."}
