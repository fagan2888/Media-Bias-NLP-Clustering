Greg Walden (R-Ore.), the chairman of the House telecom subcommittee. POLITICO Pro GOP makes U-turn on net neutrality\n\nRepublicans in Congress are doing a 180 on net neutrality as the Federal Communications Commission prepares to issue new rules within weeks.\n\nFor years, GOP lawmakers have adamantly opposed any rules requiring Internet service providers to treat all Web traffic equally, calling them unnecessary and an example of Washington overreach.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut now that the FCC is moving toward issuing a tough net neutrality order that would subject broadband to utility-style regulation \u2014 an approach endorsed by President Barack Obama \u2014 top Republicans in both chambers are making plans to legislate their own rules to ensure the agency doesn\u2019t go too far.\n\n\u201cTimes have changed,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), the chairman of the House telecom subcommittee, said when asked about the evolving GOP position on net neutrality. \u201cThe administration has latched onto this [utility-style regulation], and the FCC\u2019s independence is nominal at best.\u201d\n\nAccording to Walden, the Republican bill \u2014 which \u201cis ready\u201d and will be released in the coming days \u2014 \u201cgives the protections that the president and FCC say they want, and does it in a legally sustainable way.\u201d\n\nWalden and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) announced late Wednesday that they plan to hold double-header hearings on net neutrality next week, and Thune laid out set of principles that will guide them as they craft the legislation.\n\nThe language Republicans are using to talk about their proposed bill illustrates just how far the GOP has come on the issue. The principles embrace and even bolster ideas that were once controversial in Republican circles, like banning \u201cpaid prioritization,\u201d the practice of charging content companies for an online fast lane.\n\nThune\u2019s principles also include bans on blocking or throttling Web traffic and extending net neutrality protections to wireless networks, an idea put forward by Obama and congressional Democrats.\n\nAt the same time, the GOP measure would tie the FCC\u2019s hands, prohibiting it from reclassifying broadband as a utility under Title II of the Communications Act, or using other sections of the law to create new rules.\n\nStill, the fact that Republicans are even talking about legislating net neutrality marks a stark departure from their past position.\n\nWhen a federal appeals court last year threw out the FCC\u2019s previous attempt at net neutrality rules, Walden and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) called the court decision \u201ca victory for jobs and innovation \u2026 by keeping the government\u2019s hands off the Internet\u201d and preventing the government \u201cfrom playing the role of traffic cop.\u201d\n\nEven those furthest to the right on net neutrality appear to be open to working on legislation. In an interview last week, Thune said all his committee members are ready to work on a measure. \u201cObviously, not everybody is in lock step, and we haven\u2019t shown a bill yet, but in terms of general principles, I think everybody is pretty much in the same place,\u201d he said.\n\nThune\u2019s committee includes Sen. Ted Cruz, who in November called net neutrality \u201cObamacare for the Internet.\u201d Now, Cruz \u201clooks forward to having a vigorous discussion on how we can best ensure the Internet remains a forum for freedom and innovation\u201d as the FCC eyes stricter regulations, according to a Cruz spokesman.\n\nClearly, a lot has changed in the Internet policy debate in the past year, shifting the political calculus.\n\nFor months, the FCC was inundated with millions of comments asking for stronger net neutrality rules, and Obama electrified the debate in November, calling on the agency to reclassify broadband as a utility \u2014 the strongest regulatory approach.\n\nWhile Hill Republicans now have the votes in both chambers to pass a resolution of disapproval or a bill to strip the FCC\u2019s power, an anti-net neutrality measure would almost certainly face a veto threat from the president.\n\nPublic interest groups say Republicans are responding to the building pressure.\n\n\u201cMillions of people and businesses have stood up and once again made clear that they want to keep the same rights they\u2019ve always had,\u201d said Matt Wood, policy director of Free Press. \u201cSelf-identified conservatives, just like everyone else, overwhelmingly support keeping the rules that have kept the Internet open.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s unclear whether the lawmakers are putting forward \u201ca legitimate effort to at long last listen to their constituents, or just a cynical cable-backed ploy to stall the FCC,\u201d Wood said.\n\nBut Walden insists the two parties aren\u2019t that far apart.\n\n\u201cThe whole world is being turned on its head right now, and yet we all share what appear to be common principles and goals,\u201d Walden said, adding that net neutrality needn\u2019t be a partisan issue. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at this as whether Republicans win or Democrats lose. It\u2019s what\u2019s best for [broadband] investment.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "With the FCC about to act, Republicans are planning to legislate their own rules to ensure the agency doesn\u2019t go too far.", "title": "GOP makes U-turn on net neutrality", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/republicans-congress-net-neutrality-fcc-114296.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/15/150115_greg_walden_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Net Neutrality,Republicans,Technology", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "With the FCC about to act, Republicans are planning to legislate their own rules to ensure the agency doesn\u2019t go too far.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a96\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro GOP makes U-turn on net neutralityRepublicans in Congress are doing a 180 on net neutrality as the Federal Communications Commission prepares to issue new rules within weeks.\n\u201cTimes have changed,\u201d Rep.
