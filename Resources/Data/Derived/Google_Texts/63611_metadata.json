In one challenge, she made turkey quesadillas and, in another, a green bean pancake with a maple cranberry sauce.\n\nThe 30-year-old nun and chef, who cooks meals for her church\u2019s soup kitchen, intends to donate her winnings to help feed her Chicago community, Humboldt Park.\n\n\u201cI wanted to [compete on the show] for Jesus: to be a witness to how fulfilling a life dedicated to God can be,\u201d Torres told The Daily Signal via email. \u201cOur vocation as religious is to live a life of prayer, witness, and service\u2014being on \u2018Chopped\u2019 certainly gives a great opportunity to share that message with the world.\u201d\n\nTorres wound up on the show, which featured three other soup kitchen chefs, after the Food Network announced they were looking to showcase religious sisters on the episode.\n\n\u201cI heard about [the show] and told my superior that I thought I had a good chance,\u201d Torres wrote. \u201cHe gave me permission to apply, and I went through the application and interview process as any other potential competing chef would.\u201d\n\nWhile Torres says she \u201cnever imagined\u201d she would wind up on reality television, she is no stranger to the kitchen. She says that she began cooking as a young teenager and that the importance of family meals was always reinforced in her home growing up.\n\nTorres says she was nervous in the days leading up to the competition but was confident in her abilities as the showdown began.\n\n\u201cWhen the day arrived I was not nervous at all,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy religious community and some close friends were praying for me, and I am confident in the power of prayer!\u201d\n\nBy Torres\u2019 estimation, she regularly cooks for anywhere between eight and 600 people at her church, Mission of Our Lady of the Angels, on Chicago\u2019s West Side.\n\n\u201cI am a naturally creative person, so cooking is a way I\u2019ve really expressed that as a religious sister,\u201d Torres told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe don\u2019t always know what food is going to come in [to the soup kitchen], so the ability to be flexible and creative has really stretched me to expand my cooking horizons and think outside the box when it comes to preparing delicious, healthy meals.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is [cooking] an opportunity to be artistic, but even more importantly, to show our deep gratitude to God and our benefactors for their generosity that sustains our life and work,\u201d Torres added.\n\nSister Alicia plans to prepare breakfast at her church for 600 homeless or hungry guests on Thanksgiving Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sister Alicia Torres, a nun from Chicago, took first place on The Food Network's cooking competition television show \"Chopped.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sister Alicia Torres, a nun from Chicago, took first place on The Food Network's cooking competition television show \"Chopped.\"", "title": "Nun Takes Soup Kitchen Cooking Skills to TV, Wins First Place", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/torres.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-16T18:14:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MNFRXf"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sister Alicia Torres, a nun from Chicago, took first place on The Food Network's cooking competition television show \"Chopped.\"", "title": "Nun Takes Soup Kitchen Cooking Skills to TV, Wins First Place", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/torres.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-11-16T16:56:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T18:14:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Alicia Torres, Sister Alicia Torres, Chopped, Food Network, Our Lady of the Angels, Chicago"}, "article_summary": "The 30-year-old nun and chef, who cooks meals for her church\u2019s soup kitchen, intends to donate her winnings to help feed her Chicago community, Humboldt Park.\n\u201cI am a naturally creative person, so cooking is a way I\u2019ve really expressed that as a religious sister,\u201d Torres told The Daily Signal.\nIn one challenge, she made turkey quesadillas and, in another, a green bean pancake with a maple cranberry sauce.\n\u201cI wanted to [compete on the show] for Jesus: to be a witness to how fulfilling a life dedicated to God can be,\u201d Torres told The Daily Signal via email.\n\u201cI heard about [the show] and told my superior that I thought I had a good chance,\u201d Torres wrote."}
