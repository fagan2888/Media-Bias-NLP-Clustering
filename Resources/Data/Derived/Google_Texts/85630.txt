Two Omaha Public Schools students earned a national honor through JROTC this fall. On Wednesday, district leaders recognized Katie Glessman, a cadet at Omaha Benson, and Jared Polack, a cadet at Omaha Burke. Both were awarded the "Legion of Valor," the highest JROTC award.

The award is authorized for roughly one out of every 4,000 cadets. This year, 29 cadets from Army JROTC received the award. The honor recognizes academic excellence, leadership potential and service.

"What the whole program is about is motivating young people to be better citizens. That's our mission statement. To do that, we focus on ARMY values. Loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage. We have a bunch of extra-curricular activities that try to inspire that. The biggest thing about it is leadership," said Polack. "I've gained a lot of friends, I've gained CPR skills, first-aid skills, leadership definitely. I can go out and command a team and it doesn't phase me at all. I'm not nervous for that stuff anymore," explained Glessman.
