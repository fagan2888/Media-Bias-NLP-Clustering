Homework or the Xbox? Finish that memo, or roam Facebook?\n\nSuch decisions test a mental ability called cognitive control, the capacity to maintain focus on an important choice while ignoring other impulses. Poor planning, wandering attention and trouble inhibiting impulses all signify lapses in cognitive control.\n\nNow a growing stream of research suggests that strengthening this mental muscle, usually with exercises in mindfulness, may help children and adults cope with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and its adult equivalent, attention deficit disorder.\n\nThe studies come amid growing disenchantment with the first-line treatment for these conditions: drugs.\n\nIn 2007, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, published a study finding that the incidence of ADHD among teenagers in Finland, along with difficulties in cognitive functioning and related emotional disorders like depression, were virtually identical to rates among teenagers in the United States. The real difference? Most adolescents with ADHD in the United States were taking medication; most in Finland were not.\n\n\u201cIt raises questions about using medication as a first line of treatment,\u201d said Susan Smalley, a behavior geneticist at UCLA and the lead author.\n\nA large study last year, in The Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, found that while most young people with ADHD benefit from medications in the first year, these effects generally wane by the third year, if not sooner.\n\n\u201cThere are no long-term, lasting benefits from taking ADHD medications,\u201d said James M. Swanson, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the study. \u201cBut mindfulness seems to be training the same areas of the brain that have reduced activity in ADHD.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why mindfulness might be so important,\u201d he added. \u201cIt seems to get at the causes.\u201d\n\nDepending on which scientist is speaking, cognitive control may be defined as the delay of gratification, impulse management, emotional self-regulation or self-control, the suppression of irrelevant thoughts, and paying attention or learning readiness.\n\nThis singular mental ability, researchers have found, predicts success both in school and in work life.\n\nCognitive control increases from about 4-12 years old, then plateaus, said Betty J. Casey, director of the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Teenagers find it difficult to suppress impulses, as any parent knows.\n\nBut impulsivity peaks around age 16, Casey noted, and in their 20s most people achieve adult levels of cognitive control.\n\nAmong healthy adults, it begins to wane noticeably in the 70s or 80s, often manifesting as an inability to remember names or words, because of distractions the mind once would have suppressed.\n\nBolstering this mental ability, specialists are now suggesting, might be particularly helpful in treating ADHD and ADD.\n\nTo do so, researchers are testing mindfulness: teaching people to monitor their thoughts and feelings without judgments or other reactivity. Rather than simply being carried away from a chosen focus, they notice that their attention has wandered, and renew their concentration.\n\nStephen Hinshaw, a specialist in developmental psychopathology at the University of California, Berkeley, said the time was ripe to explore the utility of nondrug interventions like mindfulness.\n\nSwanson agreed. \u201cI was a skeptic until I saw the data,\u201d he said, \u201cand the findings are promising.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/hfyouth03.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut mindfulness seems to be training the same areas of the brain that have reduced activity in ADHD.\nTo do so, researchers are testing mindfulness: teaching people to monitor their thoughts and feelings without judgments or other reactivity.\nBolstering this mental ability, specialists are now suggesting, might be particularly helpful in treating ADHD and ADD.\nSuch decisions test a mental ability called cognitive control, the capacity to maintain focus on an important choice while ignoring other impulses.\n\u201cI was a skeptic until I saw the data,\u201d he said, \u201cand the findings are promising.\u201d"}
