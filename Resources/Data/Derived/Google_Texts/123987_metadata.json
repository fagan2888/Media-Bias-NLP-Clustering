The following is a response that includes as its intended audience the author of the article as well as those who responded to the article.\n\n\n\nOne of the fascinating and sometimes disheartening things we do on Meridian is look at readers\u2019 comments. It is fascinating because as Latter-day Saints we come from such diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, inclinations and outlooks. It is disheartening because occasionally we see people criticize and carp at other Church members saying things like, \u201cI don\u2019t see how so-and-so can call himself a member if\u2026 (fill in the blank).\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfill in the blank\u201d differs wildly. I\u2019ve seen people say they don\u2019t see how so-and-so can call themselves a good Church member if they belong to a particular political party. I don\u2019t see how they can call themselves a good Church member if they wrote a particular book. I don\u2019t see how they can call themselves a good Church member if their child went astray, if their marriage fell apart, if they are arrogant or self-righteous, if they support Obamacare, if they don\u2019t support Obamacare. The list is endless.\n\nWe\u2019ve had indignant people write that they would never read Meridian again because of the 27,000 articles we\u2019ve published, they didn\u2019t like one of them. One reader said I was a \u201cliar and a member of the lunatic fringe.\u201d Another reader asked how we could call ourselves good members of the Church by publishing this or that statement.\n\nIt is easy to throw darts at each other in this Internet age where we can say whatever we\u2019d like about someone from the safety of our computer in our bedroom, something we would never say to their face in the foyer at Church.\n\nWe moderate our comments on Meridian\u2013as a newspaper would choose which letters to the editor to print\u2013for some reasons we think are important. We don\u2019t want to use our magazine as a forum for anti-Mormon comments or those who would deride our doctrine or the prophet. We don\u2019t let pornographic comments be made. We also don\u2019t let people malign our authors-whose views are their own. People, of course, are free to discuss a different point of view within a gospel context, but name calling and deriding criticism such as \u201cthis is drivel\u201d we moderate out of the discussion. We don\u2019t think our writers should have to be personally beat up for expressing a viewpoint, though we have no problem with calm and rational expression of difference.\n\nCurrently, the senior editorial staff at Meridian are out of the country working on a book project. Apparently in our absence an article was published on our magazine that threw the blogsophere for a loop called \u201cAre You a Liberal Mormon?\u201d by Joni Hilton. I am out of the country and have not seen the brouhaha that surrounded this article, but Joni wrote to say that she didn\u2019t mean politically liberal. She was using the term liberal more to mean casual Mormon, someone who didn\u2019t take their commitment seriously. Apparently, most readers saw this as meaning \u201cpolitically liberal\u201d and were offended. We are sorry for this and acknowledge that the content and tone should have been more carefully edited or revised. Sometimes as writers we don\u2019t understand all of the implications that others will take from our words. We appreciate all the good and insightful articles Joni has added to Meridian over many years.\n\nWhen my husband, Scot, was young in a very small branch in Ankara, Turkey, a woman came to church who had clearly just smoked a cigarette only moments before. She still smelled strongly of the smoke and people noticed\u2013though they tried not to react. It was testimony meeting that day and she got up and said something he never forgot. \u201cI know you all smelled the smoke on me when I came into church today, but you know if every sin had an odor, the church would be a pretty stinky place.\u201d\n\nWe are all always struggling to overcome our weaknesses and become more devoted disciples of Jesus Christ.\n\nSo this is a plea. Can we refrain from judging each other as to whether we are good members or not? Can we give each other the benefit of the doubt? Can we act with charity in our comments? Can our hearts expand to include people whose ideas and inclinations may not match our own?\n\nThe Adversary would have us scattered and divided. He would love us to make camps and forge little wars against each other. Let\u2019s not play his game or fall for his tactics.\n\nThis is a favorite scripture of mine which seems to suit the situation. \u201cI say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.
