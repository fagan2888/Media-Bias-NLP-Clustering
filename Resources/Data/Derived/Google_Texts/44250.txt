Hilarious White House tweet aims for the 'My Little Pony' demographic

Perhaps it is nostalgia for the heady days of the past, when the media could be counted upon to publish photos of Barack Obama with a halo surrounding his head (Google Obama+Halo for countless examples), and journalists called him a “lightworker” and “like a god.” But that was before the wheels fell off the bus with Obamacare and the catastrophic diplomatic malpractice that has unleashed Putin, and is plunging the Middle East toward nuclear chaos.

These days, it is up to White House propaganda machine to come up with imagery suggesting divine grace has anything to do with our commander in chief. Thus, the White House tweet sent out yesterday, showing a rainbow springing from his hand as he descended from the clouds and exited Air Force One. The comments on Twitter instantly became hilariously derisive, with my favorite being #5 from Wyatt Torosian (@BitProofDiction): “gotta reach that 'my little pony' demographic.” There is a downside to surrounding oneself with sycophants. They've got to keep Valerie Jarrett away from the Twitter account.
