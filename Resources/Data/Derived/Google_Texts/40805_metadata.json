About a year ago, I promised that 2014 would be a breakthrough year for America. And this week, we got more evidence to back that up.\n\nIn December, our businesses created 240,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6%. That means that 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. In 2014, unemployment fell faster than it has in three decades.\n\nOver a 58-month streak, our businesses have created 11.2 million new jobs. After a decade of decline, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the \u201890s. America is now the world\u2019s number one producer of oil and gas, helping to save drivers about a buck-ten a gallon at the pump over this time last year. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone. We have cut our deficits by about two-thirds. And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, and more of our brave troops have come home.\n\nIt has been six years since the crisis. Those years have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everybody\u2019s part. So as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we\u2019ve got to show for it. America\u2019s resurgence is real. And now that we\u2019ve got some calmer waters, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, we can make sure that tide starts lifting all boats again. We can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers America\u2019s prosperity for decades to come.\n\nThat\u2019ll be the focus of my State of the Union Address in a couple weeks \u2014 building on the progress we\u2019ve made. But I figured, why wait \u2014 let\u2019s get started right now.\n\nOn Wednesday, I visited a Ford plant outside of Detroit \u2014 because the American auto industry and its home state are redefining the word \u201ccomeback.\u201d On Thursday, I traveled to Arizona, a state that was hit among the hardest by the housing crisis, to announce a new plan that will put hundreds of dollars in new homeowners\u2019 pockets, and help more new families buy their first home. And, I\u2019m speaking with you today from Pellissippi State Community College in Tennessee, a state making big strides in education, to unveil my new plan to make two years of community college free for every responsible student. I\u2019m also here to establish a new hub that will attract more good-paying, high-tech manufacturing jobs to our shores.\n\nMaking home-ownership easier. Bringing a higher education within reach. Creating more good jobs that pay good wages. These are just some of the ways we can help every American get ahead in the new economy. And there\u2019s more to come. Because America is coming back. And I want to go full speed ahead. Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend. ####\n\nPrevious weekly remarks from both parties are available here.\n\nRELATED:\n\nMore free stuff from Obama\n\nA GOP Congress arrives and Obama departs\n\nObamaCare pays subsidies to families making $95K\n\n\n\nBarack Obama promised unity, then delivered spectacular divisions\n\nObama vows vigilance on terrorists as he releases more from Gitmo", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's weekly remarksHi, everybody.
