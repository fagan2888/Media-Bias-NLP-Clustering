Highway 41. Leroy Burnell/Staff 6/5/2014\n\nPalmetto RV has spent years buying second-hand motor homes for customers and reconditioning them with hardwood floors, plush seating, TVs and kitchen islands.\n\nThat's still the signature sales product for the locally owned 10-employee outlet off S.C. Highway 41 east of the Cooper. \"We build it to make it work for you,\" said Ross Holmquist, general manager.\n\nBut in the past year, Palmetto RV has diversified. The recreational vehicle sales and service business added a line of new travel trailers and launched work on specialty projects such as upscale horse trailers and medical equipment installations. Cashing in on an improving economy, the company has doubled in size since January.\n\n\"It's something else we are focusing on,\" Holmquist said. \"Not just motor homes but travel trailers, horse trailers. You don't have to drive across town (to shop for RVs),\" he said.\n\nAs an example of the medical equipment efforts, the company custom-built a dialysis suite for a patient who wants to tour the country but requires daily medical treatments.\n\nPalmetto RV, meanwhile, dipped its toe in the new-travel trailer business last year while going full-scale in 2014. Travel trailers typically range from 28-32 feet in length. They're hitched to a truck and pulled.\n\nAfter researching products, the dealer chose to market the upscale North Trail brand built in Elkhart, Ind. At any one time, the lot holds about 25-30 vehicles. The \"ability to have push button for everything\" is cool, Holmquist said.\n\nPerks include wall TVs, showers, fold-out beds and grilling hook-ups. Prices are reasonable: a 32-foot North Trail on the lot costs $33,000, a 28-foot bunkhouse model goes for $22,000.\n\nWhile popular with all ages, travel trailers sell most often to couples in their 30s who've got young kids and want to go on camping breaks, according to Palmetto RV. The retailer chose North Trail because every model can be towed by a half-ton pickup such as a Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado or Ram rather than a larger, more specialized truck.\n\nAlong with the new travel trailer lineup, the outlet showcases a few dozen used motor homes that are for sale or in the midst of refurbishment. The RVs, which typically sell in the six figures, can prove practical and save on costs for the motor home buyer - who otherwise would have to pay $130,000 or more for a new edition.\n\nPalmetto RV focuses on models from 2002 to 2008 since the body styles are similar to today's editions, and they employ V-10 engines as in new editions. The operation won't buy vehicles with smoke, pet or water damage.\n\nOne reconditioned vehicle on the lot is a 2005 Winnebago Journey motor home. The shop redid the floors with custom wood and made a few other minor revisions. Palmetto RV recently sold the model for $58,000. Another customized 2003 Keystone motor home, which includes cherry wood floors and sleeps eight people, was marketed at $69,000. A new one would cost $200,000.\n\nThe Mount Pleasant dealership is more than just a retail center. Mechanics take calls 24 hours a day and handle repairs to motor homes, trailers - even boats, Holmquist says. Technicians were dispatched to Shem Creek to install new air conditioning units on shrimp boats, since the mechanisms are similar to camper a.c. equipment, he says.\n\nPalmetto RV also offers a popular \"camping school.\" Anyone who buys a motor home can go through a daytime two-day on-site course to learn the ins and outs of their vehicle. The school takes place at a nearby KOA Campground east of the Cooper.\n\nSince broadening the sales choices, \"service has doubled naturally,\" Holmquist says. \"We added two more (service) bays,\" he says.\n\nThe \"full fledged\" RV sales season occurs when couples and families are gearing up for trips. \"Three weeks ago, it's like somebody flipped a switch,\" Holmquist says. Activity tends to slow down around August as youngsters return to school.\n\nEven as it grows, Palmetto RV has maintained a low-key approach to the business.\n\nThe dealership tries to keep up a local, friendly atmosphere, such as preparing barbecue at lunchtime enjoyed by workers and customers alike.\n\n\"We're laid back,\" he says.\n\nTo learn more about Palmetto RV, visit www.palmettorv.com or call 843-416-8357.\n\nReach Jim Parker at 937-5542 or jparker@postandcourier.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "New or 'Like New': Factory sales, niche ventures help to balance out custom work for Mount Pleasant recreational vehicle dealership, \r\nAutomotive,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Palmetto RV has spent years buying second-hand motor homes for customers and reconditioning them with hardwood floors, plush seating, TVs and kitchen islands.", "title": "New or 'Like New': Factory sales, niche ventures help to balance out custom work for Mount Pleasant recreational vehicle dealership", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20140614/140619662/new-or-like-new-factory-sales-niche-ventures-help-to-balance-out-custom-work-for-mount-pleasant-recreational-vehicle-dealership", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140614/PC2107/140619662/AR/0/AR-140619662.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140614/PC2107/140619662/AR/0/AR-140619662.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Palmetto RV has spent years buying second-hand motor homes for customers and reconditioning them with hardwood floors, plush seating, TVs and kitchen islands.", "title": "New or 'Like New': Factory sales, niche ventures help to balance out custom work for Mount Pleasant recreational vehicle dealership", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140614/PC2107/140619662/AR/0/AR-140619662.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 140619662}}, "keywords": "New or 'Like New': Factory sales, niche ventures help to balance out custom work for Mount Pleasant recreational vehicle dealership , \r\nAutomotive", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T00:01:00Z", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T18:12:00Z", "author": "Jim Parker"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Palmetto RV has spent years buying second-hand motor homes for customers and reconditioning them with hardwood floors, plush seating, TVs and kitchen islands."}, "article_summary": "The recreational vehicle sales and service business added a line of new travel trailers and launched work on specialty projects such as upscale horse trailers and medical equipment installations.\n\"Not just motor homes but travel trailers, horse trailers.\nPalmetto RV in Mount Pleasant customizes motor homes such as this Discovery model at its dealership off U.S. Highway 17 and S.C.
