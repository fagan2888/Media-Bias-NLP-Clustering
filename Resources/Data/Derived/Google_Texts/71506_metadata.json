The developments could undermine already-fragile governments\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon hasn\u2019t specified how much money it will need to adapt and respond to climate change threats. However, any additional funding for the effort is sure to be scrutinized by some Republicans in Congress\u2014who question the scientific evidence behind climate change. Some have even suggested the DOD\u2019s report was just used to further the Obama administration\u2019s agenda to fight climate change.\n\nRelated: Obama Wants to Fight Climate Change with Lasers\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing, but not surprising, that the president and his administration would focus on climate change when there are other, legitimate threats in the world,\u201d Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and known climate change skeptic, told The New York Times.\n\nStill, Pentagon officials continue warning of the seriousness of the issue, saying politics should not hinder the DOD\u2019s ability to respond to the potential threats.\n\n\"Climate change is a global problem. Its impacts do not respect national borders,\" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says in the report. \"Politics or ideology must not get in the way of sound planning.\u201d\n\nOfficials conducted research and surveys to identify the biggest threats a rapidly changing climate poses to national security. Here are the 5 areas where the military is most vulnerable to the effects of climate change:\n\nRelated: How Media Bias Censors the Debate on Climate Change\n\nCoastal Bases: Rising sea levels and increased flooding pose a major threat to the thousands of coastal military installations around the world. Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office identified 7,591 military facilities that are at risk due to the effects of climate change. In one instance, rising sea levels near Alaska have caused coastal erosion at several Air Force radar installations.\n\n\n\nTraining: Droughts, wildfires and extreme temperatures could derail training activities. In a recent federal audit, investigators found that nine out of 15 military areas reported difficult training conditions due to wildfires and precipitation changes, according to the GAO.\n\n\n\nEquipment and Storage: Extreme weather events and rising waters could have serious effects on military supplies, equipment and weapons systems. It could also change how the equipment is transported as well as where it is stored.\n\n\n\nMissions: Climate change will likely have a major impact on how the military executes its operations. For example, rising sea levels could hinder water landings and changing temperatures could have an impact on when to execute missions.\n\n\n\nRegional Stability: The shortage of vital resources like food or water has the power to quickly destabilize an already vulnerable region. The CNA Military Advisory Board, made up of retired generals and admirals, recently called the effects of climate change \"catalysts for conflict\" in unstable regions.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For years, the federal government has warned that the effects of climate change could", "title": "Five Ways Climate Change Threatens National Security", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/14/Five-Ways-Climate-Change-Threatens-National-Security", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10292012_storm_flood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/14/Five-Ways-Climate-Change-Threatens-National-Security", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10292012_storm_flood.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "For years, the federal government has warned that the effects of climate change could", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf14d\"", "article_summary": "The developments could undermine already-fragile governments\u2026.\u201dThe Pentagon hasn\u2019t specified how much money it will need to adapt and respond to climate change threats.\nRelated: Obama Wants to Fight Climate Change with Lasers\u201cIt is disappointing, but not surprising, that the president and his administration would focus on climate change when there are other, legitimate threats in the world,\u201d Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and known climate change skeptic, told The New York Times.\nHowever, any additional funding for the effort is sure to be scrutinized by some Republicans in Congress\u2014who question the scientific evidence behind climate change.\nSome have even suggested the DOD\u2019s report was just used to further the Obama administration\u2019s agenda to fight climate change.\nFor years, the federal government has warned that the effects of climate change could pose serious threats to national security\u2014saying rising water levels will eventually hinder military bases."}
