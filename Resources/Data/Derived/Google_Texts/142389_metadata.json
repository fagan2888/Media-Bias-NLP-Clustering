The board's next meeting is January 27, 2015.\n\nWhen hospitals move or close down, it can be a sign of shifting populations, changing medical needs, or financial trouble. As soon as next week, St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital in Belleville could receive word from a state regulatory board on whether its proposal to shutter its current location and build a new hospital 17 minutes away will be permitted.\n\nPublic health officials say the move could leave some of St. Clair County\u2019s most vulnerable residents without a hospital nearby. But St. Elizabeth\u2019s, which is part of the Hospital Sisters Health System, contends the $288 million project would allow for necessary updates and would be more accessible to most of its patients. The proposed site sits on the edge of O\u2019Fallon, by the interstate.\n\nSt. Elizabeth's Hospital is just a few blocks from Belleville\u2019s downtown, which is filled with restaurants, a German Christmas market and an old-fashioned movie theater that pipes music into the street. The hospital sees about 585 patients every day.\n\n\u201cEvery time I go in there, that\u2019s the place where I know I was born. It\u2019s a heartfelt memory that I will never lose,\u201d said Morgan Edwards, 30-year-old Belleville resident. \u201cIt\u2019s home to Belleville.\u201d\n\nListen to Durrie's story about St. Elizabeth's.\n\nBuilt in the 1950\u2019s, St. Elizabeth's Hospital is tall and beige with a modest, art deco-inspired fa\u00e7ade. The hospital's president and CEO, Maryann Reese, said the building is aging. It's constrictive and renders some current medical technologies useless.\n\n\u201cFor example, we got new beds. $1.5 million we spent on new beds. They notify the nurse by wireless technology that a patient\u2019s about to get out of bed. So, if a high risk patient falls, that\u2019s important for the nurse to know,\u201d Reese said. \u201cWe have 18-inch cinder block walls here. We cannot use wireless technology for those beds, which is really disappointing.\u201d\n\nSt. Elizabeth\u2019s proposal, submitted to the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board, includes a six-floor hospital, physicians' offices and a $34 million ambulatory care center situated along Interstate 64 in O\u2019Fallon. An urgent care center and physicians' offices would remain in Belleville, but the hospital would be razed if no developers step forward to purchase the building. The board must vote to approve the application as a Certificate of Need, which may happen as soon as December 16.\n\nThe new hospital would hold 144 inpatient beds \u2014 less than half the number currently at St. Elizabeth\u2019s. Reese said the beds are no longer needed because birth rates are going down, and healthcare is shifting its focus to outpatient and preventive care as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cYou can argue whether the law is a good one or not, but when you think about quality healthcare, it really is incentivizing us to be more quality driven. Part of that is making sure patients are not readmitted, so therefore, [there are] less beds from that,\u201d Reese said.\n\nReese said an internal study showed that 75 percent of St. Elizabeth\u2019s patients live outside of Belleville\u2014making the new location more accessible for ambulances transporting patients.\n\nBut Herb Simmons, who directs the Emergency Management Agency for St. Clair County, doesn't agree. The hospital on the other side of town, Belleville Memorial Hospital, is already building a satellite location just two miles away from St. Elizabeth\u2019s proposed site in O\u2018Fallon.\n\nMap by St. Louis Public Radio's visual data specialist, Brent Jones.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to have the two hospitals get together and say, \u2018How do we work together here?\u2019 But I think when people put profits over people\u2019s health, that\u2019s what you end up with,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nFor heart attacks, strokes and physical trauma, minutes spent in an ambulance can be a matter of life or death. Simmons said the hospital didn\u2019t contact his agency about how its closure would affect ambulance response times before they submitted their application to the state.\n\n\u201cWhen you transfer patients seven miles farther from the location that you\u2019re normally taking them, there\u2019s a longer response time to get the patients there. Then your ambulances are that that much farther away from their response area,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nMoving to O\u2019Fallon is probably a good business decision for the hospital. The city has seen a faster population growth over the past couple of decades, and median incomes in O'Fallon are about 30.7 percent higher than in Belleville, which indicates that the population is more likely to be privately insured.\n\nSimmons said he's already seen two hospitals close in the eastern St. Louis metro area, and he'd hate to see another.\n\n\u201cThe first one was Christian welfare hospital. I saw what that did on the inner part of East St. Louis and the burden and strain that it put on St. Mary\u2019s hospital,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cWhen that hospital shut down, you can see the impact it\u2019s got there. You\u2019ve got a building that\u2019s sitting there slowly deteriorating.\u201d\n\nThe St. Clair County Health Department also criticized St. Elizabeth\u2019s proposal. It submitted a letter to the state regulator in October. \u201cA large concentration of medically underserved and vulnerable population lives in close proximity to the current location (in Belleville),\u201d wrote the Executive Director of the St. Clair County Health Department, Kevin Hutchison. \u201cTransportation barriers may reduce access to the proposed location, resulting in a shift of emergency and ambulatory care services to other hospitals that may not have the capacity to meet this increased demand.\u201d\n\nShould the plans be approved, about 1,000 employees will move with the hospital to O\u2019Fallon by the end of 2017. That means the lunchtime rush in downtown Belleville will change drastically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to have an effect on downtown business, absolutely. Whether it\u2019s the gas station, retail store, the restaurants or whatever,\u201d said Scott Muir, owner of the Righteous Pig Barbecue. Muir and his business partner opened the restaurant about eight months ago, and receive a good chunk of business from hospital employees and patients.\n\nEven though about 200 people would remain to staff the services remaining in Belleville, many downtown business owners have expressed concern over the proposal. Muir said he\u2019s gone to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital all his life and likes knowing it's close by.\n\n\u201cI wish they would stay. Belleville\u2019s a large enough community that they need two hospitals. I see absolutely no reason to leave another building vacant in Belleville.\u201d\n\nFollow Durrie Bouscaren on Twitter: @durrieB", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "Update 12/16/14: St. Elizabeth's Hospital has asked the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board to delay their planned vote over the hospital", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/decision-nears-st-elizabeth-s-hospital-move", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201412/DSC_0019.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Update 12/16/14: St. Elizabeth's Hospital has asked the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board to delay their planned vote over the hospital", "title": "Decision Nears On St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital Move"}, "story_id": 370214405, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@durrieB"}, "author": "Durrie Bouscaren", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Decision Nears On St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital Move"}, "nid": 41786, "datePublished": "2014-12-11", "keywords": "health care, hospitals, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 1313, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Muir said he\u2019s gone to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital all his life and likes knowing it's close by.\nBuilt in the 1950\u2019s, St. Elizabeth's Hospital is tall and beige with a modest, art deco-inspired fa\u00e7ade.\nSt. Elizabeth's Hospital is just a few blocks from Belleville\u2019s downtown, which is filled with restaurants, a German Christmas market and an old-fashioned movie theater that pipes music into the street.\nYou\u2019ve got a building that\u2019s sitting there slowly deteriorating.\u201dThe St. Clair County Health Department also criticized St. Elizabeth\u2019s proposal.\nThe new hospital would hold 144 inpatient beds \u2014 less than half the number currently at St. Elizabeth\u2019s."}
