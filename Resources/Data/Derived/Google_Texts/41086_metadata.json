With the persistent warmth, many communities are on pace to end up experiencing one of their top five warmest Decembers on record.\n\nOn Saturday Fort Myers hit 87 degrees, breaking the city's 51-year-old temperatures record for Dec. 26th of 85 degrees.\n\nTypically in late December Southwest Florida is nearing its climatological cool point, when daytime highs normally only top out in the mid 70s with overnight lows in the mid 50s.\n\nHowever the weather pattern our region has been locked in is not conducive to typical winter weather, in many ways thanks to the jet stream.\n\nThe jet stream is an upper-atmosphere path of wind helping to steer storms and roughly act as the dividing line between mild and cool air. For much of this month, the jet stream has been entrenched in a pattern where a trough is stuck in the western U.S. while a ridge remains in place along the east coast.\n\nJet stream troughs are southward moving kinks in the wind flow allowing colder air from the north to move south. Likewise jet stream ridges are northward moving jaunts in the wind pattern allowing mild southern air to advance northward.\n\nAdd to the situation a strong area of high pressure setting up over the Atlantic Ocean, and it's easy to see why Florida has been seeing such warm temperatures.\n\nWind around high pressure systems moves clockwise. With the placement of the high off the east coast of the country, Southwest Florida's winds have been pumping in mild and muggy air from the south and southeast for several days.\n\nLooking at current forecast data, there does appear to be much in the way of change coming the the atmosphere's patterns this week. That means more record highs could be tied or broken over the course of the next several days.\n\nThrough Thursday, daytime highs look to remain mild peaking well above the seasonable norm for the end of December peaking in the mid and upper 80s.\n\nThe first signs of change in our weather don't appear likely to make a presence until next weekend. This is when, based on the latest guidance, a cold front may try to push through the Southeastern U.S. and influence South Florida's weather.\n\nIt's too early to determine the strength of the front and how much it will impact temperatures and humidity values, but in the coming days our forecast team should get a better idea of how the front will act and what it will do with our weather.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Naples, Fla. warmed to 87 degrees on Sunday afternoon, marking the fifth consecutive day the city has tied or broken a record high.", "author": "Rob Duns", "og": {"site_name": "NBC-2.com", "description": "Naples, Fla. warmed to 87 degrees on Sunday afternoon, marking the fifth consecutive day the city has tied or broken a record high.", "title": "Weather Blog: Naples racks up fifth straight day of record heat", "url": "http://www.nbc-2.com/story/30836284/weather-blog-naples-racks-up-fifth-straight-day-of-record-heat", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wbbh/2015/images/wbbh-og-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wbbh.images.worldnow.com/images/9534922_G.jpg", "title": "Weather Blog: Naples racks up fifth straight day of record heat", "description": "Naples, Fla. warmed to 87 degrees on Sunday afternoon, marking the fifth consecutive day the city has tied or broken a record high.", "card": "summary", "creator": "https://twitter.com/RobDunsTV"}, "wnreadableurl": "weather-blog-naples-racks-up-fifth-straight-day-of-record-heat", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WBBH", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 226927947350099}, "date": "2015/12/27", "google-site-verification": "mDptbh-eRkdCypHvl8_OHFSQs1YZYC-0K23An6xvtxI", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03"}, "article_summary": "Sunday's temp beat the previous record high of 86 degrees that had stood since 1942.\nNaples, Fla. warmed to 87 degrees on Sunday afternoon, marking the fifth consecutive day the city has tied or broken a record high.\nLikewise jet stream ridges are northward moving jaunts in the wind pattern allowing mild southern air to advance northward.\nJet stream troughs are southward moving kinks in the wind flow allowing colder air from the north to move south.\nHowever the weather pattern our region has been locked in is not conducive to typical winter weather, in many ways thanks to the jet stream."}
