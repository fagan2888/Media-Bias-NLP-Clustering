The Amendment contains several exceptions, discussed below, but would affect how employers conduct background checks. The Amendment has been delivered to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office. If he signs the bill, as is expected, the Amendment will become effective 120 days later.\n\nProhibited and Permissible Inquiries and Actions\n\nThe Amendment prohibits employers from requesting or using consumer credit history to (i) make an employment decision pertaining to an applicant or an employee, or (ii) discriminate against an applicant or employee. The term \u201cconsumer credit history\u201d is defined as an individual\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or payment history, as indicated by:\n\na consumer credit report;\n\ncredit score; or\n\ninformation that an employer obtains directly from the individual regarding:\n\ndetails about credit accounts, including the individual\u2019s number of credit accounts, late or missed payments, charged-off debts, items in collections, credit limit, prior credit report inquiries; or\n\nbankruptcies, judgments, or liens.\n\nThe Amendment includes a carve-out permitting employers to request or receive consumer credit history pursuant to a lawful subpoena, court order, or law enforcement investigation.\n\nThe Amendment falls in line with credit check laws passed in recent years in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nExemptions\n\nNotably, the Amendment provides certain exemptions where requesting or using consumer credit history is, indeed, permissible.\n\nEmployer Exemption. The Amendment does not apply to employers that are otherwise required to use an individual\u2019s consumer credit history for employment purposes by federal or state law or by a \u201cself-regulatory organization,\u201d as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Thus, the Amendment does not apply to employers subject to the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d).\n\nPosition Exemptions. The Amendment does not apply to persons applying for positions:\n\nas police officers or peace officers;\n\nsubject to a background investigation by the New York City Department of Investigation;\n\nin which the employee is required to be bonded by federal, state, or city law;\n\nin which the employee is required to possess security clearance under federal or any state\u2019s law;\n\nas a non-clerical employee having regular access to trade secrets (which excludes general proprietary company information, such as handbooks or policies), intelligence information, or national security information;\n\n(i) where the employee would have signatory authority over third-party funds or assets valued at $10,000 or more, or (ii) that involve a fiduciary responsibility to the employer with the authority to enter financial agreements valued at $10,000 or more on behalf of the employer; and\n\nwhere the employee has regular duties that allow the employee to modify digital security systems established to prevent the unauthorized use of the employer\u2019s or clients\u2019 networks or databases.\n\nCovered Employers\n\nThe NYCHRL applies to employers, including employment agencies, with four or more employees (including independent contractors who are \u201cnatural persons\u201d and not themselves employers).\n\nEnforcement\n\nAn employee alleging a violation of the Amendment may either bring a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights or proceed directly to court.\n\nWhat Employers Should Do Now\n\nWhile awaiting the mayor\u2019s signature, New York City employers should:\n\nreview the employer exemption to the Amendment to determine whether it will apply to them generally;\n\nreview the position exemptions to determine if they may request or use consumer credit history in connection with one or more particular positions;\n\nreview (and get ready to revise) background check procedures, as applied;\n\nprepare to train recruiters and human resources professionals who perform background checks on whether consumer credit history may be used at all or for certain positions; and", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York City Council passed amendment to New York City Human Rights Law that would make it an unlawful for employers to use consumer credit history for employment purposes", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On April 16, 2015, the New York City Council passed an amendment (&amp;ldquo;Amendment&amp;rdquo;) to the New York City Human Rights Law (&amp;ldquo;NYCHRL&amp;rdquo;) that, if signed into law, would make it an unlaw", "title": "New York City Expected to Ban the Use of Credit Checks in Employment", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-york-city-expected-to-ban-use-credit-checks-employment", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/Smartphone%20Credit%20Cards%20Coming%20Out%20of%20Screen.jpg?itok=0HdPIKj4", "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "keywords": "Legal, Business, New York City, Consumer Credit History, Employment Purposes, Human Rights Law", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, New York City, Consumer Credit History, Employment Purposes, Human Rights Law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced02\"", "article_summary": "The term \u201cconsumer credit history\u201d is defined as an individual\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or payment history, as indicated by:a consumer credit report;credit score; orinformation that an employer obtains directly from the individual regarding:details about credit accounts, including the individual\u2019s number of credit accounts, late or missed payments, charged-off debts, items in collections, credit limit, prior credit report inquiries; orbankruptcies, judgments, or liens.\nExemptionsNotably, the Amendment provides certain exemptions where requesting or using consumer credit history is, indeed, permissible.\nThursday, April 23, 2015On April 16, 2015, the New York City Council passed an amendment (\u201cAmendment\u201d) to the New York City Human Rights Law (\u201cNYCHRL\u201d) that, if signed into law, would make it an unlawful discriminatory practice for employers to use \u201cconsumer credit history\u201d for employment purposes.\nEnforcementAn employee alleging a violation of the Amendment may either bring a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights or proceed directly to court.\nThe Amendment includes a carve-out permitting employers to request or receive consumer credit history pursuant to a lawful subpoena, court order, or law enforcement investigation."}
