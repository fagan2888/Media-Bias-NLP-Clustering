Jeff Merkley and Republican Monica Wehby differed on what would be the best course of action.\n\nWehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon, called for a nonessential travel ban from the countries in western Africa. Screening for temperature at the airport isn't the most effective method because people can naturally have a lower body temperature or artificially lower their fever in an attempt to seek treatment in the U.S.\n\n\"Doctors know that you isolate the source,\" Wehby said.\n\nMerkley said he favored a partial travel ban.\n\nHe also supports a \"massive international effort\" to build treatment facilities, research a vaccine and explore other more effective methods of screening for early symptoms of the virus.\n\nWehby also criticized the Obama administration for statements it made in September that it was unlikely someone infected with Ebola would reach our shores.\n\n\"When you put out false reassurances ... that's what makes people panic,\" Wehby said. \"Those are the things that cause the problems.\"\n\nBuy Photo Sen.

And 88 percent of those jobs paid between $25,000 and $50,000 per year.\n\nThe problem for middle-income earners is that those jobs haven't returned as the economy started to turn around.\n\nMerkley wants to create jobs by investing in infrastructure like building bridges and dredging ports because those jobs can't be outsourced. He also wants to restore shop classes and increase the capital available to start-ups by allowing them to crowd source for their initial investment.\n\nWehby wants to revise the federal tax code to remove regulations on businesses put in place by the Affordable Care Act, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Dodd-Frank Act, which governs financial institutions and lending practices.\n\n\"My staff spends more time on paperwork than they do on patient care,\" Wehby said.\n\nPartisanship and plagiarism\n\nBuy Photo Monica Wehby talks with the Statesman Journal Editorial Board on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2014, in Salem. (Photo: ASHLEY SMITH / STATESMAN JOURNAL)\n\nWhen asked to explain some of her campaign missteps, including allegations that her website used un-sourced material from national GOP figures and groups, Wehby's response was two-fold.\n\nShe said a former staffer copied health and economic policy materials.\n\n\"We held him accountable. He is no longer with the campaign,\" Wehby said. \"I'm not a career politician. This is my first campaign.\"\n\nMerkley was asked about his reputation for being one of the Senate's most liberal senators and whether that's the best way to represent Oregon and to effect change in Washington D.C.\n\nOregon's junior senator said he's worked with several Republicans on legislation where they could both find common ground.\n\nFor example, he worked with then Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl to write a bill banning the sale of crush videos where small animals are mutilated.\n\n\"I've probably done more of those partnerships than any other first-term senator,\" Merkley said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/1wcBWJM", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The two candidates for U.S. Senate met for the Statesman Journal editorial board Saturday.", "og": {"site_name": "Statesman Journal", "description": "The two candidates for U.S. Senate met for the Statesman Journal editorial board Saturday.", "title": "Wehby, Merkley talk jobs, Ebola and their weaknesses", "url": "http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/10/18/wehby-merkley-talk-jobs-ebola-weaknesses/17507693/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/statesmanjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The two candidates for U.S. Senate met for the Statesman Journal editorial board Saturday.", "title": "Wehby, Merkley talk jobs, Ebola and their weaknesses", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aeba7eaed8598f2f33e981f0e44d135381d438d0/c=397-0-4237-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Salem/2014/10/18/-sal1019wehbyandmerkley5.jpg20141018.jpg", "creator": "@salem_statesman", "site": "@salem_statesman", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815599744", "fb": {"app_id": 138699832852944}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd661f\"", "article_summary": "Senator talked about Ebola, middle income jobs and their political weaknesses during a one-hour editorial board meeting with the Statesman Journal Saturday.\nMerkley wants to create jobs by investing in infrastructure like building bridges and dredging ports because those jobs can't be outsourced.\nBuy Photo Monica Wehby listens to Sen.
