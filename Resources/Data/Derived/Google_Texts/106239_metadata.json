Photo: Mary Babic / Oxfam America\n\nThousands of people from the Marshall Islands have migrated across the world to work in the poultry industry and build a community in Springdale, AR, home of Tyson Foods.\n\nThe booming poultry industry in America is built on the backs of workers on the processing line; they earn low wages of diminishing value, suffer high rates of injury and illness, and have little voice or dignity in their labor. The following story is part of a series by Oxfam to expose the reality of life on the line, and to show you how you can help.\n\nOn a sleepy side street in Springdale, Arkansas, a low-slung building features a barber shop, an attorney\u2019s office--and the Consulate General of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe office squats in the middle of Arkansas because thousands of Marshallese live in Springdale (estimates range from 6,000 to 20,000), making it the largest population of Marshallese outside their own country (pop. 70,000). They follow in the footsteps of John Moody, one of the first Marshallese to work on the line in a Tyson plant, starting in the 1980s. He would return to the islands and spread the word about jobs: jobs that were arduous and dangerous (he lost the tip of his index finger on a saw), but that were regular and full-time. Moody\u2019s name still resonates with the Marshallese.\n\nOn a sleepy side street in Springdale, Arkansas, a squat building houses the Consulate General of the Marshall Islands, along with a barber shop and a law office. Photo: Mary Babic / Oxfam America\n\nAlbious Latior, who today works with the Marshallese community in Springdale through the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center, notes that Moody specifically brought the name of Tyson as the premiere poultry company in the US. \u201cTyson is the biggest one and well known in our community. Even if you work with another poultry company, when people at the island ask you where your son works, they say \u2018Tyson\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Marshallese come to the US as legal residents, admitted as nonimmigrants under the terms of the Compact of Free Association (COFA, first enacted in 1986). However, while they may live, work, study, and pay taxes, they are denied a range of benefits, such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMary Goff, former staff attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas, notes, \u201cThere is a major drawback with the COFA--which is that they are not entitled to certain public benefits. And that ends up being Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid, and SNAP benefits. The Medicaid is a huge problem right now, especially with the Affordable Care Act changes. But they are excluded from that because of their immigration status.\u201d\n\nChased away by radiation\n\nThe Marshall Islands, geographically part of Micronesia, are located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean. The population of slightly over 70,000 is spread out over 1,000 islands and islets. The next largest group of Marshallese is located in Springdale, Arkansas, home of Tyson Foods. Graphic: Google Maps\n\nThe Marshall Islands sit in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. The US conducted dozens of nuclear weapons tests (at least 67) in the Islands between 1946 and 1958. The radioactive fallout rendered some islands uninhabitable; the Marshallese say they are still dealing with the effects of the radiation on the land, water, and air.\n\n\u201cThey dropped the bombs and practiced at our island,\u201d notes Latior. \u201cJust imagine that the fish and people moving around were radiated \u2026 the ocean is radiation, the island is radiation. And we don't want to be there when there is radiation in there. So we have to find somewhere to go to live--to raise good family. So we decided America.\u201d\n\nLatior notes that the Marshallese first moved to Guam, then to California, and eventually to Arkansas-- specifically to work in the poultry industry.\n\nCulture shock for an island people\n\nWhen the Marshallese arrive in the US, they are eager to find full-time jobs with a steady paycheck. Latior notes, the poultry plants \u201care easy to get in. And every Friday they get paid. That's the only reason why they love the poultry.\u201d\n\nHowever, Latior goes on to say that the Marshallese face problems adjusting to an industrialized economy schedule, pace, and hierarchy. He and others refer to the Marshallese having different understandings of time and punctuality, of family relations (the Marshall Islands are a matriarchy, and childcare duties are shared by extended family networks), and of relationships. Recent media pieces have reported on the unique and vulnerable nature of the population, especially as it relates to adoption.\n\nHe believes that this makes it easy for the poultry industry to take advantage of the Marshallese. \u201cThis is their first real job. In the island they were a farmer or fisherman\u2026 As everything is new to them, they [the industry] are taking advantage of them to mistreat them.\u201d\n\nGoff notes that, \u201cThey are not as up to speed with the westernized culture, including all of the workplace rights and responsibilities. So I would say that they are even less educated on their rights in the workplace\u2026 So if the authority says so, that must be what it is and the way it is. So they are exploited heavily in the poultry industry.\u201d\n\nLatior characterizes the Marshallese as \u201cforgiving,\u201d noting that when someone hurts them, they will quickly forgive. \u201cOur culture is, really, we forgive people real fast. Meaning that even if you do something bad to us, we'll forgive you at that moment.\u201d\n\nHe notes that not only are they forgiving, they\u2019re uninformed, and they\u2019re afraid of losing their jobs \u2013 which is not uncommon for many workers in the poultry industry. Of the roughly 250,000 poultry workers in the US, most are minorities, immigrants, or refugees. Many analysts say the industry takes advantage of the special demographics to create a climate of fear. As Rosa, who worked at a Tyson plant in Arkansas, notes, \u201cThey want submissive employees\u2026 For them, a happy employee is a quiet one.\u201d\n\nMany immigrants report they do not get training in a language they understand, and do not know their rights to safety and fair compensation. Many workers report being harassed when they do speak out, threatened with being assigned \u201cpoints\u201d in a disciplinary system, or fired, or even deported. When workers are injured, they are sometimes afraid to report problems.\n\n\u201cThey don't know that they have the right to talk about how they're mistreated at work, and also lot of things they are not knowing that they have the right to know at the workplace,\u201d says Latior. \u201cA lot of Marshallese come to say they was hurt at the workplace but they cannot come forward because they're scared to lose their job.\u201d\n\nSee what it takes to bring chicken to your plate\u2014and then tell Big Poultry to treat its workers right. Sign the petition calling on the top four companies to provide a safe working environment, offer fair pay and benefits, and give their workers a voice.\n\nExperience the interactive story", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of people from the Marshall Islands have migrated across the world to work in the poultry industry and build a community in Springdale, AR, home of Tyson Foods.", "og": {"image": "http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/resized/albious-lives-poultry-worker-advocate-crop_1220x762.jpg", "description": "Thousands of people from the Marshall Islands have migrated across the world to work in the poultry industry and build a community in Springdale, AR, home of Tyson Foods."}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.oxfamamerica.org", "description": "Thousands of people from the Marshall Islands have migrated across the world to work in the poultry industry and build a community in Springdale, AR, home of Tyson Foods.", "creator": "@oxfamamerica", "image": {"src": "http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/resized/albious-lives-poultry-worker-advocate-crop_1220x762.jpg"}, "title": "Big Poultry finds workers in an immigrant community known for its culture of forgiving", "site": "@oxfamamerica", "card": "summary"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "google-site-verification": "Uz6s9nWPnq88xaABinJoT4KnRf-3Dh_1P_nZ2g-i0VA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21c7\"", "article_summary": "Big Poultry finds workers in an immigrant community known for its culture of forgiving November 18, 2015 By Mary BabicAlbious Latior, a native of the Marshall Islands, today works with the Marshallese community in Springdale, AR through the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center.\nOf the roughly 250,000 poultry workers in the US, most are minorities, immigrants, or refugees.\nGraphic: Google MapsThe Marshall Islands sit in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia.\nOn a sleepy side street in Springdale, Arkansas, a squat building houses the Consulate General of the Marshall Islands, along with a barber shop and a law office.\nMary Goff, former staff attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas, notes, \u201cThere is a major drawback with the COFA--which is that they are not entitled to certain public benefits."}
