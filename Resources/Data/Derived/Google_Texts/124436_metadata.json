That\u2019s why it was such a super-duper, nifty idea for Washington to summon into being the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It was created as part of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act back in 2010, but was originally the brainstorm of now Senator Elizabeth Warren. (You may recall she was initially slated to head the agency, but that was derailed by Congress.) So now that they are on the job, keeping citizens safe from big banking fat cats and ensuring financial responsibility and ethics, how are they doing?\n\nWell\u2026 pretty much on par with what you\u2019d expect out of any massive Washington bureaucracy. Right out of the gate, they inflated the cost of refurbishing their new digs by more than 100%, though they\u2019ve tried to deny it.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray evidently is feeling unfamiliar heat after resorting to a disreputable form of sophistry as a substitute for honest discussion and debate. During a June 10 hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, for example, Cordray responded to a question from Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., on the ballooning cost of CFPB\u2019s headquarters renovation by saying: \u201cThis has been out there and taken as gospel in the public record for some time. It\u2019s a fiction of the Washington Examiner that this project started out at $55 million and now has ballooned to higher proportions. There never was any expectation that this project could be completed for $55 million. That is false.\u201d\n\nNot only was it not false, but the Examiner took the figures directly from the General Services Administration. The cost has now skyrocketed from $55 million to $139M and still climbing. Way to keep an eye on things, guys.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all the \u201cgood news\u201d from the CFPB. They\u2019ve been criticized from without and within for creating a toxic environment where they\u2019ve been discriminating against minorities, women and seniors.\n\nAn internal investigation at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year concluded that an agency supervisor allowed an employee to be harassed by colleagues, a symbol of what the probe said was a \u201ctoxic workplace\u201d in one part of the agency.,, \u201cI found that the general environment in Consumer Response is one of exclusion, retaliation, discrimination, nepotism, demoralization, devaluation, and other offensive working conditions which constitute a toxic workplace for many of its employees,\u201d Investigator Misty Raucci will say in her opening remarks.\n\nThis is only one of many, many, many reports on the abuses taking place in the agency, highlighted in particular by one whistle blower from their own ranks. A whistle blower who, by the way, they tried to shut down themselves.\n\nI am the naturalized U.S. citizen that Bureau management referred to as an \u201cf\u2019ing foreigner.\u201d I feel obligated to protect my fellow colleagues who, in their sincere attempts to support the mission of CFPB, are paralyzed from asserting their rights, and even their opinions. I hope, by telling my story, it will further enlighten the committee about the culture of intimidation and retaliation at the Bureau and how that culture makes it very difficult for employees to raise concerns about mistreatment, mismanagement, and abuse of authority. In short, favoritism and cronyism runs rampant at the Bureau. I soon found that voicing a professional dissenting opinion that is in any way at odds with with Bureau management \u2013 even in the smallest of ways \u2013 will result in retaliation.\n\nWay to look out for the little guy. The CFPB is quickly on it\u2019s way to looking more like The Weed Agency than any sort of super hero protecting the citizen on Main Street.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Capsize", "title": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau already sinking into scandal", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/21/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-already-sinking-into-scandal/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-21T17:01:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-21T13:47:03+00:00"}, "keywords": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Elizabeth Warren, scandals,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a83\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why it was such a super-duper, nifty idea for Washington to summon into being the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau already sinking into scandalposted at 1:01 pm on June 21, 2014 by Jazz ShawIt\u2019s great to have Uncle Sam looking out for the little guy, isn\u2019t it?\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray evidently is feeling unfamiliar heat after resorting to a disreputable form of sophistry as a substitute for honest discussion and debate.\nIt was created as part of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act back in 2010, but was originally the brainstorm of now Senator Elizabeth Warren.\nThey\u2019ve been criticized from without and within for creating a toxic environment where they\u2019ve been discriminating against minorities, women and seniors."}
