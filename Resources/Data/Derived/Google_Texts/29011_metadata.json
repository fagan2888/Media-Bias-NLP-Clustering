The other large player, Buckyballs, stopped sales in 2012 and recently agreed to establish a trust fund to cover the costs of recalling its product.\n\nThe BB-size magnetic spheres can be molded together in sculptures or artistic designs.\n\nBut the CPSC maintains that the magnets are dangerous. The agency cites nearly 3,000 incidents of children swallowing the 5-millimeter balls during a five-year period from 2009 through 2013. Some of the accidents required emergency surgery because if two or more balls are swallowed, they can bind intestinal tissue together.\n\nQu said he is not currently selling magnets because he\u2019s not sure how long the temporary stay will remain in effect, and because he can\u2019t predict how the court will ultimately rule on his challenge to the CPSC\u2019s ban.\n\nZen Magnets also is battling the safety agency on a related case over the CPSC\u2019s proposed order requiring Zen to recall the magnet sets already sold.\n\nA decision on that case is expected in May.\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Zen Magnets wins stay against federal ban on magnetic balls", "title": "Denver\u2019s Zen Magnets wins stay against federal ban on magnetic balls", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/03/denvers-zen-magnets-wins-stay-against-federal-ban-on-magnetic-balls/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__BZ12ZENMAGNETS3_07_12_hc1HC_0384p1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__BZ12ZENMAGNETS3_07_12_hc1HC_0384p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T14:16:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T10:55:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb668\"", "article_summary": "Denver-based Zen Magnets has won a temporary stay against a federal regulation that would ban the sale of tiny magnetic balls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s far from time to post the \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 banner, but this is a giant and tangible indicator of momentum,\u201d said Zen Magnets founder Shihan Qu.\nZen Magnets is the last surviving major magnetic-ball company.\nZen Magnets also is battling the safety agency on a related case over the CPSC\u2019s proposed order requiring Zen to recall the magnet sets already sold.\nThe ban was scheduled to take effect April 1, but under a challenge filed by Zen, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday issued a stay."}
