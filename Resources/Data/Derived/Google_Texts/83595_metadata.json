Currently, Clinton has a lead with that group, besting her rival 69 percent to 27 percent. She will presumably campaign, as she has done elsewhere, on the promise of four more years of President Obama\u2019s policies. Will that be enough? Maybe not.\n\nIt\u2019s early yet, and many potential voters are still getting to know Sanders and his message of income inequality, healthcare for all, and other social reforms. Also, the most recent referendum on the Obama presidency was in 2014, during which black turnout plummeted, even accounting for the usual slump in non-presidential contests, ten percent of African Americans defected to Republicans. In that election, Democrats lost every state in which Bill and Hillary Clinton campaigned. At the time, a poll showed that only 53 percent of African-Americans held a \u201cvery favorable\u201d view of Clinton.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Gets a Taste of What Could Be a Painful 2016\n\nThe lesson is that the high black turnout and solid support for the Democrat ticket in 2008 and 2012 was largely because of Barack Obama. That enthusiasm may have waned, since many African-Americans feel Obama has failed the black community. Hillary\u2019s promise of allegiance to the president may not carry much weight.\n\nUnemployment among black men is nearly 9 percent today, more than twice the rate for whites. In January 2009, the month Obama took office, the unemployment rate for white men was 8.3 percent and for blacks 15.8 percent; by this one measure, the divide between white and black employment has gotten worse under President Obama.\n\nThe disparity between black and white worker incomes has widened since 2009. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in the third quarter of last year median weekly pay for black men was $652, compared to $919 for white males, a difference of 41 percent. In the final quarter of 2008, before Obama took office, that difference was 35 percent.\n\nAfrican Americans have made almost no progress in educational achievement over the past eight years, with only 11 percent meeting three benchmarks on ACT tests of high school achievement, compared to 49 percent of whites. This does not stir our president, who gave up efforts at school reform when alerted by the teachers\u2019 unions that he might lose their endorsement in 2012.\n\nRelated: Sanders Lashes Out at Clinton in Contentious Democratic Debate\n\nBlacks are right to feel slighted. Obama could have done more to move the needle on African American earnings and achievement, but at some risk. Controversial news anchor Don Lemon landed in hot water in 2013 when he suggested that blacks might improve their lot by finishing school and stemming out-of-wedlock births \u2013 riffing on a Talking Points broadcast by Fox anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nLemon said, \u201cStop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year.\u201d On marriage, he was equally forthright: \u201cMore than 72 percent of children in the African American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.\u201d\n\nThe furor over Lemon\u2019s pitch was sadly predictable. A writer on the black website Clutch dismissed Lemon\u2019s nostrums, arguing he was ignoring \u201cthe country\u2019s history of institutional racism and systematic oppression.\u201d The author resists Lemon\u2019s \u201crespectability politics play [which] sends a dangerous message that the blame for oppression lies with the oppressed. He puts the onus on us to change to \u2018earn\u2019 basic rights and privileges that are extended to other races, no matter their flaws.\u201d In other words, why even try?\n\nIn a Fathers\u2019 Day speech in 2008, then Senator Obama sailed into this conversation, telling a packed black church in Chicago, \u201cWe need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception.\u201d The candidate observed, \u201cMore than half of all black children live in single-parent households,\u201d a number that he claimed had doubled in his lifetime. On education, he told the applauding congregation, \u201cDon\u2019t get carried away with that eighth-grade graduation; you\u2019re supposed to graduate from eighth grade.\u201d In an earlier speech in 2008, Obama had also pushed family responsibilities, lecturing them for giving \u201ccold Popeyes\u201d to their kids for breakfast.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Clinton\u2019s Lead over Sanders Is Shrinking Fast\n\nHe could have pushed that theme more consistently, but he desperately needed blacks to turn out for him in 2012 as they did in 2008, and this line of persuasion isn\u2019t too popular. In 2008, Obama received 96 percent of the black vote; in 2012, it dipped to 93 percent. It could have gone lower.\n\nKevin Johnson, the senior pastor of the Bright Hope Baptist Church and a long-time Obama supporter, wrote a scathing criticism of the president in 2013, titled \u201cA president for everyone, except Black people.\u201d In his piece, he noted that Obama had appointed fewer blacks in his cabinet than Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, and that \u201cAfrican-Americans are in a worse position than they were before he became president.\u201d He also decried \u201cthe president\u2019s poor record in catapulting an economic and empowerment agenda for the African-American community\u2026\u201d and wondered why blacks were still supporting the president.\n\nObama did revisit the theme of taking responsibility in 2013, telling graduates of Morehouse College, there is \"no time for excuses\" for African-American men. But, he has also voiced sympathy with those who see racism as the biggest threat to blacks. Obama has found, according to black firebrand Cornel West, the middle ground. He says, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t realize that a great leader, a statesperson, doesn\u2019t just occupy middle ground\u2026. The middle ground is not the place to go if you\u2019re going to show courage and vision.\u201d This moderation, frustrating to both those advocating reforms in the black community and in society, prompts Johnson to note in his op-ed, \u201cObama is more of an historical leader than he is a transformational leader for the African-American community.\u201d Obama wasted his opportunity to boost the fortunes of blacks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders turn to South Carolina, both will be hoping to w", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton Has a Tenuous Hold on Black Voters", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/20/Why-Hillary-Clinton-Has-Tenuous-Hold-Black-Voters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01202016_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/20/Why-Hillary-Clinton-Has-Tenuous-Hold-Black-Voters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01202016_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lizpeek"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders turn to South Carolina, both will be hoping to w", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That enthusiasm may have waned, since many African-Americans feel Obama has failed the black community.\nIn 2008, Obama received 96 percent of the black vote; in 2012, it dipped to 93 percent.\nIn that election, Democrats lost every state in which Bill and Hillary Clinton campaigned.\nAt the time, a poll showed that only 53 percent of African-Americans held a \u201cvery favorable\u201d view of Clinton.\nThe disparity between black and white worker incomes has widened since 2009."}
