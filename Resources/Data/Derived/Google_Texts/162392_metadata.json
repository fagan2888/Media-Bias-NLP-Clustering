And Fantasy Football is a primary reason. And as long as games are played, regardless of scandal or turmoil, fans will still be invested. I\u2019m guilty \u2013 and admittedly ashamed \u2013 of it too.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t mean these issues should be ignored \u2013 and in the words of my friend, Arash Markhazi (@ArashMarkazi) on Twitter: \u201cSports is often an escape from reality but sometimes, such as times like these, it can be a force to help change reality.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why I applaud any pregame show, postgame show, or game itself that took time to address the issues at hand. I don\u2019t mind debates about Rice, Peterson, Ray McDonald or Greg Hardy being \u201cshoved down our throats\u201d as some would like to put it \u2013 because spreading awareness about the severity of domestic violence and child abuse is of the utmost importance \u2013 and the games themselves have a captive audience, whether some fans want to hear about it or not.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re going to enjoy \u2013 or at least pay attention to \u2013 a league with all of these current problems, then I believe it\u2019s a responsibility to not only understand them, but to raise awareness and educate others as well.\n\nESPN\u2019s Darren Rovell reminded us that October is Domestic Violence Awareness month. The NFL has an obligation to that campaign, along with its normal observation of Breast Cancer Awareness month.\n\nAnd as football fans, we have an obligation to listen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the heels of a depressing, maddening and sickening week in the NFL, I have a shameful confession that reflects the power and popularity of the league: After the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson news broke, and after the magnitude and severity of their actions had properly set in, my next instinct...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "b6228bea1d7671a78a13a75050035f3a"}, "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "On the heels of a depressing, maddening and sickening week in the NFL, I have a shameful confession that reflects the power and popularity of the league: After the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson news\u2026", "title": "Commentary: Watching football comes with a new responsibility re: DV and Child Abuse", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2014/09/14/commentary-watching-football-comes-with-a-new-responsibility-re-dv-and-child-abuse/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/promo235019850.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/promo235019850.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@q13fox", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
