Claire Levy.\n\nBecker will be sworn into office next month to represent House District 13, which includes part of Boulder County and all of Clear Creek, Gilpin, Grand and Jackson counties.\n\nThe 43-year-old Democrat bested two other candidates to win Levy\u2019s seat. Levy resigned effective Oct. 31 to serve as the executive director of the Colorado Center on Law and Policy.\n\nBecker will be the third new face when the 2014 legislative session begins. Earlier this month, Republicans Bernie Herpin and George Rivera were sworn in as senators, replacing Democrats John Morse of Colorado Springs and Angela Giron of Publo, who were recalled for their gun votes.\n\nBecker will have some big shoes to fill. Levy previously served as House Judiciary Committee chair and would have chaired the Joint Budget Committee had she finished her term.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known KC for several years now, and I think very highly of her,\u201d Majority Leader Dickey Lee Hullinghorst, whose district includes part of Boulder, said in a news release. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific that House District 13 will continue to be represented by a strong woman.\u201d\n\nBecker is in the final year of a four-year term on the Boulder City Council, where she was the council\u2019s representative on the Boulder Urban Renewal Authority and was the city\u2019s representative to the Denver Regional Council of Governments. Before that she worked for the Department of the Interior for six years, notably on public land issues in Colorado and Wyoming.\n\n\u201cI have a solid background on Colorado\u2019s water, public land and environmental issues,\u201d she said, in the release.\n\nShe has a law degree from the Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore., and a master\u2019s from the Burns School of Real Estate at the University of Denver\u2019s Sturm School of Business. She also spent two years in the real estate business.\n\nBecker and her husband, Miles Kunkel, are parents of two young children.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Angela Giron,Bernie Herpin,Claire Levy,Dickey Lee Hullinghorst,George Rivera,John Morse,KC Becker,Miles Kunkel", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Boulder City Councilwoman KC Becker this afternoon won a vacancy committee appointment to the House district now held by Rep.
