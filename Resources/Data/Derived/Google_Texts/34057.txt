Kathryn Bigelow, the director of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, is tackling another angle of the war on terror in a new project she’s developing for HBO.

Multiple entertainment sites are reporting that Bigelow is collaborating with Somali rapper K’naan Warsame––who will write and direct––on an HBO show tentatively titled The Recruiters.

What’s it about? Well, it’s set in Minnesota and the idea is to “draw open an iron curtain behind which viewers will see the highly impenetrable world of Jihadi recruitment.”

Yes, in a time of great concern about terrorist groups like ISIS recruiting people from the West, HBO may end up actually airing a show focused on just that.

Eat your heart out, Homeland.
