Rick Scott for adopting policies that help the richest Floridians, like lowering corporate income taxes, and harm the poorest and working class families, such as not supporting a raise in the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for them to vote. They have to know that it matters,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged Democrats to reach out to voters who could benefit from a turnaround in those policies.\n\n\u201cExplain, explain, explain and figure out how to physically get people to the polls,\u201d Clinton said in a 41-minute speech. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, if you can reach Florida\u2019s portion of those 50 million people \u2026 you will have the darnedest celebration on election night you ever saw.\u201d\n\nClinton illustrated his point by saying that Democrat Alex Sink should have won a special election to replace the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young in a Pinellas County congressional district. Sink was defeated by Young\u2019s onetime aide David Jolly.\n\n\u201cAlex Sink won the independent votes by almost twice the margin President Obama did. But the registered Democrats did not turn out,\u201d Clinton said, noting that Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe won his election because black voter turnout matched that in the general election. \u201cIf they can do it, you can do it,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThe Clinton event raised $1.1 million \u2014 topping previous earnings for the annual \u201cLeadership Blue Gala\u201d fundraiser, formerly called the \u201cJefferson-Jackson Dinner\u201d \u2014 and nearly 1,600 supporters were expected to attend the event at the Westin Diplomat Resort & Spa, another historic high, according to Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant.\n\nParty loyalists were united in their enthusiasm for ousting Scott from office if not in their support for his Democratic challengers, former Senate Minority Leader Nan Rich and onetime Republican Gov. Charlie Crist.\n\nTant echoed the overarching topic of the day\u2019s caucus meetings \u2014 the importance of getting Democrats to the polls to prevent the \u201chorrendous\u201d possibility that Scott wins a second term.\n\n\u201cWe are going to build the largest field plan that the Florida Democratic Party has ever seen,\u201d she pledged.\n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said the DNC has created a \u201cvast and sophisticated voter file\u201d called \u201cProject Ivy\u201d that it is sharing with state parties to help in turning out voters.\n\nBlack-caucus leaders reminded members that turnout among black voters dropped significantly in the 2010 election, from 75 percent in 2008 to 49 percent in the mid-term. Now, black leaders have targeted 33 counties in which they hope to organize efforts to improve turnout in November.\n\nCaucus chairman Henry Crespo Jr. said Democrats cannot win without support from black voters.\n\n\u201cThe state party of Florida needs the black caucus in 2014 and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the Hispanic caucus earlier in the day, Latino lawmakers chided the GOP-dominated Legislature for playing \u201celection-year politics\u201d by passing laws aimed at helping Scott, who campaigned four years ago on bringing an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida.\n\nIn a marked turnaround, Scott this spring signed into law measures aimed at soothing relations with Latino voters, including one that will allow undocumented students to pay cheaper, in-state tuition at colleges and universities and another that makes undocumented immigrants eligible for the Florida Bar.\n\nSen. Darren Soto, a Puerto Rican Democrat from Orlando, advised his fellow Hispanics to remind their friends and families that Democrats had been pushing those issues for a decade to no avail.\n\n\u201cRemember the history of \u2026 who doesn\u2019t need polls to tell them when to side with you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Hispanic caucus meeting also highlighted the significance of the upcoming gubernatorial race for Democrats on the national level as they seek to put the governor\u2019s mansion in Democratic hands in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Political Director Raul Alvillar told the Hispanic caucus that the national party\u2019s commitment to Hispanics \u201cis stronger than ever.\u201d Alvillar said later that Project Ivy contains years of information regarding Hispanic voters\n\n\u201cWe have some of the best data in the country. \u2026 We know where all these Hispanic voters are. We\u2019re very targeted and we\u2019re able to go with laser precision and say, \u2018You need to vote Democratic because of all of the issues that the senator was speaking about,\u2019 \u201d Alvillar said. \u201cWhen people realize that and they keep hearing stuff that the Republicans are spewing, they\u2019re going to realize that these folks really do not care about the Hispanic vote. That stuff will also help us get our Hispanics out to vote, too.\u201d\n\nHispanics and blacks should pool their resources, Miami-Dade Democratic Party Chairwoman Annette Taddeo told the black caucus.\n\n\u201cWe need to create a black and brown coalition,\u201d she said.\n\nRich posed for pictures and made appearances at all of the Democratic caucus meetings in the morning, reminding attendees of her lifelong support for progressive issues such as gay rights, abortion rights and public education in frequent, if not subtle, swipes at her primary opponent.\n\n\u201cI am a lifelong Democrat and I will not be having any epiphanies when I get into the governor\u2019s mansion,\u201d Rich said.\n\nCrist did not appear until just before the 7 p.m. dinner featuring Clinton. He told reporters he had been at an event in Nantucket, where the Democratic Governors Association gave the committee backing his run for governor $500,000, matching the same amount the group contributed to Crist\u2019s committee in April.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m very grateful for that again. They\u2019re all in. We\u2019re all in. And now it\u2019s great to be back in South Florida and I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to be with these wonderful people,\u201d Crist said, hugging and posing for pictures in a crush of supporters.\n\nRepublicans continued to hammer Crist for failing to release his wife Carole\u2019s tax returns. A plane towing a banner reading \u201cwww.CharliesTaxReturns.com #WhatsCristHiding,\u201d paid for by the Republican Party of Florida, flew overhead prior to Crist\u2019s arrival.\n\nRPOF Chairwoman Leslie Dougher met briefly with reporters to blast Crist for the tax returns and for his absence earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d Dougher said. \u201cThe more you hide something, the more people want to see it.\u201d\n\nBut Crist, flocked by supporters upon his entrance to the hotel, dismissed the demands.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even consider asking Carole to do that unless Rick Scott would be truly transparent and answer 75 questions that he wouldn\u2019t answer under the federal investigation of his company,\u201d Crist said, referring to an investigation of Scott\u2019s former company, Columbia/HCA. \u201cHe\u2019s the most untransparent governor in the history of Florida. And for him to make transparency an issue is a gift to me.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "bill clinton,bill young,homepage,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CLINTON-HOLLYWOOD-435-23.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Hammering on a theme heard throughout the day, former President Bill Clinton warned Democrats they won't win critical races this fall if they don't figure out", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8d0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are going to build the largest field plan that the Florida Democratic Party has ever seen,\u201d she pledged.\nBlack-caucus leaders reminded members that turnout among black voters dropped significantly in the 2010 election, from 75 percent in 2008 to 49 percent in the mid-term.\n\u2026 We know where all these Hispanic voters are.\nCaucus chairman Henry Crespo Jr. said Democrats cannot win without support from black voters.\nClinton Says Dems Need To Get Voters To \u2018Show Up\u2019By Dara Kam, The News Service of Florida // June 29, 2014URGED DEMOCRATS TO REACH OUT TO VOTERSHOLLYWOOD, FLORDA \u2013 Hammering on a theme heard throughout the day, former President Bill Clinton warned Democrats they won\u2019t win critical races this fall if they don\u2019t figure out how to get voters to cast ballots."}
