Photo: Supplied\n\nWhen tragedy strikes, a few minutes can be the difference between life and death. So it was for a 26-year-old Doonside driver, who was saved by the keen eye and quick thinking of two Westmead Hospital nurses on their way home from work.\n\nThe man became trapped behind the wheel of his car after it collided with another on the Great Western Highway near Pendle Hill on Saturday afternoon. He was slumped in a way that cut off his breathing, said Ian Badham, founding director of CareFlight, which attended the scene.\n\nThe two nurses, from Westmead's intensive care unit, were driving home after a shift when they spotted the accident, ran over and tipped the man\u2019s head up to re-open his blocked airway.\n\n\"It's fair to say they were at the right place at the right time,\" a spokesperson from Westmead Hospital said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Badham said the man would not have survived otherwise, and that the nurses' basic act was one everybody should be able to perform in an emergency.\n\n\"They knew what to do...they had to simply tip his head back. Without that simple act of knowing what to do and doing it quickly, he would not have been alive when the paramedics arrived,\" he said.\n\n\"Anybody can do what the nurses did with just a little bit of training. To be able to recognise that somebody\u2019s in difficulty...a simple producedure and you can save a life.\"\n\nCareFlight medical director Dr Alan Garner, who attended the scene, said the man suffered head, neck and chest injuries, while a woman and child in the other car escaped with minor injuries. He was in an unknown condition in Westmead Hospital on Saturday night.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "For a lucky Sydney driver, two nurses were in the right place at the right time", "title": "Pendle Hill car crash: off-the-clock nurses to the rescue", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/pendle-hill-car-crash-offtheclock-nurses-to-the-rescue-20140816-104z82.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/0/4/z/8/r/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.104z82.png/1408188373904.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/0/4/z/8/r/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.104z82.png/1408188373904.jpg"}, "title": "Pendle Hill car crash: off-the-clock nurses to the rescue", "description": "For a lucky Sydney driver, two nurses were in the right place at the right time", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "For a lucky Sydney driver, two nurses were in the right place at the right time"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90f5\"", "article_summary": "\"It's fair to say they were at the right place at the right time,\" a spokesperson from Westmead Hospital said.\nHe was in an unknown condition in Westmead Hospital on Saturday night.\nSo it was for a 26-year-old Doonside driver, who was saved by the keen eye and quick thinking of two Westmead Hospital nurses on their way home from work.\nThe man became trapped behind the wheel of his car after it collided with another on the Great Western Highway near Pendle Hill on Saturday afternoon.\nThe two passing nurses had already saved the man's life by the time paramedics arrived."}
