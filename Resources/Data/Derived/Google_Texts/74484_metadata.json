He sided with the NLRB in 18 of those decisions, agreeing with the agency\u2019s interpretation that an employer committed unfair labor practices.\n\nIn all of those cases, the blog said, \u201cdeference to the NLRB has had favorable consequences for labor and unions.\u201d\n\nEven in the four cases in which he did not defer entirely to the NLRB, Judge Garland\u2019s decisions \u201csuggest an outlook that is generally favorable to union activity,\u201d the analysis found.\n\nIn two of these four cases, for example \u2014 Carpenters and Millwrights, Local Union 2471 v. NLRB (2007) and Guard Publishing Co. v. NLRB (2009) \u2014 Judge Garland \u201cupheld the aspects of the NLRB\u2019s decisions that were favorable to the union involved, and overturned only the part of the NLRB\u2019s decision in each case that was favorable to the employer.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama nominated Judge Garland, chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, last week to fill the vacancy created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans say they won\u2019t allow a vote on the nomination, preferring to wait for a new president to nominate a candidate early next year.\n\nThe White House is portraying Judge Garland as a moderate not influenced by ideology; conservative activists are characterizing him as a liberal who would shift the balance of the high court to the left.\n\nJudge Garland\u2019s writings show a \u201cstrong preference\u201d for agency precedent, the analysis said. In a 2006 ruling in Ceridian Corp v. NLRB, for example, he said the Court of Appeals should not reverse the agency\u2019s findings unless its determinations are \u201chopelessly incredible,\u201d \u201cself-contradictory\u201d or \u201cpatently unsupportable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough Judge Garland\u2019s decisions speak primarily of his deference to the NLRB, the effect of that deference is favorable to labor and unions,\u201d the blog post said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An analysis of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland's judicial decisions on labor disputes has found that he nearly always sides with unions.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An analysis of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland\u2019s judicial decisions on labor disputes has found that he nearly always sides with unions.", "title": "Merrick Garland rulings consistently side with labor unions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/21/garland-rulings-consistently-side-labor-unions/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/17/Senate_Supreme_Court.JPEG-0dea4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/17/Senate_Supreme_Court.JPEG-0dea4.jpg", "description": "An analysis of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland's judicial decisions on labor disputes has found that he nearly always sides with unions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Merrick Garland rulings consistently side with labor unions"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Law Crime, National Labor Relations Board, Merrick Garland"}, "article_summary": "An analysis of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland\u2019s judicial decisions on labor disputes has found that he nearly always sides with unions.\nJudge Garland\u2019s writings show a \u201cstrong preference\u201d for agency precedent, the analysis said.\nHe sided with the NLRB in 18 of those decisions, agreeing with the agency\u2019s interpretation that an employer committed unfair labor practices.\nThe White House is portraying Judge Garland as a moderate not influenced by ideology; conservative activists are characterizing him as a liberal who would shift the balance of the high court to the left.\nThe onlabor.org website, a blog run by Harvard Law School professors Benjamin Sachs and Jack Goldsmith, found that Judge Garland has written the majority opinion in 22 cases that considered appeals of National Labor Relations Board decisions between 1997 and this year."}
