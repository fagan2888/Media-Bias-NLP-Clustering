Double down: Buono compares Christie to fist-pumping ‘Jersey Shore’ clown

Chris Christie minted another YouTube hit by answering a mid-debate cheap shot from Democrat Barbara Buono with grace and magnanimity, leveling her in the process. Yogi Berra famously said, “it’s never over ’til it’s over,” but this race is over. And Buono must know it, because she’s not even attempting a course correction. Here she is straining to compare Christie to buffoonish reality television star “The Situation:”

HOST: “Senator, one of the most memorable points that I thought came from last night is when they asked you to say something nice about the Governor, and you mentioned that he does well on late night TV. I thought it was a bit of a jab, and I was just wondering though, if you got the opportunity to do some late night TV, wouldn’t you jump at that opportunity to spread your message?” BUONO: “I’m thrilled that the governor is good with his wisecracks at night, but the fact of the matter is that this election is about more than just reality TV. Do we really need another reality TV show? I mean we already have ‘The Situation’ do we really need ‘The Governor’, I don’t think so.”

If only Christie had those abs. Refreshingly, Barbara Buono has no regrets. She doesn’t regret getting snarky in the one moment of the debate that was specifically designed to pause the partisan acrimony. She doesn’t regret a single one of her 154 votes for tax increases. And based on the clip above, she doesn’t regret getting called out as “shrill and petty” by the New Jersey media. Two polls. Two blow-outs. Goodnight, Barb — and stay classy.
