Now that many Americans \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 are decrying Trump's candidacy, he decided to launch it at his wife's urging.\n\n\u201cI showed it to a couple of people who had a chuckle,\" Calabrese told USA TODAY. \"I wasn't going to do anything and then my wife said, 'Hey that Donald Trump website, you should launch that.'\u201d\n\nThe site touts Cape Breton's beauty and other lifestyle attractions. Like the rest of Canada, however, its social policies may appeal more to Democrats than to Republicans who oppose Obamacare and gun control: Canada has socialized medicine and stringent gun control.\n\n\u201cI don't think Republicans fully understood what happens here,\u201d he said. Even so, \"we just thought, 'Hey, we have a severe population problem. Let's get out in front and say if you're going to move to Canada, look at this beautiful little option.'\u201d\n\nCalabrese initially responded to emails personally, but the demand for information has been so overwhelming that he has posted helpful links to various government agency websites.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was having fun responding to them because their questions were genuine,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought this is great, this is such a blast. Then they started coming in every few seconds, I wasn't able to keep up.\n\nThe deluge was so great that the Destination Cape Breton Association, a non-governmental tourism board, partnered with Calabrese and assembled a team to respond to a backlog of requests for information.\n\n\u201cI think that because he presented it as a beautiful destination, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s an interest piqued,\u201d said the board's CEO, Mary Tulle.\n\nTulle said the group's website has gotten 380,000 unique visitors of its own since the site went viral, up from 12,000 over the same period last year. \u201cWe (had) three of our summer season team come in ... so I had five staff dedicated to handling online requests.\u201d\n\nThose requests were mostly about immigration, employment and housing, suggesting people are serious about relocating and not just asking about Cape Breton out of idle curiosity.\n\nThe interest could not come at a better time for an island that has seen its coal mining and steel industries shrink. The full-time population is just under 150,000, about 30,000 fewer than 50 years ago. Many have left to seek jobs in the oil fields of western Canada.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur population decline is so severe right now, the graduating class in our school system is double the size of the kindergarten class,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe island's decline has upset Calabrese, a native Cape Bretoner who takes pride in promoting his home as one of the most scenic spots in Canada. \u201cWhen you look at travel magazines, Cape Breton is always ranking in the top of the world for beautiful islands,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people have an international reputation for friendliness and hospitality.\u201d\n\nCalabrese said the island's Gaelic , French and Native Canadian influences, its folk music traditions and peacefulness make it an appealing destination to Trump haters.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I think of Donald Trump is irrelevant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, he is the most famous in the universe and the things that he says on the campaign trail, that way of thinking is pretty much the opposite of here.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 WFAA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The prospect of a Donald Trump&nbsp;presidency has sparked&nbsp;a flood of interest in a&nbsp;Nova Scotia island where a local booster is beckoning American Trump haters to live&nbsp;if the Donald&nbsp;is elected.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "WFAA", "description": "The prospect of a Donald Trump\u00a0presidency has sparked\u00a0a flood of interest in a\u00a0Nova Scotia island where a local booster is beckoning American Trump haters to live\u00a0if the Donald\u00a0is elected.", "title": "Nova Scotia isle lures those vowing to move to Canada if Trump elected", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.wfaa.com/photo/2016/02/29/nova%20scotia_1456753980484_654018_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.wfaa.com/news/politics/nova-scotia-isle-lures-those-vowing-to-move-to-canada-if-trump-elected/61274646", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.wfaa.com", "description": "The prospect of a Donald Trump\u00a0presidency has sparked\u00a0a flood of interest in a\u00a0Nova Scotia island where a local booster is beckoning American Trump haters to live\u00a0if the Donald\u00a0is elected.", "title": "Nova Scotia isle lures those vowing to move to Canada if Trump elected", "image": {"src": "http://content.wfaa.com/photo/2016/02/29/nova%20scotia_1456753980484_654018_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "WFAA", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212557628824992}, "keywords": "donald trump,president,united states,canada,nova scotia,Politics,News,Life", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "\"I wasn't going to do anything and then my wife said, 'Hey that Donald Trump website, you should launch that.\nCape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada.\n(Photo: C.
