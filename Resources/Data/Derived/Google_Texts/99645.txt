Saturday Night Live opened its 40th season last night with a 4.0 rating in metered-market households and a 2.1 in adults 18-49 in the Local People Meters. The show, hosted by Chris Pratt, was down 14% in households and down 22% in 18-49 from last fallâ€™s premiere hosted by Tina Fey but equaled the numbers for the May finale hosted by another SNL alum, Andy Samberg.
