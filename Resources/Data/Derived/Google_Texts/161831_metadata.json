Workers likely weighed their options for getting coverage either through their employer or through an Obamacare health exchange.\n\nIn addition, in some states, some low-wage workers may not have qualified for a subsidy for their health coverage because their state chose to not expand access to Medicaid. Under the health-reform law, individuals who earn less than 200 percent of the poverty level couldn't qualify for a subsidy. Instead, these people were eligible to receive coverage through Medicaid\u2014but that was only if their state opted for the Medicaid expansion.\n\nRead MoreYour employer's health plan will cost you\n\n\n\nWal-Mart said it anticipated that more workers would seek health coverage, but the actual numbers topped their projections. Trussell said that with the year now halfway complete, it's \"fair to say they probably have a better gauge now just on how many associates of theirs will participate in the plan.\"\n\nAlthough he said the retailer will more than likely face this headwind all year, he views it as mostly one-time in nature. Trussell has a \"hold\" rating and $75 price target on the company.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Wal-Mart Stores earnings are taking a hit as more of its U.S. workers sign up for health-care coverage.
