The Democratic strategist decided to give President Obama some much-needed advice on how to raise his favorability with Americans.\n\n\u201cI think the best thing he can do is take a toke on the mayor of Toronto\u2019s crack pipe, because his numbers are about 48,\u201d Carville said.\n\nThe former Bill Clinton campaign manager referenced Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who recently admitted to smoking crack cocaine months after Gawker reported there was a video of him doing so.\n\nCarville isn\u2019t the only one joking Obama should take a page out of Ford\u2019s playbook. \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jay Leno cracked \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 one at the President and Ford\u2019s expense last week, saying Obama is better off \u201csmoking crack than passing Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFollowing the disastrous rollout of the president\u2019s signature healthcare law, Obama\u2019s approval ratings sagged to 39 percent, a two-year low. But contrary to President Obama\u2019s dismal numbers, Ford\u2019s actually ticked up to 44 percent from 39 percent in the wake of his confession.\n\nCarville, though, tried to defend the president\u2019s dwindling favorability with Americans. He said Obama\u2019s record speaks for itself, despite what the numbers show.\n\n\u201cI think we can stop putting the nails in the coffin here. We can admit that there\u2019s some real, deep, fundamental problems with this president. But I think we\u2019re throwing the dirt here too soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deficit is dropping as a percentage of GDP faster than any time since World War II. He saved the auto industry. Health care costs are flattening better than any time in the last 20 years. Teenage pregnancy is at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nh/t POLITICO", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The American people aren't too thrilled with President Barack Obama following the disastrous rollout of Obamacare, but Democratic strategist James Carville knows just how the President can get back in their good graces: take a toke off the mayor of Toronto's crack pipe.", "title": "[WATCH] Dem strategist Carville says Obama should \"take a toke\" on...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/11/James-Carville-600x340.jpg", "height": 340}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/11/11/watch-dem-strategist-carville-obama-should-take-a-toke-on-toronto-mayors-crack-pipe/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "world-war-ii", "published_time": "2013-11-11T11:18:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T17:50:56+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1afa\"", "article_summary": "The Democratic strategist decided to give President Obama some much-needed advice on how to raise his favorability with Americans.\n\u201cI think the best thing he can do is take a toke on the mayor of Toronto\u2019s crack pipe, because his numbers are about 48,\u201d Carville said.\nBut contrary to President Obama\u2019s dismal numbers, Ford\u2019s actually ticked up to 44 percent from 39 percent in the wake of his confession.\nCarville appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Monday and discussed Obama\u2019s tanking approval ratings with hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.\nThe American people aren\u2019t too thrilled with President Barack Obama following the disastrous rollout of Obamacare, but Democratic strategist James Carville knows just how the president can get back in their good graces: take a toke off the mayor of Toronto\u2019s crack pipe."}
