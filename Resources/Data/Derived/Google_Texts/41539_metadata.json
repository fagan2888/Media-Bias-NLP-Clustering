If someone\u2019s death meets this criteria, the body is required to be examined afterwards in order to determine why and how they died.\n\nThe word \"autopsy\" has been used since the 17th century, but the practice dates back to 3000 BC, when the Egyptions became one of the first civilizations to dissect the body and remove organs during mummification.

Forensic autopsies are done to define the cause and manner of death, and are often done to serve legal issues: in the U.S., deaths are classified as either natural, accidental, homicidal, suicidal, or undetermined. Clinical autopsies, on the other hand, are performed in order to provide scientists with greater information about pathology and also to keep a check on hospital care and ensure doctors are providing the best services they possibly can. Autopsies are done by forensic pathologists \u2014 physicians trained in examining corpses \u2014 also considered medical examiners.\n\nThe word \"autopsy\" is derived from ancient Greek, autopsia, which means \"to see for oneself.\" In many ancient civilizations, autopsies were considered sacrilegous, as disfiguring the dead might prevent them from going into the afterlife. One of the first times it was used, however, was in ancient Egypt. The practice was used irregularly throughout Europe until the Renaissance, and in the 19th century the medical researcher Rudolf Virchow created some guidelines and standards for future autopsies.\n\nThough it may seem like a morbid job, autopsies actually provided the field of science and medicine with plenty of answers about illness, pathology, and death: only by opening up and studying the body could scientists see the effects of illness and discover how to better treat it.

Having this information can help them piece together what exactly happened. Then they delve into a several-step process, viewing the body at nearly every angle possible to help create a whole picture. During this time, the examiners take notes and record things in order to keep track of what they\u2019re seeing.\n\nExternal Exam\n\nFirst, investigators inspect the outside of the body \u2014 this assists in identifying the person \u2014 then check weight and measurements of the body. They examine what might often be seen as the \u201csuperficial\u201d qualities of a person \u2014 their eye and hair color, as well as the clothes they were wearing. This is also the point in time when the examiners look at the person\u2019s skin, searching for gunpowder residue, or scratches or bruises.\n\nInternal Exam\n\nThen comes the messy part. During the internal examination, the investigators cut open the chest then remove and dissect the organs inside, and sometimes the brain as well. The body is placed on a rubber block to arch it and open up the chest, in order for the examiner to make a Y-shaped incision.\n\nAbove are examples of some of the medical examiner's tools used in making incisions and dissecting organs.

Also, in both sexes, they make the arms of the Y too short; they actually need to extend all the way up to each shoulder joint.\u201d\n\nBut this process isn\u2019t as messy as it may seem: because the heart isn\u2019t pushing blood through veins, the body can\u2019t exactly \u201cbleed\u201d when cut: only gravity creates pressure on blood. Using a rib cutter to remove the rib cage, the medical examiner then removes the intestines and the rest of the organs. These organs are often played in formalin for days before dissection, because this keeps them preserved and firms them up \u2014 allowing for more precise incisions.\n\nIn addition to examining all of the organs, tissue samples and bodily fluids, like blood, urine, bile, or vitreous gel found in the eyes, are also analyzed. This helps the medical examiners determine whether the person had been a drug user or had infections, among other things.\n\nThis image shows a brain being dissected and showing signs of meningitis. CDC/ Dr. Edwin P. Ewing, Jr.\n\nPutting The Body Back Together\n\nSometimes, the brain or other organs need to be preserved for later use and to find more answers. Otherwise, most organs are placed back into the body or cremated, depending on the law and/or family\u2019s wishes. The body is then lined with cotton wool or another material and sewn shut, washed, and prepared for the funeral. Though seemingly unpleasant, autopsies have assisted researchers in better understanding how illnesses affect the body.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how autopsy works", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Autopsies aren\u2019t often completed the way they are depicted on television.", "title": "How It Works: Inside An Autopsy [GRAPHIC PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-autopsy-works-what-its-really-examine-cause-death-314914", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/18/autopsy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Autopsies aren\u2019t often completed the way they are depicted on television.", "title": "How It Works: Inside An Autopsy [GRAPHIC PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-autopsy-works-what-its-really-examine-cause-death-314914", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/18/autopsy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/18/autopsy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-12-22T07:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-22T07:00:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Autopsies aren\u2019t often completed the way they are depicted on television."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe036d\"", "article_summary": "This helps the medical examiners determine whether the person had been a drug user or had infections, among other things.\nAutopsies are done by forensic pathologists \u2014 physicians trained in examining corpses \u2014 also considered medical examiners.\nAbove are examples of some of the medical examiner's tools used in making incisions and dissecting organs.\nIf someone\u2019s death meets this criteria, the body is required to be examined afterwards in order to determine why and how they died.\nForensic autopsies are done to define the cause and manner of death, and are often done to serve legal issues: in the U.S., deaths are classified as either natural, accidental, homicidal, suicidal, or undetermined."}
