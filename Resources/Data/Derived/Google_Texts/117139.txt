The next Warrior Beach Retreat may be a couple months away, but one local business spent their Fourth of July raising money for the organization.

The St. Andrews Cooler on Calhoun Avenue in Panama City held its first annual Fourth of July Benefit Bash and Cookout Saturday.

The restaurant and bar offered free hot dogs and hamburgers with a donation and there were raffles for door prizes, a custom built electric guitar, and a 50-50 prize.

All proceeds the St. Andrews cooler made Saturday go towards Warrior Beach Retreat. If you want to make a donation, you can go to warriorbeachretreat.org.
