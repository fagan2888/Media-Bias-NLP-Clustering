The command and control will still be here in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance formed here in 2002, and the planning for it started even earlier \u2014 years before data breaches became a household concern. The nonprofit's founders wanted to create a place where public agencies and private companies could share quick-moving information about computer threats.\n\nWhen the Alliance started, spam emails were considered the biggest online threat to industry.\n\nToday, the nonprofit Alliance operates out of the Second Avenue technology center, bringing together federal officials with representatives from more than 100 national companies involved in finance, energy, medicine, manufacturing, retail and other sectors. Companies pay to become members.\n\nFBI Director James Comey singled out the nonprofit during a visit to the agency's Pittsburgh office last week, praising it for bridging communication gaps with business. The FBI's national office has deployed agents to work with the Alliance.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to forge relationships with the private sector that are appropriate and lawful and effective,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe have to figure out ways to talk to each other. ... We have shown how to do that here in a lot of different ways.\u201d\n\nWorkers at the Alliance's headquarters sit among cubicles, each marked with the person's name and corporate affiliation. If one company or group detects a software weakness or online attack, they can quickly alert the others and mount a common defense, LaVigna said.\n\nFor example, an energy company that detects a virus might end up alerting a retailer to an emerging threat, LaVigna said. \u201cWhere else can that happen?\u201d he noted.\n\nMichael Spring, an information science professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said that \u201cone of the most significant problems faced in battling cybercrime is the secrecy with which it's handled. People don't want to let other people know they've been compromised.\u201d\n\nStrong roots\n\nThe Alliance's plan to expand to the nation's opposite coasts is a natural outgrowth as computer security concerns have become more widespread, Spring said.\n\nThe office in New York will seek to reach more Wall Street and financial companies, while the Los Angeles office will target entertainment, energy and port-related companies, LaVigna said. The Alliance will seek to have a broader impact by being in closer proximity with more clients, he said.\n\n\u201cOne thing is expanding our reach to industries that we normally wouldn't have access to, primarily for distance,\u201d LaVigna said. \u201c... There's value to having that physical touch.\u201d\n\nInside a malware laboratory lined with banks of monitors, the Alliance's employees watch computers infected with the nastiest viruses known. At any moment, analysts might be tracking dozens of variants and following them for as little as a couple of weeks to as long as several years, said David Johnson, malware program manager.\n\nThe goal is to learn the behavior of each attack and to watch for changes or updates so the Alliance can alert its members, said Steve Mancini, the chief technology officer.\n\nGroups in Japan and Singapore recently replicated the Alliance model, and cybersecurity experts from around the world routinely seek out the Alliance for insight and collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe're proud of our roots here in Pittsburgh,\u201d LaVigna said. \u201cThis was definitely an organization that was created here in Pittsburgh. It was not thought of and planted here; it was born here.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit expects to open the offices by August. That could mean moving some Pittsburgh-based employees, though many are glad to be here, LaVigna said.\n\n\u201cThey like having the opportunity to do the work they're doing on a global basis and still be here in Pittsburgh,\u201d he said.\n\nAndrew Conte is a member of the Tribune-Review investigations team.
