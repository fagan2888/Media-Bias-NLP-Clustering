Kirk Douglas, Hollywood hefty-weight and winner of an honorary Academy Award, got a sneak preview of his obituary when a recent People magazine post announced his death — only he’s not dead.

In addition, the headline of “Kirk Douglas Dies” was preceded by the all-caps, clearly readable “DO NOT PUB” tag, USA Today reported.

People has since removed the obituary from its website, but not before social media got a good look at it.

“Kirk Douglas is one of the few lucky people to see what his obit might say once he dies,” tweeted one, USA Today reported.

“Kirk Douglas: not dead yet, but @peoplemag must think he’s close,” tweeted another.

And yet another, referring to the Sept. 29, 2014, date that was curiously affixed next to the People post: “Did you know that according to a People Magazine obit, Kirk Douglas has been dead since September?”

One more: “I hope that Kirk Douglas, like the rest of us, is reading his DO NOT PUB obituary in People,” USA Today reported.
