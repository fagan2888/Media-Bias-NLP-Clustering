MARIE, Mich. \u2014 Gosh, you guys really hate selfie. And we see the hate runs so deep you don\u2019t mean just the images, you mean the word itself.\n\nEach year, the overseers of the overwrought phrase usage at Lake Superior State University in Michigan ask the public to send in nominations of words or terms that drive them crazy.\n\nTheir Department of Words to Be Banished from the Queen\u2019s English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness gets thousands of submissions and then it narrows the list to 13. Because that\u2019s what we need at the end of the year, a top 10+ list of something!\n\nA quick and totally unscientific search of CNN.com in 2013 reveals three dozen references to selfie, which includes stories about President Obama\u2019s selfie controversy, selfies taken at funerals, selfie tips and the fact that some organization called the Oxford Dictionaries had the nerve to name selfie the global word of the year.\n\nAnd selfie only just became an honest-to-goodness real word.\n\nWe may not be able to keep people from posting them online, but we can try to get them to use another word.\n\n\u201cA self-snapped picture need not have a name all its own beyond \u2018photograph.\u2019 It may only be a matter of time before photos of one\u2019s self and a friend will become \u2018dualies,'\u201d wrote nominators Lawrence of Coventry, Connecticut, and Ryan of North Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nAnother critic said the term is full of self-importance.\n\n\u201cMyselfie disparages the word because it\u2019s too selfie-serving,\u201d wrote Lisa of New York City. \u201cBut enough about me, how about yourselfie?\u201d\n\nBut the battle between the Lake Superior State folks and the Oxford crew doesn\u2019t end there. The award-winning \u201ctwerk\u201d also gets the thumbs down from the 39th edition of the banishment list. What is twerking? I\u2019m not sure I can accurately capture it in words, so watch this, but quickly.\n\nLisa from New York City comes back strong again.\n\n\u201cI twitch when I hear twerk, for to twerk proves one is a jerk \u2014 or is at least twitching like a jerk. Twerking has brought us to a new low in our lexicon,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSome of the phrases were a bit surprising to some of us, but if you insist, I guess it\u2019s time to retire Mister Mom and T-bone, the verb, as in one car T-boned the other.\n\n\u201cWhile the accident\u2019s layout does, indeed, resemble its namesake cut of beef, we\u2019d prefer to dispense with the collateral imagery and enjoy a great steak,\u201d the barons of overused phrases wrote.\n\nAs for Mr. Mom, well, that movie came out 30 years ago (kids, it\u2019s hilarious), and the idea of a man staying home while a wife works is not so novel any more.\n\n\u201cI am a stay-at-home dad/parent. And if you call me \u2018Mr. Mom,\u2019 I will punch you in the throat,\u201d said Zachary of East Providence, Rhode Island. We agree, the guy in the movie was a bit clueless about how to care for the little ones and the house.\n\nWe went over to the Twittersphere to see the reaction to the call for the end of \u201cTwittersphere.\u201d Apparently many people missed the memo on that (I can use that \u2014 missed the memo hasn\u2019t made the complete list yet). Another Internet word to make the 2013 list was the written out or spoken hashtag. The symbol # is fine, apparently. Or maybe not.\n\n\u201cTyped on sites that use them, that\u2019s one thing. When verbally spoken, hashtag-itgetsoldquickly. So, hashtag-knockitoff,\u201d typed Kuahmel of Gardena, California.\n\nBut Jen from Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, thinks: \u201cIt\u2019s #obnoxious #ridiculous #annoying and I wish it would disappear.\u201d\n\nWe concur, Jen. #soundslikeagoodidea #notgoingtohappenanytimesoon\n\nSports fans contributed two words \u2014 \u201cadversity\u201d and \u201cfan base.\u201cFacebook user Tim Wilcox had an even better idea, getting rid of \u201cNation\u201d after every team\u2019s nickname to describe their fans base.\n\nAnd adversity? In a sporting event? It means \u201ca state, condition, or instance of serious or continued difficulty or adverse fortune,\u201d according to Merriam-Webster.\n\n\u201cFacing adversity is working 50 hours a week and still struggling to feed your kids. Facing third and fifteen without your best receiver with tens of millions in the bank, is not,\u201d Kyle of White Lake, Michigan, wrote.\n\nAnother phrase that likely got its start in sports but leaked into other usage and needs to go is \u201c_______ on steroids\u201c. For instance, it\u2019s like a fast food restaurant on steroids. Wow, it must be, um, great.\n\nThere were a few huge crises on the planet in 2013 but it\u2019s still here. So the use of \u201c-ageddon\u201d and \u201c-pocalypse\u201d got old quickly. We say there will be no Snowmageddon 2014. And we pray there is no a global shortage of pork products as the world must avoid using Baconpocalypse, or worse, Aporkcalypse.\n\nThe list also included two terms associated with politics, or at least with Washington.\n\nIntellectually/Morally Bankrupt was one.\n\nCal of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, wondered: \u201cAre there intellectual creditors?\u201d\n\nAnd the other was Obamacare, which appears in the media approximately every 3.2 seconds. However, that is easier to fit in a headline or ticker than \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d Just sayin\u2019 (Also not banned \u2014 yet).\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2013 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
