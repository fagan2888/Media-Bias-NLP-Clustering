Jefferson is among the first medical schools factoring in emotional intelligence in acceptance.\n\n\u201cWe believe that 65 percent or so of patients who end up in a hospital\u2019s emergency rooms don\u2019t need to be there, and not just because it could not just be five hours of a patient\u2019s life but $1,500 of their deductible.\u201d\n\nA new kind of merger\n\nJefferson, a five-facility academic medical system flanked by a 950-bed hospital, spent 19 years affiliated with Main Line Health until ending that management arrangement. Jefferson announced the merger with Abington shortly after.\n\nSince then, Klasko has tightened how the health system runs. While Jefferson alone had a board of more than 100 prior to Klasko\u2019s reorganization, the new, five-hospital and $3 billion Abington-Jefferson system will be run by one board of 24 people.\n\n\u201cOur merger with Abington is a totally different model from what\u2019s existed before, where it\u2019s a hub and spoke and a community hospital can send more patients to Philadelphia,\u201d said Klasko, who\u2019s slated to be CEO of the new system.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe goal, Klasko said, is to to have \u201chub and hub\u201d model, where patients can consult Jefferson clinicians over an Internet video chat, get specialty care in community-based setting and only come into the hospital if they really need it. Another way to put it is going from \u201cthe Blockbuster model to the Netflix model,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Abington merger is set to close in May.\n\nThat vision of high-tech, personalized healthcare has also brought Jefferson serious donations. Sidney Kimmel, the Philadelphia-born fashion tycoon, donated $110 million Jefferson's medical school in 2013. Early this year, the Marcus Foundation, established by Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, gave Jefferson $14 million to expand its integrative health center in Villanova.\n\nKlasko claims that center will offer \u201cthe best of traditional American medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, vitamin therapy, acupuncture, Ayurvedic medicine and a technology-based, home-based telehealth model where people can be part of a club and get wellness services in a way that\u2019s consistent with how they do their banking and everything else.\u201d That grant will also let Jefferson open eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s first PET MRI scanner.\n\nAmong other initiatives, Jefferson has a new startup \u201caccelerator zone\u201d to advise and potentially invest in Philadelphia-area health entrepreneurs, and is considering starting what would be greater Philadelphia\u2019s first CT-equipped ambulance for mobile stroke care.\n\nStanding out\n\nKlasko\u2019s restructuring of Jefferson is also a sort of rebranding. The organization purchased the naming rights to a main downtown train station and became the official hospital of the Philadelphia 76rs basketball team. Klasko has become a celebrity in the Philadelphia medical scene, giving TED talks, meeting with dozens of media outlets and widely acknowledging the general frustration Americans have with healthcare.\n\nWhether Klasko\u2019s ideas and Jefferson\u2019s new initiatives translate into better, more affordable healthcare remains to be seen, said Robert Field, a Drexel University health researcher who worked in management at the University of Pennsylvania Health System in the late 1990s. For one thing, Field said, neither Jefferson nor any other regional provider system has made headway in improving patient billing.\n\nJefferson is also not the only area health system looking to create an integrated health network spanning the suburbs and center city of Philadelphia.\n\nThe competition between Jefferson and Penn Medicine \u201chas been explicit,\u201d though still friendly, said Field. But while the two both offer patients many options for advanced care and clinical trials \u2014 both, for example, provide access to cancer immunotherapies \u2014 Jefferson wants to lead in the move towards retail clinics and telehealth. Greater Philadelphia has dozens of urgent care centers, but only a few that are run by health systems.\n\nIn 2010, Klasko and a group of academic medical center leaders were at a conference when Walgreens announced the launch of its walk-in clinics. Klasko remembered many of the deans laughing it off: \u201cWhat a stupid business model. Who\u2019s going to go to a drugstore to have their kid be seen with an earache?\u201d\n\n[Also: Walgreens cuts ties with two ACOs]\n\nBillions of dollars later, Klasko said, retail primary and urgent care clinics are one of the fastest growing parts of healthcare, and some providers complain that they are taking away high-margin, low-acuity services.\n\n\u201cThe reason isn\u2019t because everybody was excited about going to the drugstore to have their kid be seen. The reason was, back then, if your kid had an ear ache you would be told by your pediatrician in many places that we could see you in two days. Well by then, your kid was either better or had gone to the emergency room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest of the world has become consumer centric and has absolutely zero patience for waiting 24 hours to do anything,\u201d Klasko said. \u201cRather than watching other companies make a lot of money because we don\u2019t have our act together, we want to be part of those companies.\u201d\n\nOne way to measure Jefferson\u2019s influence and the region\u2019s healthcare progress in the long-term will the success of the Delaware Valley ACO, a Medicare shared savings joint venture between Jefferson, Main Line, Holy Redeemer Hospital , Doylestown Hospital and Magee Rehabilitation.\n\nThe 65,00 patients in the Medicare ACO plus the many commercially-insured patients around greater Philadelphia represent a way to scale consumer-centric healthcare, Klasko said. \u201cKeeping patients out of the most expensive place to get care and treating them at home or in urgent care basically\u201d means \u201chappier patients who are costing less.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/thomas-jefferson-university-and-hospitals-chief-rolls-out-ambitious-plans-post-merger", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Thomas-Jefferson-University-Hospital-wiki-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "CEO Stephen Klasko pitches telehealth, clinic focus as he manages the merger between the top academic medical center and the suburban Abington Health hospital system.", "title": "Thomas Jefferson University and Hospitals chief rolls out ambitious plans post-merger"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Thomas-Jefferson-University-Hospital-wiki-feature.gif"}, "description": "CEO Stephen Klasko pitches telehealth, clinic focus as he manages the merger between the top academic medical center and the suburban Abington Health hospital system.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Thomas Jefferson University and Hospitals chief rolls out ambitious plans post-merger"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If Stephen Klasko, MD, has his way, Philadelphia\u2019s largest health system will reinvent academic medicine.&#13; Klasko, CEO of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, is pitching several changes to the system as he manages the merger between the top urban academic medical center and the suburban Abington Health hospital system.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e9e\"", "article_summary": "Klasko, CEO of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, is pitching several changes to the system as he manages the merger between the top urban academic medical center and the suburban Abington Health hospital system.\nIf Stephen Klasko, MD, has his way, Philadelphia\u2019s largest health system will reinvent academic medicine.\nJefferson is also not the only area health system looking to create an integrated health network spanning the suburbs and center city of Philadelphia.\nThe 65,00 patients in the Medicare ACO plus the many commercially-insured patients around greater Philadelphia represent a way to scale consumer-centric healthcare, Klasko said.\nSince then, Klasko has tightened how the health system runs."}
