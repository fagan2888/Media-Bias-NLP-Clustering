The total route was around 10 blocks long. Many people arrived early to the parade, securing a good seat for the hour long celebration.\n\nFor the businesses of Delano, this event brought in customers. \"That's your economic development, bringing people downtown, letting them shop downtown, let them have fun downtown, its a family day,\" said long time Delano developer Mary Lou Rivers.\n\nThat idea of a family day brought out many to celebrate together. Four generations of one family sat at the end of the parade route, watching all the acts and people walk by. Kelly Blades is in the middle of that four generations and says this parade brought them together; \"it's a family tradition for us and this is our fifth [St. Patrick's Day Parade at Delano], we always meet up here.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "An estimated 13,000 people attended the 8th annual St. Patrick's Day parade in Delano.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "An estimated 13,000 people attended the 8th annual St. Patrick's Day parade in Delano.", "title": "Thousands attend St. Patrick's Day parade in Wichita", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Thousands-attend-St-Patricks-Day-parade-in-Wichita-250480251.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/45C/452/45C452355CB849E6967EE70840D379B9", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DC9/654/DC9654C82B804CD09D30AEAE31D5D619.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "An estimated 13,000 people attended the 8th annual St. Patrick's Day parade in Delano.", "title": "Thousands attend St. Patrick's Day parade in Wichita", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Thousands-attend-St-Patricks-Day-parade-in-Wichita-250480251.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/photo+(2)22.JPG", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Thousands attend St. Patrick's Day parade in Wichita", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Thousands attend St Patricks Day"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca68d\"", "article_summary": "For eight years, business owners have been putting on a parade in the downtown Wichita Delano district for St. Patrick's Day.\nThat idea of a family day brought out many to celebrate together.\nFour generations of one family sat at the end of the parade route, watching all the acts and people walk by.\nKelly Blades is in the middle of that four generations and says this parade brought them together; \"it's a family tradition for us and this is our fifth [St. Patrick's Day Parade at Delano], we always meet up here.\"\n\"That's your economic development, bringing people downtown, letting them shop downtown, let them have fun downtown, its a family day,\" said long time Delano developer Mary Lou Rivers."}
