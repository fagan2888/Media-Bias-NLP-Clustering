The gut-wrenching heartaches, stress, fatigue, fears \u2014 but most of all, the love \u2014 these families experience reflect my own caregiving journey.\n\nThe film (check local listings or watch online at pbs.org/caringformomanddad) is narrated by actress Meryl Streep and highlights several adult children\u2019s experiences as they work and care for parents who are dealing with strokes, dementia and other health challenges as they age.\n\nIt effectively illustrates the potentially rewarding but rocky road that all family caregivers travel. It is a must-see for everyone because we all will be touched by caregiving in some way at some point in our lives \u2014 as a caregiver, as a care recipient or as someone striving to support a caregiver.\n\nNeed Medicare Info?

She can\u2019t always say yes. She has work and her children pulling her in other directions. \u201cI want to be a good daughter,\u201d she says with tears in her eyes. I know that feeling all too well.\n\nThe documentary also touches on the challenges of maintaining a job while caring for a loved one \u2014 and the financial sacrifices, as well. As caregiver and former New York Times reporter Jane Gross bluntly put it, \u201cThere are many scenarios in which by the time this is over, Mom and Dad are broke and so are you.\u201d Professionals over age 50 who leave the workplace to care for a parent stand to lose an average of more than $300,000 in wages and benefits over their lifetime. The film highlights several employees and employers who have benefited from workplace options that support family caregivers.\n\nBut along with these burdens, there are also the moments of intense joy that are part of the caregiving experience. The film subtly communicates that those moments are what keep most of us going. A daughter caring for her mother with dementia expressed this exquisitely: \u201cIt\u2019s those treasured times that outweigh those challenging moments. There is a rainbow where that storm and that peace collide. It produces such a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nAs a family caregiver, I found the documentary very validating. It also gave me hope that more people will wake up to the reality of an aging society. People are living longer, and boomers are aging rapidly \u2014 or as Meryl Streep put it, \u201cSoon the old will outnumber the young, and most will live longer than ever before.\u201d By 2050, the number of people with dementia will triple, and a recent AARP study indicates that the ratio of potential family caregivers to each care recipient will plunge from the current 7-to-1 to just 3-to-1. How will family caregivers juggle life, work and caregiving at that rate?\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\nThe film\u2019s call to action is clear: We must have more options for affordable services to supplement the unpaid work of family caregivers who shoulder the vast majority of the care. Just as important, the critical caregiver supports \u2014 such as the geriatric care managers, medical advocates, family caregiver intervention programs and flexible workplace policies shown in the film \u2014 are vital to helping us navigate family conflicts and continue to work as we care for our loved ones.\n\nI urge you to check listings to find out when the documentary will be aired on your PBS station, or watch the film online at pbs.org/caringformomanddad.\n\nAmy Goyer is AARP\u2019s family, caregiving and multigenerational issues expert; she spends most of her time in Phoenix, where she is caring for her dad, who lives with her.
