But the present is proving what we stubbornly refuse to learn from the past: that command economies (like that of the defunct Soviet Union) don\u2019t respond kindly to, well, commands.\n\nBut that does not stop political charlatans from claiming to see the future and to know how to trick it into doing their bidding.\n\nI seem to recall that in 2009 President Obama said, \u201cThis law [Obamacare] will cut costs and make coverage affordable for families and small businesses.\u201d He added that this monstrous monument to one man\u2019s twisted, authoritarian ego included \u201ctough new consumer protections to guarantee greater stability.\u201d\n\nOne would think Obamacare\u2019s danger to health care price stability would inspire Republicans to denounce the law vociferously and make its repeal the central issue for its army of candidates now tripping over one another as they seek their party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nBut last May, Karl Rove, the high-pitched soprano of the GOP\u2019s moderate castrati, warned Republicans in his Wall Street Journal column to stop all their talk of \u201cwholesale repeal and replacement\u201d of the president\u2019s dictatorial law.\n\nSupreme Court Obamacare ruling sets dangerous precedent\n\nObama took Rove\u2019s tacit endorsement and ran with it, \u201cThere\u2019s a reason fewer [Republicans] are running against Obamacare,\u201d said the president, \u201cbecause while good, affordable health care might still be a feigned threat to freedom on Fox News, it\u2019s working pretty well in the real world.\u201d\n\nOf course, as medical costs rise and government reimbursements remain low, more doctors will opt out of the system, triggering a rationing of care. The doctors that remain will be forced to see more patients per hour, risking missed diagnoses and higher death rates.\n\nWhen Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote his 1967 novel \u201cThe Cancer Ward,\u201d Soviet officials were outraged by his honest portrayal of state-run medicine. As we saw with the Veterans Administration scandal, Obamacare\u2019s neglected patients, or those that die, will be expunged from the official record.\n\nIn one passage, Dr. Oreshchenkov tells a patient and friend:\n\nThe family doctor is the most comforting figure in our lives, and now he\u2019s being pulled up by the roots. The family doctor is a figure without whom the family cannot exist in a developed society\u2026 How many adult human beings are there, now, at this minute, rushing about in mute panic wishing they could find a doctor?\u2026 In fact, it\u2019s a matter as essentially intimate as a search for a husband or a wife. But nowadays it\u2019s easier to find a good wife than a doctor ready to look after you personally for as long as you want, and who understands you fully and truly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well,\u201d says the patient, \u201cbut how many family doctors would you need? It simply doesn\u2019t fit into the system of a free universal national health service.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does \u2018free\u2019 mean?\u201d asks Oreshchenkov, \u201cThe doctors don\u2019t work for nothing, you know. It only means that they\u2019re paid out of the national budget and the budget is supported by patients\u2026 If a patient kept the money that pays for his treatments, he would have turned the ten rubles he has to spend at the doctor\u2019s over and over in his hands. He could go to the doctor five times over if he really needed to.\u201d\n\nCourt backs Obamacare subsidies: Legislation from the bench?\n\nFor this observer, yesterday was nothing more than an evening of pyrotechnic displays and loud noise. A nation that sings of its bravery and love of freedom rings hollow while its government issues mandates on its ruled subjects, who sheepishly accept chaotic government-provided \u201csecurity.\u201d\n\nThe Sovietization of America is nothing to celebrate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The future cannot be predicted.
