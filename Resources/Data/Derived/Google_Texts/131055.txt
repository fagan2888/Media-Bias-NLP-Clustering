NEW YORK (MainStreet) - The momentum of legalizing marijuana across the nation has lead to the launch of a slew of new business in both legal and non-legal states, and insurers are developing new products to cover them.

The legal cannabis industry will likely reach $10 billion in annual activity by 2018, according to Viridian Capital & Research, and the cannabis sector overall saw 21 companies complete a total of 33 acquisitions in the first three quarters of 2014.

"Like any commercial venture, there's a host of exposures when it comes to liability but in the stream of commerce that is marijuana, there is a unique set of exposures," said Michael Cohen with Halland Capital, an insurance brokerage firm.

Exposures include loss of crops due to pesticides, mold and other hazardous toxins that may destroy the cannabis plant. "Investing time and money into a crop and then having it go to waste is becoming more of an issue for growers trying to stay in the industry to recoup their losses," said Jason Draizin, CEO with MarijuanaInsurance.net. "By building crop insurance policy we can help those new and existing growers protect their investment."

Policies available that cover these and other exposures include crop insurance for field and hydroponic cannabis growers, traditional commercial insurance that covers dispensary transit , medical malpractice polices for doctors who treat their patients with marijuana and gap coverage for doctors issuing recommendations rather than traditional prescriptions."Insurers are looking into specifically adopting their medical malpractice wording to recommendation rather than prescriptions," Cohen told MainStreet. "We're also offering malpractice policies for lawyers that represent marijuana companies."
