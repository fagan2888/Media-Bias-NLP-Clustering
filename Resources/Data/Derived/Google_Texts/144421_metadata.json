Mary Landrieu (D), who is up against three Republican challengers for her seat in Louisiana, is facing renewed attacks this week over her support for the Affordable Care Act. The Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity is out with a new ad featuring several people \u2014 who appear to be Louisiana residents \u2014 receiving notices in the mail that their insurance plans have been cancelled thanks to Obamacare. \u201cSend Senator Landrieu a message: Obamacare is hurting Louisiana families,\u201d the ad concludes.\n\nBut the people featured in the hard-hitting ad aren\u2019t actually Louisiana residents at all. In reality, they\u2019re paid actors hired by the right-wing group.\n\n\u201cHiring professional actors to impersonate Louisiana families is low even for the billionaire Koch brothers,\u201d the senator\u2019s campaign manager, Adam Sullivan, told ABC News.\n\nOver the past several months, Obamacare opponents have consistently struggled to find credible spokespeople for attacks on the health law, particularly in regards to the claim that Americans are unhappy with the fact that their existing policies are getting canceled. This past fall, the media profiled dozens of people who claimed that the federal health law was forcing them to purchase an expensive new plan \u2014 but most of those Obamacare \u201chorror stories\u201d were quickly debunked.\n\nIn reality, Obamacare is transforming the individual insurance market to prevent insurers from offering skimpy plans that don\u2019t meet a minimum standard of coverage. Some of the people featured in the \u201chorror stories\u201d actually changed their tune once they realized how the health law\u2019s new requirements could benefit them.\n\nBut Americans for Prosperity is sticking by its new ad. \u201cI think the viewing public is savvy enough to distinguish between someone giving a personal story and something that is emblematic,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesperson told ABC News.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s a not new tactic. The Koch-backed organization, which has poured millions into a misinformation campaign against health reform over the past several months, also hired a paid actress from Maryland to star in an anti-Obamacare ad targeted at Alaska residents.\n\nIn Louisiana, nearly 33,000 people had enrolled in new Obamacare plans by the end of January, according to the latest available data from the Health and Human Services Department. About 27 percent of the people enrolling in new plans are young people between the ages of 18 and 34, on par with the national average.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The people claiming that Obamacare is a bad deal for Louisiana families aren't actually residents of the state.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The people claiming that Obamacare is a bad deal for Louisiana families aren't actually residents of the state.", "title": "Koch Brothers Hire Paid Actors To Star In Attack Ad Claiming Obamacare Hurts Louisiana Residents", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/14/3293291/koch-brothers-paid-actors-louisiana/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obamacare-Protest_tpftd-e1379969975929.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The people claiming that Obamacare is a bad deal for Louisiana families aren't actually residents of the state.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obamacare-Protest_tpftd-e1379969975929-321x214.jpg", "title": "Koch Brothers Hire Paid Actors To Star In Attack Ad Claiming Obamacare Hurts Louisiana Residents", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obamacare-Protest_tpftd-e1379969975929.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Obamacare-Protest_tpftd-e1379969975929.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-14T11:59:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Koch Brothers Hire Paid Actors To Star In Attack Ad Claiming Obamacare Hurts Louisiana Residents CREDIT:Sen.
