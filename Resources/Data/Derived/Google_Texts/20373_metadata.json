It has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\n\nPollsters also said Friday that their latest results indicate a slight growth in support for keeping Guant\u00e1namo Bay functional. About 53 percent wanted it to stay operational when surveyed last August, while 44 percent backed shutting it down.\n\nCNN reported the high-water mark for keeping Gitmo open came last March, when roughly 60 percent supported its continued operations.\n\nAbout 39 percent advocated closing the facility, that survey from March 19 to 21, concluded.\n\nPresident Obama unveiled his plan for closing the prison late last month, a last-ditch attempt to keep a 2008 campaign promise.\n\nGOP lawmakers immediately rejected the plan, arguing it lacked details and raised the uncomfortable possibility of having dangerous terrorism suspects on U.S. soil. Obama has repeatedly argued that keeping Gitmo open emboldens extremists and damages America\u2019s human rights credibility.\n\nThe prison currently holds 91 detainees, down from 242 at the start of Obama\u2019s first term. It has an annual operating cost of approximately $445 million.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "President Obama outlined a plan for closing the military prison in Cuba late last month.", "description": "President Obama outlined a plan for closing the military prison in Cuba late last month.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "President Obama outlined a plan for closing the military prison in Cuba late last month.", "title": "Poll: Over half of Americans oppose closing Gitmo", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/271817-poll-over-half-oppose-closing-gitmo", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/guantanamobay_062613getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-04T14:10:03-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-04T14:10-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/271817-poll-over-half-oppose-closing-gitmo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-04T13:44-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mark Hensch", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-04T13:44:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T14:10:03-05:00"}, "keywords": "polls, Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Gitmo, Terrorism,President Obama,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/271817-poll-over-half-oppose-closing-gitmo", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "President Obama outlined a plan for closing the military prison in Cuba late last month.", "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: Over half of Americans oppose closing Gitmo"}, "dcterms.title": "Poll: Over half of Americans oppose closing Gitmo"}, "article_summary": "Over half of U.S. adults oppose closing the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, according to a new poll.\nCNN reported the high-water mark for keeping Gitmo open came last March, when roughly 60 percent supported its continued operations.\nAnother 22 percent describe the Communist nation as \u201cjust a slight threat,\u201d while 47 percent see \u201cno threat at all.\"\nObama has repeatedly argued that keeping Gitmo open emboldens extremists and damages America\u2019s human rights credibility.\nADVERTISEMENTAnother 40 percent want Gitmo closed, the poll says, and 3 percent had no opinion on the issue."}
