Rowland took to the airwaves at his usual time on his WTIC AM talk show, despite being named in federal court as an alleged co-conspirator to a campaign finance scheme. He wouldn't comment on the accusations, only to say, \"I am not going to be discussing the recent news and legal developments. I am sure that you all understand. And I want to respect the process.\"\n\nToday on The Wheelhouse, we talk Rowland, political corruption, legislative turnover, Obamacare deadlines in Connecticut, and Dan Malloy's re-election campaign. Also, we talk about a study that looks at academic performance for the 2014 NCAA Division I men's and women's basketball teams. It doesn't look good for the UConn men.\n\nGUESTS:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "On Tuesday, former Governor John G.
