On Friday, a veterinarian found a pellet inside 7-month-old Athena that left her paralyzed and in need of a dangerous surgery.\n\nAt first sight Athena still looks like a normal cuddly kitten.\n\n\"She's very friendly, in high spirits,\" said Sarah Coffman with the Wichita Animal Action League. \"She doesn't appear to be in much pain.\"\n\nBut once she starts to move the problem is evident, she can't lift her hind legs. Coffman stepped in after a good Samaritan called Thursday after seeing the kitten dragging along.\n\n\"We had thought she had been hit by a car and her back legs were broke so we offered to pay for her to go to the vet and get checked out,\" Coffman said. \"We were not prepared for what we were told.\"\n\nX-rays show a pellet lodged against her spine, pressing nerves that leave her partially paralyzed.\n\n\"So extremely angry,\" Coffman said. \"We've determined from the trajectory of the bullet that she had to of been standing very close to whoever shot her because the bullet is almost straight down into her back.\"\n\nWhile police search for whoever did this cruel act, Athena is in need of a surgery to be able to walk again.\n\n\"Without this surgery the bullet will likely travel inside of her body and move possibly in the future paralyze her if she moves wrong,\" Coffman said.\n\nCoffman says her group has raised more than a thousand dollars within hours of starting a fundraiser to get Athena back on all four legs, the problem is she goes into surgery on Monday and they're about $2,500 short.\n\n\"I have no doubt that our followers are going to come through by Monday,\" Coffman said. \"I have no doubt.\"\n\nIf you would like to help, click here .\n\nThe kitten was found in a mobile home park on Macarthur in south Wichita.
