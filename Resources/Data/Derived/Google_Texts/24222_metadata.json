Widespread spying on ordinary citizens and on friendly world leaders has led a growing majority of Americans to disapprove of the security agency. Even those who, like myself, have given the NSA the benefit of the doubt \u2013 assuming that government spooks are only doing what they must to protect us from terrorism \u2013 are starting to wonder.\n\nMy biggest concern is not that spies are eavesdropping on what I\u2019m planning for dinner \u2013 in this Internet age, I\u2019ve relinquished any expectation of privacy \u2013 but rather that our intelligence efforts are misdirected or just plain incompetent. The most recent data point: revelations that our super-spies completely missed Russia \u2019s planned attack on Crimea .\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, though satellites showed troops massing at the Ukraine border, intelligence analysts intercepted no communications from those planning to attack. Shockingly, it appears the Russians evaded our eavesdropping effort.\n\nRelated: Obama to Ask for Curbs on NSA Data Collection\n\nThat\u2019s the same eavesdropping effort that tapped Angela Merkel\u2019s cell phone and scooped up telephone data from millions of Americans--the data mining that just yesterday President Obama was apologizing for, again. How is this possible? Presumably, we have our monitors directed elsewhere. A senior official said, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone into crisis-response mode.\u201d\n\nThe Journal reports, \u201cU.S. spy agencies and the military are rushing to expand satellite coverage and communications efforts across Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states,\u201d hoping to close the \u201cinformation gap.\u201d Another official is quoted as saying the Obama administration is \u201cvery nervous\u201d because \u201cthis is uncharted territory.\u201d\n\nWhat does that even mean? Presumably, since the end of the Cold War we have sensibly directed most of our intelligence gathering towards the Middle East and Asia , targeting terrorism. Still, doesn\u2019t the ever-aggressive Russia deserve oversight, especially after Putin\u2019s 2008 invasion of Georgia ? Alternatively, was this inattention part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s famous \u201creset\u201d?\n\nIt turns out that as early as December there were those warning that Putin might strike in Crimea . Even though the Pentagon asked our intelligence agencies to ramp up their surveillance, we were left in the dark. Apparently, those thousands of Russian troops massed at the borders never blabbed to their girlfriends via cellphone about the coming strike, posted no \u201cselfies\u201d on Facebook, and sent no Tweets. Bugs caught no official communications, either. Moreover, there were no Americans in Crimea able to confirm Russian aggressions, and no drones.\n\nRelated: Phone Calls Can Be Heard by NSA a Month Later\n\nOn February 28, President Obama yet again warned Putin against invading Crimea; by then the peninsula was fully controlled by Russians. Security head Clapper\u2019s office, according to the Journal, could not say with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the takeover had occurred.\n\nTalk about a complete security bust. It makes you wonder where else we are vulnerable. It also raises questions: are we bad at listening in, or are we spread too thin? Since we\u2019re spending about $70 billion annually for our intelligence gathering, that\u2019s hard to imagine. Or\u2026are other countries further ahead in these technologies? In his lengthy January speech about the NSA, President Obama claimed, \u201cAmerica\u2019s capabilities are unique\u2026\u201d Are they?\n\nThere are other reasons to doubt our intelligence community, starting with the Arab Spring. As uprisings in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and elsewhere ignited, the United States appeared consistently surprised. How about this? In 2011, it took more than two days for the U.S. to find out that North Korea leader Kim Jong-il had died; reports from the North Korean news media slowly trickled out. North Korea is an especially closed country, but isn\u2019t that the kind of place \u2013 especially given its nuclear weapons \u2013 where we should have intelligence capabilities?\n\nRelated: China Huawei Condemns Reported NSA Snooping\n\nIt is impossible to know whether our data gathering has been deficient, or whether those charged with interpreting and responding to the flow of information have been derelict. President Obama came into office desperate to pluck the United States from entanglements in Iraq and Afghanistan. He viewed his predecessor and historical transgressions as responsible for America\u2019s rocky relationships with our adversaries. His worldview has been little altered by events. He declares the global war on terror over, though we daily confront hostilities both actual and virtual. His myopia may impact our intelligence posture--we know it has led to ineffectual policies and worsening relations with Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Russia, among others.\n\nThe NSA of course is just one of many agencies providing intelligence, but it is our lead eavesdropper. The agency\u2019s credibility suffered from the data dump provided by Edward Snowden. But that the former operative was allowed access to such a monster cache of sensitive documents, and that he was able to release them to the media, is in itself a travesty. His boss at the CIA, where Snowden worked before joining the NSA, sent him home from Geneva after voicing suspicions that the young man was trying to access classified documents and had adopted disturbing work habits and attitudes. Snowden had become a \u201cprolific online commenter\u201d complaining, among other things, about surveillance of civilians. He should never have been hired.\n\nIn his January speech, President Obama attempted to convince Americans and our allies of our commitment to walking that fine (maybe impossible) line between security and privacy. To his credit, he did not back down from our right to collect and analyze data. Obama promised that the U.S. would no longer monitor \u201cthe communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies.\u201d\n\nWe surely hope that doesn\u2019t include Putin.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Public opinion has turned against the NSA.", "title": "Spies Like Us: The NSA Is Intrusive and Incompetent", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/03/26/Spies-Us-NSA-Intrusive-and-Incompetent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06112013_NSA_Phone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/03/26/Spies-Us-NSA-Intrusive-and-Incompetent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06112013_NSA_Phone_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lizpeek"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Public opinion has turned against the NSA.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0b4\"", "article_summary": "In his lengthy January speech about the NSA, President Obama claimed, \u201cAmerica\u2019s capabilities are unique\u2026\u201d Are they?\nPresident Obama came into office desperate to pluck the United States from entanglements in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nRelated: Obama to Ask for Curbs on NSA Data CollectionThat\u2019s the same eavesdropping effort that tapped Angela Merkel\u2019s cell phone and scooped up telephone data from millions of Americans--the data mining that just yesterday President Obama was apologizing for, again.\nThe NSA of course is just one of many agencies providing intelligence, but it is our lead eavesdropper.\nIn his January speech, President Obama attempted to convince Americans and our allies of our commitment to walking that fine (maybe impossible) line between security and privacy."}
