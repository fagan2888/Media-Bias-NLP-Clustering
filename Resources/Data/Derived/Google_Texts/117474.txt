We thought we were done with Miley Cyrus and her "Wrecking Ball" video. We even thought we were done with all of the parodies that have popped up on the Web during the past few week's. But The Pet Collective, which bills itself as THE " online destination for all things animal and pet related," snagged us this morning with it's new "Wrecking Ball" parody, "Tennis Ball," featuring a scruffy little pup dressed up in skimpy white undies, and bouncing around to hilariously rewritten lyrics, sung quite nicely by an unknown Pet Collective vocalist.

The Pet Collective -- whose motto is, "If it breeds, it leads" -- is an online partner with Blip, a distributor of web video content and other multi-media fun. There's plenty of other dog-and-cat song parodies on the site, plus a very behind-the-scenes video on the making of "Tennis Ball."

Here's the main "Tennis Ball" video, with lyrics below, just in case you want to sing along.

And don't be too much of a downer and tell us this sort of thing is doesn't belong on a news website. Sometimes, we just all need to step back and watch a dog swing around on tennis ball.







My paws, my chain, sunshine or rain

I’ll jump, if you throw it high

I fetch, you yell “please drop the ball”

I do, but I don’t know why

I am not a stray, I will sit and stay

As long as I get that ball

It’s my lifelong goal, to bite into that ball

Can you throw it now please?

I keep on chasing tennis balls

They’re always falling from above

Even when you throw it off the wall

No matter what I always / catch it with ease

Yeah I, catch it with ease

You threw it high up in the air

And then, it started falling down

It spun around, came towards the ground

But then, I caught it in my mouth

I am not a stray, I will sit and stay

As long as I get that ball

It’s my lifelong goal, to bite into that ball

Can you throw it now please?

I keep on chasing tennis balls

They’re always falling from above

Even when you throw it off the wall

No matter what I always / catch it with ease

I keep on chasing tennis balls

I just opened my jaw and jumped

When I landed I had caught the ball

No matter what I always / catch it with ease

I always, catch it with ease
