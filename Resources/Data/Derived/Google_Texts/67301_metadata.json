It aims to bring thousands more in the upcoming years.\n\nJust like the Taglit-Birthright Israel program it is modeled after, Covenant Journey seeks to strengthen American students\u2019 love for Israel. But instead of having them mingle with young Jewish soldiers, participants walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ and visit Christian holy sites. According to the program\u2019s founder, the results from a recently launched pilot tour were encouraging. Participants in the trip were transformed into enthusiastic pro-Israel advocacy messengers.\n\n\u201cI grew to love Israel by reading my Old Testament, but after visiting Israel, it gave me a push to act for Israel,\u201d said Erica Tomlin, a 19-year-old sophomore at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, the school founded by the late reverend Jerry Falwell. Tomlin, who participated in the first trial run of the trip this past winter, said: \u201cIt changed my career path. Now I want to work on advocating for Israel.\u201d\n\nProgram organizers say their target audience consists of Christian student leaders who support Israel. While not officially limited to evangelical Christians, most of those signing up identify as evangelical. Many attend Christian colleges like Liberty. One of the trips planned for this summer will include only Christian students from Ivy League universities. The heavily subsidized cost for students on all Covenant Journey tours is $500. (Taglit-Birthright Israel is free.) Two foundations underwriting the project covered the rest.\n\nThe 11-day program, which varies slightly from trip to trip, is a mix of a Christian pilgrimage and a pro-Israel training camp. Participants in the pilot tour visited Christian holy sites, including Jerusalem; Nazareth; the Sea of Galilee; Mount of the Beatitudes; Tabgha, traditionally viewed as the place where Jesus performed the miracle of the loaves and fishes, and Capernaum. But they also toured the Western Wall and Jerusalem\u2019s old Jewish quarter, and ventured to Israel\u2019s northern and southern borders, where participants heard about the country\u2019s security challenges. In Sderot, Christian students experienced an itinerary similar to one that many Jewish groups and American politicians go through: a lookout at Gaza, visits to a children\u2019s playground with adjacent bomb shelters and a stop at the stack of Hamas rockets fired at the Southern town. The tour did not include any planned meetings with Israeli Arabs or Palestinians living in the West Bank.\n\nBerthold Werner Share\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing better than standing with Israel, and that\u2019s standing in Israel,\u201d said Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington, who hosted the program\u2019s launch event at the Israeli Embassy. \u201cIt is critical to bring the next generation of leaders in the Christian community to Israel. If they walk in the places where the patriarchs and the prophets and the kings and that young rabbi from the Galilee walked, then they will stand with Israel here and they will strengthen their Christian identity.\u201d\n\nStrengthening evangelical support for Israel could be driven in part by the growing diversity of views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within the evangelical community. Several evangelical groups have become more active in supporting Palestinian causes, and recent reports have indicated younger evangelicals no longer adhere automatically to the Israeli viewpoint.\n\n\u201cThe change is in the wind,\u201d said Gary M. Burge, author of \u201cWhose Land? Whose Promise?: What Christians Are Not Being Told About Israel and the Palestinians\u201d and a professor of New Testament at Wheaton College. \u201cThere is a kind of frantic reaction,\u201d he said, explaining that Christian Zionists are aware of the shift.\n\nThe idea of sending Christian students on Birthright-like trips has been in the making for more than three years, a period of time during which organizers sought out Jewish and Christian donors who would contribute jointly to the program.\n\nThe Jewish part was easier. The Philos Project, a pro-Israel group with a stated mission of promoting \u201cpositive Christian engagement in the Middle East,\u201d offered its backing early on. The group\u2019s board includes Richard Lang, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary; Mark Tooley, president of the Institute for Religion and Democracy, which is a conservative religious think tank, and Republican Jewish activist Dan Senor, who served as spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority, in Iraq, during the administration of George W. Bush. The group\u2019s main funder is Paul Singer, a Jewish hedge fund billionaire who is also one of the single largest donors to Republican politics.\n\nLuke Moon, deputy executive director of the Philos Project, said the organization strives to raise awareness of persecution of Christians in the Middle East and to increase Christian support for Israel. \u201cWe see these two issues as being linked, since what is happening now to the Christians has already happened to the Jews,\u201d he said.\n\nThough a full list of donors is not available, Moon acknowledged that most of the donors to the project are Jewish.\n\n\u201cFor me, as a Jew, that\u2019s huge,\u201d Singer said of the new program at the launch event, which was part of the Israeli Embassy\u2019s annual Christian solidarity meeting. \u201cI truly believe that Jews, Christians and all of Western civilization will be reaping the fruit of this project for years to come.\u201d\n\nEddie Gerald Share\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nMoon explained that the Philos Project attempts to reach out to evangelical Christians who support Israel but are not engaged with Christians United for Israel, the main Christian-Zionist organization led by the Rev. John Hagee. \u201cThere\u2019s a large group that is not met by CUFI\u2019s rhetoric and does not connect with their message,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Covenant Journey project began moving forward once Singer and the Philos Project found a Christian partner to share the funding: Museum of the Bible, a private museum next to the National Mall in Washington, set to open its doors in 2017. The museum\u2019s founder and chairman is Steve Green, an Oklahoma billionaire who owns the craft chain Hobby Lobby and who is a major donor to evangelical causes. Green burst into public attention last year after challenging President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court. Hobby Lobby successfully argued against the provision requiring employers to include coverage of contraceptives in their health care plan. Green\u2019s landmark Supreme Court victory gave him hero status in conservative Christian circles.\n\n\u201cVisiting the Holy Land \u2014 where Abraham journeyed and gave birth to the nation of Israel, David conquered Goliath and the Prophets and Apostles wrote and lived \u2014 and walking where Jesus gave his ministry,\u201d Green said at the embassy event, \u201cwill create a foundational platform from which they can become goodwill ambassadors for Israel and the Jewish people, and the Covenant Journey participants will never be the same.\u201d\n\nCovenant Journey does not officially take a stance regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the group\u2019s itinerary stresses the security risks Israel faces. The group also highlights the plight of Christians across the Arab world.\n\nMoon said Christians believe the resolution of the conflict is up to both sides, but he introduced other considerations that Christian supporters of Israel, including those participating in the trips, should keep in mind: \u201cWill this be a Palestinian state that will support the human rights of Christians and others? Will it have freedom of religion?\u201d\n\nContact Nathan Guttman at guttman@forward.com or on Twitter, @nathanguttman", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/128x79/christian-birthright-jerusalem-1431625874.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Nathan Guttman", "sailthru.image.720x405": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/720x405/christian-birthright-jerusalem-1431625874.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "A new program called Covenant Journey aims to bring thousands of young evangelical Christians to the Holy Land.
