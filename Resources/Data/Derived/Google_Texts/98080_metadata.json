The uninsured rate is the lowest since Gallup and Healthways began tracking it in 2008.\n\nWhile Gallup concludes that the improving economy may be playing a role, it also notes that the uninsured has now dropped significantly lower than it was in early 2008, before the worst of the economic crisis, suggesting that the law is a key factor. And Gallup adds that the drop in the uninsured rate is particularly pronounced among lower income Americans (down 8.7 percentage points since the law went into effect), African Americans (down 7.3 points) and Latinos (down 8.3 points).\n\nThat\u2019s great. But Dan Witters, the research director of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, tells me the numbers also clearly show a drop-off in the impact of the Medicaid expansion on the uninsured rate \u2014 a drop-off that coincides with the slowdown in GOP states opting into the expansion.\n\nWitters says that Gallup data \u2014 which are extremely extensive, a key reason why this polling is the gold standard for measuring the law \u2014 showed that last year\u2019s drop in the uninsured rate, which was 4.6 percentage points, was heavily fueled by the Medicaid expansion. The expansion was responsible for around 40 percent of the newly insured, he says.\n\nBut this year, the drop has thus far been only 1.5 points \u2014 in part because of the Medicaid expansion slowdown. The data show that the fall in the rate in uninsured this year due to the Medicaid expansion is only about three-tenths of a percentage point, he says.\n\n\u201cThe states that are expanding Medicaid in recent months have only been trickling in \u2014 there are fewer new states expanding Medicaid in 2015 as opposed to 2014,\u201d Witters says. \u201cThat has sucked the air out of the rate of decline this time, relative to the last. The rate of decline in the uninsured has dropped across all American adults, in part because fewer states are joining in the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nAfter a number of states expanded Medicaid last year, in 2015 the push for the expansion has stalled in places like Florida, Tennessee, Alaska, Missouri, and Utah, due to conservative legislative opposition and an aggressive campaign against it by the Koch-founded Americans for Prosperity.\n\nWitters says the data suggests that if the expansion had proceeded at a comparable clip this year, the uninsured rate would have shown an even \u201cmore accelerated decline this time, a decline pretty close to what we saw the first time around.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019d probably see around another point shaved off \u2014 and every percentage point is another 2.4 million American adults.\u201d\n\nFlorida might end up opting in to the Medicaid expansion. GOP governor Rick Scott\u2019s sudden reversal on the expansion has put the state\u2019s budget negotiations \u2014 including planned tax cuts, a major GOP priority \u2014 in peril, and some GOP legislators are insisting on the expansion to move the budget process forward, which suggests its fiscal logic may ultimately carry the day. That logic may yet prevail in other states where the expansion is being debated.\n\nBut it\u2019s very possible the Medicaid expansions could remain on hold. And beyond that, of course, looms the Supreme Court\u2019s pending decision in the King v. Burwell lawsuit, which could gut subsidies for millions in the three dozen states where governors have declined to set up exchanges, possibly driving the uninsured rate back up again. Which is to say that even if the law currently is accomplishing one of its core goals, GOP resistance to it is accomplishing one of its core goals, too \u2014 and the resistance\u2019s achievements could only grow more impressive in the months ahead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rate of uninsured is dropping.
