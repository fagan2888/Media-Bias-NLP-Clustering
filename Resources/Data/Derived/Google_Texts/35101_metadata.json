Think of the federal government\u2019s carrot-and-stick approach offering No Child Left Behind waivers in exchange for adopting Common Core standards. Ask your friends in education how those standardized tests, intrusive surveys, and massive data collection are helping students?\n\nAccompanying the side dish of diversity, HUD will provide complementary demographic data tables assisting bureaucrats in identifying jurisdictions and regions guilty of egregious violations of segregated housing patterns, which will be remedied by a federal template racial rezoning map, replacing locally controlled land use and zoning laws.\n\nHello Sartell!\n\nNo need for a citizen driven comprehensive plan or those pesky local land use planning boards.\n\nAnd given that citizens are limited to five minutes of input during most city and county board meetings, taxpayers will hardly notice a difference until their property values drastically decline while taxes simultaneously increase to fund the infrastructure and bureaucracy necessary for compliance.\n\nAh yes! Utopia!\n\nWho doesn\u2019t dream of living in a community where the federal government dictates the size of property lots, heights of buildings, greens space designations, type of homes, where homes are built and who may live in them.\n\nHow could this happen you ask? Well, while you were paying attention to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, a third decision granted the federal government the right to coerce neighborhoods to integrate based on racial quotas.\n\nThe 5-4 court ruling in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project determined that housing policies that are not intentionally discriminatory can nonetheless be discriminatory because they have \u201cdisparate impacts\u201d or adverse impacts on minorities, refugees and immigrants.\n\nRecall the U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Government agencies forced desegregation by bussing students to assigned schools using racial quotas. Unquestionably a costly failure.\n\nRegardless of past lessons, zoning and discrimination are apparently the same; social engineering intended to force diversity may actually reduce the availability of low-income housing and slow housing development in all neighborhoods.\n\nStanley Kurtz, author of \u201cSpreading the Wealth: How Obama Is Robbing the Suburbs to Pay for the Cities,\u201d wrote in National Review, \u201cAFFH obligates any local jurisdiction that receives HUD funding to conduct a detailed analysis of its housing occupancy by race, ethnicity, national origin, English proficiency, and class. Grantees must identify factors (such as zoning laws, public-housing admissions criteria, and \u2018lack of regional collaboration\u2019) that account for any imbalance in living patterns.\n\n\u201cLocalities must also list \u2018community assets\u2019 (such as quality schools, transportation hubs, parks, and jobs) and explain any disparities in access to such assets by race, ethnicity, national origin, English proficiency, class and more. Localities must then develop a plan to remedy these imbalances, subject to approval by HUD.\u201d\n\nBottom line: Communities should reject even one single dollar from HUD.\n\nAnother bonus by forcing low-income housing into America\u2019s suburbs is the affect it will have in shifting Republican-leaning neighborhoods into new Democrat voting regions.\n\nRemember, the end justifies the means!\n\nThis is the opinion of AJ Kern, a politically engaged resident of Sauk Rapids. Her column is published the first Thursday of the month.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2015/09/01/high-court-affirms-huds-ability-rezone-city/71524818/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Like educational plans, rule ties federal aid to compliance with racial zoning measures", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Like educational plans, rule ties federal aid to compliance with racial zoning measures", "title": "High court affirms HUD\u2019s ability to rezone your city", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2015/09/01/high-court-affirms-huds-ability-rezone-city/71524818/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Like educational plans, rule ties federal aid to compliance with racial zoning measures", "title": "High court affirms HUD\u2019s ability to rezone your city", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96221d128842f032d4b9a9bf116587d046752395/c=0-160-1806-1966&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/01/StCloud/B9318672738Z.1_20150901181144_000_G23BPR2C6.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda851\"", "article_summary": "On July 16, HUD provided its overreaching final version of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule known as AFFH.\nThink of the federal government\u2019s carrot-and-stick approach offering No Child Left Behind waivers in exchange for adopting Common Core standards.\nAsk your friends in education how those standardized tests, intrusive surveys, and massive data collection are helping students?\nAnother bonus by forcing low-income housing into America\u2019s suburbs is the affect it will have in shifting Republican-leaning neighborhoods into new Democrat voting regions.\nGrantees must identify factors (such as zoning laws, public-housing admissions criteria, and \u2018lack of regional collaboration\u2019) that account for any imbalance in living patterns."}
