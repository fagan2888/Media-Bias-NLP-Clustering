Originally founded by local Bay Area artist Michael Sturtz in 1999, The Crucible serves approximately 5,000 students per year and offers classes in 16 unique fields. Course offerings include blacksmithing, glassblowing, fire dancing, jewelry making, woodworking, and kinetics and electronics.\n\nStudents range in age and background. The Crucible Youth Program serves kids aged 8 to 18, offering weekend and after-school classes, as well as camps and field trips. Adults of all ages are also drawn to The Crucible, Sturtz says, and their reasons for taking courses vary widely. Some are seeking professional training while others simply want a hands-on creative outlet.\n\nAs the world becomes more digital, Sturtz has seen an increase in the number of tech professionals coming to classes. He attributes this to people\u2019s innate desire to work with their hands. \u201cI think as humans that we\u2019re really more attune to being physical and making things and getting your hands dirty and getting sweaty \u2026 that\u2019s what our background was.\u201d\n\nThe Crucible has long advertised itself, fundraised and entertained audiences with its elaborate, fire-themed theatrical performances. The center held its annual Fire Arts Festival from 1999 to 2009 (with no festival in 2001 or 2003), and have staged full-length fire operas, fire ballets and fire-themed fashion shows.\n\nWhile The Crucible has received offers to franchise and expand nationally and internationally, Sturtz says he wants to remain local. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a Bay Area phenomenon, and very much an Oakland-grown orientation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "art,arts,industrial arts education,Katie Brigham,Oakland,The Crucible,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia", "description": "This Oakland nonprofit industrial arts education center is celebrating its 15th anniversary.
