The biggest chunk, roughly $318 million, included deals where Autonomy sold its products through resellers or hosted other companies\u2019 data on its computers.\n\nIn the filing, H-P said Lynch gave the go-ahead to start selling \u201cpure hardware at a loss,\u201d in late 2009, pushing sales executives to boost their numbers. H-P said Lynch offered one executive, Michael Sullivan, a Porsche if he could resell $10 million worth of hardware that quarter. The filing doesn\u2019t say whether Sullivan got the car.\n\nThe allegations shed new light into H-P\u2019s long-running dispute with Lynch, whom H-P fired in 2012, just seven months after buying his company.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Hewlett-Packard has fleshed out its fraud allegations, saying Autonomy sought to boost its revenue ahead of H-P\u2019s purchase of the British software maker.", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU915_HPQ_20_MG_20140219100423.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Robert McMillan", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Hewlett-Packard has fleshed out its fraud allegations, saying Autonomy sought to boost its revenue ahead of H-P\u2019s purchase of the British software maker.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/h-p-details-5-billion-fraud-suit-against-autonomy-execs-2015-05-06", "author": "Robert McMillan", "parsely-title": "H-P details $5 billion fraud suit against Autonomy execs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-06T04:56:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Hewlett-Packard has fleshed out its fraud allegations, saying Autonomy sought to boost its revenue ahead of H-P\u2019s purchase of the British software maker.", "title": "H-P details $5 billion fraud suit against Autonomy execs", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/h-p-details-5-billion-fraud-suit-against-autonomy-execs-2015-05-06", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU915_HPQ_20_MG_20140219100423.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU915_HPQ_20_MG_20140219100423.jpg"}, "article.id": "DCADC654-F3CB-11E4-A754-FA6DFF672F67", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Autonomy reported nearly $2.1 billion in revenue from 2009 through the first half of 2011, the period over which H-P said it improperly booked more than $700 million.\nBloombergHewlett-Packard Co. said Autonomy Corp. improperly reported $709 million in revenue over 2\u00bd years before H-P bought the British software maker for $11 billion in 2011, as it fleshed out fraud allegations against former Autonomy executives.\nIn the filing, H-P said Lynch gave the go-ahead to start selling \u201cpure hardware at a loss,\u201d in late 2009, pushing sales executives to boost their numbers.\nH-P sued Autonomy\u2019s former Chief Executive Michael Lynch and former Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain on March 30, seeking approximately $5.1 billion in damages.\nH-P said Lynch offered one executive, Michael Sullivan, a Porsche if he could resell $10 million worth of hardware that quarter."}
