In presidential addresses, in Thanksgiving proclamations, and in many other ways,\u201d he said in a brief talk at Archbishop Rummel High School in Metarie, according to various news reports.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with that, and do not let anybody tell you that there is anything wrong with that,\u201d added Scalia, a Catholic.\n\nNew Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond introduced Scalia to the crowd of about 600 that had gathered for an annual celebration of religious freedom.\n\nIn his brief remarks, Scalia said that the principle of religious neutrality has been twisted by jurists since the 1970s to mean that traces of religion must be banished in favor of a purely secular public square. He called that idea \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition. Where did that come from?\u201d he said. \u201cTo be sure, you can\u2019t favor one denomination over another. But we can\u2019t favor religion over nonreligion?\u201d\n\nScalia said justices should follow the customs and common experiences of the American people on matters of faith more than \u201cabstract principles.\u201d\n\nHe said that if the American people at some point decide they want to \u201cimpose\u201d secularism on the United States, \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with that as long as it is done democratically.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t cram it down the throats of an American people that has always honored God on the pretext that the Constitution requires it.\u201d\n\nScalia, 79, was appointed in 1986 by President Reagan and is the high court\u2019s longest-serving justice. He frequently makes headlines with comments in speeches as well as from the bench; in oral arguments last month on a crucial affirmative action case before the high court, he came under fire for questioning whether some black students would benefit from going to \u201cslower-track\u201d schools.\n\nThese latest remarks also drew fire, but also support from fellow conservatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI hope Scalia \u2026 lives to be a hundred and ten, and dies on the bench, fighting,\u201d columnist Rod Dreher, who attended the talk, wrote at the American Conservative.\n\n\u201cScalia is right to say that there is nothing in the Constitution that requires the government to be neutral about religion,\u201d said William Donohue of the Catholic League.\n\nIn addition to a decision on affirmative action, the Supreme Court this year is set to rule on a number of key cases of great interest to faith groups, including the contraception coverage mandate in the Affordable Care Act that some religious groups say forces them to allow employees to get health insurance coverage for birth control and for prescriptions that they say can cause abortions.\n\nDavid Gibson is a national reporter for RNS.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/faith/2016/01/04/supreme-court-justice-scalia-constitution-says-government-can-favor-religion/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/771f9bc439164438a13f371d2ca58e7a.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said the US Constitution can favor religion over \"nonreligion,\" and that God has been good to the country because \"we have done him honor.\"", "title": "Supreme Court Justice Scalia: Constitution says government can favor religion"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cScalia is right to say that there is nothing in the Constitution that requires the government to be neutral about religion,\u201d said William Donohue of the Catholic League.\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with that, and do not let anybody tell you that there is anything wrong with that,\u201d added Scalia, a Catholic.\nIn his brief remarks, Scalia said that the principle of religious neutrality has been twisted by jurists since the 1970s to mean that traces of religion must be banished in favor of a purely secular public square.\nNew Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond introduced Scalia to the crowd of about 600 that had gathered for an annual celebration of religious freedom.\nHe called that idea \u201cabsurd.\u201dAdvertisement\u201cTo tell you the truth, there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition."}
