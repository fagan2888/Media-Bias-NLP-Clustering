The present version of the law dates back to the early 1970s.\n\nThe change would give health plans greater flexibility in crafting new products and ease the regulatory process for bringing them to market, backers say.\n\n\u201cThe HMO in 1972 is very different from the HMO of today, and many of our employer groups want to see some innovation and see some different types of products available to them but still within the basic HMO concept,\u201d said Judith Hooyenga, a Spring Lake attorney who specializes in health care law and serves as a consultant with the Michigan Association of Health Plans.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the incentives are very limited in what we can offer and this would open that up a little bit,\u201d she said.\n\nAs employers increasingly adopt wellness programs and use incentives to encourage employee participation, existing regulations often slow the process of bringing new products to market to meet that demand, said Dominick Pallone, deputy director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans that represents 17 health plans and HMOs in the state.\n\nThat\u2019s because the present insurance code does not expressly allow for the use of wellness incentives in HMO benefits packages, which in turn prolongs the regulatory review process when health plans file for approval of new products, Pallone said. Getting new products approved and to market \u201cjust took forever\u201d in a rapidly evolving marketplace, Pallone said.\n\n\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get these products approved. It would be this long process to finally get a \u2018yes.\u2019 We want to try to change that paradigm so that they can say \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Pallone said. \u201cThe code has been prohibitive in companies getting new products out there that can offer different types of incentives. The code needs to evolve.\u201d\n\nUnder the present insurance code, health insurers \u201ccan\u2019t be as flexible as they want to be,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the three bills proposed defines a healthy lifestyle program as one that\u2019s designed to \u201cenhance health, educate enrollees on health-related matters, or reduce risk of disease\u201d and specifically states that such programs are not subject to the approval of state regulators.\n\nThe House Insurance Committee passed the bills Oct. 29 on a unanimous 17-0 vote. The legislation modernizes the code by clarifying language, assuring state regulations confirm with the federal Affordable Care Act, and streamlining the regulatory review process for health plans.\n\nPallone cites instances in the past where health insurers threatened litigation when they were going through a prolonged review process because the insurance code did not specifically allow for what they proposed. Updating the insurance code should alleviate that possibility in the future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any insurance company, as an individual company, wants to have that type of a relationship with their regulator, and I don\u2019t think the regulator wants to have that type of relationship with its client, which is the insurance company,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cWe think it will be a much, much easier pathway to get products approved.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also would specifically permit HMOs to form an administrative services organization to manage benefits for self-funded employers, which is presently allowed through a separate business unit, Hooyenga said. By adding the language to the insurance code, HMOs can better accommodate larger employers who want to shift to a self-funded plan without any disruption, she said.\n\n\u201cIt just makes things a lot easier to be able to have the same legal entity providing that service,\u201d Hooyenga told state lawmakers during a recent hearing on the bills.\n\nThe MAHP worked with Rep. Tom Leonard, a Republican from DeWitt who chairs the House Insurance Committee, and the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services to draft the legislation, which received no opposition at the committee level.\n\nThe use of wellness by employers and incentives to drive employee participation and lifestyle changes to improve their health has been growing steadily for years.\n\nIn the 2015 survey on health care costs by The Employers\u2019 Association in Grand Rapids, 42 percent of respondents said they now offer some form of a workplace wellness program, versus 33 percent in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advocates say legislation pending in Lansing would make it easier for health plans to craft new products that incorporate wellness incentives into pol...", "generator": "runengine.com", "title": "State legislation would streamline process for health plans to use wellness incentives", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/23053-state-legislation-would-streamline-process-for-health-plans-to-use-wellness-incentives", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/609aa87ce7f7f3547614cc69f4859310_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Advocates say legislation pending in Lansing would make it easier for health plans to craft new products that incorporate wellness incentives into pol...", "title": "State legislation would streamline process for health plans to use wellness incentives"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/609aa87ce7f7f3547614cc69f4859310_S.jpg", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "Judith Hooyenga,Michigan Association of Health Plans,Dominick Pallone,The Employers\u2019 Association", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/23053-state-legislation-would-streamline-process-for-health-plans-to-use-wellness-incentives"}, "article_summary": "The code needs to evolve.\u201dUnder the present insurance code, health insurers \u201ccan\u2019t be as flexible as they want to be,\u201d he said.\nAdvocates say legislation pending in Lansing would make it easier for health plans to craft new products that incorporate wellness incentives into policies to encourage people to take better care of their health.\nThe legislation modernizes the code by clarifying language, assuring state regulations confirm with the federal Affordable Care Act, and streamlining the regulatory review process for health plans.\nThe change would give health plans greater flexibility in crafting new products and ease the regulatory process for bringing them to market, backers say.\nThe use of wellness by employers and incentives to drive employee participation and lifestyle changes to improve their health has been growing steadily for years."}
