David Crane \u2014 Staff Photographer\n\nCalifornia\u2019s children are more likely to have health care coverage, avoid teen pregnancy and live until adulthood, but many remain in poverty or with parents who lack secure jobs, according to a report released today.\n\nThat mixed assessment of the well-being of California\u2019s youth means the Golden State ranks poorly when it comes to making programs more accessible to help children live better, said authors of a report for the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The private philanthropy based in Baltimore makes grants to respond to children\u2019s poverty among other issues.\n\nResearchers said in the annual Kids Count report that California made vast improvements in 2013 compared with 2008 in expanding health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act, reinstating the Black Infant Health program and improving enrollment in the CalFresh nutritional program.\n\nBut from 2010 through 2013, about 23 percent of children lived in poverty compared with 18 percent in 2008, while 34 percent in 2013 grew up in homes where employment is insecure compared with 32 percent in 2008. Those figures for California children nearly mirrored those nationwide, but they give California a ranking of 38 out of 50 in overall child well-being because the state has the resources to pull youth out of poverty, said Ted Lempert, president of Children Now, a statewide advocacy group.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy,\u201d Lempert said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re in a better position than most states to invest in kids, but support hasn\u2019t kept up with pressures families have felt since the recession. We have more children living in poverty, and more parents lacking secure employment than we did in 2008. More must be done so all families can share in the economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe Kids Count report follows several others released earlier this summer with similar results. Last week, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health released a report that backed up those poverty rates by looking at food insecurity, which means a struggle to eat nutritious meals. Between 2002 and 2011, access to affordable foods continued to be limited for low-income households. That means 530,000 L.A. County households are not always able to afford enough food.\n\nHealth officials worry about those figures as well as the future. Most recently, the drought and gas prices have contributed to the higher cost of food.\n\n\u201cAn inadequate food supply can have many negative effects on physical and mental well-being and can lead to adverse health effects across the entire lifespan,\u201d Cynthia Harding, interim director of the Department of Public Health, said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage those in need to take advantage of the resources available, such as the CalFresh Program, offered through the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Los Angeles Regional Food Bank sees residents who can\u2019t afford to buy fruits and vegetables but are also experiencing hunger. In the agency\u2019s own report, the food bank found that 26 percent of Los Angeles County children, or 620,000, are food insecure.\n\n\u201cFood insecurity is not hunger, but they are not receiving nutrients they need,\u201d said Michael Flood, president of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. \u201cBecause they\u2019re maximizing (their) food budgets, they may be buying rice and pasta but leaving out fresh fruits and vegetables, protein and dairy. What we see over and over again in these reports is where children are present, parents are heavily sacrificing themselves so that kids can eat. These adults are absolutely not eating.\u201d\n\nThe solution is to guide more people into programs that are already in place but might be difficult to access, said Sharyn Church, director for Children Now\u2019s Los Angeles office.\n\nFor example, many people don\u2019t know that the state\u2019s food stamp program is now called CalFresh, and those who qualify can apply through the county\u2019s Department of Public Social Services. Officials with the department say 59 percent of those estimated to be eligible are receiving CalFresh food assistance. That could be higher, Church said.\n\n\u201cOur agenda is making sure that all kids have access to health and well-being programs,\u201d Church said. \u201cI think there are a lot of systems in place, but they\u2019re all filled with bureaucracy, and many parents don\u2019t know how to access them. We need to create policy to break them down.\u201d\n\nStill, the report showed some bright spots, Church and others said. About 7 percent of all California children lacked health care coverage in 2013, compared with 11 percent in 2008. Teen pregnancy was down to 24 percent compared with 38 percent in 2008, and children\u2019s deaths also were down to 20 percent compared with 24 percent for those same years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California\u2019s children are more likely to have health care coverage, avoid teen pregnancy and live until adulthood, but many remain in poverty or with parents who lack secure jobs, according to a report released today.
