The Family Leader announced Thursday that its leaders are endorsing Ted Cruz for president in 2016.

Family Leader CEO Bob Vander Plaats and others are individually supporting Cruz, but the group is not endorsing a candidate before the Iowa Caucuses.

The announcement was just made at a news conference at the State Capitol Thursday morning.

The Family Leader released a statement Thursday morning, reading in part:

"The ministry of The FAMiLY LEADER has grown in recent years to encompass far more than elections and candidates. Especially with the growing, global impact of the If 7:14 call to prayer for revival, our focus is on transforming culture, strengthening families, and inspiring Christ-like leadership. Our work with pastors and churches has grown as well, and itâ€™s critical that none of our ministry efforts be seen as being co-opted by a partisan agenda.

"For these reasons and others, our board unanimously decided The FAMiLY LEADER needs to remain a standard bearer for Christian principles in our culture and government, and not endeavor to be a kingmaker in the election process."

The Family Leader is a political organization based in Pleasant Hill. The Family Leader is comprising The Family Leader Foundation, Marriage Matters, Iowa Family PAC, and Iowans for Freedom.

The group also remained neutral in 2011, but Vander Plaats personally endorsed Rick Santorum.
