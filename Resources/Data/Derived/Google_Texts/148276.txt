It’s almost as if some members of the GOP warned that the high deductibles on these Obamacare plans make their low monthly cost a giant illusion. But, hey … now since the Huffington Post is reporting on what we’ve been saying for years, it must be true!

Obamacare helped, but (many) millions still struggle with high out-of-pocket costs http://t.co/kpQ5jgGpjD — Jonathan Cohn (@CitizenCohn) May 20, 2015

It's not just you. Those health insurance deductibles are getting scary. http://t.co/kpQ5jgY0Id — Jonathan Cohn (@CitizenCohn) May 20, 2015

This really deserves “NEWSFLASH” or “BREAKING” as part of the headline for a little added irony.

Backing a public option that forces insurers to compete with lower deductibles is a must for the Democratic nominee. http://t.co/8ZZrEMw6JF — LOLGOP (@LOLGOP) May 20, 2015

A “must” for Hillary Clinton? So, she has to campaign on how badly Obamacare was structured? We like it.

Yes, they really really are……. great program, but tough to afford http://t.co/6dAiwbTIyK — Logan Justice (@SuperheroLJ) May 20, 2015

But President Obama keeps saying it’s affordable? Is he lying?

People delaying care because of rising deductibles. You are not alone. http://t.co/W5QpCbMEMk — Mona O'Connell (@authormgtobe) May 20, 2015

And we’ll end it with this. Is everything that’s wrong with Obamacare a bug, or is it all part of the plan:
