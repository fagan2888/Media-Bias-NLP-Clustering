(NYSE:LRN) earned $848 million in revenue for the 2013 fiscal year, 86 percent of it from its business running virtual public schools in 33 different states., according to its 2013 annual report.\n\nTilson doesn\u2019t hold back much in his criticism.\n\n\u201cK12 reminds me of the subprime mortgage lenders and for-profit colleges when they were flying high \u2013 and the ending will be similar I believe,\u201d Tilson wrote in an email to Business Insider, who posted his entire slide presentation here.\n\nTilson, also an outspoken education reform proponent who previously served on the National Alliance of Public Charter Schools board, \u201cshorted\u201d K12\u2019s stock in the presentation, meaning he predicts that the company\u2019s value will go down.\n\nHe made his decision because of what Tilson describes as K12\u2019s aggressive pursuit of students unsuitedto the home-based online schooling that led to poor academic results. He also expressed concern about numerous regulatory issues and accusations of wrongdoing K12 has faced that Tilson wrote, \u201cI\u2019m convinced the problems are endemic.\u201d\n\nK12, for its part, has defended its low test and graduation rates in many states, pointing out the schools they run tend to attract large numbers of at-risk students.\n\nHe highlights the Tennessee Virtual Academy, which opened in 2011 and is \u201cthe worst of any school in the state,\u201d according to Tilson.\n\nThe school had test scores in its first year of operation that put it in the bottom 11 percent of Tennessee schools, according to 2011-12 school data.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s almost no learning at all going on at TVA,\u201d Tilson writes on a slide showing the school\u2019s low test scores.\n\nTo read Tilson\u2019s slideshow, which is chock-full of charts, data and interviews from named and unnamed former K12 employees, click here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfeca\"", "article_summary": "(NYSE:LRN) earned $848 million in revenue for the 2013 fiscal year, 86 percent of it from its business running virtual public schools in 33 different states., according to its 2013 annual report.\nTo read Tilson\u2019s slideshow, which is chock-full of charts, data and interviews from named and unnamed former K12 employees, click here.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s almost no learning at all going on at TVA,\u201d Tilson writes on a slide showing the school\u2019s low test scores.\nHe highlights the Tennessee Virtual Academy, which opened in 2011 and is \u201cthe worst of any school in the state,\u201d according to Tilson.\nThe school had test scores in its first year of operation that put it in the bottom 11 percent of Tennessee schools, according to 2011-12 school data."}
