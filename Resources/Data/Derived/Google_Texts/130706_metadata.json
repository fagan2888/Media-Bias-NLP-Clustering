Another area of concern for local residents on the harbour is downstream pollution from the surging number of large cruise ships docking in Sydney harbour.\n\nBut Gavin Birch, an associate professor from Sydney university's school of geosciences, who has researched the health of the harbour for decades, says that metal pollution levels are plateauing to new lows, decades after regulations banning toxic tin were introduced.\n\n\"In the last three or four years we've been taking [samples] in all parts of the harbour and in every case the metal concentrations have declined,\" he said.\n\nIn general the environment department report's findings about NSW's beaches were largely positive.\n\nOf the 144 NSW ocean beaches examined by the water quality monitoring service Beachwatch, 97 per cent were ranked \"good\" or \"very good\" \u2013 a marginal increase on last year. Ratings across another 100 additional swimming spots, including estuarine and river swimming spots, also increased slightly.\n\nSome of the beaches in the inner-harbour area that received good or very good ratings included Woolwich Baths, Redleaf Pool and Hayes Street Beach.\n\nThe state opposition has questioned how much of this improvement is due to last year's near-record dry summer.\n\n\"The Baird government has cut over 450 staff from Sydney Water, or about 15 per cent of its staff. Most of these jobs have been cut from frontline maintenance,\" opposition water spokesman Peter Primrose said.\n\nMr Primrose said beach the cleanliness would be tested again when it rains.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "How safe are Sydney&amp;#8217;s inner-harbour swimming spots?
