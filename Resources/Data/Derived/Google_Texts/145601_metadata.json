Hair, an attorney for the North Carolina NAACP, said in her opening statement.\n\n\u201cThey were voter suppressors in search of a pretext,\u201d she told the judge.\n\nThe state has argued throughout the case that the 2013 changes were neutral on their face, burdening all voters \u2013 not just African-American or Latino voters \u2013 and that the state\u2019s election laws now resembled those in other states, where same day registration and early voting don\u2019t exist.\n\nBut Hair dismissed that argument, saying that other states do not have the same racially-charged history of voter suppression as does North Carolina.\n\n\u201cPoll taxes were neutral on their face,\u201d Hair said. \u201cLiteracy tests were neutral on their face. The law teaches it is the impact that matters \u2013 an impact that is linked to social and historical conditions \u2013 not whether a law explicitly says African Americans or Latinos are not allowed to vote.\u201d\n\nOutside, the trial over the voting changes in the court of public opinion also waged on.\n\nSpeakers from the state NAACP held an early morning press conference while their supporters and others from voting rights advocacy groups chanted what\u2019s become the mantra for the Moral Monday movement: \u201cForward together! Not one step back.\u201d\n\nIn the opposite corner behind a podium bearing the NCGOP logo, state Republican Party spokesman Ricky Diaz told the media that the election law changes were simply common sense provisions meant to ensure the integrity of the vote.\n\nThe parties have identified nearly 100 voters, experts and state officials as possible witnesses in the case, and once opening arguments ended, the challengers began calling them to the stand.\n\nDurham resident Gwendolyn Farrington told the court that she tried to vote near her 6 a.m.-to-6 p.m. job, since she couldn\u2019t get to her own precinct, but was told that she had to cast a provisional ballot \u2014 which she later learned would not be counted.\n\nRev. Dr. William J. Barber II, president of the state NAACP, also took the stand yesterday afternoon in advance of a planned Moral Monday voting rights march held at 5 p.m. in Winston-Salem.\n\n\u201cIn North Carolina, a literacy test is still on the books,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThe Voting Rights Act overruled it, but it remains there as a symbol.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this country we should be doing everything humanly possible to ensure all people can vote,\u201d he added.\n\nTrial will continue day-to-day at the federal courthouse at 251 N. Main Street, Winston-Salem, and is expected to last at least two weeks.
