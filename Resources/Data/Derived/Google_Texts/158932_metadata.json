Even so, the challenger and union member has taken campaign contributions from a conservative group tied to anti-union efforts.\n\nThe Illinois Opportunity Project, an organization who describes themselves as promoting \u201cprinciples of liberty and free enterprise\u201d on their website, is opposed to raising Illinois\u2019 minimum wage , expanding Medicaid, and advocates for the Illinois to opt-out of having its own state exchange for \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe IOP has ties to the Illinois Policy Institute, an organization which supports the same law firm (the Liberty Justice Center) which earlier this week filed a motion in court to deny unions in Illinois from being able to collect the so-called fair share dues that Gov. Rauner also opposes. On Feb .19, the IOP donated $3,000 to Napolitano\u2019s aldermanic campaign.\n\nIn January, the 43rd Ward Republicans organization donated $1,000 to the fireman. Alderwoman Mary O\u2019Connor blasted her challenger in the Northwest side ward\u2019s race.\n\n\"Anthony should immediately return the money he received from the extremist groups supporting his campaign, and denounce their union-busting efforts. They have no place in the 41st ward,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nFor his part, Napolitano told Ward Room that his campaign will not return the campaign contributions from the conservative groups. \u201cNo, we are not going to give the money back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe greatest thing about this election is that it is a non-partisan election. We\u2019ve received contributions from conservatives and liberals both. I\u2019m supported by a local firefighters union that supported her in 2011 but now they don\u2019t want her in office. I\u2019m endorsed by the SEIU who endorsed her in 2011, but she failed them as well so they don\u2019t want her in office. We\u2019re a grassroots campaign, and so we take money from a lot of different groups.\u201d\n\nThe challenger said the notion that he is in support of union-busting is laughable. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has been in a union for fifteen years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve paid my union dues. I\u2019ve shed blood, sweat and cried with union members. I pay into a pension and I will protect pensions. If anyone should be returning money it is her for taking money from O\u2019Hare interest groups and then not calling a hearing about noise complaints from residents in the ward, even though she\u2019s on the Aviation Committee.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor believes that the symbolism of Napolitano taking money from groups who are attacking unions, is still wrong. \u201cFamilies are sick and tired of the never ending assault on unions who give working people a collective voice,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd, they deserve better than a candidate who takes money from the right-wing organizations pushing that very agenda.\u201d\n\nThe IOP is connected to many issues other than labor ones, of course, including so-called \u201cschool reform.\u201d Napolitano, who says he has not had concerns expressed to him of his support for organized labor by any of his labor supporters, also told us that he unequivocally supports neighborhood Chicago Public Schools.\n\n\u201cI support CPS. I have three children in Chicago public schools,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not support charter schools, either. Flat-out. And, I support an elected school board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "41 ward council woman Mary O'Connor says that her runoff challenger Anthony Napolitano should give back campaign contributions made by conservative groups.
