In a time of unprecedented competition and an increasingly changing healthcare environment, Navicure further secured its leadership position in the healthcare industry through introduction of a patient payment solution, and continued ICD-10 educational outreach and client service this year.\n\nTo address the challenges associated with the rise in high-deductible health plans, Navicure launched a patient payment solution in August 2014. Navicure Payments allows healthcare organizations to estimate patient financial responsibility at the time of service. It also enables organizations to securely store patients\u2019 credit and debit card information and charge the card in full or create an automated payment plan once patient responsibility is determined. Navicure Payments clients have seen positive results, including accelerated cash flow, reduced bad debt and decreased patient collections costs.\n\nIn addition to equipping clients for a changing patient collections environment, Navicure continues to prepare them for ICD-10. In October 2014, CMS selected Navicure for ICD-10 end-to-end testing with eight Medicare payers to be held during the week of Jan. 26-30, 2015. The opportunity allows participating physician practices to remedy potential problem areas prior to ICD-10 implementation on Oct. 1, 2015. Navicure also continues to provide clients with ICD-10 compliance training, webinars and tools such as Navicure Code Source, ICD-10 Analyzer and ICD10Hub.com to help ensure clients\u2019 ICD-10 readiness.\n\nIn 2015, Navicure will remain focused on educating its clients about emerging trends affecting healthcare organizations, such as the growing prevalence of value-based reimbursement models. In this environment, organizations will have to evaluate current revenue cycle processes to maximize reimbursement. The company is committed to working alongside clients to help them meet their financial goals.\n\n\u201cThe reimbursement environment is changing drastically. Not only are healthcare organizations facing an increase in patient financial responsibility but also additional regulatory changes that could affect their bottom line. Our goal is to provide our clients with the products and resources they need to successfully tackle these challenges,\u201d said Jim Denny, founder and CEO of Navicure. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our accomplishments this year, and our focus for 2015 will be ensuring growth, innovative thinking, and most importantly, satisfied clients, supported through our 3-Ring Policy and our award-winning client services team.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Navicure and view the company\u2019s recent announcements.\n\nAbout Navicure\n\nNavicure\u2019s cloud-based healthcare billing and payment solutions help healthcare organizations of all sizes increase revenue, accelerate cash flow, and reduce cost in the course of managing insurance claims and patient payments.
