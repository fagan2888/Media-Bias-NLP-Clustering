That's 23 percent and 44 percent of the uninsured population, respectively.\n\nSo far, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam has elected to not expand TennCare, the state's Medicaid program. But it isn't too late for him to take the federal government's offer to pay 100 percent of the cost of the expansion for the first three years. After that, the federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost in the next three years. Republican Representative Jeremy Durham of Franklin is sponsoring a bill in the Tennessee General Assembly that would require Haslam to get lawmakers' approval should he decide to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act puts the decision to expand Medicaid coverage to non-elderly adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level in the hands of the states. In states, such as Tennessee, that choose not to expand, uninsured adults with incomes between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level may qualify for subsidies to help them pay for an insurance plan offered through healthcare.gov, but those with incomes below poverty level do not have access to new coverage options. So far, 25 states and Washington, D.C. have opted to expand Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Blog Post", "description": "From the Urban Institute A new interactive map by the Urban Institute displays the numbers of poor and low-income uninsured people across the U.S. who...", "title": "Map Shows Number of Memphis Metro Area Residents Who Would Be Eligible for Medicaid Under Obamacare Expansion | News Blog | Memphis News and Events | Memphis Flyer", "og": {"site_name": "Memphis Flyer", "description": "From the Urban Institute A new interactive map by the Urban Institute displays the numbers of poor and low-income uninsured people across the U.S. who...", "title": "Map Shows Number of Memphis Metro Area Residents Who Would Be Eligible for Medicaid Under Obamacare Expansion", "url": "http://www.memphisflyer.com/NewsBlog/archives/2014/02/05/map-shows-number-of-memphis-metro-area-residents-who-would-be-eligible-for-medicaid-under-obamacare-expansion", "image": {"width": 371, "identifier": "http://media2.fdncms.com/memphisflyer/imager/from-the-urban-institute/u/slideshow/3603064/1391637252-screen_shot_2014-02-05_at_3.53.34_pm.png", "height": 450}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media2.fdncms.com/memphisflyer/imager/from-the-urban-institute/u/slideshow/3603064/1391637252-screen_shot_2014-02-05_at_3.53.34_pm.png"}, "title": "Map Shows Number of Memphis Metro Area Residents Who Would Be Eligible for Medicaid Under Obamacare Expansion", "description": "From the Urban Institute A new interactive map by the Urban Institute displays the numbers of poor and low-income uninsured people across the U.S. who...", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@@biancaphillips"}, "oid": 3603016, "p": {"domain_verify": "d2d30bc6784f2b5e5f6a99b5b0dde6f6"}, "fb": {"app_id": 180262592037294}, "keywords": "barbecue, memphis barbecue, graceland, elvis presley, memphis bars, memphis, memphis nightlife, memphis news, memphis politics, memphis blog, martin luther king, civil rights museum, stax records, soulsville, john branston, fly on the wall", "google-site-verification": "T1zwTLmH_sFg9jmwVQ_ivGZvRF0EQ6sTuK_HW1biHDg", "thumbnail": "http://media2.fdncms.com/memphisflyer/imager/from-the-urban-institute/u/slideshow/3603064/1391637252-screen_shot_2014-02-05_at_3.53.34_pm.png", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "barbecue, memphis barbecue, graceland, elvis presley, memphis bars, memphis, memphis nightlife, memphis news, memphis politics, memphis blog"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f14\"", "article_summary": "For the Memphis/Bartlett/Collierville area, the map show 15,200 poor, uninsured people and 28,600 low-income, uninsured residents that would be eligible for Medicaid under an expansion.\nSo far, 25 states and Washington, D.C. have opted to expand Medicaid.\nSo far, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam has elected to not expand TennCare, the state's Medicaid program.\nThe Affordable Care Act puts the decision to expand Medicaid coverage to non-elderly adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level in the hands of the states.\nRepublican Representative Jeremy Durham of Franklin is sponsoring a bill in the Tennessee General Assembly that would require Haslam to get lawmakers' approval should he decide to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."}
