They suggest that otherwise laudable efforts to insulate the forecasts from political influence have resulted, somewhat ironically, in insulating the process from data that could improve their accuracy.\n\n\u201cThe bias in their forecasts results in a picture that\u2019s rosier than it really is,\u201d King told the Gazette. \u201cThey\u2019re not saying the system is in good health. Pretty much everybody who evaluates Social Security realizes there\u2019s a problem \u2026 But the system is in significantly worse shape than their forecasts are indicating.\n\n\u201cThis is a major problem,\u201d he continued. \u201cSocial Security is the single largest government program. It lifted an entire generation of elderly out of poverty, and today affects the lives of almost every American. The forecasts are essential for ensuring the solvency of the Social Security trust fund, as well for Medicare and Medicaid, which together add up to half of the entire budget of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe inherent bias in the forecasts has become more pronounced since 2000, the study found.\n\n\u201cThe study compared all forecasts made by SSA over the 80-year history of the program with its actual outcome, and found that its forecasts of the health of Social Security trust funds have become increasingly biased since 2000. Current forecasts are likely off by billions of dollars, and the program could be insolvent earlier than expected unless legislators act, the study found,\u201d the Gazette reported.\n\nWhile forecasting the health of the Social Security trust funds has long been part of the program \u2014 each year, the administration creates forecasts that look one, five, 10, 20, and even 75 years into the future \u2014 the study conducted by the Harvard-Dartmouth team is the first by anyone inside or outside of the government to evaluate their accuracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically been difficult to conduct studies that evaluate forecasts, but the Social Security Administration has been around long enough that if they made a 10-year forecast a decade ago, by now we can look to see how they did,\u201d Samir Soneji, assistant professor at Dartmouth and co-author of the study, told the Harvard Gazette. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous scientific value in evaluating real-world forecasts that were made by people who were really trying to figure out what the future was going to be like.\u201d\n\nWhat they found, King said, was that while forecasts were never perfect, they were largely unbiased for quite some time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A new study has revealed \u201cbiased\u201d forecasts by the U.S. Social Security Administration, suggesting the health of the system millions of Americans are depending on for their retirement is seriously overstated.
