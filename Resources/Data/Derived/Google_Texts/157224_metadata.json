A key piece of that campaign is a new television ad, obtained first by CNN\n\nThe ad, which will begin airing Thursday, comes as policy makers begin to set payment rates for next year. The preliminary rates for Medicare Advantage program, which covers seniors through private insurance, will be announced next month, and final rates will be set in April.\n\nThe ad campaign is part of a lobbying and media blitz by the insurance industry to avoid cuts to their Medicare Advantage payments. The Affordable Care Act cut the Medicare Advantage program by $200 billion. The law and other policy changes cut the program by 6.5% this year.\n\nInsurance officials say the cuts are already forcing insurers to cut their doctor networks , and they warn that further cuts will increase cost and limit access to seniors\n\n\"If the Medicare Advantage plan is cut once again, seniors are going to find out in October that their costs are going up, their benefits are being reduced and they have fewer choices of providers and fewer coverage options,\" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the insurance industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.\n\nIn the TV ad, seniors tell Washington that they depend on their Medicare Advantage coverage and will spread the word.\n\n\"No more cuts to Medicare Advantage,\" Evelyn Harrell said.\n\nAdded Mary Kay Boerner, \"You know, we vote.\"\n\nInsurers believe that timing will help their cause. Most seniors will find out about the new rates during open enrollment in October -- only weeks before congressional elections. And insurers are betting that lawmakers won't want to be explaining to 14 million seniors why their health care costs more or their benefits have decreased.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The insurance industry is launching a seven-figure campaign to persuade Washington officials not to cut Medicare Advantage funding next year.", "pubdate": "2014-01-16T11:00:22Z", "author": "By Chris Frates, CNN Investigative Correspondent", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The insurance industry is launching a seven-figure campaign to persuade Washington officials not to cut Medicare Advantage funding next year.", "pubdate": "2014-01-16T11:00:22Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/politics/medicare-advantage-ad-campaign/index.html", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/politics/medicare-advantage-ad-campaign/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, First on CNN: Insurers launch new ad to stop Medicare Advantage cuts - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2014-01-16T16:04:35Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the TV ad, seniors tell Washington that they depend on their Medicare Advantage coverage and will spread the word.\nThe ad campaign is part of a lobbying and media blitz by the insurance industry to avoid cuts to their Medicare Advantage payments.\n\"No more cuts to Medicare Advantage,\" Evelyn Harrell said.\nThe Affordable Care Act cut the Medicare Advantage program by $200 billion.\nThe preliminary rates for Medicare Advantage program, which covers seniors through private insurance, will be announced next month, and final rates will be set in April."}
