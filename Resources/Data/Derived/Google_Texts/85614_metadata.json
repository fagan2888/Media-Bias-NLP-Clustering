That fund ended, and former TD Capital Managing Director Marc Michel joined Metamorphic as a partner in 2009. The firm raised its first $20 million fund in 2009 and 2010, and Mr. Gersh left for personal reasons last year.\n\nMetamorphic divided the world into four areas, Mr. Hirsch said\u2014Web companies like Google, media companies like AOL Inc., commerce companies like 1-800-Flowers.com Inc. and payments and payment processing companies like Visa Inc. and PayPal.\n\nThe global financial crisis had scared off many local angel investors, but there were good opportunities to invest, he said\u2014media and commerce, for instance, were integrating.\n\nHowever, although Metamorphic built a promising portfolio, the partners found they had raised too little capital to participate in follow-on rounds with their best companies.\n\n\u201cWe found ourselves farming out our winners to bigger VCs,\u201d Mr. Hirsch said.\n\nThis cramped growth, so the firm raised enough money from current investors to invest more in three of its companies\u2014the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo Inc., the ad targeting platform Chango Inc. and Movable Inc., which enables e-mails to change as users interact with them\u2014and then started to raise a bigger fund.\n\nMetamorphic\u2019s second fund focuses on the intersection of digital and physical businesses. E-commerce, for instance, is the fastest growing online category, but revenue at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is still bigger than e-commerce. The firm wants to be able to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\n\u201cHow do we help move the needle on where the big numbers are\u2013to do more of what we\u2019re doing and take bigger positions when we start and have the ability not only to follow on but to add to our position sizes?\u201d Mr. Hirsch said.\n\nThe second fund also includes institutional investors, who contributed about 70% of the capital, although Metamorphic didn\u2019t want to lose the experience and connections of the industry operators who invested in the first fund.\n\nThe firm has a group of executives with ties to Silicon Valley tech companies, mainstream companies and universities who advise entrepreneurs and bring Metamorphic potential deals, including companies that are being started by former employees of Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.\n\nOne portfolio company, Stamped, which created a mobile app that let people share recommendations on restaurants, books and other entertainment, was sold to Yahoo Inc. in 2012 for about $10 million and became Chief Executive Marissa Mayer\u2019s first acquisition, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSo far, Metamorphic has invested about $8 million out of its second fund. While the firm has had several exits, and \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of moneyball to be made on the investing side selling companies south of $100 million, I don\u2019t want to give you the wrong message there,\u201d he said there are big opportunities out there.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s big money to be made with the big winners,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hirsch, who said he helped develop Google\u2019s culture, has also incorporated some of it into Metamorphic, which has conference rooms painted in yellow, green and blue; gym equipment, and conferences known as \u201cwhiteboard workouts, where we\u2019re all working out and taking notes and thinking big.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned at Google is that you have to have fun and make a difference and have an impact,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Deborah Gage at deborah.gage@wsj.com.
