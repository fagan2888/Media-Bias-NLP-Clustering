As Halperin put it: \u201cThe press is largely sympathetic to their arguments that it\u2019s the House Republicans\u2019 fault.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn fact, as a new Media Research Center analysis of broadcast network evening news coverage shows, ABC, CBS and NBC spent the two weeks prior to the shutdown almost universally pinning the blame on congressional Republicans, especially conservative/Tea Party House Republicans. By the time the shutdown actually took place on October 1, news audiences had been repeatedly instructed to think about it as a GOP-generated crisis.\n\nFrom September 17 through September 30, the Big Three evening newscasts ran a total of 39 stories about the possibility of a government shutdown. Our MRC analysts found that a majority of those stories (21) were framed around the idea of Republicans triggering the crisis, compared to four that blamed both sides and absolutely none that put the onus on Democrats\u2019 failure to negotiate. (The remaining 14 stories did not include discussion of blame.)\n\nAs explained by network news correspondents, the responsibility for the deadlock lies with Republicans for failing to put aside their opposition to ObamaCare. Talking about the initial House Republican decision to seek defunding of the health care law, CBS Evening News correspondent Nancy Cordes on September 18 said \u201cSpeaker Boehner was forced into the risky strategy by his right flank...[a strategy] one Senate Republican described to us today as suicide.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwo days later, NBC\u2019s Brian Williams argued that \u201cthe wheels were set in motion\u201d toward a potential shutdown after \u201cRepublicans in the House passed a bill that would keep the government going while killing ObamaCare.\u201d A week later, on the September 27 Nightly News, NBC\u2019s David Gregory zeroed in on \u201ca relatively small group of legislators, you have Tea Party conservatives in the House who don\u2019t want to give up on this ObamaCare defunding fight.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday, September 29, after Harry Reid\u2019s Senate had killed the proposal to cut off ObamaCare funding, the networks characterized the much-milder demand for a one-year delay as too radical to consider. According to NBC\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell that night, \u201cTea Party conservatives held to their risky demand,\u201d while on CBS, Nancy Cordes argued that \u201cHouse Speaker John Boehner had hoped to dial back this fight, but was urged to press on by conservative Tea Party members.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe next night, after Republicans had retreated to an even-milder proposal to delay just the individual mandate (the President himself, in July, had ordered such a delay for the mandate on businesses), ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer presented Obama\u2019s characterization of the situation as reality: \u201cThe President expressed outrage that one faction in one House of Congress is ready to bring the entire federal government to a halt.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Sawyer\u2019s hyperbole about \u201cthe entire federal government\u201d coming to a halt was contradicted by her own correspondent, Jonathan Karl, a few minutes later: \u201cNot everything gets shut down. Troops will continue to get paid, Social Security checks will continue to go out.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on that night\u2019s CBS Evening News, Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer framed it as a crisis caused by \u201cultra-conservatives.\u201d According to Schieffer, the question was \u201cwill the moderate and more establishment Republicans continue to go along with the ultra-conservatives?...We\u2019re headed to a shutdown unless the moderates in the House revolt.\u201d\n\nAs for the rare story that blamed both sides, ABC\u2019s Karl on the September 26 World News juxtaposed Republicans\u2019 \u201claundry list of demands\u201d with a White House that \u201chas decided not to try\u201d to strike a deal. \u201cInstead of negotiating, they are name calling,\u201d Karl reported. \u201cToday, one of the President\u2019s top aides said of Republicans, quote, \u2018What we\u2019re not for is negotiating with people with a bomb strapped to their chest.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a White House briefing on Monday, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta actually confronted spokesman Jay Carney about the tactic of seeming to \u201ctaunt Republicans\u201d rather than exploring the potential for a constructive dialogue.\n\n\n\nAcosta told Carney: \u201cIn the last couple of weeks, Democrats, including the President, have\n\n\u2014 and he has not used all of these words, but I\u2019ll throw out some of them that have been used \u2014 have referred to Republicans as \u2018arsonists,\u2019 \u2018anarchists,\u2019 \u2018extortionists,\u2019 \u2018blackmailers,\u2019 \u2018hostage-takers.\u2019...It almost sounds as if this White House is trying to taunt Republicans into shutting the government down.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Democratic congressmen, or a Democratic Speaker of the House, pursuing a liberal policy objective, was subjected to similar ridicule or insults from a Republican President or a Republican Senate Majority Leader, you can bet that the networks would have made such language the centerpiece of their coverage.\n\n\n\nInstead, the media have chosen to foist all of the blame on conservatives for sticking to their promise to oppose ObamaCare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "On Monday morning, Time/MSNBC political analyst Mark Halperin explained an obvious political reality to his fellow Morning Joe panelists: \u201cThe White House does not have much incentive\u201d to negotiate on the government shutdown, because Democrats expect the liberal news media to hand them a public relations victory.
