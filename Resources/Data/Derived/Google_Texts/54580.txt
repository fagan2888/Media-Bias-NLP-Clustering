Dr. Ben Carson on Thursday released seven principles he says will guide him as he develops his own conservative alternative to Obamacare.

The former director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital released the principles through his role as chairman of the American Legacy PAC’s Save Our Healthcare Project.

Here are the principles, which the American Legacy PAC says will be developed into an alternative healthcare plan to Obamacare later this year:

Our health is the most personal and important thing we possess, therefore its care must be under our control.

Centralization and bureaucracy are the antithesis of personalization, and only discourage choice and innovation.

Large-scale change should not be imposed from above. Instead, we must have the freedom to choose what is best for our families and build on proven successes.

Advancing technology and innovation can reduce costs and increase efficiency but every individual must always own and control their personal medical information.

States should have maximum flexibility to design the programs that serve their citizens.

Employers and individuals purchasing health insurance must always be free to buy coverage and benefits consistent with their moral and religious beliefs.

Physicians are the backbone of our healthcare system and deserve to practice in an environment free of unnecessary, frivolous and costly lawsuits.

As The Daily Caller reported last week, Carson, who some conservatives are urging to run for president in 2016, is scheduled to meet with the lawmakers of the Congressional Health Caucus on Thursday to discuss health care.

But he isn’t the only potential 2016 candidate offering a his own replacement plan. On Wednesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal unveiled a conservative health-care proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare.
