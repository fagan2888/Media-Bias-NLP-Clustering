Credit: AG Architecture\n\nBy of the\n\nBy the end of 2016, a museum focused on Waukesha's history \u2014 including legendary guitarist Les Paul \u2014 will likely reopen in much better financial shape as part of a project that will create 41 high-end apartments.\n\nThe financially troubled Waukesha County Museum is selling its downtown property, including the historic former courthouse, to a group led by local developer Alan Huelsman, who operates Berg Management Co.\n\nIf the project wins final city approvals, the new owners will demolish a building that connects the former jail, built in 1885, to the former courthouse, built in 1893 and known for its 120-foot tower and four corner turrets.\n\nIn the connector building's place, Huelsman's group, Historic Prairieville Limited Partners, will develop a five-story apartment building with a section that ties to the courthouse. The $9 million apartment development will be a combination of that new construction and the renovated former jail.\n\nHistoric Prairieville will lease the three-story former courthouse to the museum for annual rent of $1.\n\nThe partnership will install a new heating, air conditioning and ventilation system at the historic courthouse, 101 W. Main St., allowing the museum to reduce its utility bills.\n\nThe museum will use around 25,000 square feet in the courthouse, compared to 82,000 square feet it now uses in the connector building and courthouse, said Dennis Cerreta, executive director of the Waukesha County Historical Society and Museum.\n\nCerreta said that smaller space is enough to house the museum's three main exhibits, which cover Waukesha's initial settlement, its role in the Civil War, and the story of Les Paul, who grew up in Waukesha and is the inventor of the solid-body electric guitar \u2014 which helped give birth to rock music.\n\nFinally, Huelsman's group will restore the original third-floor courtroom into space the museum can use for educational programs.\n\nThe group could then partner with a catering firm to lease it out for weddings and other events, said Catherine Huelsman, Alan Huelsman's wife and Berg Management general manager.\n\n\"This gives us a plan on how the museum can proceed,\" Cerreta said.\n\nThe museum began seeking development partners after Waukesha County decided to stop funding it. County funding, which accounted for half of the historical society's budget, ended Dec. 31.\n\nAs a result, the museum has greatly cut its hours. It is open Thursdays 1 to 4 p.m., with access to the archives by Friday appointments only.\n\nMeanwhile, the plan to redevelop the courthouse, unveiled in February, is proceeding through the city's review process.\n\nThe proposal to demolish the former connector building, built in 1938, was approved by the city's Landmarks Commission in June.\n\nThis month, the Landmarks Commission granted conditional approval to the apartment addition's design.\n\nThe project will feature studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, with underground and street-level parking. The monthly rents will likely range from around $750 to $1,850, Catherine Huelsman said.\n\nA portion of the former jail will include a community room for apartment residents, and bricked windows in that building will be reopened.\n\nThere also will be a new driveway off Main St. for dropping off people going to the museum and events at the banquet room.\n\nThe project was presented to the Plan Commission on Wednesday for an initial review.\n\nCommission members, including Mayor Shawn Reilly, supported the general concept of creating apartments and blending them into the historic buildings.\n\nHowever, they also expressed concerns similar to comments that surfaced at this month's Landmarks Commission meeting. Some of that involves the new apartment building's height, and the challenges of blending new construction with historic buildings.\n\n\"I think it's very difficult to create a contemporary building sitting between two historic structures,\" said R.G. Keller, a commission member and an architect.\n\nThe current plan was revised after city officials had concerns the apartment building's initial design, which included peaked roofs, drew too much attention away from the old courthouse and jail, said Maria Pandazi, a city planner.\n\nThe Plan Commission could vote on the proposed site plan and architectural review at its next meeting, scheduled for Sept. 9.\n\nHuelsman told commission members he hoped that vote would occur then. He said the city approval process is \"kind of moving at a glacial pace.\"\n\nBut commission member and Ald. Joan Francoeur said \"speed is not a criteria for me right now because of the importance of the location and the buildings. ... I'm looking for the 'wow' factor.\"\n\nAlong with Plan Commission approval, the project will need height and setback variances from the Board of Zoning Appeals, Pandazi said.\n\nAlso, Huelsman and city officials are in preliminary discussions about possible city financing help for the project through a tax incremental financing district, Reilly said.\n\nCities typically use such financing districts to help pay for commercial developments, with the project's new property tax revenue paying back those funds. Once those funds are paid back, the new property taxes flow to the city, its school district and other local governments.\n\nAny city financing help would need Common Council approval.\n\nIf all those city approvals occur, project work could begin in November, Cerreta said.\n\nThe museum will close for an undetermined period during the project.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would have the museum remaining closed until the entire project, including the apartments, is finished, Cerreta said. It will likely take around a year to build the apartments.\n\nHuelsman's project probably will be \"the most important piece of development in downtown for a long time,\" project architect Gene Guszkowski told Plan Commission members.\n\n\"We want to make sure we get this right,\" said Guszkowski, AG Architecture president.\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/JSBusiness\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/TomDaykin", "article_metadata": {"title": "Waukesha County Museum makeover moves forward as part of apartment plan", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/waukesha-county-museum-makeover-moves-forward-as-part-of-apartment-plan-b99564775z1-323318381.html", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99564775z.1_20150829112136_000_gnpccfop.1-0.jpg", "height": 1126}, "type": "article", "description": "By the end of 2016, the museum focused on Waukesha\u2019s history \u2014 including legendary guitarist Les Paul \u2014 will likely reopen in much better financial shape as part of a project that will create 41 high-end apartments.", "title": "Museum makeover moves forward as part of apartment plan"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99564775z.1_20150829112136_000_gnpccfop.1-0.jpg", "description": "By the end of 2016, the museum focused on Waukesha\u2019s history \u2014 including legendary guitarist Les Paul \u2014 will likely reopen in much better financial shape as part of a project that will create 41 high-end apartments.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Waukesha County Museum makeover moves forward as part of apartment plan"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Plan Commission could vote on the proposed site plan and architectural review at its next meeting, scheduled for Sept. 9.\nAlong with Plan Commission approval, the project will need height and setback variances from the Board of Zoning Appeals, Pandazi said.\nHuelsman's project probably will be \"the most important piece of development in downtown for a long time,\" project architect Gene Guszkowski told Plan Commission members.\nThe project was presented to the Plan Commission on Wednesday for an initial review.\nIn the connector building's place, Huelsman's group, Historic Prairieville Limited Partners, will develop a five-story apartment building with a section that ties to the courthouse."}
