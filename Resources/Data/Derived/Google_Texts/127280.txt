The state is giving a first look at insurance networks for 2016 under the Affordable Care Act.

Every hospital in the state will be covered by at least two of the insurance plans that will be sold on Healthcare.gov in 2016. There will also be an uptick in the total number of plans over this year.

Michael Wilkey with the insurance department says there will be lots of options.

"I would encourage individuals to seek out navigators and other individuals who are able to help people understand the, shall we say, the complexity of both the plan designs as well as the networks that are being offered on the exchange," says Wilkey.

In other words, find a broker – free of charge – to help you navigate what insurers will cover, and where they will and won’t cover it. Insurers still have a few months to finalize their networks and rates.
