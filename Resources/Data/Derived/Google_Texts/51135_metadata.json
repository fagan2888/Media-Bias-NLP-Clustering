This year\u2019s budget proposal is no exception.\n\nObama wanted God to bless Planned Parenthood and, this year, he wants them blessed with hundreds of millions.\n\nAs Tom Minnery of March for Life explains:\n\nThe good news in President Obama\u2019s budget is that Title X funds (p. 434) that generally give money to entities like Planned Parenthood have gone down from $297,400,000 to $286,479,000. (That is still higher than the figure in 2007 ($283,146,000.)) Also it appears that $5,000,000 is set aside for true abstinence education (p. 490) while almost six times that amount is reserved for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d abstinence education that does everything from encouraging young kids to shower together to helping fund online \u201cHow to BDSM\u201d videos for teens. The bad news is the Obamacare slush funds make it impossible to fathom where some of the money will be going. In one instance the budget gives \u201d approximately $14.6 billion over 10 years to implement innovative policies to train new health care providers and ensure that the future health care workforce is prepared to deliver high-quality and efficient health care services. To encourage and enhance training of primary care practitioners, and other physicians in high-need specialties.\u201d While this provision is probably to counter the rapid loss of doctors the country is facing over Obamacare regulations, I cannot remember if when we were fighting Obamacare if we put in protections to ensure that money doesn\u2019t go to training of future abortionists, however regardless if we did or not considering this Administrations flagrant willful ignorance of the law there is little guarantee. The $350 million slush fund known as \u201cCommunity Services Block Grants\u201d still exists as well, to be distributed at the whim of the Secretary.\n\nPlanned Parenthood continues receiving taxpayer funds despite recent annual report documents showing it remains the nation\u2019s biggest abortion business and provides few options for pregnant women other than abortions.\n\nAccording to their annual report [PDF], Planned Parenthood performed 333,964 abortions in 2012\u2014almost 80,000 more than they performed in 2005. That\u2019s about one every 95 seconds, every day of the year. The report shows 149 abortions for every adoption referral Planned Parenthood makes and it made $170 million from abortions.\n\nOne of the most glaring numbers was the steep decline in prenatal services-a 31.97 percent decline from the prior year. In addition, Planned Parenthood\u2019s highly touted cancer screening services dropped 14.22 percent from the 2011 numbers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's Budget Sends $286,479,000 to Planned Parenthood Abortion Biz", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "President Barack Obama and Planned Parenthood have been bosom buddies since his election -- and the president has kept flow of taxpayer funds on ever since ente", "title": "President Obama\u2019s Budget Sends $286,479,000 to Planned Parenthood Abortion Biz", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/03/04/president-obamas-budget-sends-286479000-to-planned-parenthood-abortion-biz/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baraobam81-190x149.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "president obama\\'s budget sends $286,479,000 to planned parenthood abortion biz", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc07b\"", "article_summary": "In one instance the budget gives \u201d approximately $14.6 billion over 10 years to implement innovative policies to train new health care providers and ensure that the future health care workforce is prepared to deliver high-quality and efficient health care services.\nObama wanted God to bless Planned Parenthood and, this year, he wants them blessed with hundreds of millions.\nAccording to their annual report [PDF], Planned Parenthood performed 333,964 abortions in 2012\u2014almost 80,000 more than they performed in 2005.\nThe report shows 149 abortions for every adoption referral Planned Parenthood makes and it made $170 million from abortions.\nPresident Barack Obama and Planned Parenthood have been bosom buddies since his election \u2014 and the president has kept flow of taxpayer funds on ever since entering the White House in 2009."}
