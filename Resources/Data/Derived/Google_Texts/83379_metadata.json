Rick Perry announces his 2016 candidacy for president June 4, 2015, in Addison, Texas.\n\nThe Big Conversation\n\nNew federal campaign reports released on Thursday present a portrait of a free-spending Rick Perry presidential campaign weeks before Perry dropped out of the race.\n\nAs the Tribune's Patrick Svitek reports, the campaign spent about four times as much as it raised between July 1 and Sept. 30. The campaign reported spending $1.1 million.\n\n\"Among Perry's largest expenses was $200,000 to Abstract Communications, an Austin-based firm owned by his former campaign manager, Jeff Miller,\" Svitek writes. \"In its last campaign finance report, Perry's campaign said it paid nearly $400,000 to the firm, which offered a variety of services such as video production and website development.\"\n\nBut even with a faltering fundraising effort, Svitek notes that Perry was still receiving big dollar contributions from a number of familiar folks, including \"San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt, hair products magnate John Paul DeJoria and Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor whose son ran a now-defunct super PAC supporting Perry. Perry also collected a $2,700 check from David Botsford, a member of the legal team fighting his indictment.\"\n\nTrib Must Reads\n\nVela to Host Major South Texas Fundraiser, by Abby Livingston \u2013 A band of powerhouse congressional Democrats is headed to South Texas this weekend to headline a fundraiser bolstering the campaign coffers of U.S. Rep.
