It's for the same drug,\u201d Schmid said.\n\nHe said some of the providers, including Humana and Aetna, have already lowered their drug costs in response to the complaint, which is still pending.\n\nIn a memo sent to insurers preparing to file 2016 Marketplace plans, the OIR said it would deem plans as discriminatory if the tiered formulary of HIV/AIDS medications was not at least as favorable as the state\u2019s benchmark plan.\n\nFlorida\u2019s benchmark plan limits patient co-pays to $40, $70, or $150 per 30-day supply, depending on the medication.\n\nOne injectable medication has a co-pay of $200. Plans in 2016 would have to limit patient cost-sharing for HIV and AIDS medications to levels that are similar to those in the benchmark.\n\n\u201cThis is a major victory for people living with HIV who rely on medications to remain healthy,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cWe thank the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation for recognizing that insurers charging excessive co-insurance is discrimination and harms people with HIV who cannot afford the cost of their medications.\u201d\n\nDaylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
