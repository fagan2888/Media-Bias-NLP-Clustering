(Yankees fans: If you're not following her, click the blue button now.)\n\nOn Saturday, when her husband kept the Yankees unbeaten after the All-Star break, she let him (and the rest of the world) know she'd be late (and we all sympathized):\n\nHi @mlb Amanda here, can you postpone the Yankees game today? I am stuck on the Deegan again. Thanks! Xoxo \u2014 Amanda McCarthy (@Mrs_McCarthy32) July 19, 2014\n\nWhen fans suggested a Metrocard Plan B, she reminded them that she's not a mass transit sort of gal:\n\nTelling me to take the subway is like telling me there is a new stadium.. I know guys, I know.. \u2014 Amanda McCarthy (@Mrs_McCarthy32) July 19, 2014\n\nHer husband, the guy she calls \"Stretch,\" just shakes his head.\n\n\u201cIf everybody isn\u2019t apprised of what she\u2019s doing every few minutes, God knows what would happen,\u201d said McCarthy, himself a Twitter Hall of Famer, after the game. \u201cThat\u2019s how I find out what goes on with my wife. I read it when everybody else does.\u201d\n\nWell, if he accessed Twitter in the dugout, he found out she beat the traffic in time to comment on the weather:\n\nLoving the pinstripes.. Loving the cloudy weather, such a perfect day to sit outside and watch a game \u2014 Amanda McCarthy (@Mrs_McCarthy32) July 19, 2014\n\nAnd boast about her hubby, who has been looking like an ambidextous Clayton Kershaw lately. In six innings of Saturday's 7-1 victory, he struck out nine, walked none and gave up six hits. His ERA is 1.42 in his two starts as a Yankee and 1.78 in his last four starts.\n\nSo proud of that guy...
