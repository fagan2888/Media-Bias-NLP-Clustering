It's good to be Apple. Really good. As of this week, in fact, $700 billion worth of good. Apple's closing price of $122.02 per share on Tuesday made it the first American company ever to cross that market-cap threshold.

Apple is also now selling bonds in Switzerland, which is probably a smart way for the company to buffer its ginormous pile of cash. (As The Wall Street Journal points out, this means Apple can use proceeds from debt sales to reinvest in itself without getting taxed the way it would if it used money brought back from overseas.)

Plus, global interest rates are so low that selling bonds is a pretty cheap way to raise money. And boy does Apple have a lot of money—a staggering $178 billion in cash on hand. (That's more than double Bill Gates's net worth, and he's the richest man in the world.)

Apple has the financial influence of a not-even-that-small country at this point. The company's $178 billion—$178 billion!—puts it on par with the gross domestic product of a country like New Zealand, surpassing the GDPs of Vietnam, Morocco, and Ecuador, according to the most recent World Bank data.
