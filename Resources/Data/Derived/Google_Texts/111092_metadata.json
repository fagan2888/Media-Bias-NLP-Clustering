Journalism classes at Olympic Heights High School in West Boca Raton have created \"The Torch,\" online at ohtorch.com, which offers local, national and international news from a student perspective. They write about Olympic Heights events, too.\n\nIt's the only news website of its kind in the school system, according to the Palm Beach County School District's public affairs office.\n\nAlthough several high schools maintain student newspaper websites, most simply republish their printed edition, with rare updates. The Torch has a national news ticker at the top of the page, as well as a revolving photo gallery, polls and school sports updates.\n\nOn a recent day, the site offered staff-written stories about University of Missouri football player Michael Sam, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, Pope Francis, the Miami Heat, Ukraine and the Affordable Care Act. Student critics offered music, film, fashion and restaurant reviews.\n\nStories about Olympic Heights' celebration of St. Baldrick's Day as well as coverage of the basketball and softball teams also dominated the paper's main web page. The journalism classes, led by teacher David Keithley, still produce a traditional newspaper every six weeks.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "education, boca-raton, news, palm-beach", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "It's time, some students say, to bring the high school newspaper into the 21st century.The traditional student paper, published around once a month, has old news that anyone with an interest in the...", "title": "Boca Raton: Olympic Heights students create news website, The Torch", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-03-21/news/fl-olympic-heights-torch-20140321_1_the-torch-school-paper-michael-sam", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53220992/turbine/fl-olympic-heights-torch-photo-a-jpg-20140313/2048/2048x1585", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 143455335716926}, "description": "It's time, some students say, to bring the high school newspaper into the 21st century.The traditional student paper, published around once a month, has old news that anyone with an interest in the"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a47\"", "article_summary": "Journalism classes at Olympic Heights High School in West Boca Raton have created \"The Torch,\" online at ohtorch.com, which offers local, national and international news from a student perspective.\nSo, one high school journalism team has gone to where its peers are: on the Internet.\nThey write about Olympic Heights events, too.\nStories about Olympic Heights' celebration of St. Baldrick's Day as well as coverage of the basketball and softball teams also dominated the paper's main web page.\nStephanie Judd and Allison Bangert work on an upcoming edition of the Olympic\u2026 (Mark Randall, Sun Sentinel )It's time, some students say, to bring the high school newspaper into the 21st century."}
