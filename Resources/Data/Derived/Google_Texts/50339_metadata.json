Under the terms of the settlement, CVS may continue to manufacture and sell the mislabeled products until Jan. 1, 2015. The company has two years to comply with California's labeling law.\n\nIt's unclear whether the implicated products are being sold at CVS locations nationwide, or just in California. CVS did not immediately respond on Saturday to calls and emails from The Huffington Post requesting comment.\n\nThe settlement marks the second mea culpa in as many weeks issued by the company.\n\nLast month, CVS apologized for illegally charging women $20 co-pays for birth control, in violation of a regulation in the Affordable Care Act that requires health insurers to offer all generic forms of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives at no cost. The company has said it is sending refunds to customers who were charged.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CVS has agreed to pay a $225,000 penalty for mislabeling store-brand beauty products.\n\nThe health and retail giant settled allegations by four Californ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-10-05 16:13:47 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "CVS has agreed to pay a $225,000 penalty for mislabeling store-brand beauty products.\n\nThe health and retail giant settled allegations by four Californ...", "title": "CVS Will Pay $225,000 Penalty For Mislabeling Packages", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/04/cvs-mislabeled-packages_n_5932378.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2132686/images/o-CVS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CVS has agreed to pay a $225,000 penalty for mislabeling store-brand beauty products.\n\nThe health and retail giant settled allegations by four Californ...", "creator": "AlexCKaufman", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2132686/images/o-CVS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "CVS Will Pay $225,000 Penalty For Mislabeling Packages", "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-04 16:13:47 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5932378", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "cvs mislabeled products,cvs health,cvs,CVS Pharmacies,CVS Caremark,cvs retail,cvs wrinkle cream,CVS Lawsuit,cvs california,cvs settlement california", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "cvs mislabeled products,cvs health,cvs,CVS Pharmacies,CVS Caremark,cvs retail,cvs wrinkle cream,CVS Lawsuit,cvs california,cvs settlement california", "published_time": "2014-10-04 16:13:47 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-10-04 16:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd613\"", "article_summary": "Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCVS has agreed to pay a $225,000 penalty for mislabeling store-brand beauty products.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, CVS may continue to manufacture and sell the mislabeled products until Jan. 1, 2015.\nEight moisturizing and wrinkle creams, two hair products and a topical acne-fighting gel were identified.\nIt's unclear whether the implicated products are being sold at CVS locations nationwide, or just in California.\nAside from a $1,200 fee paid to the Department of Agriculture, the money will be divided between Fresno, Yolo, Sacramento and Shasta counties."}
