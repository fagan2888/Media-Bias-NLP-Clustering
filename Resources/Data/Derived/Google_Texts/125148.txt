ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A group of more than 40 millionaires in New York state have written to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and top lawmakers calling on them to consider raising taxes on the state's wealthiest residents to help address poverty and rebuild failing infrastructure.

The letter proposes new, higher tax rates for the top one percent of earners. Those signing the letter include Abigail Disney, Agnes Gund, Leo Hindery and Steven C. Rockefeller.
