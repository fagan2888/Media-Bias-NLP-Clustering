Baker Newman Noyes (BNN) and The Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce invite you to a special employee benefit plan regulatory update presented by the BNN employee benefit plan practice and the Department of Labor (DOL).

Employee benefit plan sponsors take on a complex role as fiduciary of their organization’s benefit plans. Recent DOL enforcement initiatives, including a focus on deficiencies in the quality of benefit plan audits, highlight the risks fiduciaries bear in the administration of employee benefit plans.

Please join us, along with Mary Rosen, associate regional director of the DOL, EBSA, for a breakfast seminar. The presentation will explain current DOL enforcement initiatives and the importance of a quality benefit plan audit in meeting your fiduciary responsibilities.
