I am half-Jewish,\u201d he told a local ABC affiliate. \u201cI hung the flag after watching President Obama (Thursday) night. Obama usurped his oath of office. I wanted people to be shocked, because I am offended.\u201d\n\nMr. Wheeler would not agree to speak to the station on-camera. He reportedly removed the flag from the front of his home after repeated complaints.\n\nBeth Brooker, Mr. Wheeler\u2019s neighbor, said he and another woman hurled insults at her when she confronted them over the flag on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how somebody can have so much hate in them and feel it\u2019s OK to express themselves,\u201d she told the station. \u201cGranted, there\u2019s freedom of speech. He can do and say whatever he wants to, but I think you need to have some respect for people in this country \u2014 and that flag represents nothing but hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs offensive as I may find it and other people, he has a right to say what he wants,\u201d said another neighbor, Vicki Wolfson. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunately it had to be in such a nasty way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Virginia homeowner has outraged his community after flying a Nazi flag outside of his home in protest of President Obama's executive action on immigration reform.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Virginia homeowner has outraged his community after flying a Nazi flag outside of his home in protest of President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration reform.", "title": "Virginia neighborhood outraged by homeowner\u2019s Nazi flag", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/25/virginia-neighborhood-outraged-by-homeowners-nazi-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/25/william-wheeler.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/25/william-wheeler.jpg", "title": "Virginia neighborhood outraged by homeowner\u2019s Nazi flag", "description": "A Virginia homeowner has outraged his community after flying a Nazi flag outside of his home in protest of President Obama's executive action on immigration reform.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "William Wheeler"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde47c\"", "article_summary": "A Virginia homeowner has outraged his community after flying a Nazi flag outside of his home in protest of President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration reform.\n\u201cI hung the flag after watching President Obama (Thursday) night.\nBeth Brooker, Mr. Wheeler\u2019s neighbor, said he and another woman hurled insults at her when she confronted them over the flag on Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how somebody can have so much hate in them and feel it\u2019s OK to express themselves,\u201d she told the station.\nI wanted people to be shocked, because I am offended.\u201dMr. Wheeler would not agree to speak to the station on-camera."}
