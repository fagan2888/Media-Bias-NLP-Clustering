Barbara Boxer of California.\n\n\u201cWhat a breath of fresh air. \u2026 I urge an \u2018aye\u2019 vote,\u201d she told the Senate ahead of the roll call.\n\nThe amendment authored by Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), one of dozens proposed to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, came up in a whirlwind session that saw both parties angling to outmaneuver the other in a messaging battle over the first bill to hit the floor in the new Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nIn the end, only a modest measure stating that climate change is real and not a hoax passed the chamber, winning even the backing of Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the author of a book that denounces the idea that climate change is man-made.\n\nBut the 15 Republicans \u2014 including seven from red states as well as one likely presidential contender, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014went further, agreeing climate change was affected by human activity.\n\nGOP energy lobbyist and consultant Mike McKenna cheered the demise of Hoeven\u2019s climate amendment, which left Democrats only a muddled campaign-trail message to use against vulnerable Republicans.\n\nStill, he warned that the number of Republican senators backing Hoeven\u2019s amendment set a \u201creally troubling\u201d precedent, especially since Senate Minority leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) missed the vote while recuperating from his accident.\n\n\u201cIf Harry Reid\u2019s well, that passes,\u201d McKenna said in an interview. As for Democrats, he added: \u201cNext time they\u2019re going to come back much smarter, much tougher. \u2026 If we\u2019re losing Republicans on votes like that, we need to construct better votes.\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s trick play on the climate amendment had the party first propose language that stayed on message, praising \u201cabundant, affordable, clean, diverse and secure\u201d energy, its mantra that includes fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. But an edit emerged in the hours ahead of the vote that borrowed the Democratic language on human-caused climate change but omitted the word \u201csignificant\u201d to describe the impact.\n\nHoeven later told reporters that the change to include the climate language was made \u201cbecause our members felt they needed something they could vote for,\u201d though he was ultimately forced to vote against it to prevent it from reaching the 60-vote threshold.\n\nSome greens hailed the division among the Republicans and their leadership. Environmental Defense Fund senior director Jeremy Symons, a former Boxer aide, wrote Friday that the Hoeven vote \u201cexposes [a] GOP rift on climate.\u201d\n\nBut several GOP senators who backed the Hoeven amendment sought to play down the importance of the vote, including Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who dismissed it as no \u201cbig deal.\u201d And he noted that President George W. Bush\u2019s top environmental adviser had acknowledged global warming and was \u201ctrying to push technologies to deal with\u201d its effects.\n\nFor Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), voting in favor of the measure was easy. \u201cThere always has been [climate change], there always will be,\u201d he said, but the impact from humans is \u201cup for debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change is real \u2014 humans probably have some part of it,\u201d said another Republican who backed Hoeven\u2019s language, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. \u201cHow significant? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nRepublicans\u2019 omission of the word \u201csignificantly,\u201d he added, \u201creflects, I guess, some modesty about how little or as much as we know.\u201d\n\nStill, the Democratic minority watched with interest as Hoeven was forced to vote against his own amendment to prevent it from passing.\n\n\u201cTheir confusion was evident from our perspective,\u201d one Senate Democratic aide recalled.\n\nAnother Senate Democratic aide described the near-passage of Hoeven\u2019s language as \u201chopefully a sign of progress to come, but only time will tell.\u201d\n\nBut greens were split on why Paul, who\u2019s weighing a White House bid in 2016, would take a vote that fellow conservatives could use against him.\n\n\u201cBeing a denier isn\u2019t politically viable anymore,\u201d Democratic political consultant David DiMartino wrote via email, citing polls that show Iowa and New Hampshire voters aligning with climate science and Mitt Romney\u2019s recent turn back to public acknowledgement of global warming. \u201cRand must be seeing the same numbers Mitt is seeing.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s spokesman, Brian Darling, declined to comment on the vote.\n\nAs recently as last April, Paul downplayed the threat of climate change and humans\u2019 contribution to it, and he slammed potential presidential foe Hillary Clinton in September for saying global warming is among \u201cthe most consequential\u201d dangers to America. But Republican strategist McKenna said Paul voted yes on last week\u2019s climate proposal \u201con purpose,\u201d since agreeing that humans play some role \u201cis a pretty cheap way to hedge your bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a crowded field, everyone is trying to be the standout,\u201d Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund chief Heather Taylor-Miesle wrote in an email. \u201cPaul\u2019s vote could represent that thinking, but I just like to believe that he is coming around on the science and reading the tea leaves on the politics.\u201d\n\nSierra Club legislative director Melinda Pierce took a dimmer view of Paul\u2019s vote for the GOP climate language, saying in an interview that it \u201copens a conversation\u201d for the future but doesn\u2019t mark the Kentuckian as a pro-environment maverick. \u201cMaybe he put his toe in the water, but he didn\u2019t go swimming.\u201d\n\nScientists at the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and many other government bodies have for years raised the alarm about rising sea levels and higher temperature. The changes will threaten coastal populations and food supplies, while weather disasters become ever more destructive \u2014 unless humans quickly act to stem the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe offices of several other Republican senators who agreed last week that humans are changing climate did not return requests for comment by press time, including Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mike Rounds of South Dakota.\n\nAnd even if Paul or the Republicans take heat for last week\u2019s vote, the oil industry remains confident that economic growth and jobs will turn out more voters than threats to the planet.\n\n\u201cEven with Tom Steyer\u2019s epic defeat at the ballot box last fall, some Democrats are still holding on to the hope that climate change is their winning ticket,\u201d one industry source wrote via email, addressing the GOP\u2019s climate stance on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe American people made it very clear where they stood in the last election. The Steyer wing of the party should be put on notice.\u201d\n\nDarren Goode contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A measure linking human activity to warming exposes a split in the party.", "title": "After Senate climate votes, Dems see rift in GOP", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/senate-climate-votes-democrats-barbara-boxer-114556.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/24/150124_barbara_boxer_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Democrats,Climate Change,Barbara Boxer", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A measure linking human activity to warming exposes a split in the party.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1d1\"", "article_summary": "Senate Republicans fended off Democrats\u2019 climate change campaign in the Senate last week, but their strategy exposed cracks in the majority party.\n\u201cTheir confusion was evident from our perspective,\u201d one Senate Democratic aide recalled.\nGOP energy lobbyist and consultant Mike McKenna cheered the demise of Hoeven\u2019s climate amendment, which left Democrats only a muddled campaign-trail message to use against vulnerable Republicans.\nRepublicans managed to neutralize a Democratic amendment on climate change in favor of a watered-down statement that left deliberately vague how much human activity is to blame for global warming.\nIn the end, only a modest measure stating that climate change is real and not a hoax passed the chamber, winning even the backing of Sen.
