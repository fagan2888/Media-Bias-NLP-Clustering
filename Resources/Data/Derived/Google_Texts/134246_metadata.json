Invisible. In Danger.\u201d by two Florida newspapers details how those cuts have put patients and staff in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHealth News Florida spoke with the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Leonora LaPeter Anton, one of the reporters who spent more than a year looking into Florida\u2019s mental hospitals. You can hear the conversation about what this has meant for patients in these facilities here:\n\nAnton also talked about the responses from staff and other stakeholders in Florida\u2019s troubled mental hospitals:\n\nWhat have you heard from employees of these facilities about what they need?\n\nA lot of them told us they were afraid to do their jobs. In fact, in the wake of the series we've heard from tons of employees who have said, wow, you guys got it right\u2014this is how it is inside these facilities and we're afraid.\n\nWe heard also from others who say they're not afraid. It's not every single ward, every single patient. It\u2019s not completely horrible every single day of the week.\n\nIt\u2019s just that there\u2019s just not enough employees on duty, they said.\n\nThey often have to work double shifts, they're tired, they\u2019re not paid well. And what you find is the people who are working with the patients, they're not educated in the area of mental health often. They\u2019re people who maybe worked in McDonald's or Burger King and they maybe have a high school education. They get some training when they start out, but a lot of them said it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe other thing we saw was that each hospital has a staffing ratio. But it\u2019s not a standard ratio. It\u2019s by hospital. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any ramifications if it\u2019s not followed. So one thing that has been talked a lot about is coming up with a statewide standard for how many patients each staffer should take care of.\n\nThe Department of Children and Families responded with a list of disputes to your article. They say they only experienced about $50 million in budget cuts. How\u2019d they come up with such different numbers?\n\nThe state reports its expenditures on a state fiscal portal\u2014that's what it reports to the public. And this is what we used.\n\nThey\u2019re saying that part of that money is a fee for administration\u2014a fee for DCF\u2019s administration in Tallahassee.\n\nWe\u2019re saying, well, these are the figures you report to the public. And so we think that those are the proper figures to use.\n\nAnd also a lot of the disputes they had with our facts are not really disputes. Our facts are our facts. We do not feel anything is inaccurate. We feel everything is accurate.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nWe hope the state looks at the information we\u2019ve provided and comes up with some sort of answers, some sort of solution. Whether it\u2019s statewide standards, more money, better patient-to-staff ratios, more protection for patients, better training\u2014we think it\u2019s important.\n\nWe think we\u2019ve raised an issue that needs to be addressed and we hope that the state does.\n\n--Sammy Mack is a reporter with WLRN in Miami.
