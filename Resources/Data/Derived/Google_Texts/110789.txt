Bill Maher and his “Real Time” panel on Friday night debated the shooting in Garland, Texas, and the controversy over PEN America’s decision to give an award to Charlie Hebdo.

Maher opened the discussion by mentioning Pamela Geller, who he called “kind of a loon.”

“I’m not a fellow traveler with her, but she’s the one who sponsored this Draw Mohammed cartoon contest,” he said. “Now, obviously it was a provocation. But this is America. Do we not have the right to draw whatever we want?”
