Some lawyers are naturals at business development. Many others, however, have no idea how to start. Business development was not part of the traditional law-school curriculum. As a result, law firm marketers increasingly are being asked to coach their lawyers in business development skills.\n\n\u201cBusiness development coaches need to know two things,\u201d said Merrilyn Astin Tarlton. \u201cThey need to know how to coach and they need to know which lawyers will most benefit from coaching.\n\n\u201cBefore you can coach a lawyer, or anyone else for that matter, you need to build a relationship with that person,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had the experience of being \u2018told what to do\u2019 by someone we do not know or someone we dislike. It\u2019s excruciating.\n\n\u201cCoaching is based on trust,\u201d said Tarlton, \u201cand trust is created in a relationship. Good coaches will encourage the lawyers they are coaching to do most of the talking. Ask questions. Listen carefully to the answers and use this information to continue the conversation and dig deeper.\n\n\u201cMany lawyers come to the business development coaching process looking for a quick fix,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201c\u2019Just tell me what to do and let me get about my business.\u2019 But that is not how coaching works. There is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 formula. It is a careful process, not a quick prescription. Plus, each lawyer is unique. You cannot know what will or will not work with that lawyer without creating a relationship.\u201d\n\nTarlton discussed business development coaching in law firms at the monthly program of the Rocky Mountain Chapter of the Legal Marketing Association, held June 17 at Guard & Grace in LoDo, Denver.\n\nAs a founding member of Astin Tarlton, Tarlton consults with lawyers on their roles as leaders and business people. She was a founder and early president of the Legal Marketing Association. In 2007, she was inducted in the LMA Hall of Fame. In addition, she has held senior positions with the ABA Law Practice Management Section. She launched Attorney at Work in collaboration with Feldcomm.\n\nThe second step in the business development coaching process is to carefully assess the lawyer\u2019s position within his or her career \u2013 in terms of both age and accomplishment. \u201cAll of these steps involve asking useful questions and carefully listening to the answers,\u201d said Tarlton.\n\nWhy did you go to law school? Why did you choose to focus on environmental rather than personal injury law? Why did you choose this particular firm? Where do you see your career in five or ten years? Which are your favorite and least-favorite clients --and why? Where did your best clients come from? Which business development tactics have you tried that worked -- or did not work? How do you feel about using these tactics?\n\n\u201cA good coach\u2019s questions and answers will be based on a lawyer\u2019s seniority and experience,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cA young lawyer fresh out of law school needs a different approach to business development than a senior lawyer with a long list of clients and contacts. So does a lateral transitioning from an in-house position. Once again, there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach.\u201d\n\nThe third step of the coaching process is to skillfully challenge the way that lawyers are trained to think. \u201cIn law school and in legal practice, lawyers are rewarded for knowing everything about a matter or a case \u2013 and never being wrong,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cIt goes against lawyers\u2019 nature to admit that they might need help. If lawyers state, \u2018I\u2019ll never be good at business development,\u2019 follow up by asking them why they think this is true. Try to get at the root of their resistance to business development.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth step of the business development coaching process, a good coach will help the lawyer come up with useful ideas and resources. \u201cNever say \u2018this is what you need to do\u2019,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cThere is no magic pill.\n\n\u201cDo some research and contribute this knowledge and these resources to the lawyer,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cProvide examples of tactics used successfully by similar lawyers. Ask the lawyer to name colleagues who are successful at business development \u2013 and to analyze these lawyers\u2019 approaches. Encourage the lawyer to generate individualized business development ideas based on these resources.\n\n\u201cLawyers are naturally curious and process-driven,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cGet them interested intellectually in business development and they will likely buy into the process.\u201d\n\nThe fifth step of the process involves supporting and encouraging the lawyers as they attempt to implement their business development ideas. Behaviors that are rewarded tend to be repeated.\n\n\u201cThis support can be individual,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cA coach can drop by the lawyer\u2019s office on a regular basis to assess and provide positive feedback, and to ask and answer additional questions. Support and encouragement also can be firm-wide, such as a method for public recognition of lawyers\u2019 business development accomplishments \u2013 perhaps in meetings or firm-wide emails or on the firm\u2019s intranet site.\u201d\n\nStep six entails creation of a method to track and measure success, using specific deadlines. How does the lawyer being coached define success? Is it three new clients in a particular industry? Is it five additional matters for an existing client? Is it strengthening his or her reputation in an area by writing three articles for a well-read industry publication? Lawyers carefully track progress on their matters and cases; tracking business development activities will feel natural to them and can help drive results.\n\nFinally, a good business development coach will help a lawyer to focus on the pipeline that will delivery work to his or her desk in the future \u2013 not just today. What are the emerging issues that will threaten your clients? Create lists of clients and potential clients who will be affected, and begin a communication process that puts you in front of these clients well in advance of the pack.\n\n\u201cNot all lawyers can be successfully coached,\u201d said Tarlton. \u201cBefore starting this process ask a few select questions to screen the good candidates from those who will only waste your time and talent. Work only with lawyers who take personal responsibility for their own success. Reject any lawyer who is not willing to partake in the process outlined above.\u201d\n\nQuestions to screen potential coaching candidates include:\n\nWill you commit to a certain amount of time to spend on this effort? (Most lawyers spend long hours at work and already feel that they are shortchanging their families. Nonetheless, a good candidate will be willing to set aside a specific amount of time each week.)\n\nAre you willing to acknowledge that, although you know a lot about your area of the law, you do not know everything about business development? Are you open to new ideas?\n\nCan you be counted on to keep all of your scheduled appointments with your coach \u2013 no matter how busy you are?\n\nWill you commit to \u201cwalking the talk\u201d \u2013 doing what you say you will do? If you agree to make three phone calls to existing client by the next meeting, will you do so?\n\nAre you willing to try something if you are not 100-percent sure it will work for you?\n\nAre you willing to take full responsibility for your own business development?\n\nIf business development staff can master the steps of the process, and if lawyers can commit, business development coaching can greatly benefit the careers of coaches and lawyers alike.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than ever before, lawyers are expected to develop new business for themselves and their law firms.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/hold-july-4successful-coaching-lawyers-process", "type": "article", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "More than ever before, lawyers are expected to develop new business for themselves and their law firms.
