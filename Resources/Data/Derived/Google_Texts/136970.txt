Health care services made up 62% of 2015’s deal volume, due to increased investor interest in post-acute health care sectors such as Long-Term Care and Rehabilitation. The Behavioral Health Care sector also gained more attention. Physician medical groups, both primary care and specialty physicians, were back in the limelight, as hospitals and health systems moved closer to a value-based reimbursement system.

The health care technology sectors were dominated once again by deal volume and spending in the Pharmaceutical sector, even though deal volume declined 10% in 2015. Spending in the Pharma sector was $297.4 billion, thanks in large part to the $160 billion pending acquisition of Allergan plc by Pfizer Inc., announced in the fourth quarter of 2015.

“Health care mergers and acquisitions benefited from a perfect storm of low interest rates and the building effects of the Affordable Care Act,” said Lisa E. Phillips, editor of Health Care M&A News. “Three years into the ACA, more consumers have health insurance and the shift to bundled payments is under way. Health care providers, health insurers and pharmaceutical companies are all looking for greater scale and cost efficiencies. We’ll see if 2016 can deliver the same level of growth.”

“The fourth quarter of 2015 helped those full-year results,” Phillips noted. Although deal volume declined about 10%, to 370 transactions, compared with the third quarter’s 409 transactions, Q3:15 was a record-breaker. Deal volume was also higher than Q4:14, up 4%. Spending in Q4:15 grew 1%, to $202 billion, compared with $199.5 billion in the third quarter, and was 46% higher than the same quarter in 2014, which posted $138.5 billion.
