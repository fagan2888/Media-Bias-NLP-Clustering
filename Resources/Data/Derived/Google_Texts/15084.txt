A good Samaritan stabbed and seriously injured a man who was allegedly sexually assaulting a woman Saturday morning near a bus stop on East Colfax Avenue, authorities say.

The names of the suspect, who suffered a deep cut, and the victim have not been released. The suspect is in serious but stable condition, Denver police Cmdr. Matt Murray said Saturday afternoon.

The suspect was attacking a woman near East Colfax Avenue and Downing Street when a man came to her aid and stabbed the alleged attacker, said Sonny Jackson, Denver police spokesman.

Witnesses told police the suspect was sexually assaulting the woman, Murray said.

“That’s one of the things we’re looking at,” Murray said.

“There was blood there, and blood there and blood around the corner,” said Bill Hilden, 68, as he pointed at three spots about 20 feet apart at the northeast corner of Colfax and Downing.

Hilden was standing about 20 feet from an RTD bus stop while waiting for his bus.

“I’ve seen guys picking on people there at the bus stop,” Hilden said. “You really can’t stop them. They are so damn aggressive.”

Detectives were interviewing the good Samaritan and the woman, Jackson said. The suspect is in custody at a hospital, he said.

The stabbing happened in front of a parking lot for a Papa John’s restaurant and just west of Paul’s Liquors, which is marked up with gang graffiti.

Perfecto Basurto, 55, the manager of the liquor store, said crime doesn’t happen there nearly as often as it used to.
