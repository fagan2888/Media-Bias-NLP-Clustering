Fox News producer Jesse Watters was the “one lucky guy” on Fox’s “Outnumbered” on Monday, saying President Barack Obama is in denial about the fact that he has gone from being “the messiah” to a “pariah”:

“The president basically went from the messiah to a pariah, and he’s in denial about it. He’s trying to say ‘Oh, Obamacare’s great, the economy’s great, but these stupid American voters, they don’t realize how good they have it,’ and he blamed it on the sales pitch. It’s like everything is great, but we couldn’t sell it because my own party quarantined me in the White House. And he also said ‘You know what, 75 percent of the country says that things are on the wrong track, but they don’t know any better. Things are great!’ It’s such an elitist attitude.”
