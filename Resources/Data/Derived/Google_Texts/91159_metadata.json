They were half dead, starving and desperate for home. But when the British aircraft-carrier HMS Speaker brought them into Sydney Harbour, the wharfies went on strike. For 36 hours, the soldiers were forced to remain on-board, tantalisingly close to home. This final act of cruelty from their countrymen was their thanks for all the sacrifice.\n\nColebatch coolly recounts outrage after outrage.\n\nThere were the radio valves pilfered by waterside workers in Townsville which prevented a new radar station at Green Island from operating.\n\nSo when American dive bombers returning from a raid on a Japanese base were caught in an electrical storm and lost their bearings, there was no radio station to guide them to safety. Lost, they ran out of fuel and crashed, killing all 32 airmen.\n\nColebatch quotes RAAF serviceman James Ahearn, who served at Green Island, where the Australians had to listen impotently to the doomed Americans' radio calls:\n\n\"The grief was compounded by the fact that had it not been for the greed and corruption on the Australian waterfront such lives would not have been needlessly lost.\"\n\nAlmost every major Australian warship was targeted throughout the war, with little intervention from an enfeebled Prime Minister Curtin. There was the deliberate destruction by wharfies of vehicles and equipment, theft of food being loaded for soldiers, snap strikes, go-slows, demands for \"danger money\" for loading biscuits.\n\nThen there were the coal strikes which pushed down coal production between 1942 and 1945 despite the war emergency.\n\nThere were a few honourable attempts to resist union leaders, such as the women working in a small arms factory in Orange, NSW, who refused to strike and \"pelted union leaders with tomatoes and eggs\".\n\nThis is a tale of the worst of Australia amid the best, the valour and courage of our soldiers in New Guinea providing our last line of defence against Japanese, only to be forced onto starvation rations and to \"go easy on the ammo\" because strikes by the wharfies back home prevented supplies from reaching them.\n\nA planned rescue of Australian PoWs in Borneo late in the war apparently had to be abandoned, writes Colebatch, because a wharf strike in Brisbane meant the ships had no heavy weapons.\n\nThere was no act too low for the unionists. For instance, in 1941, hundreds of soldiers on board a ship docked in Freemantle entrusted personal letters to wharfies who offered to post them in return for beer money. The letters never arrived.\n\nAt one point in 1942 a US Army colonel became so frustrated at the refusal of Townsville wharfies to load munitions unless paid quadruple time, he ordered his men to throw the unionists into the water and load the guns themselves.\n\nIn Adelaide, American soldiers fired sub-machine guns at wharfies deliberately destroying their aircraft engines by dropping them from great heights. Australian soldiers had to draw bayonets to stop the same Adelaide wharfies from stealing food meant for troops overseas.\n\nYou will read this book with mounting fury.\n\nCoelbatch offers various explanations for the treasonous behaviour of the unions. Many of the leaders were Communists obsessed with class warfare. Fervent \"identity politics\" led them to believe they were victims and servicemen and women were \"puppets of capitalism whose lives were of no consequence\". Contrary to popular belief, strikes and sabotage continued, even after the Soviet Union became an ally, writes Colebatch, who contends that the Australian Left may have wanted to undermine the military in preparation for revolution after the war.\n\nWhatever the reasons for the defective morality of those unionists who sabotaged our war effort, the traitors have never been brought to account. This story has been largely suppressed for 70 years because Labor and the Left have successfully controlled the narrative of history.\n\nNo more, thanks to Colebatch.\n\nARCHITECT REFUSES TO BE DRAWN\n\nARCHITECT Peter Tonkin, who designed the Australian War Memorial's Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier, has spoken out about the foiled plan to replace the iconic inscription \"Known Unto God\" with a Paul Keating quote.\n\nHe backs memorial director Brendan Nelson's claim that Charles Bean, the WWI correspondent who first conceived of the memorial, had stipulated it not be \"not sectarian in any sense at all.\n\n\"He wrote that very clearly in his purpose statement.\"\n\nThe Surry Hills architect described his design as \"full of non-sectarian symbolism\".\n\nBut he would not be drawn on the controversy over the God reference.\n\n\"My feelings on the matter are entirely private. I do think it's a great shame there's such a controversy about it all.\"\n\nNelson consulted Tonkin over his remodelling plans to incorporate Keating's 1993 speech.\n\n\"Known Unto God\", a staple of Unknown Soldier monuments around the world, was not included in the original 1993 design, but was added six years later on the suggestion of historian Geoffrey Blainey, then a member of the memorial's council.\n\nHONOUR TO MEET MAN OF VALEUR\n\nI HAD the privilege of meeting Australian war hero Mark Donaldson last week. The SAS Trooper was the first Victoria Cross recipient in 40 years, recognised for courage under fire in 2008 during a Taliban ambush.\n\nHe told me he used to listen to Metallica in preparation for battle.\n\nThe extraordinary feats of the SAS in Afghanistan have barely been acknowledged, because of the need for secrecy, except in rare accounts of battles, such as Sandra Lee's 18 Hours. Donaldson, like many SAS warriors, is wiry and slight, his physical capabilities tightly under wraps, his demeanour guarded.\n\nBut now he has opened up in his book, The Crossroads, about his journey from rebellious teenager with a green Mohawk in Dorrigo, through the family tragedies which propelled him into the Army. It is an inspirational tale, and one we must honour. As our presence in Afghanistan ends, we are in eternal debt to a magnificent new generation of fighting men and women, whose sacrifices and valour will be revealed in time.\n\n* Hear more of Donaldson's life and musical inspiration on my radio show today on 2GB 873, 4pm-6pm\n\nJANICE REID - SYDNEY'S UNSUNG HIGH ACHIEVER\n\nONE of the most influential, yet unsung high achievers in Sydney is Janice Reid.\n\nThe vice-chancellor of the University of Western Sydney retires next month after 16 years in which she has built up Sydney's black sheep institution into a thriving success and the lifeblood of Sydney's vibrant west.\n\nMore than half its students are the first in their family to go to uni and she still gets a kick out of graduation.\n\nWell done to a great Sydneysider.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AS the Abbott government begins to take on union power and corruption, a timely new book reveals the union movement's role in one of the most shameful periods of Australian history.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "AS the Abbott government begins to take on union power and corruption, a timely new book reveals the union movement's role in one of the most shameful periods of Australian history.", "title": "Unions exposed as war saboteurs", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/unions-exposed-as-war-saboteurs/story-fni0cwl5-1226751793596", "image": "http://resources.news.com.au/cs/dailytelegraph/images/placeholders/story-thumb-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226751793596, "keywords": "war effort, Australian soldiers, union leaders, deliberate destruction, union power, shameful periods, American soldiers, Australian history, union movement, beer money, Australian troop ships, American dive bombers, danger money, Japanese prison camps, Australian troops, union bastardry, personal letters, diary entries, radio valves, honourable attempts, class warfare, wharf strike, snap strikes, identity politics, Japanese base, heavy weapons, aircraft engines, mounting fury, key witnesses, ,,,Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, ,,,Afghanistan, United States of America Army, University of Western Sydney, Mark Donaldson, Hal Colebatch, Janice Reid, war saboteurs, Australian waterfront, starvation rations, Australian warship, home prevented supplies, British aircraft-carrier, defective morality, electrical storm, treasonous behaviour, coal strikes, forensic precision, radio calls, waterside workers, war emergency, untold story, coal production, James Ahearn, Peter Tonkin, Paul Keating, John Curtin, Brendan Nelson, Sandra Lee, Geoffrey Blainey", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Nov 02 14:00:35 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Nov 02 14:00:35 EST 2013", "author": "Miranda Devine"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0971\"", "article_summary": "HONOUR TO MEET MAN OF VALEURI HAD the privilege of meeting Australian war hero Mark Donaldson last week.\nOne of the most obscene acts occurred in October, 1945, at the end of the war, after Australian soldiers were released from Japanese prison camps.\nPerth lawyer Hal Colebatch has done the nation a service with his groundbreaking book, Australia's Secret War, telling the untold story of union bastardry during World War 2.\nAustralian soldiers had to draw bayonets to stop the same Adelaide wharfies from stealing food meant for troops overseas.\nWhat the wharfies did to Australian troops - and their nation's war effort - between 1939 and 1945 is nothing short of an abomination."}
