She was subsequently named deputy director and then director of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) now-defunct Office of Health Reform, where she reported directly to Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nLambrew\u2019s current \u201cdeputy assistant to the president\u201d position, while modest-sounding, gives her extensive and centralized power over the White House\u2019s efforts to implement Obamacare.\n\n\u201c[Lambrew] is also unabashedly liberal \u2013 often serving as the architect of her party\u2019s most progressive ideas on healthcare reform,\u201d wrote American Enterprise Institute resident fellow Scott Gottlieb in a March op-ed.\n\n\u201cThe few remaining centrists thinkers inside the White House, mostly scattered across the National Economic Council and Treasury, are gone \u2013 or largely marginalized when it comes to issues around implementation. The people drafting and reviewing the regulations are mostly centered in the White House and its Domestic Policy Council \u2014 and they mostly work for Jeanne Lambrew,\u201d Gottlieb wrote.\n\n\u201cNormally, the Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council would be heavily engaged on the issuance of regulations tied to a major law like Obamacare. Not the Obama White House. The economists still play on the fiscal issues related to Medicare and Medicaid. But when it comes to Obamacare implementation, they are not calling the shots. The power is centered on Lambrew,\u201d Gottlieb wrote.\n\nLambrew exchanged confidential taxpayer information on organizations with IRS official Sarah Hall Ingram and White House health policy advisor Ellen Montz, according to 2012 emails obtained by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and provided to The Daily Caller last week. Ingram attempted to counsel Lambrew and the White House on a lawsuit from religious organizations opposing Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nLambrew also hosted 155 of Ingram\u2019s 165 White House visits, according to White House visitor logs that were recently taken offline during the government shutdown. The IRS improperly targeted conservative groups for harassment of their tax-exempt applications and abusive audits between 2010 and 2012.\n\nLambrew previously served as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-wing Washington think tank headed by former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta.\n\nPodesta credited Lambrew with helping to shape the \u201cfoundation\u201d of the progressive health care reform push beginning in 2005, which was eventually realized under Obama despite attempts to \u201cdemagogue\u201d the issue by conservatives who believe that \u201chealth is a privilege, not a right,\u201d according to Podesta.\n\nLambrew moderated a June 2008 Center for American Progress panel criticizing Obama opponent John McCain\u2019s health policy.\n\nAmong numerous other positions in government and academia, Lambrew worked on health care reform at the Department of Health and Human Services between 1993-94, as First Lady Hillary Clinton led the administration\u2019s disastrous health care reform initiative.\n\nLambrew has contributed money to the presidential campaigns of John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Obama, and to the now defunct George Soros-funded PAC America Coming Together.\n\n\u201cProviding and improving health care for every American may be the current test of our country\u2019s strength of conviction, as was enacting civil rights for all in the 1960s and the creation of the New Deal in the 1930s,\u201d wrote Lambrew, Podesta, and Teresa L. Shaw in 2005.\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "The most powerful official on Obamacare implementation within the White House exchanged confidential taxpayer information with the IRS", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The White House official who exchanged confidential taxpayer information with the IRS is a longtime Obama advisor and progressive activist who is currently the most powerful official on Obamacare impl", "title": "Most powerful White House Obamacare official at center of IRS scandal", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/14/most-powerful-white-house-obamacare-official-at-center-of-irs-scandal/", "image": {"width": 629, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jeanne+Lambrew+Obama+Holds+Press+Conference+fDR5d8i3UM3l.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The White House official who exchanged confidential taxpayer information with the IRS is a longtime Obama advisor and progressive activist who is currently the...", "title": "Most powerful White House Obamacare official at center of IRS scandal Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/14/most-powerful-white-house-obamacare-official-at-center-of-irs-scandal/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jeanne+Lambrew+Obama+Holds+Press+Conference+fDR5d8i3UM3l.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-14 10:01:18", "sailthru.title": "Most powerful White House Obamacare official at center of IRS scandal", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "white-house,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "irs scandal,white house,obama,jeanne lambrew,sarah hall ingram,", "sailthru.description": "The White House official who exchanged confidential taxpayer information with the IRS is a longtime Obama advisor and progressive activist who is currently the most powerful official on Obamacare impl", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jeanne+Lambrew+Obama+Holds+Press+Conference+fDR5d8i3UM3l.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "3908817The White House official who exchanged confidential taxpayer information with the IRS is a longtime Obama advisor and progressive activist who is currently the most powerful official on Obamacare implementation within the White House.\nLambrew also hosted 155 of Ingram\u2019s 165 White House visits, according to White House visitor logs that were recently taken offline during the government shutdown.\nNot the Obama White House.\nIngram attempted to counsel Lambrew and the White House on a lawsuit from religious organizations opposing Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate.\nThe White House did not return a request for comment."}
