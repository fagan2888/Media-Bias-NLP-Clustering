It offers sliding-scale subsidies for private coverage to people with no access to health care on the job and directs low-income people to Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s health program for the poor.\n\nAs a result, California has reduced the number of uninsured by millions.\n\nCovered California estimates about 4 million Californians do not have health insurance, half of whom don\u2019t qualify because they are in the country illegally. Another 1.4 million are eligible for Medi-Cal but haven\u2019t signed up.\n\nLee said the agency will use the upcoming enrollment season to target a remaining pool of about 750,000 Californians eligible for Covered California subsidies.\n\nWhile people who are lower-income have been signing up in high numbers, those who qualify for less subsidy because they make more money have not been signing up as fast. Officials don\u2019t know why they have not been enrolling.\n\n\u201cThey may be signing off the exchange without subsidies and that\u2019s a piece of information we don\u2019t know,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHe said Covered California has done a good job reaching minorities but acknowledges there\u2019s more work to do. For example, Lee said the agency found it was effective at reaching African-Americans through church partnerships.\n\nAlso, a survey commissioned by Covered California found more Californians learned about the exchange through the news than through paid advertising, which Lee said was surprising.\n\nLast season, Covered California fell short of its goal to sign up 1.7 million people for private insurance. Currently, the exchange has 1.3 million active members and the state is expecting to add between 295,000 and 450,000 people during the third enrollment period.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
