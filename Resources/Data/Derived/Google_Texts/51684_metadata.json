As an ongoing shortage of physicians, driven in part by the burden of mandates such as meaningful use and the expense of EHR adoption, begins to put the squeeze on care availability, new trends in physician employment are changing the way healthcare is delivered in the United States.\n\n\u201cUnlike virtually any other type of professional in today\u2019s economy, newly trained doctors are being recruited like blue chip athletes,\u201d said Mark Smith, president of Merritt Hawkins. \u201cThere are simply not enough physicians coming out of training to fill all the available openings.\u201d\n\nThe organization asked more than 1200 medical residents about to graduate into the job market, about recruitment opportunities and their future plans. More than 60 percent of the residents had received more than fifty solicitations from recruiters in the last year of residency, while 46 percent were flooded with more than one hundred job offers.\n\nThe overwhelming number of offers may have something to do with the extraordinarily low percentages of new recruits choosing what have become challenging career paths: solo practice or employment in a rural area. Just two percent of respondents were interested in opening up their own practice, while a mere three percent would consider seeking a position in a community with less than 25,000 people. More than two-thirds of new physicians headed straight for larger medical practices in more urban areas.\n\nThese decisions are contributing to the growing shortage of care in rural areas, which is compounded by an increasing number of elderly patients, more patients becoming eligible for care under the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansions, and the prevalence of chronic diseases. In Colorado, for example, some rural counties would need to increase their physician population by more than 100% to meet basic state benchmarks for the ratio of providers to patients.\n\nBut that might not happen if the urban employment trend continues. \u201cThe days of new doctors hanging out a shingle in an independent solo practice are over,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMost new doctors prefer to be employed and let a hospital or medical group handle the business end of medical practice.\u201d\n\nYet even physicians who secure a place in a hospital or group setting are not entirely happy with their choice. A quarter of residents indicated that if they had the option to start over again, they wouldn\u2019t even choose the medical field at all. Physician dissatisfaction is at an all-time high, driven by everything from an overwhelming number of EHR alerts that interrupt patient care and frustrate technology users to the coming of ICD-10, which is placing a considerable strain on hearts and wallets alike.\n\nEmployed physicians might not have to worry about cooking their own books, but they complain instead about being treated as cogs in a machine, losing autonomy, and being mismanaged by executive staff. A March survey by the former American College of Physician Executives, now the American Association for Physician Leadership, found that many employed physicians gripe at corporate culture clashes, a lack of financial incentives, and disinterest in their opinions from organizational leaders.\n\n\u201cWith declining reimbursement, increasing paperwork, and the uncertainty of health reform, many physicians are under duress today,\u201d added Smith. \u201cIt is not surprising that many newly trained doctors are concerned about what awaits them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employed physicians are becoming the norm as new doctors shy away from private practice and a career in rural healthcare.", "author": "EHRIntelligence", "og": {"url": "https://ehrintelligence.com/news/68-of-new-doctors-prefer-to-be-employed-physicians", "site_name": "EHRIntelligence", "image": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/72991430.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "68% of New Doctors Prefer to be Employed Physicians"}, "twitter": {"description": "Employed physicians are becoming the norm as new doctors shy away from private practice and a career in rural healthcare.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/72991430.jpg"}, "title": "68% of New Doctors Prefer to be Employed Physicians", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd802\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe days of new doctors hanging out a shingle in an independent solo practice are over,\u201d Smith said.\n\u201cWith declining reimbursement, increasing paperwork, and the uncertainty of health reform, many physicians are under duress today,\u201d added Smith.\n\u201cMost new doctors prefer to be employed and let a hospital or medical group handle the business end of medical practice.\u201dYet even physicians who secure a place in a hospital or group setting are not entirely happy with their choice.\nMore than two-thirds of new physicians headed straight for larger medical practices in more urban areas.\n\u201cIt is not surprising that many newly trained doctors are concerned about what awaits them.\u201d"}
