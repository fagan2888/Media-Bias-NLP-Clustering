Bush, Iraq, Michigan, Rick Snyder, TomDispatch.com, News, Politics News\n\nThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatch\n\nSomething is rotten in the state of Michigan.\n\nOne city neglected to inform its residents that its water supply was laced with cancerous chemicals. Another dissolved its public school district and replaced it with a charter school system, only to witness the for-profit management company it hired flee the scene after determining it couldn\u2019t turn a profit. Numerous cities and school districts in the state are now run by single, state-appointed technocrats, as permitted under an emergency financial manager law pushed through by Rick Snyder, Michigan\u2019s austerity-promoting governor. This legislation not only strips residents of their local voting rights, but gives Snyder\u2019s appointee the power to do just about anything, including dissolving the city itself \u2014 all (no matter how disastrous) in the name of \u201cfiscal responsibility.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWho cares?\u201d since what happens in Michigan stays in Michigan, think again. The state\u2019s aggressive balance-the-books style of governance has already spread beyond its borders. In January, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie appointed bankruptcy lawyer and former Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr to be a \u201clegal adviser\u201d to Atlantic City. The Detroit Free Press described the move as \u201ca state takeover similar to Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s state intervention in the Motor City.\u201d\n\nAnd this spring, amid the hullabaloo of Republicans entering the 2016 presidential race, Governor Snyder launched his own national tour to sell \u201cthe Michigan story to the rest of the country.\u201d His trip was funded by a nonprofit (fed, naturally, by undisclosed donations) named \u201cMaking Government Accountable: The Michigan Story.\u201d\n\nTo many Michiganders, this sounded as ridiculous as Jeb Bush launching a super PAC dubbed \u201cMaking Iraq Free: The Bush Family Story.\u201d Except Snyder wasn\u2019t planning to enter the presidential rat race. Instead, he was attempting to mainstream Michigan\u2019s form of austerity politics and its signature emergency management legislation, which stripped more than half of the state\u2019s African American residents of their local voting rights in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAs the governor jaunted around the country, Ann Arbor-based photographer Eduardo Garc\u00eda and I decided to set out on what we thought of as our own two-week Magical Michigan Tour. And while we weren\u2019t driving a specially outfitted psychedelic tour bus \u2014 we spent most of the trip in my grandmother\u2019s 2005 Prius \u2014 our journey was nevertheless remarkably surreal. From the southwest banks of Lake Michigan to the eastern tips of the peninsula, we crisscrossed the state visiting more than half a dozen cities to see if there was another side to the governor\u2019s story and whether Michigan really was, as one Detroit resident put it, \u201ca massive experiment in unraveling U.S. democracy.\u201d\n\nStop One: Water Wars in Flint\n\nJust as we arrive, the march spills off the sidewalk in front of the city council building.\n\n\u201cStop poisoning our children!\u201d chants a little girl as the crowd tumbles down South Saginaw Street, the city\u2019s main drag. We\u2019re in Flint, Michigan, a place that hit the headlines last year for its brown, chemical-laced, possibly toxic water. A wispy white-haired woman waves a gallon jug filled with pee-colored liquid from her home tap. \u201cThey don\u2019t care that they\u2019re killing us!\u201d she cries.\n\nWe catch up with Claire McClinton, the formidable if grandmotherly organizer of the Flint Democracy Defense League, as we approach the roiling Flint River. It\u2019s been a longtime dumping ground for the riverfront factories of General Motors and, as of one year ago today, the only source of the city\u2019s drinking water. On April 25, 2014, on the instruction of the city\u2019s emergency manager, Flint stopped buying its supplies from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and started drawing water directly from the river, which meant a budgetary savings of $12 million a year. The downside: people started getting sick.\n\nSince then, tests have detectedE. coli and fecal bacteria in the water, as well as high levels of trihalomethanes, a carcinogenic chemical cocktail known as THMs. For months, the city concealed the presence of THMs, which over years can lead to increased rates of cancer, kidney failure, and birth defects. Still, it was obvious to local residents that something was up. Some of them were breaking out in mysterious rashes or experiencing bouts of severe diarrhea, while others watched as their eyelashes and hair began to fall out.\n\nAs we cross a small footbridge, McClinton recounts how the city council recently voted to \u201cdo all things necessary\u201d to get Detroit\u2019s water back. The emergency manager, however, immediately overrode their decision, terming it \u201cincomprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a whole different model of control,\u201d she comments drily and explains that she\u2019s now working with other residents to file an injunction compelling the city to return to the use of Detroit\u2019s water. One problem, though: it has to be filed in Ingham County, home to Lansing, the state capital, rather than in Flint\u2019s Genesee County, because the decision of a state-appointed emergency manager is being challenged. \u201cUnder state rule, that\u2019s where you go to redress grievances,\u201d she says. \u201cJust another undermining of our local authority.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, many city residents remain frustrated and confused. A few weeks before the march, the city sent out two notices on the same day, packaged in the same envelope. One, printed in black-and-white, stated bluntly: \u201cOur water system recently violated a drinking water standard.\u201d The second, in flashy color, had this cheery message: \u201cWe are pleased to report that City of Flint water is safe and meets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines\u2026 You can be confident that the water provided to you today meets all safety standards.\u201d As one recipient of the notices commented, \u201cI can only surmise that the point was to confuse us all.\u201d\n\nMcClinton marches in silence for a few minutes as the crowd doubles back across the bridge and begins the ascent up Saginaw Street. Suddenly, a man jumps onto a life-size statue of a runner at the Riverfront Plaza and begins to cloak him in one of the group\u2019s T-shirts.\n\n\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t want you getting in any trouble!\u201d his wife calls out to him.\n\nHe\u2019s struggling to pull a sleeve over one of the cast-iron arms when the droning weeoo-weeooo-weeoo of a police siren blares, causing a brief frenzy until the man\u2019s son realizes he\u2019s mistakenly hit the siren feature on the megaphone he\u2019s carrying.\n\nAfter a few more tense moments, the crowd surges forward, leaving behind the statue, legs stretched in mid-stride, arms raised triumphantly, and on his chest a new cotton T-shirt with the slogan: \u201cWater You Fighting For?\u201d\n\nStop Two: The Tri-Cities of Cancer\n\nThe next afternoon, we barrel down Interstate 75 into an industrial hellscape of smoke stacks, flare offs, and 18-wheelers, en route to another toxicity and accountability crisis. This one was caused by a massive tar sands refinery and dozens of other industrial polluters in southwest Detroit and neighboring River Rouge and Ecorse, cities which lie along the banks of the Detroit River.\n\nAlready with a slight headache from a haze of emissions, we meet photographer and community leader Emma Lockridge and her neighbor Anthony Parker in front of their homes, which sit right in the backyard of that tar sands refinery.\n\nIn 2006, the toxicity levels in their neighborhood, known simply by its zip code as \u201c48217,\u201d were 45 times higher than the state average. And that was before Detroit gave $175 million in tax breaks to the billion-dollar Marathon Petroleum Corporation to help it expand its refinery complex to process a surge of high-sulfur tar sands from Alberta, Canada.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a donor zip,\u201d explains Lockridge as she settles into the driver\u2019s seat of our car. \u201cWe have all the industry and a tax base, but we get nothing back.\u201d\n\nWe set off on a whirlwind tour of their neighborhood, where schools have been torn down and parks closed due to the toxicity of the soil, while so many residents have died of cancer that it\u2019s hard for their neighbors to keep track. \u201cWe used to play on the swings here,\u201d says Lockridge, pointing to a rusted yellow swing set in a fenced-off lot where the soil has tested for high levels of lead, arsenic, and other poisonous chemicals. \u201cJumping right into the lead.\u201d\n\nAs in other regions of Michigan, people have been fleeing 48217 in droves. Here, however, the depopulation results not from deindustrialization, but from toxicity, thanks to an ever-expanding set of factories. These include a wastewater treatment complex, salt mines, asphalt factories, cement plants, a lime and stone foundry, and a handful of steel mills all clustered in the tri-cities region.\n\nAs Lockridge and Parker explain, they have demanded that Marathon buy their homes. They have also implored the state to cap emission levels and have filed lawsuits against particularly toxic factories. In response, all they\u2019ve seen are more factories given more breaks, while the residents of 48217 get none. Last spring, for example, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality permitted the AK Steel plant, located close to the neighborhood, to increase its toxic emissions as much as 725 times. The approval, according to the Detroit Free Press, came after \u201cGov. Rick Snyder\u2019s business-promoting agency worked for months behind the scenes\u201d lobbying the Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n\u201cLook at this cute little tree out of nowhere over here!\u201d Lockridge exclaims, slowing the car in front of a scrawny plant whose branches, in the midst of this industrial wasteland, bend under the weight of white blossoms.\n\n\u201cThat tree ain\u2019t gonna grow up,\u201d Parker responds. \u201cIt\u2019s dead already.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trying,\u201d Lockridge insists. \u201cAww, it\u2019s kind of sad. It\u2019s a Charlie Brown tree.\u201d\n\nThe absurdity of life in such an environment is highlighted when we reach a half-mile stretch of sidewalk sandwiched between a massive steel mill and a coal-fired power plant that has been designated a \u201cWellness Walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnergize your Life!\u201d implores the sign affixed to a chain-link fence surrounding the power plant. It\u2019s an unlikely site for an exercise walk, given that the state\u2019s health officials considerthis strip and the nearby park \u201cthe epicenter of the state\u2019s asthma burden.\u201d\n\nAfter a sad laugh, we head for Zug Island, a Homeland Security-patrolled area populated by what look to be giant black vacuum cleaners but are actually blast furnaces. The island was named for millionaire Samuel Zug, who built a lavish mansion there only to discover that it was sinking into swampland. It is now home to U.S. Steel, the largest steel manufacturer in the nation.\n\nOn our way back, we make a final stop at Oakwood Heights, an almost entirely vacant and partially razed subdivision located on the other side of the Marathon plant. \u201cThis is the white area that was bought out,\u201d says Lockridge. The scene is eerie: small residential streets lined by grassy fields and the occasional empty house. That Marathon paid residents to evacuate their homes in this predominantly white section of town, while refusing to do the same in the predominantly African American 48217, which sits closer to the refinery, strikes neither Lockridge and Parker nor their neighbors as a coincidence.\n\nWe survey the remnants of the former neighborhood: bundles of ragged newspapers someone was once supposed to deliver, a stuffed teddy bear abandoned on a wooden porch, and a childless triangle-shaped playground whose construction, a sign reads, was \u201cmade possible by generous donations from Marathon.\u201d\n\nAs this particularly unmagical stop on our Michigan tour comes to an end, Parker says quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my family out of here.\u201d\n\nLockridge agrees. \u201cI just wish we had a refuge place we could go to while we\u2019re fighting,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see we\u2019re surrounded.\u201d\n\nStop Three: The Great White North\n\nNot all of Michigan\u2019s problems are caused by emergency management, but this sweeping new power does lie at the heart of many local controversies. Later that night we meet with retired Detroit city worker, journalist, and organizer Russ Bellant who has made himself something of an expert on the subject.\n\nIn 2011, he explains, Governor Snyder signed an emergency manager law known as Public Act 4. The impact of this law and its predecessor, Public Act 72, was dramatic. In the city of Pontiac, for instance, the number of public employees plummeted from 600 to 50. In Detroit, the emergency manager of the school district waged a six-year slash-and-burn campaign that, in the end, shuttered 95 schools. In Benton Harbor, the manager effectively dissolved the city government, declaring: \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the city manager is now gone. I am the city manager. I replace the financial director, so I\u2019m the financial director and the city manager. I am the mayor and the commission. And I don\u2019t need them.\u201d\n\nSo in 2012, Bellant cancelled all his commitments in Detroit, packed his car full of chocolate pudding snacks, canned juices, and fliers and headed north to support a statewide campaign to repeal the law through a ballot referendum in that fall\u2019s general election. For two months, he crisscrossed the upper reaches of Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula, the part of the state that people say looks like a hand, as well as the remote Upper Peninsula that borders Wisconsin and Canada.\n\n\u201cSeven or eight hours a day, I would just knock on doors,\u201d he says.\n\nIn November, the efforts paid off and voters repealed the act, but the celebration was short-lived. Less than two months later, during a lame-duck session of the state legislature, Governor Snyder pushed through and signed Public Act 436, a broader version of the legislation that was referendum-proof. Since then, financial managers have continued to shut down fire departments, outsource police departments, sell off parking meters and public parks. In Flint, the manager even auctioned off the plastic Santa Claus that once adorned city hall, setting the initial bidding price at $5.\n\nAnd here\u2019s one fact of life in Michigan: emergency management is normally only imposed on majority-black cities. From 2013 to 2014, 52% of the African American residents in the state lived under emergency management, compared to only 2% of white residents. And yet the repeal vote against the previous version of the act was a demographic landslide: 75 out of 83 counties voted to nix the legislation, including all of Michigan\u2019s northern, overwhelmingly white, rural counties. \u201cI think people just internalized that P.A. 4 was undemocratic,\u201d Bellant says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
