In addition, the offering's underwriters will have the opportunity to purchase up to 302,602 shares of common stock. Ultragenyx won't receive any proceeds from its selling stockholders, but based on its current price would net roughly $54 million in gross proceeds from the sale of its 1.3 million shares. Ultragenyx plans to use the proceeds to advance its existing clinical and preclinical pipeline, as well as investing heavily in early stage research.\n\nNow what: This is the downside to investing in wholly clinical-stage companies: any sizable rally in share price can result in management capitalizing on padding their cash balance by offering common stock for sale. This offering is only going to increase Ultragenyx's outstanding share count by a little more than 4%, so today's reaction lower may be a bit overdone. However, as I pointed out last week, Ultragenyx's pipeline is comprised of a handful of early stage candidates, and placing a $1.25 billion valuation on a pipeline this wet behind the ears probably isn't prudent, no matter how attractive orphan-disease drugmakers might appear. This is a biopharmaceutical company I'd suggest you monitor from a safe distance.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:04", "description": "Ultragenyx shares aren't looking so", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "Ultragenyx shares aren't looking so \"ultra\" today after the company announced its intention to sell shares of common stock.
