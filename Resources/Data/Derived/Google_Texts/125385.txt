Media around the world are reporting about a Florida teenager who underwent a penis reduction surgery because it was “too large for intercourse” and interfered with playing football, according to the study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.

University of South Florida urologist Dr. Rafael Carrion successfully conducted the first “reduction corporoplasty technique,” the study reports.

The procedure starts with an incision at the scar left from circumcision, then the penis skin is peeled back and tissue is cut from either side of the penis, avoiding the urethra and the nerves that provide normal sensation, according to the journal article.

The teen’s flaccid penis was seven inches long with a 10-inch circumference and shaped like a football due to abnormally-shaped blood cells that blocked vessel, the study reports.
