The line of storms prompted tornado warnings and watches as far north as Illinois Sunday night, and the weather system was expected to linger over a large swath of the region Monday, putting a damper on some Memorial Day plans.\n\nAmong the worst-affected communities were Wimberley and San Marcos, which are in Central Texas along the Blanco River in the increasingly popular corridor between Austin and San Antonio.\n\n\u201cIt looks pretty bad out there,\u201d Hays County emergency management coordinator Kharley Smith said of Wimberley, where an estimated 350 to 400 homes were destroyed and where three people remained missing late Sunday. \u201cWe do have whole streets with maybe one or two houses left on them and the rest are just slabs.\u201d\n\nKristi Wyatt, a spokeswoman for San Marcos, said about 1,000 homes were damaged throughout Hays County, which includes Wimberley and which will be toured Monday by Gov. Greg Abbott. Five San Marcos police cars were washed away and the fire house was flooded. The city imposed a 9 p.m. Sunday curfew that would remain in place overnight.\n\nRivers swelled so quickly that whole communities awoke Sunday surrounded by water. The Blanco crested above 40 feet \u2014 more than triple its flood stage of 13 feet \u2014 swamping Interstate 35 and forcing parts of the busy north-south highway to close. Rescuers used pontoon boats and a helicopter to pull people out.\n\nAfter a surge of mud and water flooded their cottage in Wimberley, John and Valerie Nelson fled through waist-deep waters in darkness early Sunday with transformers sparking and trees crashing around them. The single-story house, which had been Valerie Nelson\u2019s grandmother\u2019s, had been carefully rebuilt on stilts so that it would be able to withstand even the worst flooding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely dumbfounded,\u201d said Valerie Nelson, who has owned the property for about 50 years. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the water would ever get that high.\u201d\n\nHundreds of trees along the Blanco were uprooted or snapped, and they collected in piles of debris that soared 20 feet high.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Deadly storms swamp Plains, Midwest, force Texans from homes", "title": "Deadly storms swamp Plains, Midwest, force Texans from homes", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Deadly storms swamp Plains, Midwest, force Texans from homes", "title": "Deadly storms swamp Plains, Midwest, force Texans from homes", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/deadly_storms_swamp_plains_midwest_force_texans_from_homes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/severe-weather.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deadly storms swamp Plains, Midwest, force Texans from homes", "title": "Deadly storms swamp Plains, Midwest, force Texans from homes", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/severe-weather.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Seth Robbins", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Five San Marcos police cars were washed away and the fire house was flooded.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSAN MARCOS, Texas (AP) \u2014 A line of storms stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes dumped record rainfall on parts of the Plains and Midwest, spawning tornadoes and causing major flooding that forced at least 2,000 Texans from their homes.\nAmong the worst-affected communities were Wimberley and San Marcos, which are in Central Texas along the Blanco River in the increasingly popular corridor between Austin and San Antonio.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely dumbfounded,\u201d said Valerie Nelson, who has owned the property for about 50 years.\nAfter a surge of mud and water flooded their cottage in Wimberley, John and Valerie Nelson fled through waist-deep waters in darkness early Sunday with transformers sparking and trees crashing around them."}
