Mary Fallin formed a task force to find better ways to recycle or reuse the water.\n\n\u201cYou can take the worst water imaginable and turn it into water you\u2019d put in your baby\u2019s bottle, the issue is the cost involved in getting that done,\u201d said J.D. Strong with the OK Water Resources Board. Strong chairs the governor\u2019s group.\n\nBut Logic Energy Solutions maintains their unique approach is affordable, hyper-efficient, and unlike injection wells, would have no link to the next quake.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to talk with energy producers about an alternative,\u201d Hill said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The controversy surrounding waste water injection wells and earthquakes has grown with each big rattle.", "author": "Karl Torp", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30949296/okc-company-says-it-can-provide-alternative-to-injection-wells", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9635853_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The controversy surrounding waste water injection wells and earthquakes has grown with each big rattle.", "title": "OKC Company Says It Can Provide Alternative To Injection Wells"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9635853_G.jpg", "description": "The controversy surrounding waste water injection wells and earthquakes has grown with each big rattle.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Company Says It Can Provide Alternative To Injection Wells"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-company-says-it-can-provide-alternative-to-injection-wells", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/12", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv, Oklahoma Earthquakes, injection wells, waste water", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv, Oklahoma Earthquakes, injection wells, waste water"}, "article_summary": "The controversy surrounding waste water injection wells and earthquakes has grown with each big rattle.\nBut Logic Energy Solutions maintains their unique approach is affordable, hyper-efficient, and unlike injection wells, would have no link to the next quake.\nAfter more than five years of research and development, Logic Energy Solutions said its technology is ready for the field.\nLogic Energy Solutions, headquartered in Oklahoma City, does not try to treat or desalinate water created when oil and gas are taken from earth.\n\u201cWhat we do is we light a flame under the water,\u201d said Logic Energy Solutions president David Hill."}
