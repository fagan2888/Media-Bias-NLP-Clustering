A CNN spokesperson, who asked not to be named, said Tapper was improperly listed as a speaker on the foundation website; he is scheduled to interview former president Clinton at the event and later moderate a panel discussion. The spokesperson said the network-approved interview will be televised. There will be no restrictions on the questions, and Tapper will not be paid by the foundation. Other details are still being negotiated.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder why Tapper\u2019s name was removed from the website. Just last week, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos got in trouble for failing to disclose donations to the Clinton Foundation totaling $75,000. Stephanopoulos used to be a top aide for Bill Clinton when he was in the White House, and many decried the failure to disclose the donations as an ethical breach.\n\nStephanopoulos has since withdrawn from a moderating position at Republican presidential primary debates. CNN is reportedly scheduled to host three three Republican prsidential primary debates.\n\nTapper\u2019s past reveals a liberal-leaning bias, with a stint writing at the liberal news site Salon between 2000 and 2003 and also a previous job as a spokesperson for a Democratic congresswoman who would later become Chelsea Clinton\u2019s mother-in-law.\n\nHowever, Tapper has has been revered for his ability to steer clear of partisan politics, and rarely, if ever, has had an issue of projecting bias.\n\nAs USA Today reports, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who is scheduled to moderate one of CNN\u2019s Republican debates, said that Tapper is \u201cthe equal of any journalist at work today when it comes to fairness, intellect, integrity and seriousness. I\u2019d be honored to work with him anytime, anywhere.\u201d\n\nLead image via @tvnewser.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Sun-Times National", "description": "CNN anchor Jake Tapper's name pulled a Houdini late Tuesday afternoon, disappearing from the Clinton Foundation's website without a trace.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aggrego.SunTimes.National", "locale": "en_US", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@News_STN"}, "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Times National", "description": "CNN anchor Jake Tapper's name pulled a Houdini late Tuesday afternoon, disappearing from the Clinton Foundation's website without a trace.", "title": "Jake Tapper's name wiped from Clinton Foundation website", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-20-at-5.05.17-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-21T09:12:57+00:00", "url": "http://national.suntimes.com/national-world-news/national-politics/7/72/1155008/jake-tapper-clinton-foundation-website/", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "gmt_offset": "-5", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=930568317", "article": {"section": "National Politics", "tag": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-05-20T16:17:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T09:12:57+00:00"}, "home_url": "http://national.suntimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca83e\"", "article_summary": "USA Today said that when it asked CNN about why Tapper\u2019s name was on the website, the Clinton Foundation \u201cswiftly removed\u201d it.\nJust last week, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos got in trouble for failing to disclose donations to the Clinton Foundation totaling $75,000.\nWritten By Scott Sutton Posted: 05/20/2015, 04:17pmCNN anchor Jake Tapper\u2019s name pulled a Houdini late Tuesday afternoon, disappearing from the Clinton Foundation\u2019s website without a trace.\nAs USA Today reports, Tapper\u2019s name was listed on the website until late Tuesday afternoon as a \u201cspeaker\u201d for a Clinton Global Initiative event in Denver from June 8-10.\nA CNN spokesperson, who asked not to be named, said Tapper was improperly listed as a speaker on the foundation website; he is scheduled to interview former president Clinton at the event and later moderate a panel discussion."}
