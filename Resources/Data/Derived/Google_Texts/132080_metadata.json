It glanced off a tree and hit the officer in the hand.\n\nThe officer fired, striking the suspect. The officer suffered a slight hand injury.\n\nThe suspect was taken to the hospital in critical condition and later died.\n\nA resident in the area said a man came by and took bricks from his wall. The resident said he later heard gunshots coming from the Cactus Park Precinct.\n\n\"I think when you look at the damage to both the patrol car and the glass at the precinct, you'll see that this man was intent on doing some harm this morning,\" Sgt.
