Jo, CC BY 2.0\n\nNot even our food is safe from gender stereotypes, says a new study published in Social Psychology.\n\nThis is already pretty obvious, suggests Time; more often than not TV commercials will depict women as the ones who want healthier foods, like yogurt and salad \u2014 not men. Lead study author Luke Zhu explained to Time that this idea women tend to eat more healthfully than men is a cultural stereotype. So these commercials are simply relaying \u201cwhat society thinks women should do,\u201d Zhu added.\n\nBut what sets this study apart is that not only does it find that gender is a factor in food packaging, but these stereotypes can also affect how men and women taste the food, too. To arrive at this conclusion, Zhu and his team conducted three experiments, the first of which they asked 93 adults to select the foods they thought were more \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine.\" The list of foods included the baked and fried version of potatoes (fries and chips), chicken, and fish.\n\nThe results revealed that yes, there is \u201ca significant tie to food and gender perception:\u201d Participants were more likely to perceive healthier foods as more feminine and unhealthier foods, like fried chicken and regular chips, as more masculine. This could explain why major sporting events, which society thinks are more for men, show more ads for junk food.\n\nIn the second experiment, researchers packaged an Entemann\u2019s mini blueberry muffin in masculine, feminine, and gender neutral ways. The masculine packaging had the word \u201cmega\u201d and football players on it; the feminine packaging had the word \u201chealthy\u201d and a ballerina; while the gender neutral packaging had nothing at all written or featured.\n\nDespite the fact that each package contained the same exact muffin, participants reported their respective gender packaging was \u201cmore attractive\u201d and tasted better than the muffin inside the gender-neutral packaging. Participants were also more likely to buy the masculine and feminine foods. But when researchers only explicitly offered gendered packaging in the third experiment \u2014 \u201cThe muffin for real men\u201d \u2014 this effect wasn\u2019t as significant.\n\n\u201cWith packaging, we expect healthy eating to be associated with femininity,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cBut what if healthy food is packaged in masculine packaging? That\u2019s an expectation violation.\u201d This is not unlike how organic food is packaged versus junk food, he added; organic health foods are literally greener, featuring plants and recycling symbols, while junk food is typically found in more \u201cbold, crinkly packaging.\u201d\n\nZhu concluded: \u201cFor marketers, there\u2019s a pretty clear implication that you want to frame the product consistently with the cultural, primed gender stereotype.\"\n\nSource: Zhu L, Brescoll VL, Newman GE, and Uhlmann EL.
