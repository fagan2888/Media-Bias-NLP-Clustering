She joined the UFC in 2013, but didn\u2019t ascend to international superstardom until recently, in part thanks to roles in \u201cThe Expendables 3,\u201d \u201cEntourage\u201d and \u201cFurious 7.\u201d When she finally did become a crossover hit, it was massive. Not many MMA fighters receive coverage in The New Yorker and The New York Times, nor do they get shoutouts from celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, Chris Pratt, Shaq and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. And the people of Brazil don\u2019t start crying upon the sight of other celebrities and sports stars like they did with Rousey.\n\nWhile Rousey is all people say she is (and more) athletically, outside of martial feats, her role model status is questionable. First, Rousey has a history of highly transphobic remarks and flat-out ignorance when it comes to trans athletes. In 2013, when UFC fighter Matt Mitrione made offensive comments about transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox, calling her a \u201clying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak,\u201d the New York Post asked Rousey for her thoughts on Mitrione\u2019s words. Rousey said he expressed himself \u201cextremely poorly\u201d and that she could \u201cunderstand the UFC doesn\u2019t want to be associated with views like that.\u201d But in that same interview, Rousey didn\u2019t exactly demonstrate a predilection for sensitivity. \u201cShe can try hormones, chop her pecker off, but it\u2019s still the same bone structure a man has,\u201d Rousey said about Fox. \u201cWhat if she became UFC champion and we had a transgender women\u2019s champion? It\u2019s a very socially difficult situation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only a \u201csocially difficult\u201d situation thanks to people like Rousey. Earlier this year, Rousey tried softening her words \u2014 though not changing her opinion \u2014 in an interview with the Huffington Post. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve read, it seems if like you\u2019ve already gone through puberty as a man, even if you really want to rid yourself of those physical advantages, I just don\u2019t think science is there yet.\u201d\n\nRousey studied the wrong \u201cscience,\u201d because claims of supposed transgender superiority in athletics are categorically false and have zero scientific backing.\n\nBut her insensitive musings go beyond transmisogyny and transphobia. This summer, Rousey decried what she called a \u201cdo-nothing bitch\u201d:\n\n\u201cI have this one term for the kind of woman that my mother raised me to not be and I call it a \u2018do-nothing bitch.\u2019 The kind of chick that just, like, tries to be pretty and be taken care of by somebody else. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s hilarious, like, that people like say that my body looks masculine or something like that. I\u2019m just like, listen, just because my body was developed for a purpose other than fucking millionaires doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s masculine. I think it\u2019s femininely badass as fuck. Because there\u2019s not a single muscle on my body that isn\u2019t for a purpose. Because I\u2019m not a do-nothing bitch.\u201d\n\nBeing proud of your body is great. Burying other women because they have a different body than yours is not. As Alanna Vagianos noted in the Huffington Post, Rousey\u2019s DNB speech is \u201ccertainly not empowering, and it certainly does nothing to combat the large issues that create a society where athletic bodies like Rousey\u2019s are judged as less than.\u201d\n\nDespite tone deaf and responsive commentary, Rousey became the darling of the Internet media after the ESPYs. She won the \u201cBest Fighter of the Year\u201d award and called out Floyd Mayweather for his history of domestic violence.\n\n\u201cI wonder how Floyd feels being beat by a woman for once,\u201d she said. Rousey didn\u2019t quit her verbal blitz, claiming she made more money per second than Mayweather. The feud spawned billions of \u201cwho wins in a fight between Ronda Rousey and Floyd Mayweather???\u201d clickbait takes. Domestic violence is abhorrent. Yet Rousey is currently dating UFC fighter Travis Browne \u2014 a man accused of domestic abuse in his previous relationship. In August, his wife Jenna Renee Webb said she\u2019d be pressing charges against Browne. Though a third-party investigation done at the behest of the UFC found \u201cinconclusive evidence\u201d of these claims.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The UFC champ is everyone's favorite new badass, now that her history of transphobia and violence are being ignored", "title": "Since when is Ronda Rousey a role model?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The UFC champ is everyone's favorite new badass, now that her history of transphobia and violence are being ignored", "title": "Since when is Ronda Rousey a role model?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/since_when_is_ronda_rousey_a_role_model/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ronda_rousey2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The UFC champ is everyone's favorite new badass, now that her history of transphobia and violence are being ignored", "title": "Since when is Ronda Rousey a role model?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ronda_rousey2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matt Saccaro", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Feminism, mma, Ronda Rousey, Transphobia, UFC", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Feminism, mma, Ronda Rousey, Transphobia, UFC, Entertainment News\u201cRowdy\u201d Ronda Rousey is an incredible fighter, an Olympian, a movie star, maybe even a burgeoning fashonista and \u2014 if you go by countless Internet headlines about the UFC women\u2019s bantamweight champion \u2014 an icon and a role model.\nThe feud spawned billions of \u201cwho wins in a fight between Ronda Rousey and Floyd Mayweather??\nWhile Rousey is all people say she is (and more) athletically, outside of martial feats, her role model status is questionable.\nYet Rousey is currently dating UFC fighter Travis Browne \u2014 a man accused of domestic abuse in his previous relationship.\nAnd the people of Brazil don\u2019t start crying upon the sight of other celebrities and sports stars like they did with Rousey."}
