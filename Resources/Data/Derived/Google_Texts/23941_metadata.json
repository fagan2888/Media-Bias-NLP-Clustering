On Monday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich threw away any hopes of ever being on a Republican national ticket and used This One Weird Governor Trick to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, in defiance of the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature. In response, six members of the legislature and two anti-abortion groups have sued to prevent the expansion, because tyranny, zygotes, and slut pills.\n\nBy going around the full legislature and sending the proposal to the Controlling Board, the suit argues, Kasich acted beyond his authority:\n\n\u201cThe Ohio Controlling Board\u2019s expansion of Medicaid violates the clear limits on its own authority, and accordingly, also violates the clear limits of the Ohio Constitution,\u201d the court filing states.\n\nAnd what does that have to do with \u201cpro-life\u201d groups? They have a very clear reason:\n\nCleveland Right to Life and Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati Inc. joined them because they oppose the use of federal funding for expansion and wanted the chance to debate the issue with the Legislature, according to the filing.\n\nThat seems pretty directly related to their core mission of stopping abortion, and it\u2019s certainly a compelling reason to keep 300,000 people from getting access to healthcare. After all, they\u2019re all certain that Obamacare magically repealed the Hyde Amendment and that the day-after pill does abortions (neither of which is true\u2026do we still need to say that? Of course we do), so Medicaid expansion will undoubtedly Holocaust all the babbies.\n\nIn any case, even if Kasich\u2019s maneuver survives court challenges, it will only expand Medicaid through 2015, which is when the federal government will begin requiring states to begin chipping in for a portion of the expansion \u2014 after that, it\u2019s up to the state to approve any continuation. Then again, if Ohio Republicans continue to make denying medical care to people their central reason for being, maybe they won\u2019t control the Legislature by then\u2026 yes, sorry, that was more wishful thinking on our part, now wasn\u2019t it?\n\n[TimesUnion.com via ThinkProgress]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Well, that escalated quickly.
