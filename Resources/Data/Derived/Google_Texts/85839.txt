More than 60 bikers with toys strapped to their motorcycles met at the Pueblo West VFW post in windy and chilly conditions Saturday for the Gary Rimpley Memorial Toy and Poker Run.

Veterans from around Southern Colorado met at the post for the run, which benefits kids in Penrose and Pueblo West.

The District II Warriors, a program under the national VFW, hosted the event. John Sterling, president of the district, said the toy run was created after founding member Gary Rimpley died in a car accident in June near Florence.

"He was really big into doing things for kids," Sterling said.

The group determined that at least 70 toys would be needed after receiving a list of families with kids in need from school counselors in the two communities.

Any extra toys collected are going to Toys for Tots, a program sponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Boxes for toys to be given to Toys for Tots were also placed at each stop on the bikers' route.

From VFW Post 5812 in Pueblo West, bikers rode to Tumbleweeds in Pueblo West and then to the Hamlet in Florence. After making another stop at McClures in Ca√±on City, the group ended at VFW Post 2788 in Penrose.

The large number of people who showed up to ride in Pueblo West wasn't a surprise to Sterling or VFW Warriors Founding President Terry Mullins.

"When we do stuff, we always have a good turnout. We take care of each other. Bottom line," Mullins said.

Even with the notorious Pueblo West wind and just-above-freezing temperatures, Sterling was confident the goal would be met.

"There's just something about bikers and kids," Sterling said.
