Jindal said as commander in chief, he would bring in very conservative, anti-abortion judges "consistent with [his] values" instead of judges like Roberts, who are susceptible to evolving views.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal criticized Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Sen. Rick Santorum during the GOP primary debate Wednesday night for supporting the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted twice to uphold Obamacare.

Santorum then took a shot at Jindal.

"He made a bad decision, a couple bad decisions on Obamacare, but he made a lot of great decisions too. I don't regret at all standing up for John Roberts. It's easy to sit out in Louisiana and say, 'Well, I'd be tougher'... I fought when I was in the United States Senate, we fought for the first time to defeat justices and judges that [President] Bill Clinton nominated, and I fought with President Bush to defend his nominees."

Graham defended his vote to confirm Roberts, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush.

"He's one of the most qualified men to ever come before the United States Senate, and I don't agree with his decision, but 99 times out of 100 I will," Graham said.

Graham said it's extremely important for Republicans to win the presidency in 2016 because "the court's at stake."

"To the Republicans, the biggest prize on the table in 2017 is the presidency," he said. "And if it's Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, they're gonna pick people that we disagree with all the time."
