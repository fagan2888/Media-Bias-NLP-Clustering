But many analysts think traders could be disappointed after the meeting.\n\n\"I think the market is really looking ahead to Doha,\" said Michael Tran, director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.\n\n\"An agreement to freeze production does little to change physical balances, but constructive rhetoric could serve as a sentiment changer at a minimum, helping to legitimize the current rally and have the market hold the $40 a barrel level as the new psychological floor.\"\n\nwere up 17 cents at $44.35 a barrel by 10:52 a.m. EST. U.S. crude was up 8 cents at $41.84. Oil found support after U.S. economic data pushed the dollar to session lows. A weaker dollar is a plus for oil, making it more affordable to holders of other currencies. [FRX/] In the previous session, oil fell after Russian oil minister Alexander Novak told a closed-door briefing of energy analysts in Moscow that a deal in Doha would be loosely framed with few detailed commitments. \"The agreement will not be very rigidly formulated, it is more of a gentlemen's agreement,\" one of those present said, paraphrasing Novak's words at the briefing. \"There is no plan to sign binding documents,\" another person at the briefing said.
