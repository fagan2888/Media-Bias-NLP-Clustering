The brief but revelatory marriage equality debate was spurred by a previous conversation centered on the hypocrisy of Republicans' obsession with Ronald Reagan. \"Reagan raised taxes,\" Colbert revealed to Cruz. \"Reagan actually had an amnesty program for illegal immigrants. Neither of those things would allow Reagan to be elected today. So to what level can you truly emulate Ronald Reagan?\" Though Cruz ultimately agreed that modern Republicans couldn't possibly agree with Reagan on those issues, he did manage to score some mild applause of his own near the end of his visit. \"If you want to win an issue, go to the ballot box and win at the ballot box,\" Cruz told Colbert and his audience. \"That's the way the Constitution was designed.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/Screen_Shot_2015-09-22_at_5_opt_ekwohp.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Trace Cowen", "description": "Ted Cruz, the guy who once said he stopped listening to the devil's rock music after 9/11, didn't quite win over the 'Late Show' audience.", "og": {"site_name": "Complex", "description": "Ted Cruz, the guy who once said he stopped listening to the devil's rock music after 9/11, didn't quite win over the 'Late Show' audience.", "title": "Ted Cruz Gets Booed During Marriage Equality Debate With Stephen Colbert on 'Late Show'", "url": "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/09/stephen-colbert-grills-republican-ted-cruz-on-late-show-with-colbert", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-09-22_at_5_opt_ekwohp.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz, the guy who once said he stopped listening to the devil's rock music after 9/11, didn't quite win over the 'Late Show' audience.", "title": "Ted Cruz Gets Booed During Marriage Equality Debate With Stephen Colbert on 'Late Show'", "url": "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/09/stephen-colbert-grills-republican-ted-cruz-on-late-show-with-colbert", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-09-22_at_5_opt_ekwohp.png", "site": {"id": 13049362}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-22T08:36:49-0400", "p": {"domain_verify": "51da1c238ae41f7163c35ac3e762917b"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685812641524750}, "sailthru.content.type": "News", "sailthru.tags": "Elections, Gay Rights, Late Night, News, Politicians, Republicans, Religion, Same Sex Marriage, Stephen Colbert, Videos, Video Still, Ted Cruz, The Late Show, Complex, Pop Culture, complex", "keywords": "Elections, Gay Rights, Late Night, News, Politicians, Republicans, Religion, Same Sex Marriage, Stephen Colbert, Videos, Video Still, Ted Cruz, The Late Show, Complex, Complex Magazine, Style Guide, Fashion News, Celebrity Profiles, Sneakers, Sneakers Guide, Sneakers Blog", "sailthru.channel": "Pop Culture", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-09-22_at_5_opt_ekwohp.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4ba\"", "article_summary": "\"In 9/11, I didn\u2019t like how rock music responded,\" Cruz said earlier this year.\n\"It doesn't mention marriage in the Constitution,\" Colbert responded, before Cruz eventually landed himself a nice round of boos.\nThe brief but revelatory marriage equality debate was spurred by a previous conversation centered on the hypocrisy of Republicans' obsession with Ronald Reagan.\nSo to what level can you truly emulate Ronald Reagan?\"\n\"If you want to win an issue, go to the ballot box and win at the ballot box,\" Cruz told Colbert and his audience."}
