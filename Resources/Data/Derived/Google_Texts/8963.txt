Whatever Peyton Manning decides about his future, he must decide by March 9.

The NFL’s all-time leader with 530 touchdown passes, Manning finished his third season with the Broncos, 17th in the league, by saying he needed more time to consider whether to return for another year.

Broncos general manager John Elway and chief executive officer Joe Ellis have emphatically stated they want Manning back but are willing to give him time to think it through.

There is a hard deadline, though. Manning’s contract stipulates that his $19 million salary for the 2015 season becomes fully guaranteed if he is still on the Broncos’ roster by the final day of the 2014 league year.

The new 2015 season begins on March 10, so Manning would have to notify the Broncos of his intentions by March 9. The Broncos signed Manning to a five-year, $96 million contract in March of 2012. He drew salaries of $18 million in 2012; $20 million in 2013, when he broke all the league’s significant single-season passing records; and $20 million this past season.

The final two years of his contract are to pay him $19 million in 2015 and $19 million in 2016. As they say, Manning has 19 million reasons to make up his mind by March 9 to keep playing.
