The Mockingjay lives!

That's the message of the second teaser trailer for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1, which depicts anti-government rebels hacking a propaganda transmission circulated by the creepy central government.

The forthcoming installment of The Hunger Games movies—which were adapted from the best-selling book series by Suzanne Collins—should excite libertarians. It preaches a fundamentally libertarian message of the inherent evils of centralized government, excessive taxation, slavery, and police brutality, and features freedom fighters motivated by self-ownership and local autonomy.

The series is hugely popular across all age demographics, but especially among kids and teenagers. It can't be a a bad thing that so many young people now have a Harry Potter-esque reverence for Katniss Everdeen, a protagonist whose message to the government is essentially "you don't own me."
