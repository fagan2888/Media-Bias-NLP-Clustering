HELENA, Mont. (AP) - A Montana man is charged with threatening to shoot a boy for sharing information about a subplot of the new “Star Wars” movie during an online conversation.

Arthur Charles Roy, of Helena, was charged with felony assault with a weapon Monday during an appearance in Lewis and Clark County Justice Court. He remains jailed with his bail set at $10,000.

Mr. Roy, 18, became angry Thursday when he learned details about “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” from a Facebook friend, prosecutors said.

Mr. Roy sent the friend a picture of himself with a gun and threatened to come to the victim’s school to shoot him, court records said. Mr. Roy reportedly said the gun was a Colt 1911 with a “hair trigger.”

The friend called a school resource officer Thursday afternoon to report the threat.

Helena’s alternative high school was locked down Friday morning after students said they were afraid Mr. Roy might follow through with his threat. Police arrested Mr. Roy on Friday afternoon. He declined to answer questions on the advice of his attorney, court records said.

Mr. Roy’s mother asked why her son was being arrested since it was only a BB gun in the photo, charging documents said.

Chris Abbott, Mr. Roy’s public defender in an ongoing separate case, wasn’t immediately available to comment Tuesday. It’s not clear if Mr. Abbott has been assigned to this case.
