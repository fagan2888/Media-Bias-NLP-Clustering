Carey \u201coverzealous\u201d and accused his office of acting \u201creprehensibly.\u201d\n\nThose remarks prompted the \u201cconcerned Sayreville residents\u201d to start an online petition at moveon.org that implores the State Department of Education\u2019s School Ethics Commission to investigate Labbe and the board.\n\n\u201cIt is believed by many in the community that (Labbe) \u2026 acted not in the best interest of children but for personal political notoriety\u201d and that he \u201ctainted the image of our athletes and community as a whole with inaccurate statements to the media prior to \u2026 conducting a thorough investigation on the matter,\u201d the group\u2019s petition, which has gained little traction, with just over 200 signatures, reads in part.\n\n\u201cWe are still at a loss as to why he felt it necessary to go to the media using what has now proven by a court of law to be inaccurate statements.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, three days before Sayreville\u2019s first day of school and 11 days before the high school football team\u2019s season opener, Carey issued a press release outlining the sentences a Family Court Judge imposed upon six of the seven defendants (one case is still pending).\n\n\u201cThe community of Sayreville needs to know that these serious crimes occurred, \u201cCarey said, \u201cand now must work together to heal.\u201d\n\nAs part of a plea deal in which Carey\u2019s office agreed not to pursue mandatory sex offender registration as required under Megan\u2019s Law, the six players were placed on probation and ordered to serve 50 hours of community service after some of them admitted using their fingers to anally penetrate younger players.\n\nIn one attack, according to Carey, a victim was forcibly knocked to the floor before one defendant held him while at least two others grabbed his penis and attempted to digitally penetrate his anus.\n\n\u201cThe facts that were alleged by the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office at the beginning of the case have clearly been proven in a court of law,\u201d Carey said before making an apparent reference to Klein, stating, \u201cwhile the Code of Juvenile Justice provides confidentiality for the protection of juveniles, that confidentiality, unfortunately, allows for certain individuals to unscrupulously mislead the public as to what occurred at the school and during the juvenile proceedings.\u201d\n\nPamela Brause, an attorney from Metuchen representing another defendant, previously told MyCentralJersey.com, after allegations of race playing a role in Carey\u2019s filing of criminal charges surfaced in an NBCnews.com report, that she has \u201cbeen practicing law in this county for a long time\u201d and that it is not her \u201cexperience that this Prosecutor\u2019s Office would \u2026 be unethical.\u201d\n\nCarey and Labbe clearly have no credibility issues, yet the scathing attacks on the latter continue on the \u201cconcerned Sayreville residents\u201d petition.\n\n\u201cI am a former school board member,\u201d one comment, posted two weeks ago, reads. \u201cI sincerely feel that this whole situation was created and followed through by people that had a vested interest in putting in their own choice of football coaching staff. This was a vendetta and I feel the more that you look into this, the more you will see that this was all premeditated.\u201d\n\nAnother signee called Labbe and the board \u201ca disgrace to our great community,\u201d while one more wrote: \u201cIt's mind boggling the way these board members ruined these kids\u2019 lives. The victims and the accusers. Disgusting display of using power to get what Labbe wanted.\u201d\n\nLabbe and former Sayreville Board of Education President Kevin Ciak, who should be lauded for their handling of the football team\u2019s scandal and for demonstrating remarkable leadership under intense national scrutiny, held two press conferences, one prior to and another after shutting down the gridiron program.\n\nThe two made one national television appearance on TODAY, which their critics perceived as grandstanding, and for a short time thereafter responded to interview requests until, at the behest of a crisis management firm the district hired, Labbe and Ciak began declining comment.\n\nIn less than a month after Labbe shut down Sayreville\u2019s football program and courageously asked others to join him nationwide in taking a stand against bullying (his critics perceived that maneuver as bringing undue attention to the district, even after the story had already garnered national attention on its own), three high school football teams in bordering states canceled the remainder of their seasons amid bullying allegations.\n\nDr. Claudio V. Cerullo, who previously served as a White House panelist on school violence prevention and is the founder and executive director of a national anti-bullying prevention organization, said he believes Labbe's stance emboldened others to speak up.\n\n\"I think the mere fact that he took a stand certainly had a domino effect across the nation,\" Cerullo previously told MyCentralJersey.com, \"and what it says is that we are not going to tolerate bullying or hazing, and at the same time protect our children.\u201d\n\nLabbe has remained publicly silent on the topic, but is scheduled to deliver the keynote address later this month at a New Jersey Principals and Supervisors Association symposium on high school hazing in Monroe.\n\nUnfortunately, some of those \u201cconcerned Sayreville residents,\u201d who could benefit from attending the symposium, aren\u2019t invited. School districts, however, are encouraged to send up to four staff members including a superintendent, principal, athletics director and coach.\n\nIn Labbe, the NJPSA could not have found a better ambassador, something the \u201cconcerned Sayreville\u201d residents should recognize.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1FfRTlj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sayreville\u2019s Labbe should be lauded for handling of hazing scandal", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Sayreville\u2019s Labbe should be lauded for handling of hazing scandal", "title": "Sayreville\u2019s Labbe should be lauded for handling of hazing scandal", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/2015/09/01/sayrevilles-labbe-lauded-handling-hazing-scandal/71505684/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sayreville\u2019s Labbe should be lauded for handling of hazing scandal", "title": "Sayreville\u2019s Labbe should be lauded for handling of hazing scandal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d324205b27385800efa347ff5e5b02cf2f366af1/c=334-0-1667-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/01/Bridgewater/B9318671086Z.1_20150901094145_000_G8RBPP2FF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "In Labbe, the NJPSA could not have found a better ambassador, something the \u201cconcerned Sayreville\u201d residents should recognize.\nUnfortunately, some of those \u201cconcerned Sayreville residents,\u201d who could benefit from attending the symposium, aren\u2019t invited.\n\u201cI am a former school board member,\u201d one comment, posted two weeks ago, reads.\nLabbe and the board were much maligned following their decision to cancel the Sayreville football season last October amid allegations that seven players hazed and sexually assaulted four teammates inside the locker room.\nSchool districts, however, are encouraged to send up to four staff members including a superintendent, principal, athletics director and coach."}
