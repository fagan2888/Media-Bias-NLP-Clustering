Spotlight on… Rick Nash, left wing, Rangers

When: New York plays the Avs on Thursday, the Rangers’ annual visit to Denver. Colorado beat the Rangers 4-3 in a shootout Nov. 13 at New York.

What’s up: Nash, 30, is having a career year with his second NHL team, scoring his NHL-leading 32nd goal in his 49th game. He is on pace to easily surpass his career high of 41 goals, set in the 2003-04 season as a 19-year-old with the Columbus Blue Jackets, and get 40 goals for the third time. Through Friday, Nash’s plus-20 rating was the best of his NHL career.



Background: Nash was the No. 1 pick in the 2002 draft and reached 30 goals in seven of his eight seasons with the Blue Jackets. He is the prototype power forward, a gifted scorer in a 6-foot-4, 213-pound body. Nash was traded to the Rangers in summer 2012 — along with Steven Delisle and a third-round draft pick — for Artem Anisimov, Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick.

Chambers’ take: Nash is on pace to score 500 goals by age 34, but his Hockey Hall of Fame candidacy will depend on what he does in the playoffs the rest of his career. In the 2013 and 2014 postseasons, the Rangers played a total of 37 games, but Nash scored only four goals. He is getting $7.9 million this season and is under contract through 2017-18.
