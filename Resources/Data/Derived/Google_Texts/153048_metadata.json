It\u2019s funny because that\u2019s exactly what Republicans and their Religious Right allies are trying to do.\n\nThis week\u2019s fun started\u2026this week, I think (because all that time-defunding means that only the gods know where we might actually be, chronologically speaking) with Pat Robertson Monday on the 700 Club telling a viewer to stay away from the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThe viewer had already asked God \u201cto be my physician\u201d but his family was pleading with him to see a doctor to be treated. Because, you know, that\u2019s what doctor\u2019s do:\n\nI am 76-years-old. Several years ago, I made a covenant with God. I asked Him to be my physician. I said, \u201cI trust you, Lord, for all my physical needs \u2013 whether I am sick or healthy, healed or afflicted. I will never cease to praise You, and when my life is ended, I pray You will receive me into Your holy kingdom.\u201d\n\nBut Robertson\u2019s answer was that if you have God as your physician, you don\u2019t need a doctor. He told the man,\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made a commitment to the Lord, stick with it, don\u2019t let your family influence you, do what you feel like doing. Live your life, God bless you.\u201d\n\nToo bad Robertson isn\u2019t willing to ante up final expenses. When he consigns somebody to death, that ought to be required.\n\nAnd then newly elected Colorado State Representative Gordon \u201cChaps\u201d Klingenschmitt chimed in. He said that a Fox News poll \u2013 now this is a FOX NEWS poll, mind you \u2013 shows that 58 percent of Americans want Obamacare repealed, and took the opportunity on his Pray in Jesus Name program to say people \u201cought to look to the Lord for our healthcare.\u201d\n\nI have some objections:\n\nNumber One\n\nAgain, this is a Fox News poll, and so suspect and hardly representative of what people actually want, or don\u2019t want. Politifact looked at the issue, based on the statement by DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cOne thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politifact, and based on a number of polls, that statement is \u201cmostly true.\u201d Meaning Fox News\u2019 claim is false, and that Klingenschmitt is proceeding from a false premise.\n\nNumber Two\n\n(And this on a personal level) unless God is a big manufacturer of the son\u2019s enzyme replacement he needs to continue living, I don\u2019t see that happening. I don\u2019t care who the god is. I know personally speaking, that my own gods would not wish me to be that stupid.\n\nBut Klingenschmitt pulled out Exodus 15:26:\n\nIf you will listen carefully to the voice of the Lord your God, and do what is right in his sight, and give heed to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord who heals you.\n\nYou might notice that even if the verse is taken at face value, cancer was not among the diseases brought upon the Egyptians. Nor was tuberculosis. Or emphysema. Or heart disease. Or Gaucher disease. Or any number of other diseases which afflict millions throughout the world.\n\nNo, even YHWH is not promising here to replace doctors.\n\nBut he assures us,\n\n\u201cI personally prefer to look to almighty God as my healer and not to the government as a substitute god or substitute healer.\u201d\n\nWhich brings me to,\n\nNumber Three\n\nThere is the little fact that Klingenschmitt himself does not rely on God for his healthcare. You know how I know? He cannot possibly, as he doesn\u2019t live according to God\u2019s law or his statutes, which is the precondition set forth in Exodus 15:26.\n\n1. He lies. Lying is a no-no. Says so in the Ten Commandments. Horrendous as the Religious Right claims being gay is, being gay doesn\u2019t make the top 10.\n\nLying does. Right there at Number 9.\n\nKlingenschmitt gives us Exodus 15. I give him Proverbs 6:\n\nThere are six things that the LORD strongly dislikes, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. Proverbs 6:16-19\n\n2. He hates. Jesus said to love your enemies and turn the other cheek. Klingenschmitt doesn\u2019t turn the other cheek. He attacks and insults and condemns. Rather than turn the other cheek to Right Wing Watch, for example, he got their YouTube account terminated \u201cby filing copyright complaints against a handful of our videos, resulting in several thousand of our videos being taken down.\u201d Of course, the videos were protected under Fair Use and RWW has their account back and chock full of Klingenschmitt videos.\n\nSo I will also give him Matthew 5:\n\nAnd if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well (Matthew 5:40).\n\nKlingenschmitt wants this nation to \u201crepent of worshiping President Obama as if he is a god\u201d but the person who ought to repent is Klingenschmitt himself.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, his health plan is on a part with the GOP\u2019s official stance, which is \u201cjust die already.\u201d Because that is what we will do if we get rid of our doctors.\n\nBoth men, meanwhile, are nominees for Right Wing Watch\u2019s prestigious 2014 Equine Posterior Award, and though they did not make the final four, that is only because there is a lot of competition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supposedly, we don't need healthcare, we need only God.
