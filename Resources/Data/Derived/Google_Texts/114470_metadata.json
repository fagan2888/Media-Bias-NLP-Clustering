Since the announcement of this transaction, we have worked closely with our Covidien colleagues to plan for the integration of these 2 leading companies, and we look forward to closing the transaction and realizing these strategic benefits.\"\n\nMedtronic said the new financing terms won\u2019t affect the deal\u2019s impact on earnings.\n\n\"The transaction is still expected to be accretive to Medtronic\u2019s cash earnings in FY2016, the 1st full fiscal year, and significantly accretive thereafter. The transaction is also expected to be neutral to GAAP earnings by FY2019 and accretive thereafter,\" according to the release.\n\nMedtronic did not change its outlook for fiscal 2015 and said the deal is still on track to close later this year or in early 2015.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "og": {"site_name": "MassDevice", "title": "Medtronic is still in on Covidien buyout", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.massdevice.com/sites/default/wp-content/uploads/logos/medtronic-covidien-large-noshake-3x2.jpg", "url": "http://www.massdevice.com/medtronic-still-covidien-buyout/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "", "creator": "@MassDevice", "image": "http://www.massdevice.com/sites/default/wp-content/uploads/logos/medtronic-covidien-large-noshake-3x2.jpg", "title": "Medtronic is still in on Covidien buyout \u2013 MassDevice", "site": "@MassDevice", "card": "summary"}, "com.silverpop.cothost": "pod2.ibmmarketingcloud.com", "google-site-verification": "3L7z8HME5RuF4m9HDRNebfZxyJWuiEr5kr1xNv5U-Ng", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/massdevicejournal", "section": "Mergers & Acquisitions", "tag": "Medtronic buys Covidien", "published_time": "2014-10-03T14:32:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a5b\"", "article_summary": "Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) said today that it will finance its mega-merger with Covidien (NYSE:COV) using $16 billion in \"external financing\" instead of the foreign cash it was planning to use.\nMedtronic said the new financing terms won\u2019t affect the deal\u2019s impact on earnings.\nMedtronic did not change its outlook for fiscal 2015 and said the deal is still on track to close later this year or in early 2015.\nThe transaction is also expected to be neutral to GAAP earnings by FY2019 and accretive thereafter,\" according to the release.\n\"The transaction is still expected to be accretive to Medtronic\u2019s cash earnings in FY2016, the 1st full fiscal year, and significantly accretive thereafter."}
