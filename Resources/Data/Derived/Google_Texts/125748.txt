LAS VEGAS (AP) — Tickets for Las Vegas’ massive, three-day Electric Daisy Carnival are going on sale six months ahead of the event.

Parent company Insomniac says attendees can buy three-day passes starting at noon Pacific time on Monday. Early bird tickets start at $329 plus service fees.

The 2015 electronic dance festival runs from June 19-21 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. It’s expected to include DJs, art installations, theatrical performances, carnival rides and other attractions.

About 134,000 people attended the 2014 event each of the three days.

A study commissioned by organizers found that the festival generated nearly $338 million in economic impact for Clark County this year.
