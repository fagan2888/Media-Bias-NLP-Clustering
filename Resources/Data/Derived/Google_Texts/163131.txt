After endorsing Marco Rubio’s candidacy, Rick Santorum went on Morning Joe and couldn’t name any of Rubio’s accomplishments in the Senate.

It is utterly inexcusable on both Santorum’s part for a lack of due diligence and on the part of the Rubio campaign for not having a key surrogate prepared. for tough questioning.

It’s all the more inexcusable when one considers that Rubio has probably done more to make Obamacare fail than anyone on Capitol Hill.

After all, it was Rubio who cleverly inserted a provision in the Omnibus Spending Bill in 2014 which barred the federal government from bailing out health insurance companies in the so-called risk corridor fund saving taxpayers billions of dollars.

While it was a temporary provision, it did much to damage Obamacare and expose its lack of financial viability.

Rubio’s surrogates should talk about how their man weakened Obamacare at every possible opportunity.
