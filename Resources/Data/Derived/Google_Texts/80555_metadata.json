Victor Ramirez, Prince George\u2019s County Democrat, and state Sen. Roger Manno, Montgomery County Democrat, have already pre-filed automatic registration bills ahead of the legislative session, saying they are trying to cut down on barriers that keep poor people from showing up at the polls on Election Day.\n\nThe bills would automatically register everyone who applies for services at the state\u2019s Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) unless the customers specifically opt out \u2014 a reversal from the current situation, where customers are asked to opt in.\n\nSEE ALSO: Congress sends health law repeal to Obama for first time\n\nAnd fearing that poor residents may not need automobile services or have access to online registration right now, the bills would also automatically enroll those who show up at social services agencies or who buy health insurance on Maryland\u2019s version of the Obamacare exchange.\n\nSimilar bills are being contemplated in the House of Delegates and are already drawing support from key lawmakers.\n\n\u201cVoting is a constitutional right, and elected officials should help and encourage every Maryland citizen, regardless of their political affiliation, to vote for the government of their choosing,\u201d House Speaker Michael E. Busch, Anne Arundel County Democrat, said.\n\nMaryland Democrats are trying to outdo California and Oregon, where laws were enacted last year automatically enrolling driver\u2019s license applicants. But Maryland goes further, seeking out eligible citizens who may not use the MVA but who use other services such as food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, mobility and paratransit programs and the state health exchange.\n\nHannah Marr, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, said that he has not taken a position on universal registration, but would be \u201cmonitoring the upcoming session, and the governor will carefully review any bill that makes it to his desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs with any initiative or piece of legislation, the associated costs and effects on current government services and programs will be closely scrutinized,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a close friend of Mr. Hogan\u2019s, vetoed a similar measure last year passed by the state\u2019s Democratic-majority legislature.\n\nState Sen. J.B. Jennings, the Maryland Senate\u2019s minority leader, said voting is an important right, but requiring voters to proactively want to register makes sense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to disenfranchise anybody from having the right to vote,\u201d the Harford and Baltimore County Republican said. \u201cEvery American citizen should be allowed to vote. But people need to do their due diligence to research why they\u2019re voting for someone, and filling out a simple card once in their lifetime to say they want to be a registered voter isn\u2019t too much to ask for.\u201d\n\nHe also questioned whether adding more registered voters would actually lead to more people turning out at the polls. He said an effort to expand the early-voting period did not produce a spike in voting.\n\nAnd Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said universal registration was a \u201cjoke\u201d that would make elections more vulnerable to fraud by signing up people who do not plan to vote or are not motivated to do so. It would also set a dangerous precedent, such as fining people for not voting, he said.\n\n\u201cIt gets to the basic problem that this isn\u2019t the role of government. It\u2019s not to force people to do things. There\u2019s certain countries in this world that force its citizens to do things,\u201d Mr. Cluster said. \u201cIsrael, at 18 years old, you get a gun. Do we want to get all our citizens a gun because you have a right to own a gun?\u201d\n\nThe bills\u2019 backers said fraud should not be a concern because all of the information will be sent to the state Board of Elections, which already cooperates with the MVA on screening out erroneous applications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s already lots of communication between the MVA and the State Board of Elections, so it\u2019s easy to shift to automatic registration, and they\u2019re in a good position to take the next step as well and look at other agencies,\u201d said Jennifer Bevan-Dangel, executive director at Common Cause Maryland.\n\nAnd advocates dismissed fears of padding Democrats\u2019 numbers on the voting rolls.\n\n\u201cThe bills don\u2019t actually register someone for one party or the other,\u201d Michelle Whittaker, communications direct of FairVote, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a growing trend in Maryland and other states toward unaffiliated voters who have more of an independent political ideology.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Ramirez said his goal is to get historically disenfranchised people into the process.\n\n\u201cVoting is a good thing. If you\u2019re a citizen, I think you should vote,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said. \u201cWe are the greatest nation in the world, and we should have more voter participation. We have to somehow reach out to people to allow them to feel like their voice still counts, allow them to be able to vote.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maryland Democrats hope to break new ground in the push for universal voter registration, planning to wage a fight in the General Assembly this year to automatically sign up everyone who visits certain state social services agency or buys coverage through the state's Obamacare exchange.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Maryland Democrats hope to break new ground in the push for universal voter registration, planning to wage a fight in the General Assembly this year to automatically sign up everyone who visits certain state social services agency or buys coverage through the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.", "title": "Democrats push to use Obamacare as voter registration drive", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/6/democrats-push-use-obamacare-voter-registration-dr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/04/straight_ticket_voting.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/04/straight_ticket_voting.jpeg", "description": "Maryland Democrats hope to break new ground in the push for universal voter registration, planning to wage a fight in the General Assembly this year to automatically sign up everyone who visits certai", "card": "summary", "title": "Democrats push to use Obamacare as voter registration drive"}, "Author": "Anjali Shastry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Victor Ramirez"}, "article_summary": "Maryland Democrats are trying to outdo California and Oregon, where laws were enacted last year automatically enrolling driver\u2019s license applicants.\nMaryland Democrats hope to break new ground in the push for universal voter registration, planning to wage a fight in the General Assembly this year to automatically sign up everyone who visits certain state social services agency or buys coverage through the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to disenfranchise anybody from having the right to vote,\u201d the Harford and Baltimore County Republican said.\nSimilar bills are being contemplated in the House of Delegates and are already drawing support from key lawmakers.\n\u201cWe are the greatest nation in the world, and we should have more voter participation."}
