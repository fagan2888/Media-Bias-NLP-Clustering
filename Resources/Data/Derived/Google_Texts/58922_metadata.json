A career banker, Migoya took over a system that bled $428 million over the previous four years. \u201cOur cash supply was in the six- to-eight -days range,\u201d says Migoya, who came directly to Jackson after a one-year stint as Miami city manager. He found Jackson lacking budget accountability, expense controls and unable to collect on certain revenue streams. \u201cBasically, there was no business plan going forward,\u201d he says.\n\n[MORE: Hospital of Tomorrow: How the Industry is Facing the Future]\n\nToday, the county hospital system is in the black\u2014its 2013 bottom line a handsome $45.7 million. The system is on the front end of an $830 million, decade-long renovation and infrastructure upgrade, and has cemented relations with University of Miami\u2014whose doctors the nonprofit academic medical system depends on. Migoya also is revitalizing Jackson Health\u2019s long-neglected community-based urgent care and clinics, a strategy required to survive under changing incentives brought on with the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cThe health care industry is going through major changes,\u201d notes Migoya. \u201cSometimes, if you\u2019re in the forest, you don\u2019t see the trees.\u201d Migoya is in the vanguard of a trend that appears poised to sweep through the hospital industry. Hospital boards increasingly want that outside perspective, along with some different skill sets \u2013 and are willing to hire outside of the industry to get it.\n\n[READ: Staffing the Hospital of Tomorrow]\n\nIt\u2019s expected that two-thirds of hospital CEOs hired this year will have little to no health care experience, according to Black Book Rankings, which last year conducted a poll of 1,404 human resource officers and board members of health care organizations. That\u2019s up sharply from 19 percent in 2009.\n\nAs ACA ushers in fundamental changes, today\u2019s hospital staffing needs have changed. Hospital demand for radiologists, anesthesiologists and other specialists a decade ago have been replaced by the need for primary care doctors, hospitalists, nurse practitioners and other physician extenders.These professionals are vital to keeping patients out of the hospital, which is essential as outcome-based payment replaces a fee-for-service system. The need for different skills seems to be hitting the C-suite, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about managing health now, not care,\u201d says Doug Brown, managing partner of Black Book Rankings. Hospital board and HR directors are looking for non-industry productivity, business development and financial management experts with heavy technological expertise. \u201cCommunication is now more important than ever,\u201d says Paul Esselman, executive vice president and managing principle at Cejka Executive Search. Whether or not a CEO comes from inside or outside of health care, Esselman says, \u201cthe absolute strength or key element in that leader has to be communication, particularly to the provider community.\u201d\n\nThe average tenure of a hospital CEO runs less than 3.5 years, with a majority of those being involuntary exits, according to Black Book Rankings. When the CEO leaves, it\u2019s common for chief financial officers, chief information officers and other top managers to leave soon after. \u201cThe big surprise is the high number of chief medical officers who are replaced (87 percent),\u201d says Brown, adding they are among the senior managers making the quickest exit\u2014most within two months of a departing CEO.\n\nEsselman notes he detected the \u201csea change in health care\u201d over the last couple of years, with \"hospital boards raising the bar for delivering results.\u201d While most newly recruited hospital executives still come with a health care background, Esselman notes that boards increasingly \u201care looking at leaders from managed care, the payer side or from finance or banking.\u201d\n\nFor example, Mike Keating, CEO of Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, previously was an investment banker.;Robert Meyer, president and CEO of Phoenix Children's Hospital, came from the consulting world; and before he was appointed to lead Indiana University Health (then Clarian Health) in November 2002, Dan Evans was a law firm partner. Michael Fisher led Premier Manufacturing Support Services before becoming the president and CEO of Cincinnati Children\u2019s four years ago.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"We all need a small amount of sodium to keep our bodies working properly \u2013 but too much is linked to heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Hospital boards increasingly want an outside perspective, along with some different skill sets \u2013 and are willing to hire outside of the industry to get it.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "author": "Christopher J.
