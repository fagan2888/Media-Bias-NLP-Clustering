In responce, Obama grinned. \u201cHow did I guess this question?\u201d he reacted with mock surprise.\n\n\u201cI have to tell you it\u2019s not a silver bullet,\u201d Obama explained. \u201cIf you are legalizing marijuana how do you deal with other drugs and where do you draw the line?\u201d\n\nObama explained that states that recently legalized marijuana, such as Colorado and Washington, would serve as an interesting testing ground for the social consequences of legalizing the drug.\n\n\u201cWe will see how that experiment works its way though the process,\u201d Obama said, cautioning that legal marijuana was not federal policy, and that he didn\u2019t see Congress changing national laws on marijuana anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI do think that if there are states that show that they are not suddenly a magnet for additional crime, that they have a strong enough public health infrastructure to push against the potential of increased addiction, then its conceivable that it will spur on a national debate,\u201d he said.\n\nObama also cautioned third world countries who were interested in gaining revenue from legalized marijuana, reminding them that their small businesses would be overrun by bigger corporations.\n\n\u201cIf you have a bunch of small medium sized marijuana businesses, scattered across the Caribbean, and this is suddenly legal, if you think that big multi-national companies are not suddenly come in and market and try to control and profit from the trade, you know that\u2019s a very real scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nLater in the event, Obama pointed to the illegal drug trade as the cause of violence in many communities.\n\n\u201cIf you have an illicit trade that generates huge amounts of money, and is not regulated, above board, that is going to attract ultimately people trying to carve out turf, trying to control markets and violence ensues,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama On Legal Weed: \u2018We Will See How That Experiment Works\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama On Legal Weed: \u2018We Will See How That Experiment Works\u2019", "title": "Obama On Legal Weed: \u2018We Will See How That Experiment Works\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ap_barack-obama-yvette-clarke_ap-photo-e1428582998340.jpg", "height": 427}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/09/obama-on-legal-weed-we-will-see-how-that-experiment-works/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama On Legal Weed: \u2018We Will See How That Experiment Works\u2019", "creator": "@charliespiering", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ap_barack-obama-yvette-clarke_ap-photo-e1428582998340.jpg", "title": "Obama On Legal Weed: \u2018We Will See How That Experiment Works\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Jamaica, legal marijuana,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "legal marijuana", "published_time": "2015-04-09T14:56:57-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd964\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring a town hall in Jamaica, President Obama was asked by one young person what he thought about legalizing marijuana and hemp.\n\u201cWe will see how that experiment works its way though the process,\u201d Obama said, cautioning that legal marijuana was not federal policy, and that he didn\u2019t see Congress changing national laws on marijuana anytime soon.\nLater in the event, Obama pointed to the illegal drug trade as the cause of violence in many communities.\nThe young man asserted that the legalization of such products would help people in poor economies out of poverty.\nObama also cautioned third world countries who were interested in gaining revenue from legalized marijuana, reminding them that their small businesses would be overrun by bigger corporations."}
