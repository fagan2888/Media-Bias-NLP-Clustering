She had some poignant things to ask of the network that often accuses black people of \"playing the race card.\"\n\n\"If in the event that I am stopped and frisked, can I pull out my race card? Will this race card increase my chances of survival?\"\n\nIn a video of the performance, posted by Button Poetry earlier this month, Valentine goes on to emphasize the ways in which \"pulling the race card\" (i.e. calling attention to racism and oppression) often does nothing to actually help black people.\n\n\u201cWill this race card give me health benefits?\" continues. \"How about Obamacare?
