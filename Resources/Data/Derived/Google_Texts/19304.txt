Colorado senior outside hitter Taylor Simpson made history Wednesday by becoming the school’s first volleyball player in history to be named to the AVCA All-America first team.

Colorado State senior setter Deedra Foss was named third-team AVCA All-American.

The 6-foot-3 Simpson, from Colorado Springs, set a CU single-season kills record with 591. She recorded a career-best 32 kills in a five-set loss to CSU in a second-round NCAA Tournament match in Fort Collins.

“Taylor is very deserving of this recognition,” CU coach Liz Kritza said. “She has proven throughout her time in a Buffs jersey that she is truly one of the elite players in the country.”

The last CU player to earn AVCA All-America recognition had been Ashley Nu’u, who was named to the 2006 third team.

Foss, from McKenna, Wash., ranked seventh nationally with 11.65 assists per match.

“We’ve had a lot of success in the past four years,” CSU coach Tom Hilbert said, “and Deedra has been one of the primary reasons. She’s gotten better each year and makes the players around her better.”

CSU junior opposite hitter Adrianna Culbert was named AVCA All-America honorable mention list.
