The suited men and veiled women in the pews \u2014 nearly all of them Assyrian \u2014 join in the ancient chants as they pray for peace and resolution to a crisis both historic and modern: the persecution of their brothers and sisters in the Middle East.\n\nIndigenous to northern Iraq, Assyrians have lived in the region for more than 6,000 years. They converted as a people to Christianity in the first century A.D. and are one of the oldest continuous Christian communities in the world. But in the past century, violence and religious persecution have escalated, forcing most of them to seek safety in other countries. Some 10,000 now reside in the Bay Area. With the rise of the Islamic State, they now risk vanishing from their homeland altogether.The problem is that \u201cthe Christians have nowhere to go,\u201d said Father Lawrance, whose family fled Kirkuk, Iraq, when he was 14 as former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rose to power.\n\nMost of the parishioners at Mar Yosip are from Iraq or Iran, although a few are from Syria and other countries in the Middle East. Many in the community still have family in the Middle East: some who have remained by choice, others who are caught in the limbo of refugee camps as they await a chance at a new life.\n\nNo safety in Syria\n\nSince the rise of the Islamic State, Assyrians in the Bay Area have tried multiple avenues to help their relatives in the region. Some have petitioned the State Department to more forcefully defend Christians in the Middle East. Others are urging the United States Agency for International Development to directly fund Assyrian humanitarian aid groups. And others are working to get families approved for asylum in the United States.But many in the community feel disappointed so far in the U.S. response. And there is a deep worry that this ancient group could disappear completely.\u201cWe kind of feel like our life is paralyzed,\u201d said Rochelle Yousefian, president of the Assyrian American Association of San Jose. \u201cThe government that we are so proud of living in in the country of peace is not taking any actions, it\u2019s not even open to listen to these atrocities. It makes us feel hopeless; it makes us unproductive because we don\u2019t know what to do, we don\u2019t know how to help.\u201dThe history of Assyrian Christians in the Middle East has been punctuated by periods of violent persecution. In 1915, the year Assyrians call the Seyfo \u2014 \u201cthe year of the sword\u201d \u2014 the Ottoman Empire slaughtered as many as 300,000 Assyrians. In 2003, it was estimated that 30,000 Assyrian Christians still lived in the city of Mosul in northern Iraq. But after the Islamic State captured the city in the summer of 2014, none remain \u2014 having been either killed or forced to flee.\u201cThis is a genocide,\u201d said Albert Nissan, a Mar Yosip parishioner who emigrated from Baghdad in 1975 and has family members still living there.\u201cThe people who emptied Mosul of its Christians are the same people who bombed Paris,\u201d he added, referring to the November attacks by Islamic extremists that killed 130 people and injured hundreds more.\n\nWhen the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, many Assyrians sought refuge in Syria, which was comparably peaceful at the time. But they were held in UN refugee camps \u201cfor years,\u201d said Father Lawrance, and when civil war broke out in Syria five years ago, some were trapped again by the violence they had hoped to escape.\n\nAsylum at last\n\nConditions for Assyrians in Syrian refugee camps are \u201chorrible,\u201d said Poline Maiel, a parishioner of Mar Yosip. Girls risk being kidnapped and Christians are frequently targets of violence, she said. \u201cWhatever we think about [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad, before the war the Assyrians [in Syria] had a good life and they were safe. Now, they are targeted by everybody.\u201dIn February, the Islamic State captured around 230 Assyrian Christians in Syria and held them for a ransom of around $14 million. That month, Assyrian Bishops in the United States called on Secretary of State John Kerry to take \u201cconcrete steps to help the remaining Assyrian Christians in the region to protect themselves.\u201d The Islamic State released some of the sick and elderly prisoners, but continues to hold around 150 Assyrian Christian hostages.In October, three of the hostages were executed. One of the victims was the first cousin of a parishioner at Mar Yosip, and other family members are still being held for ransom by the Islamic State.\n\nIn June 2014, Shamiran left her village outside of Mosul with her three teenage children on temporary visitor visas to attend a family wedding and visit her parents in the Bay Area, who are parishioners at Mar Yosip. But when ISIS overtook Mosul that summer, her husband who had remained in Iraq told her not to return because of the security risk.\n\nWaiting for visas\n\nUnable to return to Iraq, \u201cShamiran\u201d \u2014 who didn\u2019t want her real name used because of security concerns \u2014 and her children applied for asylum in the United States. In June, nearly a year after their arrival, they were granted asylum.In broken English, Shamiran described the experience of Christians in Mosul who were forced to flee the city and have their houses marked as being inhabited by Christians. \u201cThere were many Christian families in Mosul,\u201d she said. \u201cThey left everything in Mosul and they went. [ISIS] put Arabic letter \u201cNun\u201d [on our houses]. It means Christian \u2014 \u201cNazarene.\u201dShamiran\u2019s husband\u2019s request for asylum has also been approved, but he\u2019s still waiting for the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to certify his identity and complete a background check.Having been in the United States for a year-and-a-half now, Shamiran has found a job working at a grocery store, and her three children are earning A\u2019s in Bay Area high schools. But she yearns for the day when she can be reunited with her husband. \u201cMy husband is safe now, thank God. I need for him to come here to live in peace with us to be a family again.\u201d\n\nFor the few Assyrian Christians left in the Middle East, the threat of attacks by the Islamic State makes each day more perilous. But migrating to the West has become increasingly difficult, as waves of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa pour into Europe. In the United States, fears of terrorism have prompted debates about how many \u2014 if any \u2014 refugees the United States should admit.\n\nFather Lawrance agrees that refugees to the United States should be screened carefully to prevent terrorists from being admitted to the country. \u201cBut they have to differentiate between who\u2019s doing the killing and who\u2019s being persecuted,\u201d he said. Rep. Anna Eshoo , the only Assyrian member of Congress, serves California\u2019s 18th district covering parts of San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties. Eshoo, a Democrat whose parents are Assyrian Christians who fled persecution in the Middle East, voted in November against a House Republican bill to pause the admittance of Syrian refugees into the United States. Despite its passage by a wide majority that included many Democratic votes, Eshoo voted against the measure because it amounted to a \u201cbureaucratic blockade for all refugee applicants.\u201dIn June, Eshoo, who is the co-chair of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus, called on President Barack Obama to do more to help Middle Eastern religious minorities like Assyrians by prioritizing additional security support for vulnerable populations, especially the ancient Christian community. Eshoo has also called on the president to designate an additional 5,000 priority refugee visas for religious minorities from the Middle East.But the process, said Eshoo in a recent interview, is \u201cvery, very slow,\u201d since the United States has a complex system of rules for granting refugee visas. Eshoo says her goal is to expedite visas for Middle East Christians, since she fears that relief might not arrive before they are \u201cdead and gone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Bay Area Assyrians pray for an end to religious persecution in their ancestral homeland of northern Iraq, where the Islamic State has killed many of their brothers and sisters or forced them to flee.", "title": "Torn from their homeland, Bay Area Assyrians yearn for persecution to end - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_0577.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-17T06:58:41+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/12/16/bay-area-assyrians/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Culture", "tag": "refugees", "published_time": "2015-12-16T07:02:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T06:58:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bay Area Assyrians pray for an end to religious persecution in their ancestral homeland of northern Iraq, where the Islamic State has killed many of their brothers and sisters or forced them to flee.", "creator": "@KaitlynLandgraf", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_0577.jpg", "title": "Torn from their homeland, Bay Area Assyrians yearn for persecution to end - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the United States, fears of terrorism have prompted debates about how many \u2014 if any \u2014 refugees the United States should admit.\nNo safety in SyriaSince the rise of the Islamic State, Assyrians in the Bay Area have tried multiple avenues to help their relatives in the region.\nEshoo says her goal is to expedite visas for Middle East Christians, since she fears that relief might not arrive before they are \u201cdead and gone.\u201d\nMost of the parishioners at Mar Yosip are from Iraq or Iran, although a few are from Syria and other countries in the Middle East.\nFather Lawrance agrees that refugees to the United States should be screened carefully to prevent terrorists from being admitted to the country."}
