Local hospital merger talks are in the air

The possible sale of Oakwood Healthcare Inc. isn't the only example of local hospital merger chatter; industry sources say merger chatter is as strong as it has been in five years.



Royal Oak-based Beaumont Health System, which is rumored to be in talks with Oakwood along with for-profit Tenet Health Care, also is believed to be discussing a possible merger or affiliation with Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills, an independent osteopathic hospital. Beaumont and Botsford officials declined to comment.



Crain's requested an interview, but — like other CEOs linked to mergers — Botsford CEO Paul LaCasse, D.O., instead issued a statement:



"The Affordable Care Act provides opportunity for 330-bed Botsford Health Care to create strategic affiliations and partnerships that may generate even greater value for the communities we serve.
