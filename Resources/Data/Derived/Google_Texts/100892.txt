With the Affordable Care Acts excise tax just around the corner, some employers may be struggling with how to maintain the quality of their health care benefit plans and still avoid triggering the tax. But surprisingly, rather than simply shifting costs to employees, some innovative employers in traditionally stagnant industries such as manufacturing and mining are looking at voluntary core benefits to limit health care cost increases.

Speaking at last weeks Benefit Forum & Expo, Philia Swam, director of health, wellness and group benefits at global construction materials manufacturer Lafarge U.S., explains that the company has been more proactive in recent years. While noting that the company does not wait for the cement industry to do anything because well be here for a long time, Swam explained the cement, aggregates, concrete and asphalt supplier strives to be the leader in its industry in terms of health and wellness.
