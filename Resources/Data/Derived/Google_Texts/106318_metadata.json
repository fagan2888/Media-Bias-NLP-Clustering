David Clifton says Jacob Walbert of Newport was driving a Dodge van south on Nine Mile Road when he crossed the centerline roughly 3 to 3 and a half feet, hitting an Acura that was traveling north on the same road. The Acura was driven by Rebecca White.\n\nClifton says the van ran off the road to the left and hit a ditch bank then overturned, while the Acura slammed into a group of trees and came to rest along the shoulder.\n\nWhite was airlifted to Vidant Medical Center via EastCare.\n\nWalbert was transported to Carteret General Hospital via Newport EMS. His passengers, Ashley Collins and her two 7 and 8-year-old children, were not hurt.\n\nWalbert is charged with DWI (narcotics), careless and reckless driving, and driving left of center. Clifton says since children were in the van with an impaired driver, the Department of Social Services will be notified Monday.\n\nEach vehicle was deemed a total loss. The wreck closed the road in both directions for an hour and a half.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials say a man with illegal drugs in his system caused a wreck that sent him and one other person to the hospital.", "language": "english", "author": "WITN", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/302319981.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/wreck103.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Officials say a man with illegal drugs in his system caused a wreck that sent him and one other person to the hospital.", "title": "TROOPER: Impaired Newport driver charged following two vehicle wreck"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials say a man with illegal drugs in his system caused a wreck that sent him and one other person to the hospital.", "title": "TROOPER: Impaired Newport driver charged following two vehicle wreck", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/302319981.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/wreck103.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "TROOPER: Impaired Newport driver charged following two vehicle wreck", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "TROOPER Impaired Newport driver charged"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21e6\"", "article_summary": "Walbert is charged with DWI (narcotics), careless and reckless driving, and driving left of center.\nTroopers responded to a wreck on Nine Mile Road just south of Mills Road in Carteret County around 6:10 p.m.Sgt.\nClifton says since children were in the van with an impaired driver, the Department of Social Services will be notified Monday.\nThe wreck closed the road in both directions for an hour and a half.\nOfficials say a man with illegal drugs in his system caused a wreck that sent him and one other person to the hospital Friday."}
