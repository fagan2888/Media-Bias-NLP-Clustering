Before joining his administration, Sinden was a high-powered connector as the leader of Colorado Concern, a group that represents prominent business leaders.\n\nAdd to the list \u201chonored guest\u201d Gov. John Hickenlooper, Hancock\u2019s predecessor as mayor of Denver.\n\nAttendees are asked to contribute $1,000 at the swanky soiree in Cherry Creek North to benefit Hancock\u2019s campaign for re-election\n\nHancock is seeking a second term in the May 5 election without much of a challenge. He has four opponents (down from five after a recent withdrawal), but none have raised any money of note or given Hancock reason to sweat.\n\nIt would be tough to single out just a few of the co-chairs for Wednesday\u2019s event without dimming the wattage of others. Suffice it to say, these are folks who get things done behind the scenes in metro Denver and beyond. The guest list makes this potentially the biggest political fundraiser of Denver\u2019s quiet municipal election season.\n\nThe fundraiser also illustrates the close relationship between business and government as city leaders deal with potentially big decisions on zoning, redevelopment, tax incentives and other issues that affect the private sector. (Lately, even the issue of fracking has reappeared in Denver politics.)\n\nJust a couple examples: developers Cal Fulenwider and Pat Hamill have shaped big swaths of land near Denver International Airport and have maintained close ties to Hancock, who has made development of an \u201caerotropolis\u201d a big focus. (Hancock also hails from that corner of the city, having represented it on the City Council for two terms.)\n\nHamill is hosting the fundraiser at his home, a renovated historic structure.\n\nAnd David Siegel, CEO of Frontier Airlines, has lamented to employees what he sees as too few city incentives and a high tax burden as the low-cost carrier has shed jobs and flights at DIA. Last fall, Hancock disputed Siegel\u2019s account in a letter that quickly became public, noting that \u201cFrontier ceased communication months ago\u201d during incentive-development talks.\n\nPresumably, Siegel and Hancock will get some time to chat Wednesday.\n\nHancock has raised $967,359 for his re-election, including $38,604 in January. As of Jan. 31, he reported $580,366 in his campaign account.\n\nNote: In the initial version of this post, I used the word \u201cspinster\u201d to refer to PR mavens who were co-chairs of the event. It\u2019s been corrected to say \u201cspinmeister.\u201d I apologize for unintentionally using the other term, which carries a very different meaning.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bob Deibel,Cal Fulenwider,David Mandarich,David Siegel,David Steel,Ferd Belz,Frank Schultz and Scott Wylie,Janice Sinden,Maria Garcia Berry,Mark Goodman,Michael Hancock,Norm Franke,Pat Hamill,Ray Baker,Ray Pittman,Robert Cohen,Roger Hutson,Stanton Dodge,Steve Farber,Susan Daggett,Ted Brown,Walter & Christie Isenberg,Wayne Barrett,Wendy Aiello", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is bringing together powerful movers and shakers for a fundraiser Wednesday night as he seek re-election.", "title": "High-powered supporters come together for Michael Hancock", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/02/24/high-powered-supporters-come-together-denver-mayor-michael-hancock/117409/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2011/08/20110624__Michael-Hancockp1_200.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is bringing together powerful movers and shakers for a fundraiser Wednesday night as he seek re-election.", "title": "High-powered supporters come together to support Denver Mayor Michael Hancock", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/02/24/high-powered-supporters-come-together-denver-mayor-michael-hancock/117409/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2011/08/20110624__Michael-Hancockp1_200.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is bringing together powerful movers and shakers for a fundraiser Wednesday night as he seek re-election."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06f4\"", "article_summary": "Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is bringing together a big group of powerful movers and shakers, some of them potentially masked, for a fundraiser Wednesday night.\n(Hancock also hails from that corner of the city, having represented it on the City Council for two terms.)\nBefore joining his administration, Sinden was a high-powered connector as the leader of Colorado Concern, a group that represents prominent business leaders.\nLast fall, Hancock disputed Siegel\u2019s account in a letter that quickly became public, noting that \u201cFrontier ceased communication months ago\u201d during incentive-development talks.\nHe has four opponents (down from five after a recent withdrawal), but none have raised any money of note or given Hancock reason to sweat."}
