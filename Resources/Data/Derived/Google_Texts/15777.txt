I was shocked by the cartoon in the opinion section of the Sunday Register [May 18]. I have valued my care at the VA hospitals since I found during a retirement disability physical in 1993 that I had been exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. No insurance company would touch me with a 10-foot pool. No doctors outside the VA hospitals understood Agent Orange exposure.

For 21 years, I have received excellent care for numerous conditions that mainly relate to Agent Orange exposure. When I had knee replacement surgery, my wife said that I had received the best care at the hospital. Sure there are mistakes made at times, but nothing like what happens in many civilian hospitals.

Three wars have overloaded our VA hospitals. At the same time, Congress has refused to increase funds for added staff. Most recently President Obama sent a bill forward to add 27 new clinics to help with the VA overload. Guess what? Every Republican senator voted against the bill.

In the great majority of the cases, the VA hospitals give us wonderful, dependable care. If Congress is going to continue to send our military members to war, then let them also acknowledge that we come home with numerous medical problems and we deserved the care the understaffed VA hospitals strive everyday to give us.
