Burwell decision, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the federal health benefits exchange can provide Obamacare premium subsidies. Given this, it may be time for Colorado officials to shut down the Colorado exchange and let people use the federal one.\n\nIn 2012, the Colorado exchange predicted that its 2015-2018 expenditures would be $22 to $26 million. The exchange\u2019s 2015-2016 Strategic Plan and Budget now predicts operating expenses of $53 million in fiscal year 2015 alone. Going forward, operating expenses are predicted to be about $45 million a year with 78 employees. By the end of 2015, the exchange will have also consumed over $272 million in public start-up funds.\n\nThe budget projects deficits of $4.5 million in FY 2016 and $3.7 million in FY 2018. In 2016, planned revenues will come from an administrative fee of 3.5 percent of premiums for all policies sold in the exchange, a Broad Market Assessment fee of $1.80 per member per month on every insurer in the state, and $2.5 million in funding from Colorado Medicaid.\n\nIn 2015, two items will account for an estimated 20 percent of the Colorado exchange\u2019s operating budget. An enrollment \u201cassistance network\u201d of nonprofits will receive $6 million for producing far fewer enrollments than insurance brokers, and the exchange will spend $4.8 million advertising its monopoly.\n\nIf Colorado moves to the federal exchange, people who use it to buy policies would still pay the 3.5 percent administrative fee. Everyone else would be relieved of the $19 million-plus in \u201cfees\u201d levied on every policy in the state. Colorado Medicaid might save $2.5 million.\n\nThough Colorado exchange costs are higher than predicted, its benefits are lower. When the exchange hired Gruber and Associates to predict enrollment in 2011, officials estimated that 470,000 lives would be covered by subsidized policies in 2016.\n\nAs of June 2015, only 126,159 people had paid a first month\u2019s premium for exchange health insurance. Of that number, just 72,000 were eligible for federally subsidized policies when they applied.\n\nThe Spark Institute surveyed 6,068 people who purchased coverage through the Colorado exchange in the first half of 2014. Only 10 percent of them reported being previously uninsured. If correct, it means that the Colorado exchange has covered between 7,200 and 13,000 previously uninsured people, less than 2 percent of the Coloradans said to have been uninsured prior to Obamacare.\n\nMost of the people receiving the subsidized policies used them to replace private coverage. In the exchange\u2019s 2014 Annual Report, \u201cLibby and her husband\u201d say they were previously insured through Colorado\u2019s public employee retirement plan. But the subsidized PERA coverage \u201cwas expensive.\u201d Thanks to the exchange, she \u201ccan see my doctors without paying a fortune.\u201d\n\nColorado exchange performance remains poor. In 2014, the State Auditor found serious deficiencies in exchange financial controls, including at least $15 million in contract overpayments.\n\nColorado Public Radio reported that 10 percent of those who buy coverage through the exchange end up stuck in bureaucratic snarls that take months to unravel.\n\nThis year, 9News reported that the software canceled 3,600 policies when people browsed other plans. After denying that the exchange knew about the problem, exchange representatives said that they knew about it but \u201cdidn\u2019t think that it would happen and happen at this level with this group of people.\u201d\n\nCompared to the exchange, the state\u2019s high-risk pool, CoverColorado, was a bargain. When it closed at the end of 2013 it covered enrollment and subsidies for 13,670 people with uninsurable pre-existing conditions\u2014with 8.5 full-time equivalent employees at a total annual cost of $57 million.\n\nColorado exchange advocates should explain, in detail, why Colorado taxpayers need to continue subsidizing a costly underperformer. Switching to the federal exchange would provide the same subsidies without new taxes on everyone\u2019s health coverage.\n\nLinda Gorman is health care policy center director at the Independence Institute, a free market think tank in Denver.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Compared to the exchange, the state\u2019s high-risk pool, CoverColorado, was a bargain.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.6", "og": {"site_name": "Complete Colorado - Page Two", "description": "Compared to the exchange, the state\u2019s high-risk pool, CoverColorado, was a bargain.", "title": "Colorado\u2019s Obamacare exchange spends big for little new coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/stethescopemoney6.jpg", "height": 1097}, "url": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/2015/07/23/colorados-obamacare-exchange-spends-big-for-little-new-coverage/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 221004171379840}, "keywords": "Colorado healh exchange,King v.
