And I think he\u2019ll treasure that time together with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd plus, do you think he could actually get through the Senate, that can\u2019t even give him the carte blanche to do a few things that everybody agrees that are necessary?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaybe Eric Holder . . . Nah, they probably wouldn\u2019t let him through either.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut both of them would be great choices,\u201d Dyson added, pointing his finger convincingly at the camera.\n\nObama is currently being sued by the House of Representatives for unconstitutionally changing vast portions of the Affordable Care Act after its passage by Congress in 2010. (RELATED: Republicans Expected To Approve Lawsuit Against Obama This Week)\n\n\n\nMany legal analysts also claim Obama violated the constitutional separation of powers by unilaterally changing immigration and drug laws and bombing Libya without congressional authority \u2014 although these issues have yet to be litigated.\n\nHolder was held in contempt of Congress in 2012 for withholding investigative documents, refusing to prosecute Black Panthers for threatening voters and presided over the targeting and labeling of Fox News reporter James Rosen as a \u201cco-conspirator\u201d to espionage.
