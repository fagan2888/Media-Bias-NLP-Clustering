Burwell.\n\nIn a ruling expected in June, the high court could bar the federally run insurance marketplace from providing the subsidies in at least 34 states.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend the Affordable Care Act allows subsidies to be distributed only through state-based exchanges. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia set up their own exchanges from October 2013.\n\nThe subsidies are available to people making between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. They can reduce insurance premiums dramatically - cutting them by 76 percent on average for people who picked an insurance plan on the federal exchange or on one of two state-based plans, the GAO said.\n\nNearly 11.7 million people have either signed up or re-enrolled for insurance coverage under the U.S. healthcare reform law. The GAO said about 16 percent of non-elderly adults remain uninsured.\n\n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Andre Grenon)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Susan Cornwell", "Author": "Susan Cornwell", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Early evidence suggests that the tax credit subsidies at the core of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law likely helped expand U.S. health insurance coverage last year, Congress's non-partisan research arm said on Monday.", "title": "Obamacare subsidies likely expanded insurance coverage: report", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150323&t=2&i=1034775007&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB2M0YF", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
