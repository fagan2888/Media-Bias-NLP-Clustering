But Cover Oregon offers a microcosm of the market in general, brokers and agents say.\n\nMore than 81,000 people went through through Cover Oregon \u2013 either through paper or electronic applications\u2014to select a private health plan. Of those, 5,000 have already cancelled policies or been terminated for lack of payment. Thousands more have not yet paid their first-month's premiums, meaning their have not completed their enrollment, according to carriers.\n\nCover Oregon allowed consumers with qualifying incomes to access tax credits and other subsidies. Moda Health dominated sales through the exchange, with 40,000 policies sold covering about 55,000 people, including dependents.\n\nModa spokesman Jonathan Nicholas said \"more than 80 percent\" of people who used Cover Oregon have paid their first premium, but declined to be more specific.\n\nOther insurers gave ratios ranging between 66 percent to 80 percent of consumers who followed through with payments.\n\nFor instance, people used Cover Oregon to buy 1,500 PacificSource policies but of those only 992 have so far paid their first month's premiums.\n\nSome carriers give consumers until the day before their effective date to pay. Others consider them nominally enrolled, but don't pay claims until the first premium is received.\n\nLettenmaier said consumers need to check their billings, or call their carrier immediately to find out how long a grace period they have to pay their first month's premium. She recently had a customer respond one day late-- and now his family has to resort to short-term insurance, which does not prevent a federal tax penalty or cover pre-existing conditions.\n\nOnce the first month's premium is paid and the policy is in place, under the Affordable Care Act consumers will have a much longer grace period \u2013 90 days\u2014to reinstate insurance after failing to pay.\n\nBut if consumers don't pay that first month's premiums, they have a problem. Aside from certain exceptions, under the new federal law \"there are no second chances\" until the open enrollment begins again, Lettenmaier said.\n\n--Nick Budnick", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "cover oregon,health exchange,health reform", "title": "Thousands have not paid premiums for Cover Oregon health policies, placing coverage at risk", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Thousands have not paid premiums for Cover Oregon health policies, placing coverage at risk\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/05/thousands_have_not_paid_premiu.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/hillsboro_news/photo/13914651-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12928896\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-15T23:59:53Z\", \"author\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@breaking-news\",\"@finance\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@politics\",\"@topstories-olive\",\"cover oregon\",\"health exchange\",\"health reform\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@oregonlive", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/hillsboro_news/photo/13914651-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Even people who Cover Oregon considers enrolled are not unless they pay their first month's premium, and thousands have not.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@NickBudnick"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, May 15, 2014,  8:30 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/hillsboro_news/photo/coverorfair-23169825jpg-63649a8d42689e3f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"nbudnick\", \"author_nickname\": \"Nick Budnick | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"9643439\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health & Fitness News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Even people who Cover Oregon considers enrolled are not unless they pay their first month's premium, and thousands have not.", "title": "Thousands have not paid premiums for Cover Oregon health policies, placing coverage at risk", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/05/thousands_have_not_paid_premiu.html", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_olive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, May 15, 2014,  4:58 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Even people who Cover Oregon considers enrolled are not unless they pay their first month's premium, and thousands have not."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1100\"", "article_summary": "That applies not only to Cover Oregon policies, but policies purchased directly from carriers as well.\nA large number of people who've signed up for private health insurers through the Cover Oregon health insurance exchange have not paid their first month's premiums, meaning they are at risk of going without coverage through November.\nFor instance, people used Cover Oregon to buy 1,500 PacificSource policies but of those only 992 have so far paid their first month's premiums.\nMore than 81,000 people went through through Cover Oregon \u2013 either through paper or electronic applications\u2014to select a private health plan.\nBut Cover Oregon offers a microcosm of the market in general, brokers and agents say."}
