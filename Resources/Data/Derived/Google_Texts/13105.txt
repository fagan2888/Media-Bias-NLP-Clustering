BRUNSWICK, Maine — The Coastal Humane Society is making some very special deliveries this Christmas.

Their goal was to adopt out 35 puppies from Georgia to new families right here in Maine. Three of them were delivered as special gifts for Christmas Day.

Heather Straz is a volunteer at the Coastal Humane Society.

Today, working as a part-time elf, she made some special deliveries and surprised 6-year-old Cameron, who has wanted a puppy.

His dad says this is what Christmas is all about.

“This one’s been in need of this for a long time so we decided to take advantage of it and the whole Christmas delivery thing made it all the more special,” Sean Kirby said. “Just a kid that needed a dog.”

This was the first year of the puppy delivery program.

The elf CBS 13 spoke to said she thinks it was a success.
