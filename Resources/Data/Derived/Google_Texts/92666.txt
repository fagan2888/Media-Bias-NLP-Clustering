I posted earlier about how Elisabeth Hasselbeck cast truth aside in order to attack President Obama and fear monger about Obamacare last night. The day before, she went after her fellow Americans who aren't as fortunate as she to make the big bucks lying and smearing on television. Hasselbeck “asked," “Do these folks really need to be on welfare?” Then, after a clip of a few welfare recipients telling Fox’s John Stossel that they have air conditioning and cable TV, she praised his reporting for “exposing the ugly side of entitlements.”

Smearing the poor is a regular Fox News activity, as regular readers know. Clearly, Hasselbeck is fitting right in. With her dress hiked mid-thigh, she leaned forward and said eagerly to Stossel during the interview that followed, “If you’re in 35 states, though, the actual – the minimum wage there is less than what you can make being on welfare. So the motivation to go get a job is almost non-existent.”

We have already debunked that particular fiction. But even if she were telling the truth, it’s revealing that Hasselbeck used it to suggest that welfare recipients get too much money (for nothing). Nobody mentioned that, as News Hound Christopher put it in his post on the subject, the stat could be “an indictment of our abysmal minimum wage, which has depreciated over time both in real dollars and in payment per productivity.”

Co-host Steve Doocy and Stossel piled on. “Once upon a time there was some shame to it,” Doocy said, referring to accepting government assistance.

Stossel added, “I joined the chorus that said, ‘It’s not right that these people, who through no fault of their own need help and we’re shaming them. That’s terrible.’ But it’s grown from that to this entitlement.”

Apparently, Fox News is longing for those good old days when we can go back to shaming and smearing people in need and be proud of it!
