The Des Moines Register reported (http://dmreg.co/1Q13JaY ) that the ruling is considered a \u201cproposed decision,\u201d and it\u2019s unclear how it will affect plans to let WellCare and three other companies take over running Iowa\u2019s $4.2 billion Medicaid program beginning Jan. 1.\n\nIowa Department of Administrative Services Director Janet Phipps is expected to review the decision.\n\nThe ruling said WellCare should have disclosed information early to state officials about fraud or mismanagement involving former executives.\n\n\u201cWithout this information, they could not exercise reasoned judgment as to whether WellCare\u2019s failure to disclose these events in its initial response was an intentional or material omission,\u201d Scase wrote.\n\nWellCare officials said in a statement it will challenge the ruling.\n\n\u201cWellCare strongly disagrees with Judge Scase\u2019s recommended order,\u201d spokeswoman Crystal Walker said. \u201cWe intend to bring its erroneous conclusions to Director Phipps\u2019 attention and urge that she uphold the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 contract awards.\u201d\n\nGov. Terry Branstad said in a statement Wednesday the ruling allows the privatization plans to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe continue to evaluate the next steps in the administrative review of the procurement process and remain on schedule to implement our plan on January 1, 2016.\u201d\n\nRoughly 560,000 people are enrolled in Iowa\u2019s Medicaid program, which provides care to poor children, families and disabled people, as well as some low-income adults. It is funded with state and federal dollars.\n\nPlans to switch to private care on Jan. 1 have been challenged by some Democratic lawmakers, who argue the state isn\u2019t ready. Branstad said the move will save the state money and offer better care to patients.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "An administrative law judge has recommended that the state of Iowa throw out one of four contracts awarded to private companies set to take over the state's Medicaid program in January, a move that challenges whether plans to switch oversight can remain on schedule.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/26/judge-recommends-iowa-throw-out-1of-4-medicaid-con/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "An administrative law judge has recommended that the state of Iowa throw out one of four contracts awarded to private companies set to take over the state\u2019s Medicaid program in January, a move that challenges whether plans to switch oversight can remain on schedule.", "title": "Judge recommends Iowa throw out 1of 4 Medicaid contracts"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "An administrative law judge has recommended that the state of Iowa throw out one of four contracts awarded to private companies set to take over the state's Medicaid program in January, a move that ch", "card": "summary", "title": "Judge recommends Iowa throw out 1of 4 Medicaid contracts"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Judge Christie Scase said in a ruling Wednesday that Iowa should reverse its contract with Florida-based WellCare.\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - An administrative law judge has recommended that the state of Iowa throw out one of four contracts awarded to private companies set to take over the state\u2019s Medicaid program in January, a move that challenges whether plans to switch oversight can remain on schedule.\n___Information from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com\nThe ruling said WellCare should have disclosed information early to state officials about fraud or mismanagement involving former executives.\nIowa Department of Administrative Services Director Janet Phipps is expected to review the decision."}
