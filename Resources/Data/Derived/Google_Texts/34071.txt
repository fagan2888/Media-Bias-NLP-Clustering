It was good to see the breakdown of the Boeing tax breaks and their effects in Washington in your paper. A $305 million tax break incentive to a company that brought $13 billion to the state coffers is obviously a good investment. Government and business need to work together, like they do in Germany. Government is a business! But it relies on other people's money and is run by non-business types. We compete with other states for business. If we don't want jobs leaving the state, then we need to make it attractive for business to operate here instead of taxing them out of here. A no-brainer.And if you think taxes aren't high enough here, just ask anyone who is retiring and selling their home or land. They will tell you they have to pay 25 percent of their lifetime savings (which they have paid real estate taxes on their whole lives already) in capital gains taxes thanks to the end of the Bush tax cuts and the 4 percent Obamacare provisions added onto the already horrific 20 percent rates, in order to provide a whole lot of people with a whole lot of “free stuff.”My case rests.Monroe
