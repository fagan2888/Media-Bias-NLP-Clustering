Having the always-loquacious Terrance Knighton apparently wasn\u2019t enough, and now that former Jacksonville teammate Jeremy Mincey has caught on with the Broncos, it\u2019s hard to imagine there\u2019s a funnier unit with more to say anywhere in the NFL.\n\nMincey spoke to the Denver media for the first time Wednesday after signing with the team Tuesday. Barely more than week removed from being cut by the Jaguars, he\u2019s already fitting in with the Broncos.\n\nHere\u2019s an opportunity to get to know Mincey \u2014 and his big personality \u2014 a little better.\n\nQ: I was clicking around on the Internet before meeting you and I found a lot about your interest in music. Has that always been your thing?\n\nA: Music has always been a part of me. My best friend, J. Dash, sings the song \u201cWop,\u201d the one Miley Cyrus (twerked) to. That\u2019s my best friend. We went to the University of Florida together, and we lived in the same dorm. We were roommates. We used to record music in the dorms all the time. It was always a part of me, ever since I was a young child. That\u2019s what (J. Dash and I) bonded over. I was the athlete and he was the artist. He stuck with it, and I would do it every now and then, and it was fun. Eventually I took it serious and opened Mr. Mince Productions, which is a premium recording studio in downtown Jacksonville. We\u2019re getting to a lot of major artists, who stop through.\n\nQ: What are you going to do with the studio now that you\u2019re in Denver?\n\nA: It\u2019s a company, so I have people running it for me. J. Dash moved on to sell 1.5 million records. That\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s just like here, destiny.\n\nQ: You keep mentioning destiny. Does that have to do with getting a chance to win?\n\nA: I just want to win. It\u2019s year eight (for me in the NFL). The clock\u2019s ticking. It\u2019s ticking, and I\u2019m a winner, man. I know I haven\u2019t reflected that on the field, but you see me try.\n\nQ: What was your weekend like, between getting cut and signing with a new team?\n\nA: I celebrated my birthday. That was my 30th birthday. I got cut on my birthday. (Mincey actually was cut Dec. 13. His birthday is Dec. 14.) No, but it was good. I had time to celebrate. The funny thing about it is, Jacksonville signed me on my birthday my rookie year. It\u2019s crazy. Everything happens for a reason.\n\nQ: I know other teams expressed interest in you. Did you visit anywhere else or did you just come straight to Denver?\n\nA: Nope. My agent called me, said Denver was the first team that called, and after that, I was coming. They have a lot of great players here and a real chance. We had a lot of opportunities, but I chose Denver because I know this is a special city. The fans, the people. The fans love the player. The fans are very involved in what\u2019s going on here, and I\u2019m a fan of fans.\n\nQ: So are you just living out of one bag now?\n\nA: I got one bag of stuff. The rest is coming later. I have to go to the shopping mall and try to figure something out.\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joanniesen\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Each Sunday, The Denver Post\u2019s Broncos reporters help readers get to know the players on a more personal level.\n\nAbout Jeremy Mincey\n\n1998-2001: Played at Statesboro (Ga.)
