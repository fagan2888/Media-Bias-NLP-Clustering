The Panama City Jaycees are helping less fortunate kids have the Christmas of their dreams.

Volunteers took more than 100 kids to Target on a shopping spree Saturday morning.

"We do thousands of hours of volunteer work all year long. These four hours are what you work so hard for so you can watch the kids enjoy shopping for Christmas," Will Hancock, Jaycees Chairman.

The kids were given $75 each to buy anything they wanted from Target.

"It's really moving," Hancock said. "You know I'm not that type of person, but when I see it I get moved by it. It's one of those things where if it can move me it can move anybody."

While the kids just had their eyes on the presents, their parents were thankful for the opportunity to buy necessities.

"For these people to volunteer their time for these kids and stuff is very important," Gary LaPlant.

Hancock, "That's what it's all about just making them happy and seeing the smiles on their faces."

The Panama City Jaycees have been organizing the shopping tour for more than 20 years using money raised at the haunted house and Christmas parade.

Every year, family services sends the Jaycees a list of needy families.

Their goal is to help every child on that list.
