Haggen will open its first two grocery stores Tuesday in Ventura County after it completes the conversion of Albertsons stores in Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village.

The Washington state-based supermarket bought, and is converting, nine area Vons and Albertsons stores to its name.

The first stores to transform will be the Albertsons at 1736 Avenida De Los Arboles in Thousand Oaks, and the Albertsons at 5770 Lindero Canyon Road in Westlake Village.

The plan is as follows:

At 6 p.m. Sunday, both Albertsons stores will close.

At 12:01 a.m. Monday, Haggen will take ownership and begin making its changes. Pharmacies at the two stores will be open that day, but not until late morning, approximately 11 a.m.

At an undetermined time in the afternoon of April 21, the stores will reopen as Haggen markets.

A similar course of action will happen for the remaining stores. The following is a list of those stores and their conversion dates:

• Albertsons at 5135 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley — April 23

• Albertsons at 2800 Cochran St., Simi Valley, — April 23

• Albertsons at 2400 Las Posas Road, Camarillo — April 24

• Vons at 660 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley — April 25

• Albertsons at 920 N. Ventura Road, Oxnard — June 6

• Albertsons at 7800 Telegraph Road, Ventura — June 16

• Vons at 2100 Newbury Road, Newbury Park — June 28

Keep in mind that those dates could change. Haggen Pacific Southwest CEO Bill Shaner has indicated that scheduling for store conversions is in a state of flux.

He said the company has 146 stores to handle and “we may need to adjust the time line or change store conversion dates to address any issues that arise, including licensing or permitting; city, county, state regulations; systems issues; and so on. Our goal is to have as smooth a transition as possible for our teams and our guests.”

Haggen has begun installing its banners and merchandise at some of the other stores it acquired in December, which are in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

An Albertsons in Monroe, Washington, on Feb. 12 became the first store to change.

Haggen prides itself on being a leader in the movement to buy from local sources and plans to announce regional and local distributors.
