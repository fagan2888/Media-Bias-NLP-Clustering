Painful lessons are learned over the years but over time are unlearned and have to be relearned.

For example, a professor of mine, Rex Tugwell, in his biography of Franklin Roosevelt, stated that the Glass-Steagall Banking Act “made quite unlikely that bankers in partnership with speculators could again being on such a debacle as had occurred in 1929.” Unfortunately, in the late 1990s, Congress and the White House undid the firewall and the financial disaster erupting in 2007 took place. As my dad liked to say, “We’re too soon old and too late smart.”

Another area where we allow ourselves to be suckered is hysteria about domestic “enemies.” In 1798 we had the Alien and Sedition Acts. During World War I, we overreacted with the Espionage and Sedition laws. On the eve of World War II, we had the Smith Act (misnamed the “Alien Registration Act”). During the Civil War and the Cold War, from time to time, some in our government confused heresy with conspiracy.

A third illustration: Despite the failure of Prohibition in the 1920s, by the 1970s the nation embarked on a “war on drugs.” We should have recognized from the earlier effort at eradication that the result would be a surge in imprisonments and increased profitability for the law-breakers. (as well as venality by some law enforcers and disrespect for the drug laws by those who don’t consider that their behavior should be considered as criminal.)
