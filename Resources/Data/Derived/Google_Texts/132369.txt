Joseph Walsh, the father of Chance Walsh, was transferred from Jasper County Jail in South Carolina during the evening hours on Sunday.

ABC7 confirmed through the jail that he will be extradited back to Sarasota County, but the date had yet to be determined.

Chance's mother Kristen Bury was in a Sarasota County courtroom Saturday morning to face charges of neglect and first-degree murder in the death of Chance. It was revealed that she and Joseph Walsh told detectives where to find Chance's body.

Walsh was arrested, along with Bury, on October 6 in Ridgeport, South Carolina.

Walsh should be making his appearance at the Sarasota County Jail sometime in the near future.
