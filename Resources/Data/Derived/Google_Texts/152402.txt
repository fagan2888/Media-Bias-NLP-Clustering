PERRY â€” With Santa Fe Trail moving to the Pioneer League this year, the rivalry between Perry-Lecompton and the Chargers hits a hiatus with the programs not scheduled to face each other.

To make up for that a bit, the Kaws and Chargers met on the field Saturday night in the form of an alumni game. Roughly 40 past players from each school met in Perry as part of a growing program initiated by Alumni Football USA.

The first alumni game in Kansas to be held between two schools gave former players a chance to relive their high school days and take the field one more time.

The event served as a fundraiser for both programs, as the teams split the $10 admission per person.
