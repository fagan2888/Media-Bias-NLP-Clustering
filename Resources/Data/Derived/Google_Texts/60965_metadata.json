The insurer disclosed in late February that the breach had impacted more people than previously believed \u2014 including about 70 million current and former customers and employees.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthem defended the company's response to the data breach. Because the company expected a lengthy process to inform all of the impacted customers, it set up a website and a hotline for customers.\n\n\"Over the last few days, we have also accelerated our member notification mailings. Approximately 2.4 million letters are mailed daily.
