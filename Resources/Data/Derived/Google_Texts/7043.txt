Sioux Falls, SD

Tens of thousands filled the downtown streets of KELOLAND's largest city today to show their appreciation for the arts.

Downtown Sioux Falls hosted the 51st Sidewalk Arts Festival today, welcoming a variety of booths and vendors to the streets around the Washington Pavilion.

The event brings in money for the Pavilion's Visual Arts Center. The funds help the Pavilion's arts education outreach program which takes the delivers the arts to students who otherwise might not experience them.

“We go out to over 20 schools, and we reach anywhere from kindergarten all the way through high school, and we have a fantastic team of teachers that go out and connect with the kids,” Director of Public Relations Michele Wellman said.

Over 200 vendors sold something for everyone, from neon signs and soap to German roasted nuts, custom jewelry, pottery and photography.

Tonight at 10:00 we'll take a closer look at two of the festival's vendors and meet some people who took in the sights.
