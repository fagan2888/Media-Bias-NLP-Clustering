It did so by proposing to tighten up on the so-called special enrollment periods, or SEPs, that allowed individuals to enroll in health plans outside the once-a-year open-enrollment window, and asking insurers to submit comments and data on the proposal.\n\nWe haven't seen any comments laying out systematic abuse. \u2014 Laurel Lucia, healthcare program manager at UC Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education\n\nMost big insurers submitted comments, as did AHIP, the health insurance industry's trade group. None that I reviewed offered any empirical data -- just blanket assertions that people are gaming the system.\n\nThis has become an article of faith and a core complaint among insurers. The indispensable Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net posted a good update on the controversy on Tuesday. My skeptical take on the complaints appeared in December.\n\nSince then, nothing has emerged to give substance to the insurers' complaints. \"We haven't seen any comments laying out systematic abuse,\" said Laurel Lucia, healthcare program manager at UC Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education.\n\nInstead, she argues in a recent article on the blog Health Affairs, the evidence points in the opposite direction -- that the majority of individuals eligible for SEPs aren't taking advantage of them. Many of them are relatively young and healthy, so the result is that a disproportionate number of SEP enrollees are sicker than the general population. That's exactly the trend that insurers should want to avoid.\n\nThe indications are that the insurers are wrongly treating SEPs as their enemy, when they should be trying to make them work better.\n\nIndeed, some of the comments filed with HHS about SEPs seemed to be flagrant exaggerations of the problem. Aetna, for example, argued that slack enforcement of SEPs \"poses significant threats [sic] to the viability of the risk pool.\" The company counted \"40+ SEPs for on-exchange coverage,\" which \"leave individuals with little incentive to enroll in coverage during open enrollment, since they can wait until they are sick ... and drop coverage immediately after receiving services.\"\n\nIs this plausible? To begin with, it's hard to see how Aetna came up with more than 40 SEPs, unless it's slicing them very thin. Aetna didn't list them, and my generous examination of those listed by the government, treating every minor variation as a separate SEP, still came up in the mid-20s. (Is \"gain or become a dependent due to to a child support or other court order\" one SEP? Two? Four?)\n\nThe truth is that the SEPs fall into a handful of well-understood categories. These include \"life events\" such as getting married or divorced; becoming or gaining a dependent via birth, adoption or placement in foster care; or losing a job and the coverage that came with it. The qualifying events unique to the Affordable Care Act or other government assistance programs include becoming a U.S. citizen, moving to a new state or sometimes within a state, or experiencing a change of income that makes one newly eligible or ineligible for government subsidies. The government also allows special enrollments if a conventional enrollment was screwed up through no fault of the enrollee.\n\nSome of these categories are expansive, but not all of them are entirely under the consumer's control, and for Aetna to argue that they cover so many people that it leaves \"little incentive to enroll in coverage during open enrollment\" is simply preposterous.\n\nAetna must think the entire country consists of people plotting how to get a quickie marriage or divorce or have a baby just in case they get sick. The vast majority of SEPs cover a relatively trivial number of cases, unless you think there are hordes of people applying to become members of a Native American tribe after they get sick.\n\nThe insurers typically assert that an inordinately high percentage of new customers are coming in through special enrollment periods -- as many as 20%, by some reckonings -- and that those customers are unusually heavy users of medical services, especially in the first months after enrollment. That indicates \"'buying to use' behavior,\" the giant insurer Anthem said in its statement to HHS.\n\nchurn Kaiser Family Foundation Nothing new to see here, folks: Churn has long been a feature of the individual health insurance market, despite insurers' claims that it's a post-Obamacare phenomenon.

(Kaiser Family Foundation) (Kaiser Family Foundation)\n\nBut that's far from clear, Lucia said. She noted that the individual insurance market always has been subject to short enrollments and heavy \"churn\"; a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2014 found that of people covered by individual policies in January 2010, only 62% still had that coverage by July and fewer than half were still on it after two years. The reason is that many people used it just as a bridge to employer-sponsored insurance or a government program such as Medicare.
