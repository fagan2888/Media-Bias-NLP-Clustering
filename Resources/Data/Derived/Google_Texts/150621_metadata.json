Jay Nixon (D) rejected a measure on Wednesday that would have required women to wait three full days before being allowed to have an abortion procedure. His veto prevents Missouri from joining Utah and South Dakota, which are the only two states in the nation that currently have a 72-hour abortion waiting period on the books.\n\nReproductive rights advocates have been urging Nixon to veto the proposed waiting period ever since the GOP-controlled legislature sent it to his desk in May. It wasn\u2019t clear exactly how the governor \u2014 who has approved some abortion restrictions in the past \u2014 would come down on the measure. But on Wednesday, Nixon explained that he couldn\u2019t approve the bill because it\u2019s unnecessary in light of his state\u2019s existing 24-hour waiting period.\n\n\u201cLengthening the already extensive waiting period serves no demonstrable purpose other than to create emotional and financial hardships for women who have undoubtedly already spent considerable time wrestling with perhaps the most difficult decision they may ever have to make,\u201d the governor said in a statement. \u201cExpanding the mandatory waiting period presupposes that women are unable to make up their own minds without further government intervention. This is insulting to women, particularly in light of what the law already requires.\u201d\n\nNixon also pointed out the measure demonstrates a \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for women\u2019s well being by failing to include an exception for victims of rape and incest \u2014 which means that women who become pregnant through those crimes would be put through a potentially emotionally damaging wait before they\u2019re allowed to end the pregnancy. \u201cIt victimizes these women by prolonging their grief and their nightmare,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why hundreds of Missouri residents have been protesting the proposed 72-hour waiting period for months. When the measure first came up for consideration, women delayed their testimony against it for 72 hours to make the point that\u2019s a totally arbitrary amount of time. And once the bill started making its way through the legislature, activists held a 72-hour \u201ccitizen\u2019s filibuster\u201d to speak out against lawmakers\u2019 attempt to impose additional barriers to women\u2019s health care services in a state that has just one abortion clinic left.\n\nReproductive health advocates are celebrating Nixon\u2019s veto, pointing out that it demonstrates he was listening to the protesters who made their opinions known about the legislation. \u201cMissourians of all stripes spoke out against this bill and refused to back down, from the women who camped out for three days and nights at the State Capitol to thousands of people who used Twitter to hold politicians accountable for trying to take away a woman\u2019s right to make her own medical decisions,\u201d Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in response to Wednesday\u2019s news.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that the Missouri legislature will try to override Nixon\u2019s veto of the legislation, a tactic that Republicans in the state often employ to attempt to circumvent the governor. An override would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers. Opponents of the legislation say there\u2019s no telling exactly how that vote will go, and there\u2019s a chance that lawmakers won\u2019t be able to pull it off \u2014 something that\u2019s happened before with attempts to override vetoes of measures related to tax cuts and gun regulations.\n\nIn sharp contrast to Missouri, several other states enacted further restrictions on their residents\u2019 abortion rights this week. New anti-abortion laws took effect at the beginning of July in states like Alabama, Mississippi, and Indiana.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Lengthening the already extensive waiting period serves no demonstrable purpose other than to create emotional and financial hardships for women,\" Gov.
