Chad Gainey spends his days teaching agriculture at Holmes County High School, but in his spare time he revs up his chainsaw.

"I was doing a what you'd call a small stunt tree, where there's a standing tree, that's been killed by, a various number of things. Instead of taking the stump down, I can come in and carve and turn it into a piece of artwork," said Chad Gainey, Chainsaw Carver.

For the past three years, Gainey has been carving everything from owls to this Sasquatch, which got the attention of many NewsChannel 7 viewers.

"We've had just about nonstop traffic. People taking pictures with it, or just coming by to check the progress, and then bringing friends by to when they're in town," said Zachary Basinger, Neighbor.

"You know I'm not gonna stop and mess with a guy dealing with a chainsaw, so I stood a pretty good distance, but it looked really good. So I've seen him do some work, and its pretty impressive. I don't know how he does it."

The length of time to create the pieces vary, with Sasquatch being completed in about two days.

Along with selling his pieces, Gainey showcases much of his work in carving competitions and farmers markets.

"I mainly would say I specialize in, I guess, coastal stuff, coastal art. I do a lot of saltwater fish, marlins, mahi-mahi, shellfish. I try to , try to focus on the localized stuff."

Gainey's next project is creating a mermaid.

He is also preparing to create a masterpiece for a competition in October.
