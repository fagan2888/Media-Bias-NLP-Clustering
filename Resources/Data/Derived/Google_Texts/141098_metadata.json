Its economic and social programs drastically reduced poverty, created universal healthcare, and promoted widespread literacy and education. Compared to its Latin American neighbors, Venezuela has consistently led the region in reducing poverty.\n\nIn recent years, the Venezuelan economy has faced turbulence and rising inflation. Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, and the rapid drop in the price of oil has hit it particularly hard.\n\nThe opposition, which blames the government\u2019s left-wing policies for the instability, has capitalized on the turmoil. Supporters of the government, on the other hand, say powerful business oligarchs, corporations, and foreign governments \u2014 especially the U.S. \u2014 have pursued policies of economic sabotage in Venezuela. This view is supported by the information revealed in U.S. government documents released by WikiLeaks.\n\nAfter the election, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 who was elected after the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013 \u2014 lamented in a televised address, \u201cI can say today that the economic war has triumphed.\u201d\n\nThe electoral victory marks the first time a right-wing government will rule Venezuela in this century.\n\nAlthough Venezuela\u2019s democratically elected socialist government has been widely characterized by the right wing as a \u201cdictatorship,\u201d in 2012, former President Jimmy Carter \u2014 who won a Nobel prize for his international election-monitoring work through the Carter Center \u2014 remarked, \u201cAs a matter of fact, of the 92 elections that we\u2019ve monitored, I would say that the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.\u201d\n\nUnder the PSUV, Venezuela has been known for its harsh criticism of U.S. foreign policy. In 2006, President Ch\u00e1vez called George W. Bush a \u201cdevil\u201d in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, in comments met with applause from the audience. Ch\u00e1vez also referred to President Bush as a \u201cdonkey.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. tried to help topple Venezuela's elected leftist government in 2002; now the right wing won an election", "title": "13 years after foiled U.S.-backed coup, right-wing opposition wins Venezuela election", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The U.S. tried to help topple Venezuela's elected leftist government in 2002; now the right wing won an election", "title": "13 years after foiled U.S.-backed coup, right-wing opposition wins Venezuela election", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/07/13_years_after_foiled_u_s_backed_coup_right_wing_opposition_wins_venezuela_election/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/venezuela-elections.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. tried to help topple Venezuela's elected leftist government in 2002; now the right wing won an election", "title": "13 years after foiled U.S.-backed coup, right-wing opposition wins Venezuela election", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/venezuela-elections.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ben Norton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: News, Politics NewsVenezuela\u2019s opposition won control of the legislature in the election Sunday, for the first time in almost two decades.\nIn 2006, President Ch\u00e1vez called George W.
