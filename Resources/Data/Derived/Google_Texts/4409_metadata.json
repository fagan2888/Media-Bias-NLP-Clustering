(AP) - A Waterbury woman who helped lead Vermont\u2019s recovery from damage caused by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene was appointed Tuesday to become the state\u2019s next transportation secretary, Gov. Peter Shumlin announced.\n\nSue Minter is currently the deputy secretary of the Vermont Transportation Agency. On Jan. 1 she will succeed Secretary Brian Searles, who is retiring after 40 years of public service.\n\nCurrent Transportation Planning Director Chris Cole will become deputy secretary.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been the team that has worked alongside Brian and all of the hardworking employees of transportation to get us to where we are,\u201d Shumlin said in announcing the changes in front of two state plow trucks waiting for their next storm.\n\n\u201cOur recovery from Irene actually launched us into a new era,\u201d Minter said at a ceremony at the agency\u2019s central garage in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s been a transformational time for our agency. We work as a team like never before, we have strong partnerships throughout state government and at the municipal level.\u201d\n\nVermont also has been working to replace aging bridges, keep up with repaving the state\u2019s roadways and improve the state\u2019s rail system, she said.\n\nMinter, a former Democratic state representative, has been Searles\u2019 deputy since January 2011 when Shumlin first took office. After Irene, Shumlin named her the state\u2019s recovery officer.\n\nSearles previously served as transportation secretary from 1999 to 2003 under former Gov. Howard Dean.\n\nCole previously served a decade as general manager of the Chittenden County Transportation Authority.\n\nSearles said he felt he was leaving the agency in good hands.\n\n\u201cOne can stay in a job like this too long. I\u2019m acutely aware of that,\u201d Searles said. \u201cThe average tenure for secretaries of transportation in Vermont is about three years over the 40-year history of the agency. I\u2019m in my eighth and it\u2019s long enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Waterbury woman who helped lead Vermont's recovery from damage caused by flooding from Tropical Storm Irene was appointed Tuesday to become the state's next transportation secretary, Gov.
