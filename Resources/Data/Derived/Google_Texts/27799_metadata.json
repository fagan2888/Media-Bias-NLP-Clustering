The evaluation process is to be finished by the end of March 2014.\n\nWhether a merger will be part of the discussions is not certain, and further comment from the hospital systems was not available Wednesday, said Scott Gilbert, Penn State Hershey spokesman. \u201cWe are saying we\u2019re excited about the possibility of a collaboration. That\u2019s all we know,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nSmaller health systems are finding that greater size is needed to attain cost efficiencies, bargaining power with insurers and the resources needed to invest in new technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that these two health systems bring complementary strengths to the goals of improving the health status of the population we serve and in delivering more cost effective, high quality and accessible health care services to the region,\u201d said Michael A. Young, president and CEO of PinnacleHealth. Both are \u201cvibrant health systems offering a broad spectrum of health-care services, technologies, research capabilities and facilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn general we are seeing to some degree a trend toward this, of certain affiliations of some type to better meet the needs of their communities,\u201d said Roger Baumgarten, spokesman for the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe potential is there to offer better coordination, greater breadth of care in the affiliated group, with more efficiencies,\u201d Baumgarten said.\n\nAsked what the potential negatives are, Baumgarten cited the Penn State-Geisinger merger of the late 1990s. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out,\u201d he said. The 1997 merger lasted less than three years, with both sides citing a \u201cculture\u201d clash between one entity that focused on research and teaching, and the other on clinical care and the bottom line.\n\n\u201cThere are no guarantees, but they are pursuing it and doing what they feel will be in the best interest of patients and communities,\u201d Baumgarten said.\n\nDr. Harold Paz, Penn State Hershey CEO and dean of the Penn State College of Medicine, said in the announcement that \u201cgiven our past success in working together, it makes sense for us to explore additional opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn September, as Penn State Hershey reported income topping $1.3 billion, with a $112 million margin, Paz said, \u201cWe must be willing to take risks in order to be successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've been tremendously successful in recent years,\u201d Paz said. \u201cBut (we) can't be content to rest on our success.\u201d Paz said he would be looking for $125 million in new revenue and cost savings over the next three years by growing the medical center's market, reducing supply chain costs and increasing staff efficiency.\n\nHealth care mergers and partnerships are trending nationwide, as well as in the midstate, spurred by factors including Affordable Care Act-driven cost controls, declining payments from both private insurers and government payers such as Medicare.\n\nThe latest in the midstate is an affiliation being explored between Geisinger and Holy Spirit health systems, announced in September.\n\nPinnacleHealth System had previously explored merger talks with York-based WellSpan Health, but ended them in 2010. They ended in part due to feedback Pinnacle\u2019s board of directors received from doctors, employees and other stake holders, said a Pinnacle spokesoman Lisa Henry.\n\nPinnacleHealth and Penn State Hershey already have forged several collaborations.\n\nIn 2008 they formed the Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute, which includes a 74-bed hospital and three outpatient practices providing mental health services.\n\nIn 2010, the two organizations signed an affiliation agreement expanding their academic partnership. For more than 10 years, PinnacleHealth hospitals have been a training site for Penn State Hershey residents, fellows and medical students. PinnacleHealth residents also complete elective rotations at Penn State Hershey in several medical disciplines.\n\nPenn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth are part owners of Horizon Healthcare Services, a home infusion agency.\n\nThe two health systems worked together on a joint community health needs assessment in 2012 that examined health disparities and ways to improve health and wellness in the midstate.\n\nGilbert said the news was going through \u201cthe internal communications process since last week.\u201d Pinnacle employees were informed by email today.\n\nTeamsters Local 776, which represents 935 Penn State Hershey employees, is monitoring the developments, said Herb Garber, the business agent for the Teamsters who work at Penn State Hershey. \u201cWe have no indication at this point in time what effect that would have on the employment status of any of our members,\u201d he said.\n\nA new contract was recently approved that runs through June 30, 2016. \u201cIt provides members with some guarantee of job security. So we don\u2019t see any kind of an issue going forward,\u201d Garber said. The Local includes workers in technical service, housekeeping, food service, laundry and more.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@newsletter','@topstories','hershey medical center','Penn State Hershey','PinnacleHealth'", "title": "PinnacleHealth, Penn State Hershey hospitals will use third-party to study 'collaboration'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"PinnacleHealth, Penn State Hershey hospitals will use third-party to study \\u0027collaboration\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/pinnaclehealth_and_penn_state.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/8014956-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11728060\", \"pub_date\": \"\", \"author\": \"Barbara Miller | bmiller@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@newsletter\",\"@topstories\",\"hershey medical center\",\"Penn State Hershey\",\"PinnacleHealth\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/8014956-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@barbmiller", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth have begun formal talks to \"broaden their existing strategic relationship,\" the hospital systems announced Wednesday."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, November 27, 2013,  7:30 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/emergency-roomjpg-3bcf0b8a3330d8f1.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"bmiller\", \"author_nickname\": \"Barbara Miller | bmiller@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"519\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth have begun formal talks to \"broaden their existing strategic relationship,\" the hospital systems announced Wednesday.", "title": "PinnacleHealth, Penn State Hershey hospitals will use third-party to study 'collaboration'", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/pinnaclehealth_and_penn_state.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, November 27, 2013,  1:44 PM", "article_author": "Barbara Miller | bmiller@pennlive.com", "Description": "Penn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth have begun formal talks to \"broaden their existing strategic relationship,\" the hospital systems announced Wednesday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb49b\"", "article_summary": "Teamsters Local 776, which represents 935 Penn State Hershey employees, is monitoring the developments, said Herb Garber, the business agent for the Teamsters who work at Penn State Hershey.\nFor more than 10 years, PinnacleHealth hospitals have been a training site for Penn State Hershey residents, fellows and medical students.\nPenn State Hershey and PinnacleHealth have begun formal talks to \u201cbroaden their existing strategic relationship,\u201d the hospital systems announced Wednesday.\nPinnacleHealth and Penn State Hershey already have forged several collaborations.\nPinnacleHealth residents also complete elective rotations at Penn State Hershey in several medical disciplines."}
