Here are a few screen grabs from his failed login attempts:\n\nNow it\u2019s important to note that the site just went live at 12:00 a.m. EST. It was no doubt flooded with thousands of Americans waiting for their chance to sign up for the exchanges. That kind of traffic flow could easily overload and crash a site. So maybe the site\u2019s not that faulty. It may simply be struggling under the weight of heavy online traffic.\n\nStill, the feds have had since 2010 to lock this down. How is the site not ready for primetime? Did no one anticipate heavy traffic?\n\nSo many questions.\n\n--\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\n(H/T: Twitchy).
