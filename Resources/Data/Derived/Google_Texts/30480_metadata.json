He said the water was at the door handle when they arrived.\n\n\u201cAnd by the time they reached her, it was coming in her driver's door window,\u201d Bourdon said. The woman was not injured.\n\nIn Mt. Lebanon, lightning struck St. Bernard Church and put a stop to the music.\n\n\u201cThe organ did suffer some damage, and we're looking at that, but the building did not suffer any damage,\u201d said the Rev. Ken Marlovits, parochial vicar at the Catholic church. \u201cLightning may have struck one of lightning rods, which may have prevented any damage to the church.\u201d\n\nMarlovits said an assessor from the diocese insurance office examined the organ, which stopped working after the lightning strike.\n\nThe heaviest rain and storms began about 9:30 a.m., and most road flooding subsided by noon. In some areas, pockets of heavy rain lingered late into the afternoon.\n\nIn Westmoreland County, firefighters reported a flooded Rodebaugh Road in Hempfield and downed limbs along Logan Ferry Road in Murrysville. Flooding at Third Avenue and First Street in Sutersville made the road impassable for motorists.\n\nAcross the Youghiogheny River in Elizabeth Township, crews were using heavy equipment to clear debris from Nichols Hill and Douglas Run roads, where floodwaters from an abandoned mine covered the roadway.\n\n\u201cJust about every one of our counties had spotty rain of at least an inch,\u201d said Lee Hendricks, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Moon.\n\nThe weather service issued flood warnings that expired at 12:30 p.m. in Allegheny County and 2 in Westmoreland. Forest, Clarion, Jefferson, Armstrong, Indiana, Westmoreland and Fayette counties were under a flash flood watch through the evening.\n\nThe Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin had the most rain with 2.08 inches.\n\nIn Penn Hills, authorities closed a portion of Rodi Road and responded to reports of cars stranded in high water.\n\nThere were reports of flooding on Neville Road on Neville Island because of poor drainage. Officials said they responded to reports of flooding on Route 51 from Overbrook all the way down to Forward. Officials closed roads in Dravosburg, McKeesport and the West End when creeks overflowed their banks. Wind and lightning toppled trees from Ben Avon to Penn Hills, in some case taking wires with them.\n\nStaff writers Mary Pickels and Stacey Federoff contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=c0CquD$T3OR$rioizROtus$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuh89C$$FjaX5yovC0JNaJMWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "sailthru.author": "Bill Zlatos", "description": "A day of storms flooded roadways and toppled trees on Sunday in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties.
