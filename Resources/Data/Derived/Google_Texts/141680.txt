North Carolina State freshman wide receiver Bo Hines asked for and was granted a release to transfer to an Ivy League school Saturday.

"This has been a very tough decision for me,” said Hines. "I love NC State and the people I have had the privilege of getting to know there. I want to thank everyone at the university from my professors, to my coaches and my teammates. I will always love them and will always consider myself a member of the Wolfpack Nation. My goal is to pursue a specific career path in law and politics, and I believe that transferring to an Ivy League institution will help me reach that goal."

Hines caught three passes for a team-high 79 yards in the Wolfpack's 34-27 win over Central Florida in the Bitcoin Bowl. He led the team this past season in receptions with 45 and yards with 616 while finding the endzone once -- a 54-yarder.

“I truly enjoyed being Bo’s coach and wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors,” said Wolfpack head coach Dave Doeren.
