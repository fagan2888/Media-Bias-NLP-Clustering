I\u2019m glad you asked.\n\nMore than 200 years ago, the Ursuline Sisters of France were fleeing the French Revolution and seeking a new home in New Orleans. They planned to open schools, hospitals and orphanages, but wanted to make sure that the U.S. government, now in control of New Orleans, would not meddle in their plans \u2013 separation of church and state, you see. They wrote to President Thomas Jefferson with their concerns; Jefferson\u2019s response?\n\nI have received, holy sisters, the letter you have written me wherein you express anxiety for the property vested in your institution by the former governments of Louisiana. The principles of the constitution and government of the United States are a sure guarantee to you that it will be preserved to you, sacred and inviolate, and that your institution will be permitted to govern itself according to its own voluntary rules, without interference from the civil authority. Whatever the diversity of shade may appear in the religious opinions of our fellow citizens, the charitable objects of your institution cannot be indifferent to any; and its furtherance of the wholesome purposes of society, by training up its younger members in the way they should go, cannot fail to ensure it the patronage of the government it is under. Be assured it will meet all the protection which my office can give it. I salute you, holy sisters, with friendship and respect.\n\n(By the way, you can see Jefferson\u2019s original letter \u2013 kept in the Ursuline Museum \u2013 here.)\n\nWhy is this important? As blogger Joanne McPortland pointed out yesterday, some people (okay, columnist Jamie Stiehm at U.S. News) are trying to say that the Little Sisters of the Poor, who are currently seeking an exemption from the HHS mandate, are trying to finagle their way around the separation of church and state. Stiehm rolls out a diatribe against Justice Sotomayor, saying she \u201cis a Catholic who put her religion ahead of her jurisprudence.\u201d Why? Because Sotomayor has temporarily blocked the Little Sisters of the Poor from having to comply with the HHS mandate, which would force the Sisters to offer contraceptives and abortion coverage to their employees. Stiehm is not happy with Sotomayor:\n\nSotomayor\u2019s blow brings us to confront an uncomfortable reality. More than WASPS, Methodists, Jews, Quakers or Baptists, Catholics often try to impose their beliefs on you, me, public discourse and institutions. Especially if \u201cyou\u201d are female. This is not true of all Catholics \u2013 just look at House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. But right now, the climate is so cold when it comes to defending our settled legal ground that Sotomayor\u2019s stay is tantamount to selling out the sisterhood. And sisterhood is not as powerful as it used to be, ladies.\n\nOkay, so the \u201csisterhood\u201d (the feminists, not the \u201ctrouble-making\u201d Catholic ones) have been sold out. But then Stiehm wants to make it clear that all of this has been worked out already, by none other than\u2026Thomas Jefferson, since he\u2019s the one who came up with the whole \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d idea:\n\nThomas Jefferson, the principal champion of the separation between state and church, was thinking particularly of pernicious Rome in his writings. He deeply distrusted the narrowness of Vatican hegemony.\n\nYou can disagree with Stiehm\u2019s view of the Little Sisters of the Poor, her view about Obamacare and that of the \u201csisterhood\u201d of women. But she\u2019s flat-out wrong when it comes to Jefferson. And he himself proves that in the letter above. HotAir\u2019s Ed Morrissey:\n\n\u2026using Jefferson as an argument for federal intervention in just about anything reveals a much deeper ignorance of Jefferson, the political winds of the era, and which side of the political divide Jefferson ended up representing. The effort to replace the Articles of Confederation produced two competing camps, the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists, the latter of which strongly opposed a strong national government that could impose dictates on the states and on individuals. While Jefferson may not have been explicitly a member of that movement, he certainly sympathized with them, which is why we have a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. When the Anti-Federalists lost the argument, they ended up migrating into Jefferson\u2019s political party, the Democratic Republican Party, which was the forerunner of today\u2019s Democratic Party. Arguing that Jefferson would cheer federal dictates on the choices of health insurance for nuns is therefore either high ignorance or deliberate obtuseness.\n\nUnlike Stiehm, I hesitate to speak on behalf of Thomas Jefferson. So I\u2019ll just repeat what he said, \u201cThe principles of the constitution and government of the United States are a sure guarantee to you that it will be preserved to you, sacred and inviolate, and that your institution will be permitted to govern itself according to its own voluntary rules, without interference from the civil authority.\u201d Perhaps Justice Sotomayor knows that these words apply not only to the Ursuline Sisters, but the \u201ctrouble-making\u201d Little Sisters of the Poor as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's easy to read that headline and think, \"Wha...?\" What in the world do Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, Catholic Sisters and our present day health law", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Acton Institute PowerBlog", "description": "It's easy to read that headline and think, \"Wha...?\" What in the world do Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, Catholic Sisters and our present day health law", "title": "Thomas Jefferson, Catholic Sisters And Obamacare | Acton PowerBlog", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://blog.acton.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ursuline_nuns_1727_landing_01.jpg", "url": "http://blog.acton.org/archives/64574-thomas-jefferson-catholic-sisters-obamacare.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Acton Institute PowerBlog", "description": "It's easy to read that headline and think, \"Wha...?\" What in the world do Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, Catholic Sisters and our present day health law", "creator": "@EliseJGHilton", "image": "http://blog.acton.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ursuline_nuns_1727_landing_01.jpg", "title": "Thomas Jefferson, Catholic Sisters And Obamacare | Acton PowerBlog", "site": "@actoninstitute", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 22411840}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/actoninstitute", "section": "Freedom of Conscience", "tag": "United States Bill of Rights", "published_time": "2014-01-10T11:29:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0557\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s easy to read that headline and think, \u201cWha\u2026?\u201d What in the world do Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, Catholic Sisters and our present day health laws have to do with each other?\nYou can disagree with Stiehm\u2019s view of the Little Sisters of the Poor, her view about Obamacare and that of the \u201csisterhood\u201d of women.\nBecause Sotomayor has temporarily blocked the Little Sisters of the Poor from having to comply with the HHS mandate, which would force the Sisters to offer contraceptives and abortion coverage to their employees.\nUnlike Stiehm, I hesitate to speak on behalf of Thomas Jefferson.\nThey wrote to President Thomas Jefferson with their concerns; Jefferson\u2019s response?"}
