Instead of health care enrollment, a wrong number on the site\u2019s Contact Us page led callers to a sex hotline advertising for \u201chot ladies.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, California residents were expected to begin enrollment for health insurance through Covered California so that the process could be completed by April 15. In filling out the application, residents with hearing trouble were given a \"1-800\" number to dial in order to compare the costs of different coverage plans. Although the number on the site\u2019s contact page, 1-888-889-4500, was correct in directing callers, a second number for hearing-impaired callers to compare costs, 1-888-899-4500, led to an interesting mix up.\n\n\u201cWelcome to America\u2019s hottest talk line. Ladies, to talk to interesting and exciting guys free, press one now. Guys, hot ladies are waiting to talk to you. Press two to connect free now.\u201d This was the recording hearing-impaired callers were exposed to while trying to reach a health care service provider. When callers hung up and redialed, thinking they had dialed an incorrect number, they were connected to the same enticing voice.\n\nA representative for Covered California initially denied a mistake on the insurance provider\u2019s end, claiming an incorrect number was never listed on the website, CBS Sacramento reported. However, an email sent to CBS after the fact read: \u201cAfter investigating it further, we are reviewing the shop and compare tool as an incorrect number. We\u2019re currently working to correct the problem.\u201d\n\nOver one million California residents signed up for health insurance policies through Covered California as of Monday and an additional 1.1 million had started the application process. Residents who did not make Monday\u2019s enrollment deadline are expected to pay a $95 tax penalty or one percent of their annual income, according to Affordable Care Act guidelines.\n\nSince filling out the information on the site\u2019s \u201cApply for Benefits\u201d portal and clicking \u201cContinue\u201d is all residents had to do to start the process, further pushback of the deadline is not expected. It goes without saying this is up there with the most bizarre snafus experienced by Americans trying to sign up for the country\u2019s new health care plan.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "health, care, covered, california, hearing, impaired", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Covered California, a health care provider, redirected hearing-impaired callers to a sex hotline advertising for \"hot ladies.\"", "title": "California Health Care Provider Mistakenly Redirects Hearing Impaired To Sex Hotline", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hearing-impaired-california-residents-redirected-sex-hotline-health-insurance-sign-glitch-273912", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/02/covered-california.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Covered California, a health care provider, redirected hearing-impaired callers to a sex hotline advertising for \"hot ladies.\"", "title": "California Health Care Provider Mistakenly Redirects Hearing Impaired To Sex Hotline", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hearing-impaired-california-residents-redirected-sex-hotline-health-insurance-sign-glitch-273912", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/02/covered-california.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/02/covered-california.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-04-02T10:43:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-02T10:43:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Covered California, a health care provider, redirected hearing-impaired callers to a sex hotline advertising for \"hot ladies.\""}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re currently working to correct the problem.\u201dOver one million California residents signed up for health insurance policies through Covered California as of Monday and an additional 1.1 million had started the application process.\nWhile trying to start the process of signing up for health insurance through the provider Covered California, hearing-impaired residents of \u201cThe Golden State\u201d were exposed to a different type of service provider.\nIt goes without saying this is up there with the most bizarre snafus experienced by Americans trying to sign up for the country\u2019s new health care plan.\nPress two to connect free now.\u201d This was the recording hearing-impaired callers were exposed to while trying to reach a health care service provider.\nInstead of health care enrollment, a wrong number on the site\u2019s Contact Us page led callers to a sex hotline advertising for \u201chot ladies.\u201dOn Monday, California residents were expected to begin enrollment for health insurance through Covered California so that the process could be completed by April 15."}
