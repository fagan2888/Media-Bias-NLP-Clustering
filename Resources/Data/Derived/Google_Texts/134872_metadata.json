Seriously.\n\nPerhaps more than any other modern-day presidential contender, Ben Carson\u2019s public life is broken in two dramatically different parts.\n\nThese days he makes news exclusively for his political involvement, which continued Monday with the formal announcement of his long, long, long-shot presidential bid.\n\n\"If God ordains that we get into White House, we're going to change the government into something more like a well run business,\" he told a packed crowd at the Detroit Music Hall on Monday.\n\nHe\u2019s won commensurate adoration from Tea Party activists and contempt from Think Progress types for his internet-trolleque rhetoric.\n\nFor instance, the retired neurosurgeon once said the Affordable Care Act will have a worse long-term effect on America than 9/11 and also suggested its evils are topped only by slavery.\n\nBut the divisive former surgeon used to bring everyone together.\n\nBefore his presidential dreaming, and his Fox News stardom, and before his headline-making (and controversy-creating) speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, Ben Carson was already fabulously influential.\n\nIn 1987, when Marco Rubio was bro-ing out at South Miami Senior High School and Scott Walker was a mullet-sporting college student at Marquette University, Ben Carson became the first person to separate conjoined twins connected at the head.\n\nBut his inspiring tale doesn\u2019t start there.\n\nCarson\u2019s astonishing rags-to-riches story began in Detroit, Michigan. Soon after he was born in 1951, his parents divorced after his mother learned that his father had a secret second family.\n\nHis mother, single with two children to support, cleaned houses to keep the family afloat.\n\nHis grades in high school and SAT scores soared so high that both Harvard and Yale offered Carson scholarships. He picked Yale and majored in psychology there. He later went on to the University of Michigan to get his M.D.\n\nIn his autobiography, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story , Carson details how his Christian faith impacted his decision to go to U of M.\n\n\u201cCarson, aren\u2019t you worried?\u201d one of his friends asked him during their senior year of undergrad, as they were discussing post-college plans.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Carson replied. \u201cI\u2019m going to the University of Michigan Medical School.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason\n\n\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d his friend replied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really simple,\u201d Carson said. \u201cMy Father owns the University.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I had been teasing, and maybe it wasn\u2019t playing fair,\u201d Carson adds later in the text. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe that God--my Heavenly Father--not only created the universe, but he controls it. And, by extension, God owns the University of Michigan and everything else.\u201d\n\nDuring his time in school, Carson worked a variety of unsexy jobs, including as a supervisor of a highway trash collection crew.\n\nBut his medical genius showed early.\n\nAs a student at U of M he created a new way for neurosurgeons to find a small hole at the base of a patient\u2019s skull called the foramen ovale.\n\nDoctors started using the technique, which saved them time in surgery.\n\nAfter getting married and finishing med school, Carson went into brain surgery.\n\nHis career may have began in Michigan, but it blossomed in Maryland.\n\nThere, he became Johns Hopkins\u2019 director of pediatric neurosurgery, and had an unparalleled tenure there as a surgeon.\n\nBesides his historic separation of the Binder twins conjoined at the head, he reintroduced the hemispherectomy procedure to modern medicine by removing half of the brain of a four-year-old girl named Maranda Francisco who was suffering from brutal seizures.\n\nThe remaining side of Francisco\u2019s brain took over the functions of the removed side, thanks to the brain\u2019s plasticity. The Washington Post reported that at age 18, Francisco lead \u201ca remarkably active teenage life \u2013 dancing, taking karate lessons, firing off e-mail\u201d.\n\n\u201cPlasticity is something pediatric neurologists have known about for a long time,\u201d Carson told reporters during a reunion of patients who had successfully undergone hemispherectomies, per the Los Angeles Times . \u201cBut no one knows the mechanism by which it occurs.\u201d\n\nHe became a hero.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. played him in a TV movie and playwright Carole Graham Lehane adopted his autobiography for the stage.\n\nThousands of students saw it performed.\n\nHe even gained several mentions in the hit Baltimore-based HBO drama The Wire as someone the down-and-out characters aspired to become.\n\nOn Monday, he weighed in on the unrest in his adopted city and said the people there had simply lost hope.\n\n\"They don't feel that life is going to be good for them, no matter what happens, so when an opportunity comes to loot, to riot, to get mine, they take it, not believing that there is a much better way to get the things that they desire,\" Carson said.\n\nAnd while his political future is unlikely to soar to the heights of his medical career, Carson will have an interesting role in the ever-expanding GOP field - both as the only African American and as the field's candidate with the least electoral experience.\n\nAnd at the very least, he'll be able to make lots of jokes about how running for president isn't brain surgery.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "woodruffbets"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, Ben Carson, u.s. poli, Fox News Channel, 2016, 2016 Election", "publicationDate": 201505050915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Before he was a Fox News star, Ben Carson was a world-renowned brain surgeon.
