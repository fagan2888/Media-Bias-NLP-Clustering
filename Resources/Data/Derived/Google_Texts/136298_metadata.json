It was very close,\u201d said Kristoff. \u201cI thought I would be second \u2026 we turned on the gas.\u201d\n\nBauer tapped his head on his helmet, sighed heavily, leaned over his bike and burst into tears after failing to win. In the last few hundred meters, he left IAM Cycling\u2019s Elmiger behind as he headed for the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy for any cyclist to win a stage at the Tour and especially for a Kiwi cyclist, not many of us turn professional and not many of us get a chance to start the Tour de France,\u201d Bauer said.\n\n\u201cI really gave it absolutely everything, and as you can see from my meltdown at the finish I was pretty disappointed to come away empty-handed.\u201d\n\nThe pack, which timed its creep up on the duo to perfection, was just too strong for the New Zealander. By the time that Bauer, pedaling with his last remaining strength, looked back a last time, they were already zooming by. He ended up finishing in 10th place. Elmiger was 16th.\n\nWith about 20 kilometers (12 miles) left in the stage, the riders briefly got doused with heavy rain, though the skies brightened by the end. A series of roundabouts and leg fatigue among the sprinters after the Alpine stages gave an advantage to the breakaway pair until the final seconds.\n\n\u201cOf course, that\u2019s a pity for them, but I don\u2019t feel sorry for them,\u201d said Kristoff, noting that sprinters usually reign in such stages. \u201cNormally, the break should never have had a chance, but they did. They were really strong guys \u2026 That must have been really hard.\u201d\n\nNibali kept his main rivals for the Tour title at bay. He leads Spain\u2019s Alejandro Valverde, in second, by 4:37, and Romain Bardet of France is third, 4:50 behind. American Tejay van Garderen trails fifth, 5:49 back.\n\nNibali, the leader of Kazakh team Astana, is looking likely to take home the yellow jersey when the three-week race finishes next Sunday in Paris. Some of his best-placed rivals have already said the contest is now more for a podium spot below him.\n\nThe Italian has shown race savvy \u2014 such as by gaining time on tricky cobblestone patches in Stage 2 \u2014 and nearly insurmountable dominance on high climbs. He won Stage 13\u2019s entree into the Alps, and was second a day later, also in the snow-capped mountains.\n\nOn Sunday, Nibali showed he wasn\u2019t leaving any opportunities for his rivals to gain ground.\n\nWith about 65 kilometers left, he sped out of the pack and briefly took the lead, fearing a side wind might split it and make catching up hard \u2014 a phenomenon known as \u201cechelons\u201d in cycling parlance.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, there was a lot of side wind,\u201d he said. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to miss the good opportunity and try to move up into position \u2026 because when there\u2019s wind, you have to be at the front.\u201d\n\nMore grueling climbs are looming in the Pyrenees this week before the only individual time trial of this Tour, next Saturday.\n\nRiders take a second rest day on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nibali kept his main rivals at bay in the stage and did not lose any time to them.
