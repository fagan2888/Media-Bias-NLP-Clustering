Mitch McConnell, Nov. 5, 2014\n\nOn the day after the biggest win of his life, Mitch McConnell was feeling the love. Once he called hounding President Obama out of office his primary duty as a public servant. But rhapsodizing about common ground and fixing Congress, he sounded almost Obamaesque. Looking back at those words \u2014 and at a Congress that remains as venal and broken as it ever was \u2014 one can\u2019t help but wonder: Did he mean it?\n\nHe probably did. Every politician has heard his inner Lincoln beseech him to bind up the nation\u2019s wounds. Even if McConnell were deaf to the plea, the same self-interest that led him to a life of obstruction now requires him to prove he can do what he fought to keep Obama from doing: Make the damn place work. He figured the bar would be easy to step over, having lowered it himself.\n\nWas he ever wrong. McConnell promised to open the floor to more amendments and force senators to come to work \u2014 and that he did. But as for finding common ground or actually passing any bills, the pattern seems set in stone. Despite winning historic majorities in both houses, Republicans haven\u2019t changed Congress or themselves. They aren\u2019t about to.\n\nA quick recap:\n\nTheir only victory came before they were sworn in, when Obama leaned on Democrats to back a budget that increased defense spending, weakened efforts to slow global warming, allowed stock speculators to saddle taxpayers with their losses, and punched another hole in campaign finance laws. Republicans buried it all in a lame-duck budget because each of those moves are so unpopular. Obama said he gave in to avert a shutdown.\n\nOnce the session got going, things really fell apart. The House treated us to yet another return engagement of the Benghazi follies, tried to deny rape victims access to emergency contraception, repealed Obamacare for the 56th time and came within nanoseconds of defunding homeland security. The public strongly opposes each of these actions \u2014 and truly detests the larger spectacle of endless gamesmanship in lieu of governance. But the GOP base loves it and Obama hates it, so they do it anyway, right up to the moment they\u2019re sure the public is about to fry them. Then, as with Cuba or Ebola or the homeland security funding crisis, they ever so quietly drop the matter and move on to some fresh outrage.\n\nGovernment to them is just electoral politics by other means. Their public hearings are mostly guerrilla warfare. Their floor votes are for show. Their abortion vote was timed to coincide with a pro-life rally in Washington. Their big event, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress, was timed to coincide with his election.\n\nIn our 2012 presidential election, Bibi meddled clumsily on Mitt Romney\u2019s behalf. After Obama won, he named ex-GOP operative Ron Dermer as his ambassador to the U.S. Dermer and House Speaker John Boehner arranged Netanyahu\u2019s speech without telling Obama, the guy to whom the Constitution entrusts foreign policy. Other than to humiliate Obama and give Bibi a leg up in his race, the goal was to short-circuit the Iran nuclear weapons pact being negotiated by the U.S, U.K., France, China and Russia before anyone could read it, indeed before it even existed. Had a Democrat pulled such a stunt on a Republican president, they\u2019d have called it treason.\n\nOther than a preemptive military attack, Bibi doesn\u2019t offer an alternative to a deal with Iran. That doesn\u2019t bother Republicans, who offer no alternative to the healthcare law they repeal on the hour or to the immigration bill they won\u2019t let Congress vote on. Boehner said Americans had \u201ca good laugh\u201d over Obama\u2019s recent budget, but if you\u2019ve had a year of high school math then you know Republicans haven\u2019t offered a real alternative to an Obama budget since taking over the House in 2011.\n\nBoehner was supposed to return this year with a wider margin of error and a tighter grip on his caucus. Instead, he seems as much a lame duck as Obama. He\u2019d like to get an immigration bill and a budget deal, but he can forget the former and the latter could blow up his caucus and the whole government with it. Obama gets blamed for failing to connect with GOP leaders \u2014 but in the days leading up to the near shutdown, Boehner and McConnell weren\u2019t talking to each other. If the enduring dysfunction isn\u2019t all McConnell\u2019s fault, he nonetheless seems powerless to fix it.\n\nCongress is likely to act on just two bills of significance, but they\u2019re big ones: the Trans Pacific Trade Partnership and Obama\u2019s request for authority to put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d\u2014a hideously reductive phrase\u2014in the fight against ISIS. To say that anyone voting for either is on treacherous political ground is a vast understatement. Before the global financial meltdown, a bare plurality of Americans favored free trade agreements. No more. Two-thirds now oppose giving Obama the \u201cfast track\u201d authority he seeks with the TPP. Republican opposition is higher still. As for ISIS, Americans feel something must be done but a plurality opposes sending in combat troops. Since Korea, America has entered all its wars with broad public support that, with few exceptions, slowly dissipated. No modern president or Congress has ever sent our soldiers to fight with the country so divided from the first.\n\nThe ISIS debate will be hard. The TPP and budget debates will be harsh even by the standards of this Congress. But the harshest debates will be over nothing at all; they are mere public entertainments staged for no purpose but partisan advantage. It\u2019s why the very sight and sound of Congress offends people. Like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid before them, Boehner and McConnell now want to elevate the tone and end the paralysis, but they can\u2019t.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just leaders of Congress who want to change but can\u2019t. It\u2019s as if, at its lowest ebb, the entire democracy was flash-frozen. You can see it in the state of both parties and in the nascent 2016 presidential race.\n\nAfter its 2012 defeat the GOP issued a postmortem report that promised smart reforms. Like McConnell, GOP chair Reince Priebus delivered on technical and procedural stuff. (Mainly vows to cut back on debates and match the Democrats in data mining.) Among his goals: to get his party to back immigration reform; to rein in the huge PACs that had usurped the party\u2019s role; to attack \u201ccorporate malfeasance\u201d; to hit the reset button with gays and women and to be more welcoming to non-whites.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mitch can't fix the Senate.
