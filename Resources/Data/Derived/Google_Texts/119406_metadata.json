The little-known tax was imposed on all consumers regardless of whether they obtained their insurance through Obamacare or through their employer or as individuals in the private market.\n\nThis year the tax will cost individuals more than $500 in extra premiums according to one actuarial estimate. Families who purchased insurance will see their premiums go up by more than $700.\n\nThe new tax also hits senior citizens who rely on Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage. It will land on the nation\u2019s poor who depend upon Medicaid-managed care programs.\n\nThe 41 percent sticker shock increase doesn\u2019t stop in 2015, however. Over the next four years, the statutorily mandated Obamacare fees are expected to double again.\n\nOver the next decade, consumers will pay more than $145 billion for the tax, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The levy will continue to go up each and every year into the future.\n\nThe tax was buried by congressional authors in section 9010 of the law and was envisioned as a way to raise future funds to pay for Obamacare.\n\nThe Obamacare fees were designed by the program\u2019s authors to be delayed, kicking in only in 2014 at $8 billion and mushrooming into a $14.3 billion annual price tag on insurance policies by 2018.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Barrasso, who favors repeal of section 9010, said the tax \u201cis another example of how the president\u2019s health care law was designed so the most painful parts of the law kick in years later.\u201d\n\nCBO reported the fee was a \u201cstatutorily fixed\u201d amount that must be collected each year from consumers, as opposed to a percentage rate.\n\nThe statute describes the levy is an \u201cannual fee\u201d but health-care economists say it has been commonly referred to as an excise tax.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation said the Obamacare tax was \u201csimilar to an excise tax based on the sales price of health insurance contracts.\u201d\n\nThe panel predicted the fee on insurance policies would be borne by consumers. The panel also told then-Sen. Jon Kyl in a June 2011 letter that, \u201can excise tax generally is borne by consumers in the form of higher prices.\u201d\n\nAn actuarial review of the Section 9010 by the management firm Oliver Wyman for the health insurance industry predicted that individual policyholders will pay $514 more this year due to the Obamacare tax.\n\nThose who use small group policies will see a rise of $688, while family coverage would rise by $719, the firm stated.\n\nIronically, the elderly and the poor \u2014 those who were supposed to benefit most from Obamacare \u2014 will be adversely affected by the new tax, as will financially hard-pressed state governments.\n\nSection 9010 mandates that taxes must be paid for seniors who rely on Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D.\n\nOliver Wyman estimated Medicare Advantage would cost seniors $360 more this year. Medicaid managed-care enrollees will be expected to face increases of $152, according to the firm.\n\nMilliman, the national health actuarial firm, reported in 2014 that states will lose 52 cents for every dollar they receive from Medicaid because of the fee.\n\n\u201cThe result is a transfer of $0.52 from state government to the federal government for every $1.00 of ACA health insurer fee,\u201d the accounting firm said.\n\nMilliman further said the Obamacare tax will cost states 1.8 percent to 2.8 percent more for Medicaid managed care, which is a low-cost way to offer medical services to the poor. Half of the nation\u2019s Medicaid recipients are signed up by the states under Medicaid managed care, according to Milliman.\n\nThis fee, while seemingly low, can put many Medicare-managed care companies at great financial risk or perhaps out of business.\n\n\u201cGiven Medicaid managed care profit margins were less than 2% in CY 2012, increases of this magnitude are meaningful,\u201d Milliman said.\n\nThe actuarial firm estimated the Obamacare tax will cause the states that use Medicaid-managed care losses of up to $13.9 billion.\n\nFor years the health insurance industry has battled but failed to persuade Congress or the president to repeal the tax.\n\nEarlier this year, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch and Barrasso introduced legislation to repeal the excise tax. It has 38 Republican co-sponsors. No Democrats have backed the bill to date.\n\nHatch described the tax as \u201cyet another hidden health care tax arbitrarily created to pay for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Charles W. Boustany introduced legislation in the House to repeal Section 9010. He has claimed bipartisan support among the 218 co-sponsors, a majority of the House.\n\nThe only group exempted from the tax are people who work in large corporations that \u201cself-insure\u201d their workforce. In a self-insurance system, no insurance company is used, only the company assets.\n\nUSA Families, a non-profit group that vigorously supports Obamacare, did not respond to a TheDCNF request for comment on the tax.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
