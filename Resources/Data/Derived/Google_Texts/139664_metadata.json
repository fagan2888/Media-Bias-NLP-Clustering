There would be 1,098 parking spaces, a collision center and car wash.\n\nThe rezoning sets aside 26 percent of the 26.5 acres over four parcels for open space. Twenty percent is the minimum required for a highway business district, or HB. Most of the property was previously zoned as agricultural, or A1.\n\nThe dealership, which will be the fourth on that stretch of the corridor, has stirred up the area. Many in the meeting audience \u2014 clad in red and carrying signs stating \u201cProtect Echols Road\u201d \u2014 opposed the rezoning.\n\nKimber Williams spoke for those who signed the petition. Their main concerns were traffic, the impact on the area \u2014 which includes two schools and a park \u2014 and safety.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard people coming before you this evening using words like \u2018economic vitality,\u2019 \u2018impact,\u2019 \u2018revenue,\u2019 \u2018taxes,\u2019 \u2018dollars,\u2019 \u2018sales.\u2019 But here\u2019s what trumps that \u2014 the safety and well-being of our children.\u201d\n\nThough the commission\u2019s decision appeared unpopular, the majority of the public comment speakers supported the dealership.\n\nThey included Randall Toussaint of the Cumming-Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Echols family and some residents.\n\n\u201c[The company has] bent over backwards, I think, to try to please all the community as much as the possibly can,\u201d said Myra Echols, who has lived along the road since 1977 along with her husband, who has been there much longer.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not there to destroy, they\u2019re there to help. That\u2019s why they had two public meetings at their cost.\u201d\n\nThe Toyota dealership will join Lou Sobh Honda, which opened in late 2013 at Hwy. 20 and Sanders Road, and a Lou Sobh Kia which is under construction next to it. An 8-acre tract nearby was rezoned in October for a Q Automotive dealership.\n\nAs proposed, the Toyota/Scion dealership would be the largest of the four. The Honda center is 50,000 square feet and houses about 500 vehicles on site.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/27032/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2015/03/21/dealerships.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "EAST FORSYTH \u2014 In what they acknowledged likely would be an unpopular decision to some, the Forsyth County commission on Thursday night approved plans for a Toyota/Scion dealership along Highway 20 east of Cumming.", "title": "Rezoning for Toyota/Scion dealership near Cumming approved"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Rezoning for Toyota/Scion dealership near Cumming approved"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8e5\"", "article_summary": "As proposed, the Toyota/Scion dealership would be the largest of the four.\nEAST FORSYTH \u2014 In what they acknowledged likely would be an unpopular decision to some, the Forsyth County commission on Thursday night approved plans for a Toyota/Scion dealership along Highway 20 east of Cumming.\nMany in the meeting audience \u2014 clad in red and carrying signs stating \u201cProtect Echols Road\u201d \u2014 opposed the rezoning.\nThat\u2019s why they had two public meetings at their cost.\u201dThe Toyota dealership will join Lou Sobh Honda, which opened in late 2013 at Hwy.\nThe dealership, which will be the fourth on that stretch of the corridor, has stirred up the area."}
