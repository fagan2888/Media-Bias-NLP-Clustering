BOSTON (CBS) — During today’s suitability hearing for the proposed Everett casino before the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, casino mogul Steve Wynn spent close to thirty minutes during a break answering reporters’ questions.

And he went on at some length in response to a question from WBZ’s Jon Keller about the impact of federal health care reform on Wynn’s gambling empire.

“I’ve been a health care provider for 45 years and everything about those 2,700 pages is incorrect,” Wynn said of the bill. “It’s not the notion that it would be nice to make health care affordable for everyone. Everyone in America agrees on that but God lives in the details and if you want to do something, you got to do it correctly… Everything about Obamacare is incorrect.”

Wynn said the biggest element increasing the cost of health care is the misuse of diagnostic tools because health care providers are nervous about malpractice lawsuits.

Wynn says the same diagnostic equipment that saves lives in hospitals each day, is “overused defensively” to prevent patients from suing doctors.

“Frivolous lawsuits in a litigious society are impacting everyone’s lives in ways that are very numerous,” Wynn said.

Wynn also talked about his own struggles offering health care insurance to his casino and resort employees.

“If you keep everyone in the same group and elevate all the service to the highest level, there’s only one thing that can happen – the fees have to go up,” he said.
