An armed robbery happened right in the heart of University of Kentucky's campus, across the street from the library and near several fraternity and sorority houses.

"We didn't know it was a gunshot at first, just a big loud boom," says Austin Mullen. "One of our friends was actually walking right here and he heard it and sprinted into the house. Then we kind of realized what it was."

Mullen heard the shot around 11:30 Thursday night, right outside of his fraternity house on Pennsylvania Avenue. Shortly after, UK sent out a crime alert to students and staff.

Police say two men, armed with guns, robbed two students of their cell phones. The robbers had apparently followed those students all the way from Euclid Avenue.

At some point after the robbery, police say a shot was fired. It's unclear who fired the shot, but a shell casing was found near the scene. No one was hurt.

This robbery follows another that happened last week on East Maxwell, not far from campus.

Students tell WKYT's Whitney Wetzel these crimes are alarming, but they're not too worried.

"I mean I don't live too far from here, so seeing something happen right on your doorstep is a little bit concerning," says Mitch Cavallo, a student. "But overall, I think campus safety is pretty solid, and you know what, at the end of the day these things happen."

UK police say they're reviewing campus surveillance video.

The suspects are described as black men, around 5'9" with medium builds. One had cornrows and was wearing dark, baggy clothes. The other was wearing dark jeans, a black and white striped sweatshirt and a white or light pink polo-style ball cap.
