Lennar Homes\u2019 Generations collection homes are family-sized designs that accommodate novel living arrangements that real families are exploring in today\u2019s market \u2013 say, grandparents who come for extended stays with their grandkids; or an older parent who moves in; or a \u2018boomerang kid\u2019 who returns home.\n\nLennar has already had great success with its \u2018NextGen\u2019 designs in neighborhoods all around the Denver area, and that success is likely to be redoubled at Stapleton, Denver\u2019s most popular master-planned community, where families get unprecedented parks, trails, neighborhood shopping, good schools, and recreation centers. The grand opening of the Legacy model is today \u2013 but Lennar already has buyers signing on for these: one of them a family with kids who love the support they get from Grandma and Grandpa, who will get their own apartment-like suite as part of the design \u2013 a living room, bedroom with private bath, stackable laundry, and kitchenette with sink, fridge and convection oven.\n\nYou\u2019ll tour that additional suite on the main level \u2013 but from the outside, Generations homes look like single-family designs, ones that make no compromises in terms of size and features for their core families. In the 3,171-square-foot Legacy, you\u2019ll see three upstairs bedrooms plus a loft, including an expansive master suite with five-piece bath, and a full upstairs laundry, plus attractive main-level formal and wide-open family areas. That\u2019s in addition to its additional Generations suite, full basement, and 3-car garage.\n\nLennar Homes has a choice selection of sites for these in Willow Park East, and can deliver some homes this fall, if you get involved now. Prices start in the mid-$500s \u2013 all to include clean, renewable solar energy at no additional cost, in state-of-the-art photovoltaic systems provided and maintained by SunStreet Energy Group, plus Lennar\u2019s \u2018Everything\u2019s Included\u2019 package of highly popular standard features.\n\nYou\u2019ll also see the attractions coming to surrounding Willow Park East \u2013 including Sandhills Prairie Park with a promontory that\u2019ll have mountain views; and a wedge-shaped \u2018Pizza Park\u2019 with a wood-fired oven for pizza parties. There\u2019ll be a community garden and a dog park, and new Northfield High School opens this fall. And willow Park East puts residents close to The Shops at Northfield Stapleton, a regional attraction for its Macy\u2019s, Bass Pro and other shopping, along with a dozen dining spots including Texas de Brazil, Bar Louie, La Sandia, Starbucks, and TGI Fridays.\n\nLennar will have the Cupcake Truck on site for the grand opening from noon until 2 p.m. From central Stapleton, take Central Park Boulevard north, past I-70, to Northfield Boulevard and turn left a half mile to Verbena, then proceed north eight blocks to a left on Prairie Meadow Drive, take your first right on Valentia Court, then turn right toward the model on E. 54th Place and Verbena Street.\n\nGrand Opening of Lennar\u2019s Generations in Stapleton\u2019s Willow Park East neighborhood; 2,678 to 3,171 Sq. ft., furnished model, close to parks, The Shops at Northfield Stapleton. 5449 Verbena St., Denver; from central Stapleton take MLK Blvd east to Central Park Blvd, turn north 1.9 mi.
