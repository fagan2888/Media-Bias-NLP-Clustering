"We can do better," McConnell assured us back in that March 2010 unveiling. "We can expand access to people with pre-existing conditions, we can keep people from being kicked off their plan, we can lower costs and premiums, we can do all of these things without undermining the things that we do best and without raising taxes that kill jobs in a bad economy. The American people know that. That's why theyâ€™ve been clamoring for a different approach." "Repeal and replace," McConnell continued. "That's what Americans really want." [...] Five years, and it's still "we'll let you know"?

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is taking a page from his House Republican colleagues who totally have a plan to save Obamacare subsidies but are keeping it secret for now. McConnell said Monday that Senate Republicans "will be ready" and they just need to wait for the court and he can't talk about that plan now, but "we'll let you know depending on the outcome of the decision," what the plan is. Uh, huh. That triggered a memory forwriter Jay Bookman, the memory of Mitch McConnell promising a plan to "repeal and replace" Obamacare five years ago News flash. There is no Republican plan, secret or otherwise. There are a handful of crappy ideas floating around among Republicans, none of which would make health care in this country better and none of which can even get enough support with either the House or Senate Republican conferences to even pass.

As Bookman says, "They got nothin'."
