Authorities in central Kansas spent their Saturday searching for a woman missing for several months.

Kansas game wardens partnered with a number of other agencies to search along the Arkansas River in Rice County for 22-year-old Megan Foglesong who was reported missing November.

“We had planned this search based on a tip we received,” Rice County Under Sheriff Brian Treaster told the Hutch Post.

Foglesong's last activity on Facebook was November 30. She was reportedly seen at Guy's Liquor Store in Larned on December 25.

Foglesong is described as 5-foot-4, about 150 pounds with sandy blonde hair and green eyes. She has distinctive tattoos on her left hip (a flower), left wrist (heart design) and an infinity symbol on her upper right chest. She also has a tattoo on her left calf.

If you have seen her or know where she is, please contact the Rice Count Sheriff at 620-257-7876.

The search was expected to resume on Sunday.

Other agencies involved in the search include the Reno and Barton County sheriff’s offices, Lyons Police Department, and the Kansas Search and Rescue Dog Association.
