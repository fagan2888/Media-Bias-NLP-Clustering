Upon reinstating Robertson after his suspension (one that became a political cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the right), A&E noted that Robertson was entitled to his own \u201cpersonal views based on his own beliefs\u201d but that his \u201ccoarse language\u201d was unacceptable.\n\nAnd Robertson is entitled to his beliefs \u2014 but are A&E viewers entitled to a lecture about how we have to be as tolerant of \u201cthe old school\u201d as we are of \u201cgirls who like girls\u201d? In putting out a PSA that doesn\u2019t featuring the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d stars, and that dictates tolerance means tolerance of people who don\u2019t tolerate others, A&E is playing the oldest and most worn-out card of all. Declaring that people who notice bigotry aren\u2019t celebrating \u201cthe old-school,\u201d that they\u2019re indeed the ones who are prejudiced, won\u2019t be extinct so long as there\u2019s money to be made.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A&E's PSA dictates tolerance means tolerance of people who don't tolerate others -- the most worn-out card of all VIDEO", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A&E's PSA dictates tolerance means tolerance of people who don't tolerate others -- the most worn-out card of all VIDEO", "title": "The \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d network urges you to embrace diversity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/the_duck_dynasty_network_urges_you_to_embrace_diversity/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/celebrate_different2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A&E's PSA dictates tolerance means tolerance of people who don't tolerate others -- the most worn-out card of all VIDEO", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/celebrate_different2.jpg", "title": "The \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d network urges you to embrace diversity", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d network urges you to embrace diversity", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, a&e, duck dynasty, phil robertson, TV, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc4f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: a&e, duck dynasty, phil robertson, TV, Video, Entertainment NewsIn a new summer ad campaign, A&E is telling you to \u201ccelebrate different\u201d \u2014 even as its most popular stars, conspicuous in their absence, speak out against diversity.\nIn putting out a PSA that doesn\u2019t featuring the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d stars, and that dictates tolerance means tolerance of people who don\u2019t tolerate others, A&E is playing the oldest and most worn-out card of all.\nAnd Robertson is entitled to his beliefs \u2014 but are A&E viewers entitled to a lecture about how we have to be as tolerant of \u201cthe old school\u201d as we are of \u201cgirls who like girls\u201d?\nDeclaring that people who notice bigotry aren\u2019t celebrating \u201cthe old-school,\u201d that they\u2019re indeed the ones who are prejudiced, won\u2019t be extinct so long as there\u2019s money to be made.\nUpon reinstating Robertson after his suspension (one that became a political cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the right), A&E noted that Robertson was entitled to his own \u201cpersonal views based on his own beliefs\u201d but that his \u201ccoarse language\u201d was unacceptable."}
