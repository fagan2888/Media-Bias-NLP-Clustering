What, then, is left for a broker to do?\n\nNot much, according to Parker Conrad, founder and chief executive of Zenefits, who says his clients lose nothing by signing up with his company.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that you give up is that we will not come in person. No golf, no steak dinners,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cWe\u2019ll run an open enrollment meeting for your employees, but we\u2019re going to do that over video. What you get on the other side is that everything moves online, so there\u2019s no more paperwork, there\u2019s no more faxing; it\u2019s all done via the system. Employees can make changes themselves.\u201d\n\nCompanies with at least 20 employees get a dedicated account manager at Zenefits; smaller businesses don\u2019t. When it comes to finding a health plan, Zenefits will quote a price, instantly, for every plan available in the state. \u201cA broker, it\u2019s like work for them to go generate quotes,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cSo probably, particularly if you\u2019re a small company, they\u2019re not going to go quote you everything. They\u2019re going to go quote you five or six pretty standard options.\u201d\n\nBut is that winnowing such a bad thing? \u201cIf they\u2019re providing 150 or 200 quotes, how is a client supposed to sift through all those without the experience of having been down that road? That\u2019s where the broker comes in,\u201d said Ryan Thorn, an agent in Jordan, Utah, and the president of the National Association of Health Underwriters, a trade association for insurance agents.\n\nMr. Conrad said that a Zenefits account representative goes through the list over the phone to help the client choose a plan, but Mr. Thorn said that \u201cwould take hours and hours, and a client doesn\u2019t have that much time.\u201d Moreover, he added, \u201cI know which of those carriers are strong right now and which have some glitches or some issues. Each quote has its own unique benefits. There are still some nuances between each plan, that you need people to guide you through.\u201d\n\nMr. Thorn said that he did not oppose Zenefits and that the Utah insurance commissioner, Todd E. Kiser, started his investigation on his own initiative, not at the behest of the industry. There is a place for Zenefits, Mr. Thorn said: \u201cThere are probably companies out there that really don\u2019t care\u201d about having a personal relationship with a broker. \u201cBut what happens when there\u2019s a claims issue that they cannot resolve? Is there somebody that they can trust locally to get that issue resolved for them?\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Zenefits said that its customer support agents are trained to help clients with a variety of problems, including disputed claims.\n\nDavid Chase, health care policy director for the Small Business Majority, an organization that began as an advocate for health care law and now operates outreach programs to small businesses on behalf of several state exchanges, said that businesses trust brokers to make sense of the complexity surrounding health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complex picking insurance for yourself and your family,\u201d Mr. Chase said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more complex for a business. A business has to take into account its budget, for one thing, you\u2019ve got to be aware of all the different tax laws when you look at employer coverage, and then you\u2019ve got to factor in the needs of all your employees and your dependents.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a small-business owner, you know how to provide your product or service,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut when it comes to health insurance, it\u2019s a very foreign concept for them. They\u2019re out of their element\u201d \u2014 while brokers \u201cdo this for a living.\u201d\n\nThe health insurance landscape for small businesses is undeniably changing, in no small part because of the Affordable Care Act. Most obviously, the small-business health insurance, or SHOP, exchanges established by the health law could be seen as an effort, or opportunity, to supplant brokers: The exchanges were intended to allow businesses to compare plans from different insurers and then purchase a plan, or several plans. In theory, an exchange makes a broker irrelevant.\n\nBut in practice, some of the people who build exchanges have come to see brokers as essential. Mr. Chase said that exchanges had learned from past experience that cutting brokers out of the transaction only made unnecessary enemies. If the exchanges enlist the agents as partners, he said, the agents become \u201ca de facto sales team\u201d for the exchanges. Mr. Chase said that in his group\u2019s work for California and other states, \u201cwe see brokers as partners in our education efforts.\u201d\n\nAlan Cohen, a founder of Liazon, a benefits company, discovered something similar when he began to try to sell businesses on the merits of a private exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s simply hard to disrupt a relationship that has existed in some way or form for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery company has always used brokers.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he said, clients still want the steak dinner, or at least the attention of somebody local: \u201cIt\u2019s a personal business, it\u2019s a service support business, and you want a broker who if there\u2019s a problem will show up in your office today.\u201d\n\nMr. Cohen predicted that Zenefits would struggle as its clients become bigger. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThose companies are going to grow up. They\u2019re not going to be 30 employees anymore; they\u2019re going to be 100 employees and 200 employees, and they\u2019re going to need a real consultant.\u201d\n\nMr. Conrad maintained that much of the time that brokers devote to clients today is busywork that his software automates. \u201cPeople\u2019s relationships with their broker, they have a certain amount of value,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all you have to do is you have to provide value that exceeds the value of that relationship, and they will switch. Our software makes us a better broker.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the fate of brokers will depend on the desires and needs of business owners. \u201cMy experience with brokers is that they don\u2019t have to understand anything,\u201d said Paul Downs, a business owner who contributes to You\u2019re The Boss and has written extensively about his difficulties in buying health insurance. \u201cThey just have to be smiley, chatty people. They\u2019re fun to talk to, they make you comfortable, and then they sell you something. And neither of us understands what we\u2019re buying.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance, Mr. Downs said, is deliberately, and needlessly, complex. \u201cYou\u2019re like a cow being herded down a chute at the slaughterhouse,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou have no place to go. Eventually you realize that you need to buy insurance, and somebody shows up in your office and puts a piece of paper down on your desk for you to sign.\n\n\u201cYou can either sign it and move on, or you can torture yourself. And 99 percent of business owners want to get on with making money. They realize that drowning in the details of these transactions doesn\u2019t get them anywhere.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141218070005, "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/as-health-insurance-evolves-traditional-brokers-claim-they-still-have-a-role/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s complex picking insurance for yourself and your family,\u201d said a health care policy director for a small-business organization. \u201cIt\u2019s even more complex for a business.", "card": "summary", "title": "As Health Insurance Evolves, Traditional Brokers Claim They Still Have a Role"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robb Mandelbaum", "org": "Liazon Corp;Zenefits Insurance Services", "keywords": "Conrad Parker,Downs Paul,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Liazon Corp,Zenefits Insurance Services,Utah,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/As Health Insurance Evolves, Traditional Brokers Claim They Still Have a Role ( 20141218 )", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s complex picking insurance for yourself and your family,\u201d said a health care policy director for a small-business organization. \u201cIt\u2019s even more complex for a business.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robb Mandelbaum", "SCG": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "per": "Conrad, Parker;Downs, Paul", "byl": "Robb Mandelbaum", "BN": "boss", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance,Liazon,Parker Conrad,Paul Downs,Small business,Utah,Zenefits", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 18, 2014", "article": {"tag": "The Agenda", "published_time": 1418904005, "modified_time": "2014-12-18T12:02:13-05:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp"}, "geo": "Utah", "utime": 20141218120213, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141218, "pdate": 20141218, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Small Business", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "You\u2019re the Boss Blog", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s complex picking insurance for yourself and your family,\u201d said a health care policy director for a small-business organization. \u201cIt\u2019s even more complex for a business.", "title": "As Health Insurance Evolves, Traditional Brokers Claim They Still Have a Role", "url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/as-health-insurance-evolves-traditional-brokers-claim-they-still-have-a-role/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/as-health-insurance-evolves-traditional-brokers-claim-they-still-have-a-role/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "As Health Insurance Evolves, Traditional Brokers Claim They Still Have a Role", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 18, 2014"}, "article_summary": "Are traditional health insurance brokers \u2014 the trusted, chatty advisers who are quick to show up at your door at the hint of a problem \u2014 becoming obsolete?\n\u201cBut when it comes to health insurance, it\u2019s a very foreign concept for them.\nAnd neither of us understands what we\u2019re buying.\u201dHealth insurance, Mr. Downs said, is deliberately, and needlessly, complex.\nThey\u2019re going to go quote you five or six pretty standard options.\u201dBut is that winnowing such a bad thing?\nThey\u2019re out of their element\u201d \u2014 while brokers \u201cdo this for a living.\u201dThe health insurance landscape for small businesses is undeniably changing, in no small part because of the Affordable Care Act."}
