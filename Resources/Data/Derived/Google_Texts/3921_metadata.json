David Vitter (R-La.) has expressed openness to Medicaid expansion if he is elected governor of Louisiana on Saturday, and his Democratic opponent, John Bel Edwards, has been an enthusiastic supporter of expansion as well.\n\nMore recently, there was surprising news out of Alabama, as a commission appointed by Republican governor Robert Bentley recommended expansion. Bentley said earlier this month that he is \u201clooking\u201d at the possibility of broadening Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWhat is going to happen is that support for Medicaid expansion will continue to build,\u201d Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell told Atlanta Magazine in an article published Monday. \u201cYou hear the Alabama governor. You\u2019ve heard conversations in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Medicaid expansion hope that if they can get a foothold in the South, other states will follow.\n\nRepublicans run on repealing the ACA, when behind closed doors, they are closely examining ways to expand Medicaid. There are two dynamics driving the change. The clock is ticking towards the 2016 deadline for the federal government to foot the entire bill for Medicaid expansion, and the program has not caused the apocalypse that Republicans predicted.\n\nEven the math-challenged Deep South Republicans understand that they are giving up hundreds of millions of federal dollars for an ideological position on healthcare reform has lost. Signs are growing within all levels of the Republican Party that there are elements of the ACA that have popular support. The idea that the GOP will ever throw away the entire Affordable Care Act is more election year posturing than reality.\n\nRepublicans are trying to save face by doing it \u201ctheir way,\u201d but President Obama has won. Time and persistence are wearing down the last bastion of ACA opposition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The red states are the backbone of the Republican Party, but growing evidence suggests that opposition to ObamaCare expansion is falling apart in the GOP stronghold.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The red states are the backbone of the Republican Party, but growing evidence suggests that opposition to ObamaCare expansion is falling apart in the GOP stronghold.", "title": "Republicans Reeling As ObamaCare Opposition Is Crumbling In Red States", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/11/21/republicans-reeling-obamacare-opposition-crumbling-red-states.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Obama-Smile-full-side-feat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-21T11:17:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,ACA,Obama,Obamacare,republicans expand Obamacare,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-11-21T11:17:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-21T11:17:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, Obama, Obamacare, republicans expand Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "The red states are the backbone of the Republican Party, but growing evidence suggests that opposition to ObamaCare expansion is falling apart in the GOP stronghold.\nMore recently, there was surprising news out of Alabama, as a commission appointed by Republican governor Robert Bentley recommended expansion.\nEven the math-challenged Deep South Republicans understand that they are giving up hundreds of millions of federal dollars for an ideological position on healthcare reform has lost.\nYou\u2019ve heard conversations in Louisiana.\u201dSupporters of Medicaid expansion hope that if they can get a foothold in the South, other states will follow.\nSigns are growing within all levels of the Republican Party that there are elements of the ACA that have popular support."}
