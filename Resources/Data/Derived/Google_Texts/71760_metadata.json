So, as we brace ourselves for another GOP primary defined by \u201ctraditional values,\u201d one question it\u2019s worth asking is: Do these conservatives (and their supporters) have any right to claim the high ground?\n\nRepublicans such as Huckabee and Jindal love to use their religion as a prop: They judge and preach and condemn under the cover of Christianity. And they assume this grants them a kind of moral superiority. Well, it doesn\u2019t. Huckabee and Jindal are political hucksters. They fancy themselves Christians, but their preachments are foul and their values are un-Christlike. They are exactly what many other current GOP candidates are as well: political entrepreneurs. If they climb atop the Christian cross, it\u2019s because they want to be seen by more people. They\u2019re chasing votes, not salvation.\n\nAs the presidential race kicks into gear, Democrats would do well to remember this. For too long the GOP has controlled the moral narrative in this country. Conservatives have wisely appropriated the language of values, but they\u2019re rarely challenged on this front. When Ted Cruz or Ben Carson or Rick Santorum bloviate about family values, someone should ask: What, precisely, are your values? And what are their effects in the real world?\n\nMost conservatives (in today\u2019s GOP, at least) exalt life in the abstract, but they don\u2019t defend it in practice. Whether it\u2019s abortion or capital punishment or contraception or civil rights, they consistently advocate policies that degrade life and run counter to their own values. Despite their avowed humanitarianism, they\u2019ve little regard for human suffering. And that\u2019s because they\u2019re not interested in serving life or other people; they\u2019re dogmatists masquerading as moralizers.\n\nConservatives, for instance, admonish liberals for not protecting the sanctity of life.\n\nBut these same conservatives are often indifferent to the struggles of real people living real lives here and now. They\u2019re not particularly concerned with poverty or inequality or torture or war crimes or a hundred other ethical issues. And they\u2019re never compelled to explain the widening gap between their rhetoric and the political reality they\u2019ve helped create.\n\nTake the GOP\u2019s position on abortion. We know, for example, that banning abortions doesn\u2019t decrease the number of abortions. Sex education, contraception, and access to proper health care \u2014 these are the policies that reduce abortions. And yet pro-life conservatives oppose them at every turn. And they insist on fighting wars they\u2019ve already lost. The Supreme Court, after all, has spoken: abortion is legal in this country. (Although they\u2019re doing everything in their power to turn the clocks back.) But rather than pursue policies that might actually reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancies, something that virtually everyone could get behind, conservatives instead push for policies that actually lead to more, not fewer, abortions. That\u2019s incoherent, and positively stupid, running counter to the ostensible goals of social conservatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a glut of social conservatives announce 2016 campaigns, it's worth examining their ludicrous ideology in detail", "title": "Mike Huckabee is a raging hypocrite: Inside the religious right\u2019s incoherent faux-morality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As a glut of social conservatives announce 2016 campaigns, it's worth examining their ludicrous ideology in detail", "title": "Mike Huckabee is a raging hypocrite: Inside the religious right\u2019s incoherent faux-morality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/08/mike_huckabee_is_a_raging_hypocrite_inside_the_religious_rights_incoherent_faux_morality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/mike_huckabee3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As a glut of social conservatives announce 2016 campaigns, it's worth examining their ludicrous ideology in detail", "title": "Mike Huckabee is a raging hypocrite: Inside the religious right\u2019s incoherent faux-morality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/mike_huckabee3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Christian Fundamentalism, Mike Huckabee, Religion, The Religious Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And they\u2019re never compelled to explain the widening gap between their rhetoric and the political reality they\u2019ve helped create.\nBut these same conservatives are often indifferent to the struggles of real people living real lives here and now.\nMost conservatives (in today\u2019s GOP, at least) exalt life in the abstract, but they don\u2019t defend it in practice.\nConservatives have wisely appropriated the language of values, but they\u2019re rarely challenged on this front.\nRepublicans such as Huckabee and Jindal love to use their religion as a prop: They judge and preach and condemn under the cover of Christianity."}
