This section requires Medicare and Medicaid providers, suppliers and managed care contractors to report and return an overpayment by the later of \u201c60 days after the date upon which the overpayment was identified or the date any corresponding cost report was due, if applicable.\u201d\n\nCMS published a proposed rule applying this provision to Medicare Part A and B overpayments on February 16, 2012. The proposed rule defines when an overpayment is \u201cidentified\u201d as when the provider or supplier has \u201cactual knowledge of the existence of the overpayment or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate indifference of the overpayment.\u201d CMS also stated in the preamble that the 60-day clock would not start running until after the provider or supplier had an opportunity to undertake a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d into the basis of the alleged overpayment \u201cwith all deliberate speed\u201d after receiving information concerning a potential overpayment. The proposed rule also contained a lengthy ten-year \u201clook back\u201d period.\n\nIn the extension announcement, CMS explained that both public and internal stakeholder comments raised \u201csignificant policy and operational issues that need to be resolved in order to address all of the issues raised \u2026 and ensure appropriate coordination with other government agencies.\u201d CMS specifically pointed to the need to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Department of Justice in developing the final rule. These outstanding issues met the Secretary\u2019s standard for showing \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to obtain the rulemaking extension.\n\nThis extension indicates that the agencies recognize the far-reaching impact the final rule will have on the healthcare industry and development of the \u201creverse false claims\u201d theory under the FCA. The deadline for publishing the final rule is February 16, 2016. In the interim, the statutory requirement is in effect in the absence of a final rule.\n\nWe will keep watch for further guidance from CMS on this issue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a one-year extension to its normal three-year deadline to finalize the proposed rule explaining the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 60-Day Rule", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On February 13, 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a one-year extension to its normal three-year deadline to finalize the proposed rule explaining the Affordable Care", "title": "CMS Delays Implementation of the 60-Day Overpayment Final Rule", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/cms-delays-implementation-60-day-overpayment-final-rule", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1092/CMS%20tall%20small_10.jpg?itok=TXiSScrz", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, Health care, CMS, Affordable Care Act, 60-day rule, overpayment, 60-day rule, false claims act, FCA", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, Health care, CMS, Affordable Care Act, 60-day rule, overpayment, 60-day rule, false claims act, FCA"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2649\"", "article_summary": "In the interim, the statutory requirement is in effect in the absence of a final rule.\nWhen Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it amended the Social Security Act to add Section 1128J.\nThe deadline for publishing the final rule is February 16, 2016.\nThe proposed rule also contained a lengthy ten-year \u201clook back\u201d period.\nThis extension indicates that the agencies recognize the far-reaching impact the final rule will have on the healthcare industry and development of the \u201creverse false claims\u201d theory under the FCA."}
