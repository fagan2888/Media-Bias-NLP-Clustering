During that same time, the 230-unit complex has received more than $9.5 MILLION from the federal government to provide \u201cdecent, safe and sanitary housing\u201d to low-income families.\n\nTHE SYSTEM IS BROKEN, and residents, taxpayers and police pay the price.\n\n\n\nDaytona Beach Police officer Ryan Forrest checks out a damaged vehicle while patrolling the property with officer Tearany Hardaway at the Gardens of Daytona Apartments in Daytona Beach on Thursday night. News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nDAYTONA BEACH -- Millions of taxpayer dollars swirl around the Gardens of Daytona every year, but that hasn't been enough to extinguish constant crime on the sprawling apartment property, halt a mold epidemic or keep dishwashers and air conditioners functioning properly.\n\nBy the end of this year, about $9.5 million in federal rent and utility assistance will have been sent to the low-income complex in the city's core since the beginning of 2012. With so much money flowing from Washington, D.C., there are rules for the government, owner, apartment staff and 700-plus residents.\n\nSome are breaking the rules, though, and everyone is paying the price.\n\nPolice have been called to the Gardens of Daytona more than 5,000 times since January 2012, an off-the-charts volume that triggered a city law used to fine the apartments $94,350 for excessive requests for law enforcement. Over the course of the past four years there have been five armed robberies, 19 shootings, 154 assaults, 37 burglaries, 39 narcotics cases, 72 fights, 231 noise complaints and 36 weapons complaints, according to police department records.\n\n\"The last 10 years the crime has become more serious,\" said Nicholas Fiore, a retired Daytona Beach police officer with 29 years on the force who works for the department part time now. \"It's the perception of a place where you can get away with it.\"\n\n\n\nTerra Harp, with her 2-year-old daughter Patience Shellman and 8-year-old son Xavier Reed, has lived at the Gardens of Daytona since 2010. \"We're not all here for handouts, and we're not all criminals and bad people,\" Harp said. \"We're just people in a bad situation with no other place to go.\" News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\n\"There's a lot of apathy,\" said Police Chief Mike Chitwood, who regularly bicycles through the property. \"A lot of people just want to mind their own business and criminals know that.\"\n\nInspections at the apartments over the past 15 years have racked up a less-than-stellar collection of grades, according to reports the News-Journal obtained from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, although those low scores have not blocked the stream of federal dollars to the complex's owner. Last year's inspection ended with failing scores of 54 and 57 for two of the three clusters of buildings in the complex, and notations that all three areas had at least one life threatening health and safety issue, according to the HUD records.\n\n\"We've got bed bugs, cockroaches, rats and mold,\" said resident Terra Harp, a 35-year-old mother of five who has lived at the Gardens of Daytona since 2010. \"They don't care about us. They look at us and they just see dollar signs.\"\n\n'SOUL CITY' IS BORN\n\nBack in 1969, when the Vietnam War was raging and Daytona International Speedway was 10 years old, a large piece of land just east of Nova Road and south of Orange Avenue began to transform into the 32-building Gardens of Daytona. Construction was completed in 1971 on the maze of two-story concrete block buildings covering three city blocks.\n\nThe apartment complex has always been privately owned, and at some point after 1974 it became a place where low-income residents could receive federal government rent assistance through the Section 8 program, now called the Housing Choice Voucher Program. Most families in the 230 units bring in less than $30,000 per year and a good portion of their rent is covered by tax dollars.\n\nPolice Calls Police have been called to the Gardens of Daytona apartments more than 5,000 times since January 2012. Not all of those calls were pleas for help with violent crimes or other felonies. Records show 891 calls, for instance, were classified as \u201cextra patrol,\u201d which means officers checked on the property of their own accord, the property manager asked for increased police presence or the officer was directed there by a supervisor based on recent activity at the apartments. But many of the calls were for serious crimes.

The apartment demographics mirror what U.S. Census data reports for the surrounding neighborhood: predominantly black, single women heading up households and more renters than homeowners in a place with some of the highest crime rates in the city.\n\nSome are third-generation residents of the apartments, unable to break out of the cycle of poverty.\n\nThe broader neighborhood, called Midtown, has the city's highest rates of poverty and illiteracy, Chitwood said. The complex is just outside the boundaries of the Midtown Community Redevelopment Area, which for the past 17 years has received special attention from the city government for improvements.\n\nRULES VERSUS REALITY\n\nApartment managers in property-based voucher programs such as the Gardens of Daytona have the burden of figuring out who qualifies for the rent assistance, and coordinating with both the owner and HUD on everything from purchases to government inspections. Marilyn Baker, who's been the property manager for 10 months, works for Pittsburgh-based NDC Real Estate Management, Inc., which the apartments' owner hired in 2013 to handle day-to-day operations of the complex.\n\nOwners get into contracts with HUD, and owners' properties, rent charges, budgets, contracts and vouchers are monitored by both HUD and the private agencies HUD hires to do most of the checking. Since 2004, the Gardens of Daytona has been monitored by the North Tampa Housing Development Corporation, a private non-profit hired by HUD that monitors 450 HUD contracts throughout Florida covering 120,000 tenants.\n\nApartment owners who request significant HUD funding increases have to go through a rigorous review from agencies such as the one in Tampa, but they also have the option of asking for something akin to a cost of living increase and getting a less involved review. The Gardens of Daytona, owned by low-income housing investor James Kincaid of Cocoa Beach, has used the less thorough review process for more than a decade, said Don Shea, director of the North Tampa Housing Development Corporation.\n\nKincaid has been out of the country since August, according to his asset manager, and could not be reached for comment.\n\nHUD sends out private inspectors it contracts with to check on the condition of properties. Properties that receive a score of 90 or higher aren't scheduled for another inspection for three years. Scores of 80-89 spur the next check in two years, 60-79 are re-checked one year later and those that score below 60 trigger re-inspections in 60 days. A grade of 30 or lower will bring demands for corrective actions and possibly the end of HUD funding.\n\nThe Gardens of Daytona has received scores ranging from 44 to 91 since 2001, HUD records show. Last year's inspection records note reports of bed bugs and damaged fire extinguishers, walls, door locks, stoves, dishwashers, refrigerators, toilets, paint, roofs, fencing and steps. The next inspection is scheduled for this month, and everything from smoke detectors to kitchen sink sprayers will be checked out, Baker said.\n\nAnother type of inspection, which checks behind management, produced ratings ranging from \"below average\" to \"superior\" at the Gardens of Daytona, according to HUD records from 2001 through 2011.\n\nShea said his organization, an affiliate of the Tampa Housing Authority, has done those management site inspections at the Gardens of Daytona over the past decade to verify budget items, check that promised repairs were made and evaluate management. But those visits haven't taken place in Daytona, or at the other places the Tampa agency monitors, for three years because of a contract dispute between HUD and agencies such as Shea's that HUD chooses through a bidding process to oversee voucher program properties.\n\nShea said the dispute went into the federal court system, the private companies won at the appellate level and the U.S. Supreme Court decided in April to not take the case that centered on the way the private companies were chosen by HUD.\n\n\"It used to be we'd go once per year to look at the files and property,\" Shea said.\n\nShea said no one has filled that inspection gap for three years.\n\n\"There's no verification now,\" he said. \"God only knows what they're doing now because there's no eyes out there.\"\n\n\n\nKids strike poses for the camera at the Gardens of Daytona apartments recently amidst a sea of shopping carts. The complex's manager says \"I need the neighbors to get involved and tell me about drugs. I see a lot of little kids, and they deserve to grow up in a safe place.\" News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nA CLOSER LOOK INSIDE\n\nResidents contend that there are plenty of problems at the apartments. They complain about stubborn mildew, rampant gnats, mold that they say gives kids respiratory problems and cockroaches that set off smoke detectors.\n\n\"They'll spend money on a (security) camera but not to kill a bed bug,\" charged 40-year-old Darrian Sanders, who grew up in the apartments. \"Nothing out here is consistent. ... Some of these apartments should be condemned.\"\n\nHarp has had a protracted battle with management over bed bugs, and in August she received a written eviction warning from Baker accusing her of intimidating her neighbors into telling a News-Journal reporter they had mold in their apartments.\n\n\"Just because we're low income they feel they can treat us like this, and it's not cool,\" Harp said. \"We're not all here for handouts, and we're not all criminals and bad people. We're just people in a bad situation with no other place to go.\"\n\nDespite residents' accusations about the condition of the apartments, Daytona Beach code enforcement officers say they only get about two viable cases per year that fall in line with what they monitor. Code Officer Denzil Sykes said earlier this year he helped residents who had rats coming in through a hole in their roof.\n\nTenants who have complaints they don't want to take to the apartment manager can turn to Shea's Tampa organization. Shea said he has a call center that documents problems and contacts the owner.\n\n\"They have to reply to us how they handled it,\" Shea said. \"HUD is notified.\"\n\nSubsidies The Gardens of Daytona has received more than $9.5 million* in federal housing subsidies since January 2012. Here's the breakdown: Rent subsidies: Approximately $2 million per year; 4-year total of $8 million Utility subsidies: $378,168 per year; 4-year total of $1,512,672 *Includes full-year totals for 2015 SOURCE: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\nResidents also have a right to organize tenant associations with elected leaders and meet on the property without the owner or manager present.\n\nDeborah Hallisky, a longtime attorney with Community Legal Services of Mid-Florida in Daytona Beach who recently left the agency, has helped Gardens of Daytona residents learn their rights and navigate HUD rules.\n\n\"They're so afraid if they complain their assistance will be taken away from them,\" Hallisky said. \"They're some of the most protected tenants.\"\n\nDEEPLY ROOTED CRIME\n\nThe 230-unit Gardens of Daytona has had about 116 police calls per month since January 2012, and at the 71-unit Villages at Halifax apartment complex owned by the Daytona Beach Housing Authority that runs along the north side of International Speedway Boulevard there have been a little more than five calls per month over the past two years, according to police records. The Gardens of Daytona has about three times as many apartments, but its monthly average of police calls is 21 times higher.\n\nPolice say a significant portion of the Gardens of Daytona crime is committed either by people living there without being on a lease or non-residents coming onto the property. Harp said her kids have found bags of marijuana and cocaine while playing outside, and most restaurants refuse to deliver food to the apartments because of the crime.\n\nThe Rev. Monzell Ford, who said he spent a lot of his younger years as a member of the Crips gang in south central Los Angeles, has tried to attack the lawlessness. Ford said when he worked at the Gardens of Daytona as an assistant property manager in 2010, some apartments were makeshift neighborhood stores selling everything from soda to marijuana.\n\nFord said it's hard to catch criminals in the complex because \"Soul City is not stupid. They have lookouts everywhere.\"\n\nShane Sarver, an asset manager for the company that owns the apartments, said his agency hires off-duty police to be on the property 20 hours per week.\n\n\"It seems to help,\" Sarver said. \"It's big and it can be a chore monitoring who comes onto the property. We've seen a dramatic improvement with crime.\"\n\nChitwood said his biggest challenge has been the constant turnover of apartment managers, which has made it difficult for him to develop a partnership. But he has high hopes for Baker, who since this summer has allowed officers to use part of her office building for a small police substation and is open to connecting her security cameras to police computers.\n\nBaker has evicted about 20 people over the past year, some for felony convictions, others for violent fights \u2014 including some with hammers.\n\n\"It is hard. I'm not going to lie to you,\" Baker said. \"I need the neighbors to get involved and tell me about drugs. A lot of people like to complain, but sometimes it does take a village.\"\n\nBaker said she \"won't rest until they're all behind bars.\"\n\n\n\nDaytona Beach Police officers Tearany Hardaway and Ryan Forrest talk with Shymond Alderman while patrolling the property at Gardens at Daytona apartments in Daytona Beach on Thursday. Alderman talked to the officers about his hopes of becoming a professional fighter. News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\n\"I see a lot of little kids, and they deserve to grow up in a safe place,\" she said.\n\nREFUSING TO GIVE UP\n\nFord said he interrupted criminal activity so much a few years ago that his life was threatened \"many times.\"\n\n\"Some people there felt like they were in prison and couldn't enjoy their home, and I wasn't OK with that,\" Ford said.\n\nOver the summer, retired Judge Hubert L. Grimes, Volusia County's first black judge, held an event at the apartments for kids that included Chitwood, the Bethune-Cookman University football team, a bounce house and a water slide.\n\n\"There's a lack of trust with law enforcement, and the only way to overcome that is to develop relationships,\" said the 62-year-old Grimes.\n\nAngie Bee, who runs a Christian ministry, has held outdoor movie nights and workshops on things such as domestic violence. Former resident Joy Daniels comes back to help struggling residents.\n\n\"You can be scared of an area, or you can go there and try to help,\" Daniels said.\n\nBelinda McMillian-Haynes, who runs an educational and wellness service in Daytona, also helps residents.\n\n\"Instead of the government doing everything we're just working together,\" she said. \"We've all got to come together. Sitting behind closed doors is not going to do it.\"\n\nChitwood said it's ultimately up to the apartments' owner and management to make things better at the Gardens of Daytona.\n\n\"If you have good management, screen tenants and enforce the rules, the apartment complex will take care of itself,\" the chief said. \"Management has to make a financial, moral and ethical commitment to the tenants that they'll provide a quality of life they're entitled to that's crime-free and bug-free.\"\n\nLIFE AT GARDENS OF DAYTONA\n\n'We never know if there'll be a gunfight'\n\nCrime and poverty are part of everyday life for residents\n\n\n\nDelmetia Joseph doesn't live here anymore. She moved into a motel to escape the mold, bed bugs and rats. But the McDonald's employee still pays her share of the rent. \"I went through three beds and three couch sets,\" she said. \"They've got the same carpet from when they got flooded out. I don't know how they keep that place open.\" News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nDAYTONA BEACH -- Inside some of the garage-sized apartments, mold spreads like cancer. Slabs of raw wood cover broken windows. Bed bugs, cockroaches and rats scurry across soiled black carpet.\n\nOutside, bullet holes scar some of the concrete block walls, and empty 2-inch-square plastic bags that once held marijuana and crack cocaine poke out of the grass like weeds. Dozens of black security cameras attached to light poles and buildings are ever-present sentinels recording 24-7. Kids climb on swing sets with no swings and rusting metal slides as old as their grandparents, and they give each other rides in stolen shopping carts that are a fixture in the courtyards.\n\nWelcome to the Gardens of Daytona, home of more than 700 people, many of whom would be somewhere else if they didn't rely on the federal government dollars sent to the complex to help cover their rent and utility bills.\n\n\"Some people would say this is the place society gave up on,\" said the Rev. Monzell Ford, who moved to Daytona Beach in 2009 specifically to try to improve things at the cluster of two-story apartment buildings located just east of Nova Road.\n\nSince January 2012, there have been more than 5,000 calls to police for everything from armed robberies to burglaries to shootings at the apartments located on the western edge of Daytona's crime-saddled Midtown neighborhood.\n\nTenants are black, white and Hispanic, young and old. Their common thread is they're poor, most making less than $30,000 per year and getting well over half of their rent paid for by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, known to most people as HUD. Their total rent ranges from $623 per month for a one-bedroom apartment to $896 for a four-bedroom apartment, but nearly 120 of them pay nothing and some pay as little as $12 per month.\n\nLocals who remember when the 32 apartment buildings went up from 1969 to 1971 say they were nice when the first few waves of tenants moved in. But over the past 45 years, the property deteriorated along with the quality of life.\n\nThere's little elbow room in the complex. Shouts blast through walls, and front porches cluttered with toys, bikes, plastic chairs and grills provide about six feet of turf and no privacy.\n\nThere is no shortage of noise. Carolyn Smithson, who doesn't work and is at home all day with her 5-year-old daughter, said she can count on ear-splitting fights among upstairs neighbors every night on cue.\n\n\"You can get your own little Jerry Springer Show,\" she said, looking up at the ceiling of her cramped apartment.\n\nDarrian Sanders, a 40-year-old who grew up in the apartments and moved to Holly Hill five years ago to escape the mayhem, said people put \"concert-sized speakers outside at night until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. It's a big party town.\"\n\nManagement staff is gone by 5 p.m., and nightfall also brings rampant drug dealing and casual sex under the stars.\n\n\"It's free game after hours,\" said Sanders, who comes back to the apartments every week to spend time with his mother, who still lives there. \"If you stay here long enough you'll see a fist fight. We never know if there'll be a gunfight.\"\n\n\n\nCarolyn Smithson has family photos taped to her living room wall. She said she's teaching her daughter \"this is not where you want to stay.\" Smithson said a couple of years ago \"someone shot across my porch. I literally had to pull my baby inside. There's still bullet holes in my wall.\" NEWS-JOURNAL/Eileen Zaffiro-Kean\n\nTENANTS AND MANAGEMENT AT WAR\n\nResidents mostly blame apartment staff for the condition of the 230 units, which have rusty, decades-old gas stoves and broken dishwashers that the apartment's manager said are eventually going to be stripped out. Residents say the five maintenance men make Band-Aid repairs, and most of those improvements are tackled only when they know HUD inspectors are coming. Those inspectors, whose reports have the power to choke off the millions of dollars in rental assistance that flows into the Gardens of Daytona every year, are due to be on the property this month.\n\nMarilyn Baker, who's been the property manager for about 10 months, said residents and their visitors are the ones tearing up the property. Baker said the problems are rooted in residents breaking things themselves and not taking care of their homes.\n\nSome residents hiding people living with them who aren't on the lease, or doing illegal things behind closed doors, change their locks and don't let maintenance men in to spray for pests or make repairs, she said.\n\n\"I can't fix what I don't know about,\" said Baker, who has kicked out about 20 residents over the past year, most for violent fights.\n\nSeveral people around the community are trying to fix things at the apartments, too. Ford, the pastor, brought Christian rappers and free food to the apartments on a Sunday afternoon in July. Retired Volusia County Judge Hubert L. Grimes organized an event for kids at the apartments in June that included motivational speakers, a bounce house, water slide and food. Belinda McMillian-Haynes, who lives near the apartments, has helped residents get educations and jobs.\n\nMarianne Maegiore said she's seen things improve in her nine years at the Gardens of Daytona.\n\n\"It's better today than it ever was,\" said Maegiore, who's had her apartment windows broken out twice and lost a lot of her things in the May 2009 floods that deluged the complex with a few feet of water overflowing from the nearby Nova Canal.\n\nThe 61-year-old stayed through all the problems because she's had little choice financially, and because it became home.\n\n\"People ask, 'where do you live?'\" she said. \"When I tell them they say, 'You live there?' I'm proud of it.\"\n\nMaegiore, nicknamed \"the Nana of the Ghetto\" because she's one of the older residents and offers a caring ear for her neighbor's problems, said she's raised her two teen-aged grandchildren in the apartments and maintains \"they love it\" and are \"straight-A students.\"\n\n\"When I first moved in there were a lot of fights, gunshots, drug deals in plain view, crime galore,\" she said. \"Now they know police walk through and it's getting better. ... Change is happening, but it's slow. A lot of people are trying to change things, but there are bad apples.\"\n\nEven Smithson, who said she'll move somewhere with fewer problems the first chance she gets, has made her apartment home for now. A huge smile spread across her face as she proudly pointed to her small daughter's collection of beauty pageant trophies, sashes and crowns that have taken over a set of shelves in her living room. The surrounding walls are dotted with unframed family photos that are kept in place by Scotch tape.\n\n\n\nMarianne Maegiore, right, thanks Pastor Monzell Ford for organizing a recent Sunday afternoon festival. Maegiore is nicknamed \"the Nana of the Ghetto\" because she's one of the older residents and offers a caring ear for her neighbor's problems. News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nBED BUGS AND BURGLARIES\n\nIt's hard to find residents who like their home as much as Maegiore. It's a lot easier to come across tenants such as 26-year-old Delmetia Joseph, who said her apartment became so unlivable with mold, bed bugs and rats that she had to clear out in May and move into a motel \u2014 while she's still forced to pay $178 every month for rent on her empty apartment.\n\nSeeing a rat scamper out of her toddler's bedroom one night while he slept was a low point.\n\nWhen Joseph first moved in a little more than two years ago, she said she brought in furniture that was \"brand-stinking-new.\" But she said within months mold spread over her furniture, carpet, clothes and 3-year-old son's toys.\n\n\"I went through three beds and three couch sets,\" she said. \"They've got the same carpet from when they got flooded out. I don't know how they keep that place open.\"\n\nJoseph said she's spent thousands of dollars covering motel bills and replacing furniture, clothes and toys. As a McDonald's employee who recently got a raise from $8.35 an hour to $9.32 an hour, it's money she didn't have to lose.\n\nBaker said Joseph's claims bear little resemblance to the truth. She said Joseph changed her locks back in June so staff couldn't get inside, and the mold didn't reel out of control until Joseph shut off her power.\n\nJoseph said she's also had to deal with crime. She said one day she came home from work to find someone had broken in through her living room window, grabbed her flat-screen TV along with $500 in cash and took off. Baker said the burglary never happened, and the story was fabricated.\n\nPolice Chief Mike Chitwood said his officers investigated, but neighbors all say they didn't see or hear anything during the break-in that was reported to have happened during the day, so it's been difficult to make a case.\n\nRegardless of whether Joseph's apartment was broken into, there is most certainly crime at the Gardens of Daytona. Women avoid carrying purses in plain sight. It's not uncommon to see police speeding onto the property to chase a suspect.\n\nChitwood said a lot of the crime is committed by \"people who don't belong there.\" The chief said the rest is being committed by a small percent of the residents, but the tenants playing by the rules are unwilling to talk to police.\n\nBETTER THAN THE STREETS\n\nSmithson, whose neighbors provide the Jerry Springer-style fights, said she's still waiting for replacement of her severely stained and worn carpet. Her bathroom vent is rusted and the ceiling has a moldy area about a foot across that's sagging down in a bubble that looks like it's ready to burst.\n\nWhen Smithson's not worrying about something broken in her apartment, which is filled with damaged secondhand furniture and scattered trash, she frets about crime.\n\n\"The worst fight was the year before last,\" she said. \"Someone shot across my porch. I literally had to pull my baby inside. There's still bullet holes in my wall.\"\n\nShe'd love to move. But she said she and her husband, who's trying to get training to become a boat mechanic, can't afford anything else. The couple pay just $73 for their portion of the monthly rent, but she said her disability check that she gets for having seizures has to cover other expenses, too.\n\nHer daughter Julia, who's never known another life, giggled and played with her two puppies while her mother ran through her list of problems.\n\n\"I'm teaching my daughter this is not where you want to stay,\" she said. \"Until I get myself straight this is where I got to be. I'm just grateful I have something. Without this I'd be on the streets.\"\n\nShe said her dream is to have a house with a backyard and \"a swing where my baby can play.\"\n\n\"God will bless me,\" Smithson said. \"I'll keep on trying.\"\n\nGARDENS OF DAYTONA LANDLORD\n\nGardens owner has properties statewide\n\nCompanies have faced legal troubles in housing investments before\n\n\n\nResidents make their way to their apartment past crumbling stairs at the Gardens of Daytona apartments in Daytona Beach. News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nDAYTONA BEACH -- James W. Kincaid lives in Xanadu.\n\nThe 15-story oceanfront tower in Cocoa Beach with $300,000 condos, a private boardwalk, tennis court, heated pool, gym and clubhouse is a galaxy away from the dozens of low-income apartment complexes that Kincaid and his business partners have owned over the years.\n\nThe amenities at Kincaid's Daytona Beach apartment property, the Gardens of Daytona, include a public bicycle path that runs alongside muddy water flowing through the Nova Road canal, a laundry room with no air conditioning, decades-old playground equipment and 32 security cameras watching residents' every move outside. The complex is packed with more than 700 tenants who make less than $30,000 per year \u2014 many less than $15,000 \u2014 and rely on federal government rent subsidies, utility assistance and food stamps.\n\nFew of them could afford Kincaid's $525 monthly condo maintenance fee much less his mortgage. About four of their apartments could fit into the 2,340-square-foot piece of Xanadu that Kincaid bought in 2002.\n\nOne major financial boost Kincaid gets to make the Gardens of Daytona a profitable venture is the roughly $2 million in rent assistance he receives every year from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That $2 million is sent first to the North Tampa Housing Development Corporation, a private nonprofit organization hired by HUD that has monitored the finances and federal government contract with the Daytona apartment complex for the past 12 years.\n\n\"The (Gardens of Daytona) budget is proposed by the owner and is reviewed by my staff for compliance with guidelines and standards set in the regulations and HUD policy,\" said Don Shea, director of the North Tampa Housing Development Corporation.\n\nApartment owners can use both the HUD rent subsidies and remaining portions of rent paid by the tenants for virtually anything connected to running the complex including improvements, maintenance, appliances, property taxes and insurance, Shea said. The owners are required to keep debt to a minimum and maintain reserve accounts that they can only tap with HUD's approval, he said, but whatever is left over after reserves and bills can go for profit.\n\n\"The amount of profit is determined by the market and the extent to which the property is managed to earn any profit,\" said Shea, whose agency, an affiliate of the Tampa Housing Authority, oversees about 450 other rental properties throughout Florida.\n\n\n\nSiding hangs off one of the buildings at the Gardens of Daytona apartments in Daytona Beach. News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nThe 68-year-old Kincaid lives in a world of big numbers and big risks. He's been sued several times, winding up on the losing end of decisions with big-dollar judgments in at least a few of the suits, court records show. He's also faced IRS legal action for not paying personal income taxes for eight years, and one of his companies filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012, records show.\n\nKincaid, who according to his asset manager has been out of the country for the past month, could not be reached for comment. His business is privately held and financial records were not available.\n\nTHE COMPANIES BEHIND THE MAN\n\nRecords kept by the Florida State Department's Division of Corporations list 18 companies, 11 of which are still active, that name Kincaid as the registered agent. About six names, including Kincaid's, repeatedly show up on annual reports as officers within the limited liability partnerships. Kincaid signed many of the documents as vice president, general partner and registered agent.\n\nShane Sarver, an asset manager for Kincaid's Cape Canaveral-based parent organization, The Heritage Companies, said the investors have whittled down their holdings to about 20 affordable residential properties throughout the Southeast, less than half of which are in Florida.\n\nOne of their Florida properties is the Twin Oaks Villas Apartments in Pensacola. Pictures a resident posted online show a nice, clean apartment with attractive furniture.\n\nHere's one review from a Twin Oaks resident posted online a year ago: \"I am pleased with this living facility. I only (wish) the apartments were larger ... Loving the cameras on the property to keep us safe and management informed of what's going on the property.\"\n\nBut another Twin Oaks tenant alleged in a 2012 review that there was no pest control or security, \"the noise is horrible and (it) is drug infested.\" The writer continued that \"the violence out there is ridiculous and the office is not helpful.\"\n\nMany residents of the Gardens of Daytona have equally low opinions about their complex, and they complain about everything from mold to burglaries. The apartments' manager, Marilyn Baker, said she jumps on problems as soon as she hears about them.\n\nKincaid and his group bought the Gardens of Daytona in 2001 for just under $3.2 million, according to Volusia County property appraiser records. The property now has a just value of $5.67 million, records show.\n\nShortly after Kincaid took over the property, Sarver said he used a tax credit program to tackle a multimillion-dollar rehab of the 32-building Daytona complex that included adding central air conditioning, new doors, new windows and more three- and four-bedroom apartments. A city of Daytona Beach Permit & Licensing Division form from June of 2001 lists intended work at the apartments including \"new exterior stucco, grade beams, columns, portico roofs, shingles, interior plumbing, central heat & air, cabinets, patch & paint walls & floor covering.\"\n\nThe \"total valuation of work\" listed on the form was typed in as $7 million, but someone crossed it out and wrote next to it $218,750. A city government building permit with the same date and work information lists the value as $218,750. A 2003 building permit application that lists most of the same improvements also has a value of $218,750.\n\n\n\nTwo-year-old Patience Shellman looks at a book outside her mom's apartment at the Gardens of Daytona Apartments in Daytona Beach. News-Journal/NIGEL COOK\n\nAdditional city permits for the property that go through 2008 show applications for improvements and repairs collectively valued at about $34,000. Online records of the Volusia County property appraiser don't list any large improvements or repairs since 2001.\n\nNot all work requires permits or mentions in property appraiser records. The dozens of security cameras installed last year at the Gardens of Daytona cost a few hundred thousand dollars, and the company spent thousands a few years ago repainting all the buildings, Sarver said. He said the company tries to \"provide a safe and decent living environment.\"\n\nBaker, the property manager, said she generally gets enough money for repairs and new appliances when she submits requests.\n\nTRAIL OF LEGAL TROUBLES\n\nCourt records indicate Kincaid and his partners have spent millions covering judgments and attorneys' fees in lawsuits brought against them and their companies.\n\nOne of their most costly cases stems from Kincaid's 2002 project to build a 92-unit multi-family housing project in Lima, Ohio, according to court records. The project was spearheaded by Waterford Townhomes Limited Partnership, an agency Kincaid was connected to as general partner, records show.\n\nTo build the affordable homes, the Waterford partnership secured a $1.5 million loan from the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, a state government entity that extends financing for low-income housing in Ohio. The agreement was for Waterford to pay back the $1.5 million by September 2012 with annual installments. There was also a provision that called for an additional $1.15 million to be paid in interest, late charges, collection costs and attorneys fees if necessary.\n\nWaterford never made any loan payments, according to court records, and by December 2009 the Ohio Housing Finance Agency filed suit. After a flurry of legal action, in April 2013 an Ohio trial court ordered Heritage and related partners to pay more than $3.5 million. Last year an Ohio appeals court upheld that ruling.\n\nOne of the business partners on the deal has since paid $1.55 million of the total $3.5 million judgement, according to Ohio state government officials.\n\nIn July 2012, two months before the final deadline to pay back the $1.5 million loan, Waterford Townhomes Limited Partnership filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, records show. Kincaid signed the bankruptcy forms as \"debtor.\"\n\nThe eight businesses and two governments seeking money from Waterford listed claims ranging from $143 to $2.3 million.\n\nIt's not clear if all of those claims have been paid, or if the IRS has received the full $254,538 that records indicate the agency sought from Kincaid in unpaid personal income taxes for eight years between 1991 and 2004. At least some of that tax debt has been paid off, records show.\n\nKincaid was involved in at least three other lawsuits. A Brevard County foreclosure case ended in 2009 with a judge ordering Kincaid and some of his business partners to pay Sunrise Bank $2.7 million. A 2002 case brought against the Gardens of Daytona, LTD., and some of Kincaid's other companies ended with a judge's order to pay a debt of a little under $10,000 to Masco Contractor Services Central Inc.\n\nHOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAM\n\nVolusia gets $15 million annually in rent subsidies\n\nDAYTONA BEACH -- Every year, the federal government sends more than $15 million to Volusia County that helps thousands of people in tough financial situations pay their rent bills with taxpayer-funded vouchers.\n\nThe Daytona Beach Housing Authority is currently receiving more than $5.69 million that's helping 1,145 households. The Volusia County Public Housing Agency is getting about $1.8 million per year that's assisting 283 families. The New Smyrna Beach Housing Authority pulls in $1.14 million annually that's spread among 223 households.\n\nThe DeLand and Ormond Beach housing authorities along with a few privately owned apartment complexes are collecting millions more in federal rent assistance.\n\nGovernment housing help in the United States traces its roots back to the late 1930s, nearly a decade into the Great Depression that left so much of the country struggling.\n\nWhen Congress passed the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, the federal government went on a residential building spree and filled the new rental homes with the working poor. The next year, in 1938, the Daytona Beach Housing Authority was founded.\n\nGovernment housing assistance has gone through many iterations in the nearly 80 years since, and one major evolution came in 1974 with the birth of the Section 8 program that has given people with little money far greater choice in where they live. In recent years, the Section 8 program was renamed and became the Housing Choice Voucher Program, but many people still use the old name.\n\nMany of those who benefit from government help live in public housing that's owned by cities' housing authorities. The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides the option of getting federal government help to rent privately owned apartments, condominiums, townhomes and houses that have landlords taking part in the program.\n\nAbout 200 Volusia County rental properties are connected to the voucher program, including the 32-building Gardens of Daytona located east of Nova Road in the city's core area.\n\nSome receiving government housing assistance can even use their voucher to purchase a home.\n\nSome people in public housing get their full rent bill covered by the federal government, while others pay varying amounts up to 30 percent of their income. Housing agencies can also choose to require families to pay a minimum rent of up to $50 per month even if that's more than 30 percent of their income.\n\nTo qualify for a Housing Choice voucher and live in a private rental property, a household can earn up to 80 percent of an area's median income level, but few of most agencies' vouchers go to people making that much money. At least 75 percent of their vouchers have to go to applicants whose incomes do not exceed 30 percent of the area median income.\n\nVolusia County's 2015 median income for a family of four is $51,800. So Volusia voucher holders with four-person households can make up to $42,000 to stay under the 80 percent threshold, $26,250 for the 50 percent limit and $24,250 for the 30 percent cap.\n\nWith high demand for vouchers, applicants wait to get on waiting lists, and then they wait to be considered. It takes years. Renters can apply to multiple agencies to improve their odds.\n\n\"We have such an influx that we only periodically open it for applications,\" said Debbe Noland, the Daytona Beach Housing Authority's voucher program supervisor.", "article_metadata": {"vf": {"unique_id": "art-B6F838C6-8DA6-4861-9314-D4D60247D172-pubDN"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20150920/MULTIMEDIA/150919525", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.news-journalonline.com/global/images/fb/DN.png", "site_name": "News-JournalOnline.com", "title": "High Cost, High Crime: 5K police calls despite millions funneled into Daytona Beach complex"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dbnewsjournal", "card": "summary"}, "publishdate": 20150920, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150919525-pubDN"}}, "keywords": "Crime,  Feature,  Special Report,  Coastal Volusia"}, "article_summary": "Daytona Beach Police officers Tearany Hardaway and Ryan Forrest talk with Shymond Alderman while patrolling the property at Gardens at Daytona apartments in Daytona Beach on Thursday.\nSiding hangs off one of the buildings at the Gardens of Daytona apartments in Daytona Beach.\nDaytona Beach Police officer Ryan Forrest checks out a damaged vehicle while patrolling the property with officer Tearany Hardaway at the Gardens of Daytona Apartments in Daytona Beach on Thursday night.\nTwo-year-old Patience Shellman looks at a book outside her mom's apartment at the Gardens of Daytona Apartments in Daytona Beach.\n\"We have such an influx that we only periodically open it for applications,\" said Debbe Noland, the Daytona Beach Housing Authority's voucher program supervisor."}
