Bill Walker, an independent, has given 45 days\u2019 notice to the Alaska Legislature that he will expand Medicaid under Obamacare with or without their support.\n\nWith Obamacare expansion enrollment far exceeding projections in other states, Alaska would be the 30th state to put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid.\n\nThe program comes with a promise of new federal funding, but states will be on the hook for 5 percent of benefit costs by 2017 and 10 percent by 2020.\n\nObamacare expansion promotional materials from Walker\u2019s administration emphasize the benefit of bringing new federal welfare dollars to the state.\n\nA fact sheet from the Alaska Department of Health & Social Services asserts that expanding Medicaid \u201csaves lives\u201d and \u201cwill bring more than $1 billion in new federal money to Alaska over the first five years.\u201d\n\nThe agency expects Obamacare expansion funds to create \u201c4,000 new jobs\u201d and serve as \u201ca catalyst for reform\u201d of the state\u2019s entire Medicaid program.\n\nIn a statement provided to Watchdog.org, Alaska DHSS health care policy adviser Monique Martin said the state will be even better off if enrollment \u2014 20,000 are expected to sign up in the first year \u2014 is higher than projected.\n\nWalker\u2019s administration is \u201cconfident in the estimates developed by our Medicaid economist,\u201d but higher-than-expected enrollment \u201cwill result in increased states savings to some of those programs that are currently fully funded by the state,\u201d Martin said.\n\nHow wrong have other states\u2019 projections been? By the end of 2014, California and Kentucky had already surpassed projected all-time maximum enrollment; Washington, Nevada and other states are now in the same boat.\n\nIn Ohio, where Republican Gov. John Kasich expanded Medicaid over legislative disapproval and said 366,000 people would enroll from January 2014 to June 2015, enrollment is nearly 600,000 and the program is $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nThe potential Medicaid reforms Walker says could result from the Obamacare expansion will require approval from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Martin said no waiver requests have been submitted yet.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s administration has tried to pressure more governors and state legislatures into expanding Medicaid by threatening to end existing waivers in Florida and elsewhere.\n\nIs that tactic a cause for concern in Alaska?\n\n\u201cAlaska does not have waivers similar to Florida and other states, so this has not been a topic of discussion,\u201d Martin told Watchdog.org.\n\nRELATED: Attempt to force Obamacare expansion on states backfires\n\nEven without taking the $18 trillion national debt and the likelihood of federal funding cuts into account, Alaska will have to start paying a portion of Obamacare expansion\u2019s benefit costs in less than 18 months.\n\nMedicaid expansion states are stuck with higher administrative bills, too, said Dave Morgan, co-founder of Alaskan Center for Sustainable Healthcare Spending & Policy.\n\nWalker\u2019s decision to implement the Obamacare expansion with or without legislative approval \u201cis flawed on several levels,\u201d Morgan told Watchdog.org via email.\n\nThe governor, Morgan said, \u201chas never offered any hard data to back up his claims on economic impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a healthcare economist and have looked at the new total costs of the State of Alaska Medicaid Expansion program,\u201d Morgan explained. By his calculation, Walker \u201cwas off by $135 million dollars for 2016 to 2021.\u201d\n\nMorgan said Alaska\u2019s Medicaid program is a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d that should be fixed instead of expanded, but reforms are unlikely because of the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to grant waiver requests.\n\nObamacare will be especially unsustainable \u201csince our financial circumstances are so bleak with global oil prices at rock bottom and no improvement in that expected for years,\u201d Morgan added.\n\nAlthough the long-term costs of Obamacare expansion represent a serious burden for Alaskan taxpayers, Morgan thinks Medicaid expansion is \u201ca political promise\u201d the governor made to get elected.\n\nWalker beat a Republican incumbent in November with Democrat support after partnering with Lt. Gov. Byron Mallet, the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for governor.\n\n\u201cAfter he got elected, oil revenues plummeted and Alaska is now deficit spending at an alarming rate, but he apparently felt he could not step away from that campaign pledge,\u201d Morgan said.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walker may believe in the dream of Medicaid expansion and all the wonders it will bring Alaska,\u201d Morgan concluded. \u201cThe reality, I think, will be crushing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alaska is about to hop aboard the Obamacare expansion train even as it's hurtling off the rails.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Alaska is about to hop aboard the Obamacare expansion train even as it's hurtling off the rails.", "title": "Alaska governor plans to impose Obamacare expansion on his state - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/bill-walker-state-of-alaska.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T15:13:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/230666/alaska-governor-obamacare-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Alaska is about to hop aboard the Obamacare expansion train even as it's hurtling off the rails.", "title": "Alaska governor plans to impose Obamacare expansion on his state - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/bill-walker-state-of-alaska.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Alaska", "published_time": "2015-07-24T04:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T15:13:12+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "alaska medicaid expansion, alaska obamacare expansion, bill walker obamacare, bill walker medicaid, Alaskan Center for Sustainable Healthcare Spending and policy, dave morgan, david morgan,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b8a\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgAlaska is about to hop aboard the Obamacare expansion train even as it\u2019s hurtling off the rails.\n\u201cGovernor Walker may believe in the dream of Medicaid expansion and all the wonders it will bring Alaska,\u201d Morgan concluded.\nObamacare expansion promotional materials from Walker\u2019s administration emphasize the benefit of bringing new federal welfare dollars to the state.\nAlthough the long-term costs of Obamacare expansion represent a serious burden for Alaskan taxpayers, Morgan thinks Medicaid expansion is \u201ca political promise\u201d the governor made to get elected.\nWith Obamacare expansion enrollment far exceeding projections in other states, Alaska would be the 30th state to put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid."}
