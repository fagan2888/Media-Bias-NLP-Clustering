Take a bow, Jamie Woodruff.

The former fixture at Ponderosa in Parker has been named this year’s winner of the Ben Gregory Award, presented by the Denver Football Officials Association (DFOA).

Woodruff, respected throughout his career, was a three-year starter at Northern Colorado in the secondary. He began his coaching career as a defensive coordinator at Douglas County from 1978-83. He also was defensive coordinator at Ponderosa from 1983-92.

In 1993, he began a head-coaching run that kep the Mustangs relevant for years. Into the 2005 season, Ponderosa enjoyed three 10-0 regular seasons, was named league coach of the year eight times and won the Class 5A state title in 2003, when he also was coach of the year by The Denver Post.

Out of coaching from 2006-08, Woodruff returned to Ponderosa as its defensive coordinator, then served as its head coach for two more years.

The award, named after the late Ben Gregory who had terrific teams at Montbello before moving on to the University of Colorado as an assistant, is presented to a retired coach who was a great facilitator of sportsmanship toward opponents, as well as officials.
