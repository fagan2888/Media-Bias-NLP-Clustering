The Tigers romped in the second half for a 37-17 win over No. 4 Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, followed by an even more dominating performance in which the Crimson Tide thumped Michigan State 38-0 in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nThe Jan. 11 title game in Glendale, Arizona, matches a high-scoring Clemson offense led by quarterback Deshaun Watson against Nick Saban\u2019s latest dominating defense at Alabama, which limited the Spartans to 239 yards.\n\nThere\u2019s another story line to the title game. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney is an Alabama alumnus who played on the Tide\u2019s 1992 national championship team.\n\nNow, he\u2019s going against the greatest coach of this generation. Saban has won three national titles in the last six years at Alabama, to go along with a BCS title at LSU.\n\nClemson and Alabama will be playing for the first time since 2008, when Alabama won 34-10 in a game that signaled the Tide\u2019s return to national prominence under Saban.\n\nThat was also a pivotal year for the Tigers. Embattled coach Tommy Bowden resigned after six games, and Swinney \u2014 who was in charge of receivers \u2014 took over as head coach. Serving at first on an interim basis, he got the job permanently after leading Clemson to bowl eligibility.\n\nNow, he\u2019s got the Tigers within one win of their first national title since 1981.\n\n\u201cI knew that we would be here,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cIt was just a matter of when.\u201d\n\nAlabama is playing for another title after being upset by Ohio State in the semifinals of the inaugural College Football Playoff.\n\nSaban said his team came into this playoff with a different attitude.\n\n\u201cLast year we sort of just participated in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, we really wanted to make a statement and do something special.\u201d\n\nThese teams have been on a collision course since Clemson and Alabama were ranked 1-2 in the second College Football Playoff rankings. They\u2019ve held the top two spots since, leaving no doubt they\u2019re the best teams in the country.\n\nWith Alabama favored by 7 points, Clemson is the underdog for a second straight game. Oklahoma was favored in the Orange Bowl by 4 points.\n\nA look at the semifinals and what to expect heading to the title game:\n\nNO MORE CLEMSONING\n\nA team once known for such inexplicable stumbles that a derisive term was coined for it \u2014 Clemsoning \u2014 blew out the No. 4 Sooners over the final two quarters after trailing 17-16 at halftime.\n\nQuarterback Deshaun Watson turned in another stellar all-around performance, beating Oklahoma with his arm and his legs. The defense did the rest, shutting down Baker Mayfield and a Sooners offense that was averaging 52 points over its previous seven games.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clemson, Alabama are last teams standing in college football", "title": "Clemson, Alabama are last teams standing in college football", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Clemson, Alabama are last teams standing in college football", "title": "Clemson, Alabama are last teams standing in college football", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/01/clemson_alabama_are_last_teams_standing_in_college_football/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/aptopix-playoff-orange-bowl-football.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clemson, Alabama are last teams standing in college football", "title": "Clemson, Alabama are last teams standing in college football", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/aptopix-playoff-orange-bowl-football.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Newberry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Clemson coach Dabo Swinney is an Alabama alumnus who played on the Tide\u2019s 1992 national championship team.\n2 Alabama will face off in the desert for the national championship after dominating wins in the College Football Playoff semifinals Thursday.\n\u201cThis year, we really wanted to make a statement and do something special.\u201dThese teams have been on a collision course since Clemson and Alabama were ranked 1-2 in the second College Football Playoff rankings.\nWith Alabama favored by 7 points, Clemson is the underdog for a second straight game.\nThere\u2019s another story line to the title game."}
