Republicans and Democrats have voted in nearly equal numbers in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, where Democrats have a 13-point registration advantage. Only 10,000 voters have turned out, compared with 17,000 who turned out on the first day of 2010.\n\nNevada isn\u2019t alone. The early voting numbers, a possible indicator of overall turnout, also look bad for Democrats in Ohio.\n\nFortunately for Democrats, Nevada doesn\u2019t really matter. Neither does Ohio. There isn\u2019t a Senate race in Nevada or Ohio, and the states\u2019 Republican governors are expected to cruise to re-election.\n\nSo why am I bringing up the gloomy numbers for Democrats in irrelevant contests for them? Because they highlight the challenge of interpreting early voting data elsewhere.\n\nPhoto\n\nVery few of this year\u2019s competitive contests had close races in 2010. Colorado and Florida are notable exceptions, but Iowa, North Carolina and Georgia didn\u2019t have especially competitive statewide contests four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat\u2019s made it difficult to interpret the early voting numbers in these states. Democrats have emphasized that they\u2019re turning out voters who didn\u2019t participate in 2010. But the better question, and one that\u2019s harder to know, is whether the new voters talked up by Democrats are people who would have participated in 2010 if the states had been competitive. If that\u2019s it, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s amazing news for Democrats.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Democrats need to outdo their mobilization efforts of four years ago, when they lost competitive contests in Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. If that\u2019s right, then Democrats don\u2019t just need voters who didn\u2019t participate in 2010; they need people who wouldn\u2019t have participated in a hypothetically competitive race in 2010.\n\nMidterm Elections 2014 The latest news, analysis and election results for the 2014 midterm campaign.\n\nThe Nevada and Ohio numbers help clarify this analytical conundrum because the two states are the opposite of this year\u2019s contests. Nevada and Ohio were two of the most high-profile contests of 2010. Mostly because these states are now noncompetitive, early voting has plummeted. The big drop-offs highlight that, even in 2010, Democrats were mobilizing large numbers of voters who wouldn\u2019t have participated in a less competitive contest.\n\nOr put another way: There\u2019s nothing about new Democratic voters in Iowa that proves the Democrats are better at mobilizing voters in the battleground states than they were four years ago.\n\nThis is why I am more interested in the early voting numbers from Colorado, the only one of this year\u2019s Senate battlegrounds that was truly competitive four years ago. If the electorate looks about the same as it did in 2010, that will be cause to question whether Democrats are doing a better job of mobilizing voters than in 2010. If they\u2019re outperforming their tallies from 2010, then that might really tell us something \u2014 although the new voting system there that gives every registered voter a mail-in ballot will complicate the comparison. I\u2019ll come back to that when we get some numbers.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141020120455, "twitter": {"description": "Nevada\u2019s early voting numbers highlight the challenge of interpreting the data.
