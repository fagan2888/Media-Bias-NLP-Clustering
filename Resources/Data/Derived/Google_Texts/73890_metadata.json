Shreesh Mysore often places the owls, tummies down, inside a boxlike apparatus and places little headphones over their ears as part of his research into how the birds focus their attention.\n\nThe two professors, who work in Hopkins\u2019 department of psychological and brain sciences, share an interest in the study of attention and hope to find ways to collaborate. They believe their work may lead to a better understanding of how blind people navigate the world, or the cause of disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and autism.\n\nMysore explains how humans use attention to move through the world like this: As children learn to walk, the task requires great concentration. Once they master walking, it becomes almost automatic, requiring less of their immediate attention unless they trip or run into something. They store the knowledge of how to walk as a memory.\n\nMysore and Moss believe bats and owls also use memory to navigate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an observation over the years that bats make mistakes,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThey make sounds but aren\u2019t listening to the echoes. So if they make mistakes, we infer that they\u2019re relying on memory.\u201d\n\nMoss\u2019s bat lab is covered in black soundproofing material and features a battery of high-speed cameras lined up on the wall and 32 microphones. On a recent day, Wu-Jung Lee, a postdoctoral researcher, was hunched over a laptop on the floor, testing audio of moths\u2019 wings flapping. Lee brought in a luna moth in on a string harness to demonstrate how they would record the sound of the insect, and then replay it later with bats in the room.\n\nSuch experiments, in which the bats\u2019 movements would be captured on the high-speed cameras and their squeaks recorded on the audio equipment, are an attempt to learn more about how bats process information. Moss has about 70 bats representing four different species for her work.\n\nMoss said some blind people use a sort of echo-location \u2014 tongue clicks \u2014 to navigate, and once had a group of them visit the lab.\n\n\u201cWe invited them to the lab thinking we could ask them questions we couldn\u2019t ask the bats,\u201d she said. \u201cThey use a combination of echo-location and memory and experience. I thought, of course this is true for the bats as well.\u201d\n\nIn Mysore\u2019s experiments, once the owl is still, he sticks electrodes as thin as a human hair into its brain while the room is darkened. The owl watches a giant TV screen where white dots flash occasionally against a black background, and various noises are played through headphones. The researchers simultaneously monitor the owl\u2019s brain activity to determine how the owl\u2019s neural circuits are processing the competing demands for attention.\n\nMysore said it\u2019s not well understood how disorders like ADHD, where there\u2019s an inability to focus attention, and autism, where attention is hyper-focused, occur. Much is known about how the brain processes one thing at a time, he said, but not the competing demands for attention that are common in the real world.\n\nBy doing the research with the owls, Mysore said, he\u2019s learning more about how their brains determine which thing requires more immediate attention \u2014 the sound or the white dot \u2014 and what that means.\n\nSuch experiments can\u2019t be performed on humans, Mysore said. \u201cWe are very far from figuring out what is going on in the neural circuits,\u201d he said.\n\nHopkins is building new cages for the owls and bats for the building\u2019s roof, which are expected to be ready by the spring. They\u2019ll have heaters in the winter and the professors hope they will offer a more natural home for the animals than the cages in the basement.\n\nThe roof cages, will, of course, be separated and the animals wouldn\u2019t be able to see each other.\n\n\u201cOwls are carnivorous,\u201d Moss said, \u201cso they would eat the bats if they could.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BALTIMORE \u2014 What can we learn about attention by studying bats and owls?
