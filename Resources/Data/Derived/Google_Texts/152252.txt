Around 4:30 p.m. Saturday Coast Guard officials responded to an injured diver who was diving about five miles south of the Panama City Pass.

Officials followed the vessel into the downtown Panama City Marina and boarded her boat to check on her condition.

People on the same boat say the woman was struggling to come get on the boat after diving and may have overexerted herself.

Officials continued to talk with the men to find any more information about the woman's condition earlier that day.

The woman was conscious when the Coast Guard responded but was still disoriented.

EMS took her to Bay Medical Center where she is expected to be okay.
