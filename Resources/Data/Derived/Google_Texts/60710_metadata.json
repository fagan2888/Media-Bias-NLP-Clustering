The FTC and Congress are monitoring the impact these any mergers would have on competitive balance and \u2013 in turn \u2013 the consumer. Mergers aside, current growth rates have these five players accounting for 54% of the market share by 2019.\n\nUsing historical industry data, Kaulkin Ginsberg projects the total revenue and bad debt levels for the health insurance market through 2019 in the chart below. We chose to keep our outlook conservative by limiting the growth in bad debt as a percentage of total revenue to current estimates.\n\nAnalyzing our chart, we gather two very important pieces of information:\n\nHistorically \u2013 and into the future \u2013 insurance companies maintain a very low bad debt level of approximately 0.30%. Although this bad debt level has held constant in the past, it\u2019s expected to rise slightly over the next three to five years. A 0.30% bad debt level sounds low, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind the total value of this bad debt. In 2014, 0.30% of write-offs accounted for more than $2 billion in bad debt, and 2019 is conservatively estimated to account for more than $2.4 billion in bad debt.\n\nNormally insurance providers wouldn\u2019t insure individuals deemed \u201crisky\u201d or \u201ctoo costly.\u201d However, the launch of Obamacare mandated insurance for all U.S. citizens and increased the cost for insurers by removing their right to deny coverage. The result has been a significant rise in bad debt that is outpacing the growth of net income, and a greater need for outsourced ARM services.\n\nWe are happy to talk with you about growth opportunities within the healthcare market or another sector.
