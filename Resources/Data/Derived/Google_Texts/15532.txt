In less than a week, South Dakota voters will know who will represent the state in the U.S. Senate.

All four candidates vying for the U.S. Senate seat appeared in our KELOLAND studio for an hour-long debate Wednesday.

Former South Dakota Republican Governor, Mike Rounds and Democrat Rick Weiland along with Independent candidates Larry Pressler and Gordon Howie all took part.

The forum included questions about the top issues facing the country and South Dakota including the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Affordable Care Act and Gun Control.

Due to the debate, Survivor will not be airing at its normal time. Instead, you can catch the entire show on Thursday morning at 1:12 a.m., so you may want to set your DVR.
