That makes no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nWhat they heard instead was a retelling of his own up-from-his bootstraps personal story, raised in poverty, rising to become an accomplished surgeon, a story he told with occasional self-deprecating humor.\n\n\"As a youngster I wasn't the kind of person you would have thought was ever going to become a doctor. I was a terrible student and my nickname was 'dummy', that's what everyone called me.\"\n\nAnd they heard a message of conservative, small government values. A simplified flat-tax system based on the Biblical model of tithing. Less regulation, more control returned to the states.\n\n\"It was never intended for the federal government to be in all aspects of our lives. They've got enough to do to protect us, which is one of their biggest jobs and they're not doing it the right way.\"\n\nSurprisingly given his past statements and background, he only touched on Obamacare obliquely in his remarks, but during the interview defended his previous comments, saying it had changed the basic relationship between Americans and their government.\n\nHe also said he favors immigration reform, which would allow undocumented immigrants to remain in the US as \"guest workers,\" but only after first securing the borders.\n\nThe next stop for Carson is Las Vegas, where he will speak to a convention of Latino leaders.
