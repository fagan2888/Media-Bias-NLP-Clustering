It\u2019s the kind of practice where one doctor might treat three generations of a single family, and patients sometimes drop off a homemade pie at the office to say thanks.\n\nSo it surprised Curran when he got a call earlier this year from a Florida-based company, United MSO of America, that wanted to explore an investment in the Lakeland Medical Associates practice \u2014 suggesting a \u201cbig numbers\u201d price tag, Curran said.\n\nThe would-be investors said they could help the family medicine group save money by trying \"new models of care\" to pocket greater payments from insurers, said Curran, who declined to specify the dollar amounts discussed. \u201cOur feeling was the only way you could get those numbers back out of our practice would be to do some things with our patients and to our patients that would not be appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\nCurran\u2019s experience appears to be part of a trend in Texas. Sensing a new vein of potential profits to be mined in the multibillion-dollar health care industry, a small but growing number of private equity firms is seeking to buy into primary care practices, interviews with doctors and financial analysts suggest.\n\nPolicy shifts in the way public programs like Medicare pay for care, financial factors such as low interest rates and changing employment preferences among young doctors are aligning to intrigue investors, experts said.\n\nConsolidation in health care is nothing new, and private equity firms have for years been buying up specialty practices in areas like anesthesiology and radiology. In 2014, the value of health care buyout deals in the United States increased to $15.6 billion, a 60 percent increase from the previous year, according to a recent report from consulting firm Bain and Company.\n\nBut the influx of private-equity firms chasing profits in Texas' primary care practices appears to be a recent phenomenon, and it\u2019s unsettling some physicians in the fiercely independent Lone Star State \u2014 which has one of the highest rates of doctors practicing privately in the country, according to the Texas Medical Association. Representatives for several independent practices in Texas \u2014 who asked not to be identified for reasons of financial privacy \u2014 said investors have approached them aggressively, in some cases as often as twice per month.\n\nDoctors like Curran worry that selling the family practice would cost them independence and could mean less personalized care or higher costs for their patients.\n\n\n\nBut investors say they aren't interested in micromanaging doctors' offices. Rather, they see an opportunity for cost-saving innovation as the health care economy changes from a fee-for-service payment system, which pays doctors for each service they provide, to a value-based care model, which rewards doctors for providing cost-effective treatments. The Obama administration has said it wants 50 percent of payments from Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly, tied to value-based care by 2018.\n\n\"There\u2019s been this enormous uptick in hedge funds and even bond funds as well as private equities not interested in acquiring physicians\u2019 practices but having control over their patient base,\" said Derron DeRouin, chief operating officer at United MSO of America. \"It's kind of an ideal model because it allows physicians to maintain their autonomy \u2014 keep their practice, essentially \u2014 but to be capitalized and grouped together to leverage these numbers and leverage these patients, primarily to the independent provider's advantage.\"\n\n\"There's been a lot of interest within the state of Texas,\" he said. \"It's an obvious target.\"\n\nBut it's unclear whether the trend will prove profitable in the long term, experts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d said Kim Ross, a health care consultant and former lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association. \u201cIf you go into a disciplined organization that\u2019s got the right platforms and the right incentives and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 physician leadership, the savings are astronomical.\"\n\nPrivate equity firms are \u201cby definition less risk-averse, and it seems to me they\u2019re placing a fairly substantial bet that all these cats can be herded,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThere are benefits to consolidation, like improved efficiency and better data management, said state Rep. John Zerwas, R-Richmond, an anesthesiologist. His Greater Houston Anesthesiology practice merged in 2012 with U.S. Anesthesia Partners, backed by investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe. The group now boasts more than 1,000 anesthesia providers and is better positioned to treat patients more cheaply and effectively, Zerwas said. (The Texas Medical Board estimates there are about 3,500 practicing anesthesiologists in the state.)\n\n\u201cEssentially, nothing changed in terms of how we deliver the anesthesia care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve needed a system that really values quality and efficiency, rather than what I call a productivity system, where people are getting paid regardless of outcome.\u201d\n\nConsolidation is occurring in virtually every area of the health care sector, experts said. Large hospital systems, such as Baylor and Scott and White, have merged, and others have purchased physician practices. Health insurance giant Aetna this month announced a $37 billion agreement to buy its smaller rival Humana.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s put pressure on doctors\u2019 groups to merge as well. Providers must negotiate prices with the health plans and hospitals they contract with, and larger groups have more bargaining power, Zerwas said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re finding that they have to be bigger, stronger, integrated organizations in order to be viable in the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n\nCompared with previous waves of consolidation in the health care market, there are \u201cdifferent X factors\u201d this time around, Ross said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s different technology, and a younger physician population that is arguably not only more tech savvy, but has different expectations about what they want to be as physicians as a business,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd those changing market forces could be attractive for venture capitalists and private equity firms, which are more likely to take on financial risk. New payment models, such as a recent move to \u201cbundled payments\u201d in Medicare to pay for knee and hip replacements, offer investment opportunities, said Dan Hosler of the private equity firm Sterling Partners.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be some interesting business models where you can really invest against that,\u201d he said.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the health care economy has shown sustained growth compared with other sectors.\n\n\u201cFrom a venture capital standpoint, there are very few places to make money in the market right now,\u201d said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. Interest rates are low, and with falling oil prices and uncertainty in international financial markets like Greece hurting the market, \u201chealth care is really the growth opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nFinancial analysts also raised the possibility that Texas could expand its Medicaid program in coming years using federal money under the Affordable Care Act, potentially bringing another million Texans into the health insurance system \u2014 though the state\u2019s Republican leadership has so far vehemently opposed any such move. Medicaid in Texas largely operates under a privatized managed care system, a value-based model in which primary care doctors serve a central role as gatekeepers for patients seeking specialty treatment. Investors looking to buy family practices may be hedging their bets that the politics of Medicaid expansion in Texas will change in the coming years, leading to new opportunities to contract with the state.\n\nMeanwhile, many doctors find themselves wondering how long they can remain in independent practice. The Texas Medical Association recently announced a joint program with insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas meant to help doctors transition to new payment models and \u201coffer physicians options to remain independent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe forces are aligned to force consolidation, and frankly, how those independent doctors are able to compete against well-heeled, deep-pocketed systems or networks is going to be a problem,\u201d Banning said. \u201cTo me the question becomes, if a for-profit, publicly traded or privately held venture capital fund owns these doctors, what\u2019s their fiduciary duty to the patients? This is a market that\u2019s going to force changes.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: The Texas Medical Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas and Baylor Scott and White are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.
