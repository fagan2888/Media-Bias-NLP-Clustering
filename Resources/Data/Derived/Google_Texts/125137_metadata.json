It\u2019s immigration now, but, as commentators as disparate as New York Magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait and George W. Bush administration executive power maven John Yoo have pointed out, for a future president it could be taxes, environmental laws, workplace safety protections or elements of Obamacare that get nonlegislative overhauls when an administration uses its prosecutorial discretion (the executive tool of the moment) to curb enforcement of those laws. Stymied by gridlock? No longer \u2013 presidents are finding new and inventive uses for their executive powers. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that we\u2019re not allowed to lift a finger to fix the broken immigration system until Congress acts,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday. The administration certainly has latitude in this area but at some point lifting a finger becomes building enduring detours around the legislative process.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Barack Obama]\n\nAs I said, Obama is right on the substance of the policy; the immigration system needs fixing and what he plans \u2013 deferring deportations for up to 5 million people here illegally, giving some of them work permits \u2013 is a good step. Republicans argue that he had his chance when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and that he should now wait for Congress to \u201cwork its will.\u201d But the GOP, too, has had its chance \u2013 the House couldn\u2019t be bothered to vote on a bipartisan Senate bill which, no small matter, almost certainly would have passed.\n\nAnd Obama might be right on the politics. While a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll out this week shows people disapprove of him acting alone, process issues rarely move voters, a fact underscored when they expressed their frustration with gridlock by giving the filibuster party a Senate majority. Assuming voters don\u2019t suddenly develop a keen interest in process, Obama\u2019s baiting the 2016 GOP primary field: Which prospective nominee can most loudly promise to roll back Obama\u2019s \u201camnesty\u201d?\n\nBut one problem eclipses the substance: The president is redirecting our national immigration policy by himself. As the New York Times noted this week, no less an authority than Obama has in recent years said that what he\u2019s doing was beyond his authority. \u201cThe problem is that, you know, I\u2019m the president of the United States, I\u2019m not the emperor of the United States,\u201d he said on a Google Hangout last year. \u201cMy job is to execute laws that are passed.\u201d And execute them faithfully, at that, and with care \u2013 not simply as is convenient or even compassionate.\n\nThe president\u2019s plan is the latest example in a disturbing trend of political norms \u2013 \u201can implied understanding of what sort of behavior is acceptable,\u201d as Chait nicely sums it up \u2013 being dispensed with in this era of any-means-necessary politics. These were the unwritten rules of governance: The filibuster was used rarely, not as a standard requiring a 60-vote supermajority to pass anything in the Senate, for example, while the notion of using the prospect of a government shutdown or debt default as a tool of extortive policymaking was unheard of. So, too, prosecutorial discretion was less a matter of policy development than efficiency.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Immigration]\n\nObama defenders note that previous presidents \u2013 including Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush \u2013 have used executive authority to unilaterally extend amnesty along the lines that the current president reportedly plans to. But this reading of history is akin to the GOP\u2019s pointing to instances of policy changes accompanying debt ceiling increases as precedent for their attempts at economic hostage-taking: It is superficially true but lacks context and scope. Prior debt ceiling deals involved marginal issues, not the major policy concessions that Republicans wanted to extract from Obama. Likewise, as The Associated Press reported this week, neither Reagan nor Bush \u201cfaced the political uproar widely anticipated\u201d in the run-up to Obama's action. \u201cTheir actions were less controversial because there was a consensus in Washington that the 1986 law needed a few fixes and Congress was poised to act on them.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a redirection of policy, in other words, but a refinement.\n\nProsecutorial discretion isn\u2019t a new tool in the executive toolbox, but it\u2019s being used in a new way. How will a President John Kasich or a President Scott Walker or, heaven help us, a President Ted Cruz use it? On one level, the devil is in the details. Obama has articulated authority in immigration law that may be absent in other areas, though it\u2019s worth noting the last Republican president had no problem relying on inherent executive authority.\n\nTellingly, when White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer was asked about this scenario at a breakfast this morning sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, he dodged the question, first arguing the Obama's action on immigration is in keeping with his predecessors and then adding, \"We live in a world where there is nothing the president does \u2026 that comes without significant Republican opposition. ... Getting out of bed every morning comes with Republican opposition. So if the test is that you can only do things that are not going to get make some Republicans very mad we would do nothing. That may be what they want but that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to act.\" No answer, in other words, to the question of how Democrats will feel when a Republican president takes the same attitude.\n\n[READ: Obama's Immigration Power Grab Will Backfire]\n\nMore broadly, you can be sure the 45th president, regardless of party, will follow the path trod by his or her 21st-century predecessors in finding extralegislative ways to enact their policies. George W. Bush did it quietly, with his signing statements. Obama has turned such executive action into a kind of political performance art. Does anyone really think that future presidents will be content to flail helplessly in the face of an uncooperative Congress? That would run contrary to the history of the modern presidency, which has been one of steady (and then rapid) accumulation of executive power. Harry Truman running against the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Congress won\u2019t be the model any more, it\u2019ll be Obama bypassing it.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Op-Ed [Opinion]", "title": "Obama's Executive Action on Immigration Reform Sets a Dangerous Precedent", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Obama may be right on the substance of immigration reform, but he's setting a dangerous precedent.", "title": "The Unilateral Presidency", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/11/21/obamas-executive-action-on-immigration-reform-may-set-dangerous-precedent", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/72/435a6a5f7cf3bc63060163df665bdc/media:edcb848380b84ddca18acf9e9be1c87aObamaImmigration.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obama's Executive Action on Immigration Reform Sets a Dangerous Precedent", "description": "Obama may be right on the substance of immigration reform, but he's setting a dangerous precedent.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Nov. 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert Schlesinger,Obama, Barack,Obama administration,immigration reform,immigration,picks,Op-Ed [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Obama may be right on the substance of immigration reform, but he's setting a dangerous precedent."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41e7\"", "article_summary": "No answer, in other words, to the question of how Democrats will feel when a Republican president takes the same attitude.\nBush \u2013 have used executive authority to unilaterally extend amnesty along the lines that the current president reportedly plans to.\nBut one problem eclipses the substance: The president is redirecting our national immigration policy by himself.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s decision to unilaterally reform the immigration system is by and large right on the substance, but I fear he is dangerously wrong on the precedent he is setting.\nObama has articulated authority in immigration law that may be absent in other areas, though it\u2019s worth noting the last Republican president had no problem relying on inherent executive authority."}
