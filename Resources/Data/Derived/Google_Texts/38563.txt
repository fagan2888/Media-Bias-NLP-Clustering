One of the 56 World War II vintage military planes making a flyover of the National Mall Friday had to make an emergency landing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

The Curtiss SB2C Helldiver landed at 12:43 p.m. after a mechanical issue was detected. No one was injured, but the plane had to be towed off the runway, delaying flights at the airport, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.

The flyover was to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.

According to organizers, the vintage planes took off from both Culpeper Regional Airport and Manassas Regional Airport before aligning in formation to fly over the National Mall.

The spectacle of the low-flying vintage planes drew crowds to the mall Friday.

Over the weekend, several of the historic planes that participated in the flyover will be on display at the National Air and Space Museumâ€™s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.
