And, while much ink has already been spilled dissecting the debate and its implications from nearly every conceivable angle, much of that coverage has been problematic, to say the least.\n\nAt the core of this debate is the extent to which the religion of Islam is responsible for the violence of ISIS, and other atrocities often committed in the name of god. But the problem with such debates, as I\u2019ve argued previously, is that they mistake cause and effect. Religious belief is ultimately historically contingent: Religious beliefs, like cultural beliefs, are shaped by the material circumstances that give rise to them.\n\nThose, such as Maher and Harris, who wish to defend \u201cliberalism\u201d against the tyranny of \u201creligious fanaticism\u201d are attempting to shift the blame from actual historical circumstances to ephemeral ideologies. Should we blame the rise of ISIS on \u201creligious fanaticism,\u201d or on the failed 2003 invasion of Iraq, the de-Baathification policy, the disbanding of the Iraqi army and the disastrous regime of Nouri al-Maliki? Furthermore, there is a long history of colonial oppression, military aggression and economic hegemony. These complaints, as well as historical grievances relating back to the Crusades, inform the views of radicals like Osama bin Laden.\n\nFurther, while the violence of ISIS is put in terms of a \u201ccaliphate\u201d and religious symbols, such strategic violence has been deployed in war for centuries. The political scientist Stathis N. Kalyvas has written a rather comprehensive essay on the military tactics of ISIS and how they relate to other guerrilla fighters. He notes,\n\nthere is nothing particularly Islamic or jihadi about the organization\u2019s violence. The practices described above have been used by a variety of insurgent (and also incumbent) actors in civil wars across time and space. Therefore, easy cultural interpretations should be challenged. Third, if the Islamic State ought to be characterized, it would be as a revolutionary (or radical) insurgent actor \u2026 Revolutionary groups can appropriate a variety of other causes (nationalism, ethnic or sectarian identities), but their revolutionary identity is central and helps make sense of much of their activity.\n\nSimilarly, the best way to understand Osama bin Laden is not as a religious radical yearning for virgins in the afterlife, but rather as a political actor repelling what he sees as a colonial incursion. This is the preferred interpretation of Michael Scheuer, a former CIA analyst who spent three years hunting Osama bin Laden. He writes in \u201cImperial Hubris,\u201d\n\nOne of the greatest dangers for Americans in deciding how to confront the Islamist threat lies in continuing to believe \u2014 at the urging of senior U.S. leaders \u2014 that Muslims hate and attack us for what we are and think, rather than for what we do. The Islamic world is not so offended by our democratic system of politics\u2026\n\nHe argues that, \u201cWhat the United States does in formulating and implementing policies affecting the Muslim world, however, is infinitely more inflammatory.\u201d So rather than seeing terrorism as the outgrowth of religion, it stems from, \u201cthe Muslim perception that the things they love are being intentionally destroyed by America that engenders Islamist hatred toward the United States \u2026\n\nThis leads to the core delusion pushed by the Maher/Harris/Dawkins \u201cNew Atheist\u201d team: that religion exists independently of social, political and economic systems, and that religion influences these structures. In fact, the opposite is true: Religion is largely the handmaiden of economic and political power. It is fluid, able to mold to whatever needs are suited to those wielding it.\n\nAs Karl Marx writes,\n\nThe mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.\n\nHis colleague Friedrich Engels adds in a letter to Franz Mehring,\n\nIdeology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, indeed, but with a false consciousness. The real motives impelling him remain unknown to him, otherwise it would not be an ideological process at all. Hence he imagines false or apparent motives.\n\nWhile these ideas seem radical, there are important real-life examples of the ways in which changes in material structures shift cultural norms (or ideology). Take, for instance, birth control. The advent of birth control (a material change) has dramatically changed our political, cultural and legal superstructure. Women rapidly joined the workforce and elite educational institutions were almost entirely reshaped. As contraception has improved, social norms against sexual promiscuity have declined. Regardless of what religious people believe, their opposition to birth control was rooted in a simple, but now outdated, calculation: Premarital sex used to bear very large costs in the form of children and disease and these costs have been minimized. Jeremy Greenwood has demonstrated persuasively that the sexual revolution has been rooted in profound material changes, which have altered cultural norms.\n\nThese days, religions are already shifting to accommodate this sexual change, just as the church has accommodated to largely accept divorce, will sooner than later accommodate to accept gays, and will eventually accept other norms now considered odd. As population growth presses on economic and environmental constraints, stigmas about contraception and abortion will inevitably erode. And yet the religious texts will remain the same; they will simply be interpreted differently. This sounds extreme, but of course it is not. A brief glimpse at the history of theology shows that it has always been embedded and interpreted by a society under ideological blinders. Views on the trinity were decided by Constantine. The initial Sunni-Shiite divide was largely a political one, not a question of doctrine. This isn\u2019t to degrade religion, but simply acknowledge the fact that it is understood by humans, with their attendant biases. As an example, Paul\u2019s dictum, \u201che who does not work, neither shall he eat,\u201d is popular with both V.I. Lenin and Michele Bachmann. Religion is not simply something given from above, it is something believers wrestle and engage with.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In every heated conversation about faith and violence, there's one thing that everybody gets wrong", "author": "Sean McElwee", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In every heated conversation about faith and violence, there's one thing that everybody gets wrong", "title": "What we really talk about when we talk about religion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/19/what_we_really_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_religion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/maher_pope.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In every heated conversation about faith and violence, there's one thing that everybody gets wrong", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/maher_pope.jpg", "title": "What we really talk about when we talk about religion", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "What we really talk about when we talk about religion", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Affleck, Bill Maher, Christianity, Editor's Picks, Islam, Karl Marx, Marxism, New atheists, Religion, Sam Harris", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This isn\u2019t to degrade religion, but simply acknowledge the fact that it is understood by humans, with their attendant biases.\nAs Karl Marx writes,The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life.\nThe advent of birth control (a material change) has dramatically changed our political, cultural and legal superstructure.\nIn fact, the opposite is true: Religion is largely the handmaiden of economic and political power.\nReligion is not simply something given from above, it is something believers wrestle and engage with."}
