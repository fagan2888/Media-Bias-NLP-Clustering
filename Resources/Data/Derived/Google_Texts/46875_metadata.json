Turns out he believes in religious liberty.\n\nDunh-dunh-dunh!\n\nAs the progressive left and allies in the media continue their tenacious campaign to limit this \u201cfirst freedom\u201d (so called because religious liberty clauses are the first ones mentioned in the First Amendment in our Bill of Rights), university president Ben Sasse has gotten in their crosshairs for strongly emphasizing his commitment to same.\n\nThe language in question makes the claim that the Constitutionally protected \u201cfree exercise of religion\u201d is \u201cnot a negotiable issue.\u201d What\u2019s more, according to the campaign web site, \u201cHe will fight for the right of all Americans to act in accordance with their conscience.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re as alarmed as I am. There\u2019s more (Trigger warning: flagrantly inaccurate description of legal challenge):\n\nThe passage on his campaign website comes under the heading of Sasse\u2019s views on \u201creligious liberty\u201d and is prefaced by his take on Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius, one of two recent cases heard by the Supreme Court that challenges the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate on the grounds of religious freedom, in which an order of Catholic nuns challenges the requirement that they fill out a form to seek a religious exemption to the law. \u201cWe live in a country where the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns, must sue the government in order to continue caring for the sick and elderly poor,\u201d the website says. \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nI know how deeply distressing it must be to be on the opposing side of a class action lawsuit filed in the name of \u201cThe Little Sisters of the Poor.\u201d I don\u2019t think \u201cTenaciously fought the Little Sisters of the Poor!\u201d is something any of us would like on our tombstone. I get it, the pressure to make the government sound less cartoonishly bad must be serious.\n\nAnd MSNBC here is, in fact, parroting the White House\u2019s talking points and legal case defending itself. Not normally what a \u201cnews\u201d organization should be in the business of, but they\u2019re sadly not the only media outlet doing pro bono work for the Obama administration.\n\nIt is true that the Little Sisters of the Poor are being compelled under threat of government force to sign a form. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad. It\u2019s not true, however, that the form represents an opt-out. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty describes it as a mandate to hire others to do the work the Little Sisters refuse to do. Or it could be considered not a form so much as a voucher \u2014 which authorizes a third-party to provide services that violate their religious views, including the view that its wrong to deny a certain subset of the population their very humanity.\n\nMSNBC says \u201cthe White House has repeatedly noted religious employers can obtain exemptions that keep them out,\u201d which raises the question of why the Little Sisters of the Poor is the 72nd (!) lawsuit to be filed by groups not meeting the criteria for such exemptions. At one point in this HHS kerfuffle, a Catholic sister dryly noted that Jesus himself couldn\u2019t get an exemption, since one of the requirements for same was that you couldn\u2019t serve people who weren\u2019t your coreligionists.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the U.S. Supreme Court doesn\u2019t take the same dismissive attitude as, say, the Los Angeles Times has taken here. As the Becket Fund reports:\n\nAfter the trial court and Tenth Circuit denied a preliminary injunction, on New Year\u2019s Eve Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted the Little Sisters a temporary injunction protecting them from enforcement of the mandate, which was scheduled to take effect against them at midnight. On January 24, 2014, the entire Supreme Court granted the Little Sisters an injunction pending appeal, protecting them from enforcement while they litigate their appeal at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. That briefing has now been completed and the parties are awaiting a hearing date from the court.\n\nBut back to this scary Sasse guy and his scary views on religious liberty.\n\nMSNBC uses the Constitutional defense of religious liberty to scaremonger about Muslims. Note the unsourced claims wondering whether religious liberty should actually extend to people who aren\u2019t Katharine Jefferts Schori\u2018s co-religionists.\n\nThe phrasing of his support for religious freedom on the website has some questioning if Sasse believes it is acceptable to commit a crime as long as it is in accordance with one\u2019s religious beliefs. Such a belief could indicate a support for Sharia law, an issue many conservatives have warned about in recent years.\n\nReligious liberty: How do it work?\n\nI would assume the inability to in any way substantiate the idea that \u201csome\u201d are \u201cquestioning\u201d why Ben Sasse wants Muslims to commit crimes against everybody speaks for the general quality of this rewrite of Think Progress propaganda.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure that once Nebraskans learn that Sasse openly supports the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is going to destroy his campaign. He may even be forced to leave his state once this vigorous defense of liberty becomes better known.\n\nKeep up the good work, MSNBC.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 16 May 2014 07:51:21 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "MSNBC and other progressive outlets are raising the alarm: A rising GOP politician supports religious liberty for Little Sisters of the Poor.
