A homeschool version of a back-to-school-bash took place in Meridian Saturday.

Hundreds of people flocked to Northpark Church as they hosted the annual kickoff event for the Meridian Christian Home Educators, where anyone interested in joining the homeschool community could come and sign their child up. There were various activities such as volleyball, basketball, baseball and even karate.

"One of the misconceptions about homeschooling is that they are not socialized, and that is such a huge miscommunication. Our kids-- my daughter does more with homeschool than she ever got to do with public schools,‚Äù Cara Shirley says.

Along with the other activities, the organization also hosts a teen night once a month for homeschoolers and even puts on a prom. They claim to have everything that public school has to offer and then some.
