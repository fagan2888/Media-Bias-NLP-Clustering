The goal is generating 100 million Internet contacts before open enrollment closes March 31.\n\n\u201cThe idea is a drumbeat of dialogue, a drumbeat of discussion about coverage -- not about glitches, not about the politics, not about the pundits,\u201d said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance exchange, which led organization of the campaign.\n\nThe roster includes television star Fran Drescher of \u201cThe Nanny,\u201d actor Kal Penn of the \u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d movie series and former Women\u2019s National Basketball Association most valuable player Lisa Leslie, according to the campaign\u2019s organizers, who declined to provide a full list before it gets underway.\n\nWeb Videos\n\nAlong with daily messages from celebrities, the \u201cTell a Friend -- Get Covered\u201d campaign will include new web videos and images each week, an eight-hour streamed live event in January and a web page directing people to insurance exchanges and local enrollment assistance, Lee said.\n\nOne of the videos being released on the Internet for tomorrow\u2019s kick-off is a rap on health care by Obama impersonator Iman Crosson, who performs under the name Alphacat, he said. Organizers also will promote web sharing of short videos from people who secured health coverage through Obamacare.\n\nAnne Filipic, president of Enroll America, an independent advocacy group that has joined the campaign, said celebrity promotions will primarily function as \u201ca first step to raise awareness.\u201d\n\nConversation Starter\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that, by seeing a tweet, suddenly millions of people will go get coverage,\u201d said Filipic, a former Obama White House aide. \u201cAdam Levine\u2019s tweet helps us begin, and then we can have a substantive conservation about what\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nThrough November, 365,000 people signed up for private insurance using federal and state exchanges created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, according to a government report today. Forecasts included in a September internal Obama administration memo later released by congressional Republicans forecast 1.2 million sign-ups by the end of November.\n\nCelebrities including pop singer Lady Gaga and rapper Pharrell Williams promoted healthcare.gov in the days after enrollment began only to pull back as the web site\u2019s flaws surfaced.\n\nIn addition to the state exchanges and Enroll America, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency administering the federal website, is involved in the campaign.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mike Dorning", "twitter": {"description": "The Sexiest Man Alive is being enlisted to spice up Obamacare.", "title": "Sexiest Man Alive Embraces Obamacare to Boost Enrollment", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-11/sexiest-man-alive-embraces-obamacare-to-boost-enrollment", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNf22hH1bgKU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Mike Dorning", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Tech,Barack H Obama", "news_keywords": "Tech,Barack H Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-11/sexiest-man-alive-embraces-obamacare-to-boost-enrollment", "parsely-title": "Sexiest Man Alive Embraces Obamacare to Boost Enrollment", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-12-11T23:20:08.212Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The Sexiest Man Alive is being enlisted to spice up Obamacare.", "parsely-tags": "Tech,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2013-12-11T23:20:08.212Z", "parsely-section": "technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The Sexiest Man Alive is being enlisted to spice up Obamacare.", "title": "Sexiest Man Alive Embraces Obamacare to Boost Enrollment", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-11/sexiest-man-alive-embraces-obamacare-to-boost-enrollment", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNf22hH1bgKU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "The Sexiest Man Alive is being enlisted to spice up Obamacare."}, "parsely-post-id": "MXNXLV6KLVRE01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNf22hH1bgKU/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ac3\"", "article_summary": "The Sexiest Man Alive is being enlisted to spice up Obamacare.\nIn addition to the state exchanges and Enroll America, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency administering the federal website, is involved in the campaign.\nOrganizers also will promote web sharing of short videos from people who secured health coverage through Obamacare.\nPop singer Adam Levine, who won the designation from People magazine last month, is among the celebrities who\u2019ll be promoting enrollment in online health insurance exchanges as part of a social media campaign kicking off tomorrow.\nThe goal is generating 100 million Internet contacts before open enrollment closes March 31."}
