Co-star Jack Kelly played his more straight-laced brother, Bart.\n\nGarner left the ABC show in 1960 in a contract dispute with producers but brought his \"Maverick\"-like alter ego to a series of films, including \"Thrill of It All,\" \"Move Over, Darling,\" \"The Great Escape\" and \"Support Your Local Sheriff!\"\n\nGarner once said his screen persona as an easy-going guy smart enough to steer clear of a fight actually ran only so deep.\n\nRead MoreBillionaire Richard Mellon Scaife dies at 82\n\n\"At times it's like me, but I used to have this temper,\" he told Reuters in a 2004 interview. \"I used to get in a fight in a heartbeat.

He received his sole Oscar nomination for his work opposite Sally Field in the 1985 feature comedy \"Murphy's Romance.\"\n\nGarner said his favorite role was as the cowardly U.S. soldier who falls for Julie Andrews before being sent on a dangerous wartime mission in the 1964 film \"The Americanization of Emily.\"\n\nHe teamed up with Andrews again in the 1982 film \"Victor/Victoria.\"\n\nRead MoreActress Elaine Stritch dies at age 89\n\nHe returned to the big screen in 2000 in Clint Eastwood's astronaut adventure \"Space Cowboys\" and two years later in \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\"\n\nIn a spate of late-career TV work, Garner played a recurring role as a hospital chief executive on \"Chicago Hope\" in 2000 and starred as a conservative Supreme Court chief justice in the short-lived 2002 series \"First Monday.\"\n\nIn 2003, he joined the cast of the ABC sitcom \"8 Simple Rules,\" playing a grandfather after the untimely death of series star John Ritter.\n\nThe following year, Garner showed off his big-screen acting chops again, starring opposite Gena Rowlands as the devoted elderly husband of an Alzheimer's disease sufferer in Nick Cassavetes' adaptation of the bestseller \"The Notebook.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Actor James Garner, best known for his prime-time television roles as the wisecracking frontier gambler on \"Maverick\" and as an ex-con turned private eye on \"The Rockford Files,\" has died at age 86, Los Angeles police confirmed early on Sunday.", "news_keywords": "James Garner, dead, death, actor", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Actor James Garner, best known for his prime-time television roles on \"Maverick\" and \"The Rockford Files,\" has died at age 86.", "title": "James Garner of 'The Rockford Files' dead at 86", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/20/james-garner-of-the-rockford-files-dead-at-86.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/07/20/101851380-105898834.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Actor James Garner, best known for his prime-time television roles on \"Maverick\" and \"The Rockford Files,\" has died at age 86.", "title": "James Garner of 'The Rockford Files' dead at 86", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/20/james-garner-of-the-rockford-files-dead-at-86.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/07/20/101851380-105898834.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "section": "US: News", "published_time": "2014-07-20T21:52:34-0400", "modified_time": "2014-07-21T02:25:06-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC"}, "pageNodeId": 101851376, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf6a\"", "article_summary": "Actor James Garner, best known for his prime-time television roles as the wisecracking frontier gambler on \"Maverick\" and as an ex-con turned private eye on \"The Rockford Files,\" has died at age 86, Los Angeles police confirmed early on Sunday.\nGarner once said his screen persona as an easy-going guy smart enough to steer clear of a fight actually ran only so deep.\nRead MoreIconic Hollywood actor Mickey Rooney dies at 93The show ran on NBC from 1974 until Garner abruptly quit the series in 1980.\nBack to the big screenThe role earned Garner an Emmy Award in 1977.\nHe reprised Rockford for several TV movies in the late 1990s."}
