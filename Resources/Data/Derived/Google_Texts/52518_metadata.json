He said 13 rebels, some of them foreigners, were killed on Friday along with 16 soldiers and pro-Assad militia fighters. Five civilians also died.\n\nFEARS OF PARTITION\n\nMore than 140,000 people have been killed in the conflict, while 2.5 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries and millions more need humanitarian aid.\n\nWith the erosion of state power, Syria has also become increasingly fragmented, with the Assad holding the center of the country, rebels controlling much of the north and east, and Kurds taking steps towards autonomy in the northeast.\n\nThat prospect has alarmed many of Syria's neighbors.\n\n\"All the scenarios of partition in Syria will have disastrous results for Syria and the region,\" Jordan's King Abdullah told Al-Hayat newspaper in an interview published on Saturday.\n\n\"This will unleash endless waves of violence, hate and extremism which threaten to deepen civil war and sectarian fighting,\" the monarch said, warning it would spread across borders and threaten regional stability.\n\nThe turmoil in Syria has already spilled over into neighboring Lebanon, where car bombs have struck Beirut and other cities. Eleven people were killed on Friday in the northern city of Tripoli.\n\nIslamist fighters in Iraq's western province of Anbar, which borders eastern Syria, have also been battling Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's forces.\n\nOn Saturday, Syrian state media said an army unit east of Damascus had ambushed a group of Nusra Front fighters who had infiltrated from Jordan. Syrian television showed the bodies of around a dozen men lying on the ground, some with weapons.\n\n(Reporting by Dominic Evans; Editing by Tom Heneghan)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author":
