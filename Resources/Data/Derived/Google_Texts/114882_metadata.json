(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nBill Cassidy, the freshman senator from Louisiana and a doctor, has been pushing fellow Republicans in his first few months in the Senate to embrace an alternative to Obamacare \u2014 one he predicts will insure more people without mandates.\n\nAnd he even says he has a way to pay for it: Obamacare. At an event attended Monday by fellow GOP freshmen to mark the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, Cassidy took an unusual tack for a Republican by bemoaning the fact that 30 million people remain uninsured, despite the ACA.\n\nHe also took aim at the law for leaving pregnancy as \u201ca pre-existing condition.\u201d Asked about that assertion in a hallway interview the following day, Cassidy noted that uninsured pregnant women are only eligible to sign up for Affordable Care Act exchange plans during open enrollment or once their baby is born.\n\n\u201cNow if a woman is pregnant, she\u2019s not signed up, she\u2019s not covered until she delivers. She doesn\u2019t get prenatal care! She doesn\u2019t get prenatal care! \u2026 Now, is that a good thing? No. But that\u2019s what they left,\" he said.\n\nMore broadly, Cassidy, who noted he treated uninsured people for decades as a doctor in a public hospital, said Obamacare uses a combination of penalties, mandates and \u201cbribes\u201d to get people to submit to the administration\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually in our nation\u2019s interest for people to have insurance,\u201d but there should be a voluntary approach, Cassidy said.\n\nHe told CQ Roll Call his plan could cover those pregnant women, and many more, by providing tax credits large enough for people to afford major medical insurance and giving states the ability to auto-enroll people in insurance plans unless they opt out.\n\n\u201cThat is not a mandate. It is not a penalty, but it is a way, behavioral economics teaches, that will get most people enrolled,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicted his approach would insure more people than the Affordable Care Act has.\n\n\u201cIf you had a system where states could auto-enroll, I think you\u2019d be there. You\u2019re always going to have Theodore Kaczynski, who you don\u2019t know exists, under some hood in Montana.\u201d\n\nWomen who get pregnant while being uninsured could have a rolling auto-enrollment period, Cassidy suggested.\n\n\"Somebody who is homeless has now come to the emergency room, didn\u2019t know she had coverage, but we can, in a rolling enrollment, put her in for at least a baseline of coverage,\" he said.\n\nThere could be restrictions on plans purchased mid-year to prevent gaming the system. But even with restrictions, items such as prenatal care could be covered.\n\nThe tax credits would be at least equal to the tax breaks people get for having employer-sponsored health insurance, Cassidy wrote in a column that ran in The Hill in February.\n\nAsked how he would pay for such a bill, Cassidy cited the taxes that finance the president\u2019s health care law and pointed to the upcoming Supreme Court case over the legality of subsidies in states that did not set up their own health exchanges.\n\n\u201cKing v. Burwell obviously affects only a small scope of Obamacare, and one of the things it does not affect are the revenue streams. So, one thing you can do is basically take those revenue streams and distribute them in a way which is frankly a better plan. It doesn\u2019t have the coercion or the bribes or the penalties or the mandates.\u201d\n\nGetting rid of the mandates has broad appeal, he said.\n\n\u201cI was with a bunch of college students last night. I said, \u2018Everyone raise your hand if you want people telling you what to do?\u2019 Nobody raised their hand.\"\n\nOf course, the administration and insurers have long contended that without the mandates, the ban on pre-existing conditions would lead to sharply higher premiums as the sickest people get insurance and healthier, younger people opt out.\n\nThere's another big issue with Cassidy\u2019s suggestion of using Obamacare revenue to pay for the Obamacare replacement \u2014 the House and Senate GOP budget blueprints. The GOP budget on the Senate floor uses the revenue from Obamacare to reduce the deficit, while nuking the spending in the law on subsidies and the like.\n\nWithout the Obamacare revenue, the GOP's 10 year budget blueprint wouldn\u2019t come close to eliminating the deficit in the targeted tenth year.\n\nCassidy predicted Republicans ultimately will get a price tag from the Congressional Budget Office for a replacement plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a plan which we\u2019ll get scored,\u201d he said.\n\nAisha Chowdhry contributed to this report.
