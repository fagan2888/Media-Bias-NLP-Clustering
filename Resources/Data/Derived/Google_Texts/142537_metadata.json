The Mark Now implemented!\n\n\n\n<NOSPAM>\n\nBy Rev. Austin Miles **********SILICONE VALLEY, Ca. The headline story received little attention even though the contents are explosive. Like everything else, people are sleeping through it.(Contra Costa Times) front page story, Saturday December 21, 2013, was deceptively headlined, \"Human 2.0.\" There is a brief mention of a \"chip implanted in the hand,\" under a skeletal image of a hand along with another throw-away sentence, about. But the headline hid the true meaning of the contents.The story by( sjohnson@mercurynews.com ) tells of a computerized person namedHe doesn't need a key or password to get into his car, home or computer. He is programmed to unlock them all at the mere wave of his hands which are implanted with radio frequency identification tags.This implemented technologyis engineered by a company calledThe idea behind this Bay Area company is to outfit people with electronic devices that can be swallowed, implanted in their bodies or attached to their skin via \"smart tattoos.\" This technical advance, the story details, \"could revolutionize health care and change the way people interact with devices and one another.\"The brains of this company echo what has been proclaimed through the halls of the White House (regarding sharing the wealth and nationalized health care) which, they say, regarding the implants,According to the story, these 'chips' willGoogle CEO,(of Mountain View, California) said;like a Google Search engine.

Next, re-read the prophecy above. Buying and selling by this required Mark of the Beast will naturally be next.Here is how Revelation 13: 16-17 describes that Mark:This will replace all credit cards. Bank accounts will be no more. Every transaction will take place via the chip. Without it, one can do nothing or even function. One could no longer worship God and function in life. Instead we will be required by law to worship the beast, which is Satan, which is done by receiving the chip.And if one refuses that mark? Verse 15 makes it clear:(emphasis mine)The end time is here.When that time culminates, no philosophy, life style, political party or sexual preference will save you.Instead of worrying about what theis doing, the Gays should start worrying about their personal relationship with God. That will be the only thing that counts when the world, as we know it, ends.This same suggestion is respectfully passed along to. The greatest socialist and communist leaders will not be able to pull you out to safety once this is concluded. Only a right relationship to God can do that. There is still time for you to be remembered as a great man. Don't blow it. Do what is really the right thing to truly benefit America. We frankly prefer that you go out as the great man you are capable of being.***********\u00a9 Rev.
