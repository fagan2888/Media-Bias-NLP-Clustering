Both posts are definitely worth your time. This is from Matthews\u2019:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tax season again, and that means you\u2019re probably thinking about using TurboTax. You wouldn\u2019t be alone; Intuit, the company that sells TurboTax, claims the app has 31 million users. Its competitors did pretty well for themselves too, with H&R Block preparing more than 20 million returns last cycle and millions more using TaxAct and TaxSlayer.\n\nLet me be blunt: You should not pay for TurboTax. If you want to use a free version of TurboTax or H&R Block at Home or TaxAct, go nuts. But for the love of God, don\u2019t give Intuit money.\n\nTurboTax is an evil, parasitic product that exists entirely because taxes are confusing and hard to file. Worse than that, Intuit is one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill arguing against measures that make it easier to pay taxes. The Obama administration has argued for automatic tax filing, in which the IRS uses income information it already has to fill out your tax return for you. That would save millions of Americans considerable time and energy every year, but the idea has gone nowhere. The main reason? Lobbying from Intuit and H&R Block.\n\nDon\u2019t give Intuit money. Don\u2019t give H&R Block money. To do so is to perpetuate the status quo in which you have to file your own taxes in the first place. The best way to escape this trap is for millions of taxpayers to start doing their own taxes in hopes of weakening Intuit and H&R Block and depriving them of money they could use to lobby against auto-filing. This requires privileging your own long-term interests ahead of your short-term ones; it\u2019s mildly annoying to do your taxes by hand for now, but in the long run, if the plan works, you won\u2019t have to do your own taxes at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "If you want to use a free version of TurboTax or H&R Block at Home or TaxAct, go nuts.\nBoth Dylan Matthews at Vox (\u201cWhy I\u2019m boycotting TurboTax this year\u201d) and Josh Hoxie at Inequality.org (\u201cThe call for boycotting TurboTax\u201d) made a compelling case this week for boycotting the mega-corporations to whom so many of us turn to do their taxes.\nDon\u2019t give H&R Block money.\nLobbying from Intuit and H&R Block.\nThis is from Matthews\u2019:\u201cIt\u2019s tax season again, and that means you\u2019re probably thinking about using TurboTax."}
