Right to free speech? Nope. Right to bear arms? Forget about it. Right not to buy ObamaCare? Ha.

But illegal aliens do have a right to take your job. It's in the Obamastitution. Right after locking up filmmakers who mock Islam. And children who bite pop tarts into the shape of a gun.

Just ask Obama's AG nominee.

Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch backed up President Obama on his controversial immigration executive actions during her confirmation hearing Wednesday -- while going as far to say she believed in an illegal immigrant's "right" and "obligation to work." Under questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who asked whether legal residents or illegal immigrants have more of a right to a job, Lynch said everyone should be able to work. "I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here," Lynch said. "If someone is here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace."

I'm sure the millions of unemployed Americans appreciate Lynch's belief that illegal aliens should be able to take their jobs.

Lynch's view fundamentally overturns the entire legal system, but that's normal for Obama Inc. Illegals have a right to jobs, to ObamaCare and to voting twice for Democrats.

Americans have a right to shut up about it or be charged with a hate crime.
