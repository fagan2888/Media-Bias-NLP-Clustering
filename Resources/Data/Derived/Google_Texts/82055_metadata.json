Like HealthMap, the online tool cited above, Vespignani\u2019s computer simulations cannot anticipate an outbreak before it actually begins.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have a crystal ball either,\u201d he says. \u201cHealthMap is really a novel way of doing disease surveillance that can provide a real edge in the early detection of outbreaks by monitoring news articles, journals, Twitter or other digital sources. But they can\u2019t do this before the actual occurrence of the event. There was already a situation in West Africa. HealthMap was just able to pick up the anomaly before anyone else.\u201d\n\nAs the death toll climbs over 1,000 in West Africa, I was curious to know what makes this particular outbreak so relentless and what the global community can do to contain its spread. My conversation with Dr. Vespignani, lightly edited:\n\nFirst of all, what exactly are big data and network science research? And how do you use them to track disease outbreaks?\n\nWe create large-scale models for disease forecasting by creating a synthetic world in the computer that integrates all data about human mobility. Then we plug an infectious individual into the model and look at the spread of the disease. You can look at different levels of granularity\u2014whether locally or internationally. Network science is important because most disease now spreads by human mobility. What you hear many times is, \u201cWe\u2019re all one hop away from West Africa,\u201d although it\u2019s thousands of kilometers away. No one has a crystal ball, so we cannot say when there will be an Ebola disease outbreak. As soon as we have the data on the outbreak, what we can do is try understanding how it will evolve in the next few weeks or months, which is what we do with this modeling.\n\n\n\nWhen you talk about human mobility data, what exactly do you mean? Where does this information come from?\n\nThere are many data that we use to create the synthetic simulations of the world. We use data from various projects that map the population, so we have a grid covering the world\u2019s surface and know how many people are in each of the cells\u2014big cities, rural areas, etc. We have information on all of the flights, from the International Aviation Association, that bring people from any airport in the world. We have commuting data from the census\u2014like how people commute from one county to another in the U.S. We\u2019ve accumulated these data for 10 years, so now we have basically a representation of the whole world. Obviously, some places have data of a much higher quality and granularity, like the U.S. and Europe. Then in places like West Africa we have a much coarser understanding of the factors we need in the model. But we have accumulated a good deal of data. This is the first part. This allowed us to create the synthetic model.\n\nOK, so then how do you use the model to predict the spread of disease?\n\nThen we need the data about the disease\u2014these are the data that are most difficult to obtain. Initially, when the outbreak is not clear, you get reports of cases but you don\u2019t actually know the details about the disease, like how long the person has been in the incubation period or the transmissibility of the disease. The more data we get from the field, then the more we can calibrate our models and start using them to predict the outbreak\u2019s evolution.\n\nThese data on the disease come from health agencies, the WHO, people in the field, as well as historical data from previous outbreaks.When you pack all those data together, finally you have a computational model. We simulate 7 billion individuals in the world\u2014how they travel by plane, how they get infected and come in contact with others. We do that on a scale of one day then we try to figure out what will happen in next weeks or months.\n\nObviously, the farther away you project, the less realistic the forecast is. Because of the large international effort to contain and mitigate the Ebola outbreak, any kind of projection about the future should be redone every two weeks because the transmissibility of the disease changes\u2014people are more aware or the hospitals are able to do better procedures. There are many things you have to factor in continuously to update your models.\n\nWhat\u2019s different with this Ebola outbreak? How did it spread so fast and so far?\n\nWe\u2019re starting to have a better understanding, because we are getting more and more data from the field. We\u2019re not happy about that. What we would like to see instead is evidence that the containment and mitigation measures are effective. Unfortunately, this is not happening, so we keep getting new data on the number of cases and deaths from the various regions. So then we calibrated the model, which is a very complicated procedure. For technical reasons, you basically have to try thousands of different models to see which best approximates what has actually happened with the outbreak so far. Then from those models you can project what will happen in the future.\n\nTo understand the local spread of Ebola, you must understand that it can be transmitted through three different settings. First, it can be transmitted in the general population if the symptoms are very general and the infected individual doesn\u2019t go to the hospital right away. For instance, you may vomit in a public bathroom and someone may come in after you and be infected by the fluid. Generally this transmissibility is low, because people who are not very symptomatic do not have a high viral load or stay at home. The second component is hospital transmission. These individuals are highly infectious, and unless the hospital is following strict procedures and has all of the necessary equipment to contain the virus, this type of transmission is highly likely. Third, the virus can be transmitted through dead bodies since they have a very high viral load. All of these three components of Ebola transmissibility are active in West Africa. Efforts should focus on the hospital and funeral components because the disease doesn\u2019t have enough transmissibility in the community to create a huge outbreak.\n\nShould we worried about an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. or other Western countries?\n\nThe three components of transmissibility explain the widespread outbreak in West Africa, and also explain why we\u2019re optimistic of what would happen in the U.S. if cases are imported here. In our hospitals we have full isolation of infected patients, and the burial of an infected body would be done in the appropriate way. These things are not being done in Africa.\n\nBased on our results that project two weeks into the future, we see that the probability of an outbreak in the Western nations is statistically very small. This does not mean it\u2019s not going to happen, but we are talking about a probability of 1 to 5 percent in next two to three weeks. This is very small in terms of risk. Even if we get one or two cases in the U.S., we have the infrastructure to cope with it and stay completely safe. It\u2019s like rolling the dice with 100 faces and if you hit the number one, maybe we\u2019ll have this event.\n\nWhat about other areas of the world?\n\nThe probability of international spread is much greater for West African countries, like Ghana, because they\u2019re closer and more connected to the outbreak. This is concerning because these countries are also much less equipped to respond to an outbreak. In the U.S. and European countries we expect to see one to three cases\u2014no more than that\u2014which we can cope with easily. This is not the same for other countries in Africa, where you have to assume a very different health response system.\n\nA good example is Nigeria. They got one case imported through the airport which should have been easy to contain, but they already have more than seven suspected cases and it\u2019s not clear whether they\u2019ll be able to contain the outbreak. Another thing we see from our models is that if Nigeria is not able to contain the outbreak, things are going to be much worse since it is a well-connected country with a large population. The number of cases in that country might be a big problem. As soon as you have a known outbreak in Nigeria, the probability of cases being imported to other countries is greatly increased.\n\nWhat are your recommendations for containing the disease so it does not spread any farther?\n\nThe battle right now is in West Africa. The issue is not here. The epidemic is still in the early stages. We need to work in the African region to create the opportunities and means for those countries to bring the outbreak under control. Basic things\u2014like sending isolation tents, sanitary gloves, doctors and nurses\u2014are crucial. We need to pull resources so that health system can finally cope with outbreak. There is also lot to explain to these populations about doctors, taking care of sick patients, and dealing with funerals. It\u2019s a massive campaign. The risk is there, not here. If the outbreak in West Africa spins out of control, then it would be a global problem for everyone.\n\nWhat are your projections about the course of the outbreak over the next couple of weeks?\n\nSo far, based on new points from the field, we have seen an exponential increase. This is not good. What we\u2019re hoping to see is the number of cases plateauing or decreasing\u2014a deviation from this epidemic that is continuously growing. But there is a time delay. Now that we see the danger and threat of the outbreak, there is more proactive action from everybody. It will take time to see the effects of those efforts. In the last week, things have not changed that much and I don\u2019t expect to see big changes in the next week. But then I hope to see the number of cases declining by the end of the month. If not, then the situation needs to be reassessed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst-case scenario?\n\nThe worst scenario is if we see that Nigeria is unable to control the outbreak, as well Ghana or other countries in the region having outbreaks and being unable to contain them. At that point, the whole system is put under stress and is difficult to cope with in terms of international aid. There are not infinite resources to help them. First of all, that would be a major tragedy for African region and then it would start to affect us.\n\nBut worst-case scenarios are very speculative. Each country has a different response capability that we need to test, so we cannot make too much inference at this stage about things farther than two to three weeks down the road. I don\u2019t like doing these worst-case or best-case scenarios because you don\u2019t want to be too pessimistic or even too optimistic, because you don\u2019t want to relax things happening locally.\n\nI\u2019m very optimistic for the near future of the U.S. and Europe. For the African region, it is very difficult to predict what will happen, and a lot will depend on the kind of support we can provide them. The worst-case scenario might happen if you see this kind of toppling\u2014one country, then another, then another. Hopefully this is not what we will see in the near future.\n\nWhat can we learn from this large-scale outbreak in order to prevent similar ones in the future?\n\nThere is one lesson that I think is for everybody. We need to help those countries create a much better health infrastructure. An outbreak of this proportion should not have happened in those places. It\u2019s important that we become the enabler for those countries to create a different health approach and infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately, emerging infectious diseases are something that we\u2019ll always have to cope with. We have Ebola, but also Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, the H7N9 in China and chikungunya in the Caribbean. The diseases are there. All we can do is create the health infrastructure to cope with them and to help countries have the monitoring resources to detect outbreaks as soon as possible and provide timely data. They need to be able to perform containment and mitigation measures right away. We need to have collective responses to these emergencies.\n\nNobody can tell you there will be no Ebola outbreak in the future\u2014that\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s also impossible to say there won\u2019t be another pandemic of influenza. Those things happen. It\u2019s the way we respond to those emergencies that is changing, and we also need to change that in other regions of the world, like West Africa and remote places of Southeast Asia.
