Consuming items high in sodium and carbohydrates may lead to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. \u2014 Scott Heckman, Reston, VA\n\nSECOND PLACE:\n\nWARNING: Living in San Francisco may cause you to think you know what's best for everybody else. \u2014 Tracy Davis, Lawrence, KS\n\nTHIRD PLACE:\n\nWARNING: Reading government-required warning labels may cause the following: nearsightedness, fatigue, depression, anxiety, restlessness, apathy, anger, irritation, nausea, uncontrollable rage, uncontrollable giggles, nervousness, sweating, high blood pressure, twitching, facial tics, stroke, heartburn, indigestion, paranoia, diarrhea, apoplexy, dizziness, fainting, vomiting, suicidal thoughts, asthma, shortness of breath and a strong urge to consume alcohol. Reading government-required warning labels is strongly discouraged during the following activities: driving a motor vehicle, boating, sailing, operating heavy machinery, surgery, operating a shopping cart in a grocery store, exiting an escalator, using a cellphone, exiting an elevator, voting, pouring a cup of coffee, drinking coffee, ironing, vacuuming, operating a toaster, swimming with Killer Whales, plugging in a major appliance, replacing a light bulb, using a microwave oven, using a washing machine to wash clothes, using a clothes dryer, putting sharp objects in a dishwasher, swinging a golf club, opening a can of peaches, operating a garbage disposal, using a Q-tip, climbing a ladder, eating hot pizza, cleaning a drain with chemicals, lighting a cigarette, bicycling, moving a luggage cart, painting, using a nail clipper, shampooing your hair, moving a mattress, opening a soda can, eating an Oreo cookie, opening a McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal, brushing your teeth, unwrapping toys, taking medication, using a firearm, eating peanuts, cooking with wheat, and chewing gum. Reading a government-required warning label may result in the reader becoming fatigued, irritated and/or distracted. Distraction caused by government-required warning labels during any of those activities may cause accidents resulting in burns, cuts, lacerations, punctures, bruises, falls, trips, exposure to fumes, accidental overdoses, concussions, amputations, electric shock, chemical ingestion, impaired judgment, damage to personal belongings, choking, drowning, and even death. When reading a government-required warning label, it is recommended that the reader be in a seated position, using correct posture when possible. Lighting should be suitable for reading with no other distractions. If the government-required warning label is detachable, the reader must take care not to be cut by the edges of the label. OSHA may require personal protection equipment such as gloves or tongs when handling a government-required warning label in the workplace. Also, detachable government-required warning labels can be a choking hazard and should not be inhaled or swallowed. Government-required warning labels that are affixed to a product with an adhesive rather than printed as part of the packaging may become unattached, either through movement or normal wear-and-tear. The adhesive chemical should not be swallowed or inhaled. Skin in contact with the adhesive should be washed thoroughly. If the adhesive from the government-required warning label should come in contact with the eyes, rinse thoroughly immediately and then seek medical attention. Detached government-required warning labels should be disposed of promptly and properly. See local regulations for disposal of possible hazardous materials. Keep out of reach of children and away from animals. \u2014 James Wigderson, Waukesha, WI\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\n(On roll of Lifesavers candy) WARNING: Not intended for use as flotation devices. \u2014 Andy Johnson, Baton Rouge, LA\n\nWARNING: This is a carbonated beverage, need we say more?
