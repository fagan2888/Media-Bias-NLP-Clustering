Reuters\n\nIt\u2019s not a good day for Bitcoin.\n\nOver on Japan-based Mt. Gox, one of the major exchanges for trading the virtual currency, withdrawals have been halted and the price has dropped.\n\nSeveral thousand miles away on the tiny island of Cyprus, the central bank has weighed in on the virtual currency too, and it\u2019s not happy.\n\nThroughout this year, Cyprus has been touted in the media as fertile ground for Bitcoin growth. Remember that, since March, it\u2019s had capital controls in place, leaving residents cash-restricted.\n\nThat left Bitcoin with a potentially starring-role. In November the University of Nicosia in Cyprus said it would accept bitcoin as payment for everything from tuition to rent to books at the bookstore and meals in the cafeteria. It even started offering a Master\u2019s course in virtual currencies.\n\nIn December, the island\u2019s finance minister, Harris Georgiades, said Cyprus\u2019s troubles could turn it into a financial innovation hub, and Bitcoin was proof of that.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a very exciting prospect. I have to say that personally I\u2019m still learning regarding this bitcoin phenomenon because I think it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon on a global scale. And it\u2019s very interesting and encouraging that a private university in Cyprus has been bold enough to take this step,\u201d Mr. Georgiades told CNBC in December.\n\nThere was even talk in local media of a Bitcoin stores being opened across Cyprus.\n\nNow the central bank has weighed in, and it doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin at all.\n\nIt said in a statement (in Greek) Friday that it \u201cdoes not approve any activity that falls within its purview, unless it can ensure the legality of that activity. Activities without the necessary licensing are in breach of legislation.\u201d\n\nSo, is the institution \u2013accused of failing to control the economy on the tiny Mediterranean island and allowing rampant tax avoidance and money laundering- saying Bitcoin is illegal?\n\nNot quite. Instead it warns that there are big risks associated with using the currency.\n\nAs an example, it cites the absence of legal guarantees around the ownership of Bitcoin, high volatility in its price, and possible use of Bitcoin for \u201cabuse for illegal activities.\u201d\n\nWhere does this leave the keen Bitcoin holders in Cyprus? Warned, but still legal, it seems.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It's not a good day for Bitcoin.", "title": "Central Bank Of Cyprus Does Not Like Bitcoin", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/07/central-bank-of-cyprus-does-not-like-bitcoin/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BK657_0207bi_P_20140207123144.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Central Bank Of Cyprus Does Not Like Bitcoin", "description": "It's not a good day for Bitcoin.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Matina Stevis", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "It's not a good day for Bitcoin.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-07T17:41:57-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/07/central-bank-of-cyprus-does-not-like-bitcoin/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-16127", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "It's not a good day for Bitcoin.", "title": "Central Bank Of Cyprus Does Not Like Bitcoin", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/02/07/central-bank-of-cyprus-does-not-like-bitcoin/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BK657_0207bi_P_20140207123144.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-16127", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-07T17:42:24-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeec3\"", "article_summary": "I have to say that personally I\u2019m still learning regarding this bitcoin phenomenon because I think it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon on a global scale.\nSeveral thousand miles away on the tiny island of Cyprus, the central bank has weighed in on the virtual currency too, and it\u2019s not happy.\nAs an example, it cites the absence of legal guarantees around the ownership of Bitcoin, high volatility in its price, and possible use of Bitcoin for \u201cabuse for illegal activities.\u201dWhere does this leave the keen Bitcoin holders in Cyprus?\nNow the central bank has weighed in, and it doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin at all.\nThroughout this year, Cyprus has been touted in the media as fertile ground for Bitcoin growth."}
