From 2011 to 2014, the number of inmates in segregation dropped from 14,942 to 10,747.\n\nBut the report found that inmates are facing disproportionately long periods in confinement due to lack of time parameters. The report recommend the Bureau of Prisons reduce the length of segregation in Special Management Units from 18 to 24 months to 12 months.\n\nThe report also recommends the BOP review all inmates currently assigned to segregated housing to identify those who would be better served in a secure mental health facility and establish a separate housing option for inmates in protective custody.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Democratic senator said reform is needed despite report of declining numbers.", "description": "The Democratic senator said reform is needed despite report of declining numbers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Democratic senator said reform is needed despite report of declining numbers.", "title": "Durbin wants to rein in prison use of solitary confinement", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/234132-durbin-calls-for-reform-of-solitary-confinement-in-prison", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/durbinrichard_031114gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/234132-durbin-calls-for-reform-of-solitary-confinement-in-prison", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-27T13:37-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Penology, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Torture, Supermax, Prison, Solitary confinement, Law enforcement, Crime, Social Issues,Dick Durbin,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-27T13:37:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/234132-durbin-calls-for-reform-of-solitary-confinement-in-prison", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Democratic senator said reform is needed despite report of declining numbers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Durbin wants to rein in prison use of solitary confinement"}, "dcterms.title": "Durbin wants to rein in prison use of solitary confinement"}, "article_summary": "Durbin requested the first assessment of the segregation policies in 2013 after a hearing on human rights and the fiscal and public safety consequences of solitary confinement.\nThough a BOP report released Friday found that the number of inmates being held in solitary confinement is declining, Durbin said the U.S. still holds more prisoners in segregated restricted housing any other diplomatic nation.\nBut the report found that inmates are facing disproportionately long periods in confinement due to lack of time parameters.\nFrom 2011 to 2014, the number of inmates in segregation dropped from 14,942 to 10,747.\nSen.
