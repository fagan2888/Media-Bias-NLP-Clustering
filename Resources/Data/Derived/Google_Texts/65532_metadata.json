Tyco, which focuses on fire safety products, and Johnson Controls, the Milwaukee-based maker of heating and air conditioning systems, announced a $14 billion merger on Monday, in the latest of the offshore tax deals that have riled up our political system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOur Toby Eckert has more of the details: Johnson shareholders will control 56 percent of the shares of the combined company, which will be based in Cork, Ireland \u2014 where Tyco is already based. Johnson and Tyco expect to save about $150 million a year on taxes with the inversion. http://politico.pro/1nuX0w7\n\nWHAT THE COMPANIES ARE THINKING: The \u201cstrategic rationale\u201d of the deal will override any public fallout, a source familiar with the company\u2019s thinking said. \u201cThis is a business decision.\u201d\n\nAlex Molinaroli, Johnson\u2019s chief executive, made a similar point on a conference call, per the WSJ, insisting the merger creates a better company \u201cthat will transform our ability to capture opportunities in a fast-moving market place.\u201d\n\nThe Journal also has more on the tax benefits, for the latest of about a dozen inversions over the past 16 months: \u201cAs a result of Johnson Controls\u2019 inversion, the company\u2019s effective tax rate will be 18 percent or 19 percent, said people familiar with tax structure. Tyco paid 12 percent of its profit in taxes over the past three years, versus an average 29 percent by Johnson Controls, according to S&P Capital IQ.\u201d The 56-44 split also hits the \u201choly grail of inversion planning,\u201d the WSJ said. http://on.wsj.com/1OJp47m\n\nMAKE NO MISTAKE: This deal might be less than a tenth of the size of the Pfizer-Allergan merger, and the company\u2019s executives can swear up and down that this was just a business decision. But Democrats will try to force some public fallout.\n\nBoth leading Democratic contenders for president released statements on the Johnson-Tyco deal on Monday, with Hillary Clinton calling it \u201coutrageous\u201d and Bernie Sanders labeling it \u201ca disaster for American taxpayers.\u201d Clinton has proposed an exit tax on companies that invert, and both candidates want to rein in the earnings stripping tactic that can make inversions even more attractive.\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether these rather complex merger deals can be the potent political issue that Democrats want them to be. During the 2014 midterm cycle, President Barack Obama used the bully pulpit to call inverted companies \u201ccorporate deserters,\u201d but the issue had basically petered out by the time voters went to the booths that November.\n\nWELL, IT\u2019S TUESDAY. And we\u2019re guessing that at least some of you will have to head back to the office, and thus give up your Netflix and Amazon Prime, cold turkey. We\u2019re looking for tips, if you\u2019re getting back into the swing of things. Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nWHERE\u2019S THE GOP? House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady offered a pretty succinct response to the Johnson-Tyco merger that underscored that the various Democratic proposals to combat inversions aren\u2019t going anywhere on the Hill: \u201cThis news is yet another reminder that America's tax code is an outdated relic that is keeping America at a disadvantage.\u201d (We\u2019re also still awaiting that Treasury response on earnings stripping.)\n\nTWISTING THE KNIFE: Democrats get annoyed at every inversion, but there\u2019s certainly reason to think that Tyco\u2019s involvement might be especially galling. The WSJ, for instance, took a look at Tyco\u2019s two decades\u2019 worth of globetrotting to various tax advantaged spots \u2014 a 1997 move from the U.S. to Bermuda, then a 2008 move to Switzerland before 2013 took them to Ireland. \u201cAt least four pieces of the onetime industrial conglomerate \u2014 which was broken up after an accounting scandal that sent its former CEO, Dennis Kozlowski, to prison \u2014 have become major players in the recent surge in cross-border, tax-flavored M&A.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1Nwxefi\n\nAnd your Morning Tax author, back at his last gig, noted that Tyco was among the inverted companies that were receiving millions of dollars in federal contracts from both the Treasury Department and federal government at-large: http://bit.ly/1nLCSpj. That\u2019s a sign that the current rules seeking to stop inverted companies from getting federal contracts, which Democrats want to strengthen, already have some holes.\n\nCBO SAYS: Congress\u2019 official budget scorekeeper projected Monday that inversions like the Tyco-Johnson merger will play no small role in chipping away at the corporate tax base over the next decade, according to our Brian Faler.\n\nMore from Brian: CBO \u201cexpects corporate tax receipts to be about 5 percent lower in 2026 than they are today, thanks to businesses maneuvering to avoid paying the 35 percent corporate tax rate. About half of that projected decline is attributable to inversions, transfer pricing, intercompany loans and other techniques multinationals use to shift income overseas, out of the reach of the tax man.\u201d\n\nThe 5 percent drop is equal to about 0.1 percentage point of GDP, CBO added. http://politico.pro/1KATgOc\n\nWHAT ELSE IS IN THERE?: Brian broke down a few of the more interesting tax tidbits from CBO\u2019s 226-page report on the budget and economic outlook until 2026.\n\nAmong them: The concentration of wealth at the top will force a trade of sorts \u2014 more individual tax revenue, but less from the payroll tax that funds Social Security. The payroll tax cap is currently $118,500, and receipts will eventually decline from 6 percent of GDP to 5.8 percent. But income gains for the wealthy will also lead to a 0.3 point increase in income tax receipts. http://politico.pro/23pkToW\n\nAnd if you were looking for a silver lining to the stress that all those baby boomers would put on the entitlement system, Brian also notes that the influx of older Americans will lead to more withdrawals from tax-favored retirement accounts \u2014 raising enough revenue to increase receipts as a share of the economy by 0.2 percentage points over 10 years. http://politico.pro/1K7r2zF\n\nAlso of note: It would cost $256 billion between 2018 and 2026 if Congress fully repealed the Obamacare taxes \u2014 the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-end insurance plans, the medical device tax and the health insurance tax \u2014 that got delayed or temporarily suspended at the end of the year.\n\nTAX FOUNDATION KNOCKS HILLARY: The free-market friendly Tax Foundation found that Hillary Clinton's raft of tax increases would collect around a half trillion dollars over a decade when scored statically \u2014 but only $191 billion after taking reduced economic growth into account. http://bit.ly/1OVwTVt\n\nThe group's work has been pretty heavily cited in the Republican presidential race, with more than a few mentions in GOP debates, even as there have been some suggestions that the Tax Foundation's dynamic analyses overstate how much tax cuts can stimulate the economy.\n\n** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Last year, 109 million federal filers received refunds totaling more than $125 billion. However, criminals will attempt to steal tax refunds. As the makers of TurboTax, we at Intuit believe each of us has a special responsibility to help combat tax fraud: http://bit.ly/1QjRXYk **\n\nBERNIE MAKES IT CLEAR: Sanders made no bones about how he would pay for his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d tax plan in a CNN forum on Monday. \u201cWe will raise your taxes. Yes, we will,\u201d the Vermont senator said, before adding that it was \u201cdemagogic\u201d to not point out the savings that middle-class families would get under a single-payer health system.\n\n\"There's a little bit of disingenuity out there. We may raise taxes but we are also going to eliminate private health insurance premiums for individuals and for businesses,\" he said. Cameron Joseph of Mashable noticed that Clinton\u2019s campaign seems all too excited to make hay out of those comments. Clinton has said she\u2019ll only hike taxes on the rich, an approach that worked for Obama before her, and has sharply criticized Sanders for being willing to raise taxes on the middle class. http://on.mash.to/1Qxwptc\n\nICYMI: President Barack Obama suggested, in an interview with POLITICO's Glenn Thrush, that the more mainstream press would increase its scrutiny of Sanders\u2019 domestic policy proposals if the Vermont senator does well in Iowa and New Hampshire. (And let\u2019s be honest: Those two states are well-suited demographically for Sanders.)\n\n\u201cI think that if Bernie won Iowa or won New Hampshire, then you guys are going to do your jobs and, you know, you're going to dig into his proposals and how much they cost and what does it mean, and, you know, how does his tax policy work and he's subjected, then, to a rigor that hasn't happened yet, but that Hillary is very well familiar with,\u201d Obama said. http://politi.co/1Vm3lnT\n\n(To be fair, there has been a fair amount of policy reporting \u2014 much of it noted here \u2014 on the roughly $14 trillion in taxes needed to pay for Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan, along with further questions about how his health plan would actually work.)\n\nOBAMA ON RETIREMENT: The president\u2019s plan to expand access to retirement accounts, first pitched in his last State of the Union and to be included in his budget, will include offering tax breaks to employers who offer retirement plans. Employers with less than 100 workers that automatically enroll their employees could get a credit for up to $3,000, according to a White House fact sheet. The AP has more: http://bit.ly/1nkyPzL\n\nSTATE UPDATE \u2014\n\nTHE TAMPON TAX BACKLASH: Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell, concerned that she might be \u201ca traitor to my sex,\u201d says there are plenty of good reasons for states not to exempt tampons and other feminine products from sales taxes.\n\nQuick recap: Most states exempt necessities from the sales tax, but only a handful include tampons in that definition. But Rampell says states would be better off just giving cash transfers to the poor instead of blowing hole after hole into their sales tax bases: \u201cMaybe it seems unfair that in so many states Twizzlers don\u2019t get taxed while tampons do. But the solution isn\u2019t to dole out yet more tax breaks but to end the ones we have and direct more public funds to people who actually need assistance.\u201d http://wapo.st/1RJWpTw\n\nALABAMA GOVERNOR DROPS THE TAXES: Republican Gov. Robert Bentley wanted a half-billion dollars\u2019 worth of taxes last year. This year: nothing, according to WHNT. \"The governor understood where the Legislature was,\" said state Sen. Arthur Orr. \"The people of Alabama, by and large, didn't want to see a bunch of new taxes.\" http://bit.ly/1nkoMux\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\n\u2014 The Justice Department nabs another bank in its Swiss program. http://1.usa.gov/1PwynLo\n\n\u2014 More backlash for Google\u2019s tax deal with the U.K. http://bit.ly/1JxTT03\n\n\u2014 Want to limit the amount of taxes you pay on airfare? http://tandl.me/20pOqMJ\n\nDID YOU KNOW? In honor of Metro\u2019s slow-but-steady recovery from the storm: Adm. David Farragut, who now has a downtown Washington square and two Metro stations named after him, unleashed his famous \u201cDamn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\u201d declaration at the Battle of Mobile Bay in Alabama in August 1864.\n\n** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Our challenge today is to protect and secure our nation's information and systems \u2014 and taxpayers as well \u2014 against international criminals, fraudsters and other wrongdoers. Last spring, the IRS brought together state tax officials and the nation\u2019s leading tax return preparers and software developers, including Intuit, to create and agree on new anti-fraud measures to protect taxpayers. Together we are working to authenticate legitimate returns without unnecessarily delaying the timely refunds of deserving taxpayers, protect the nation's tax information technology infrastructure, and better inform taxpayers about how to protect their sensitive personal, tax and financial data. From government and industry, to every business and individual in the country, each of us plays a role in combating tax fraud. With everyone doing their part, we believe this is a fight that can and will be won: http://bit.ly/1QjRXYk **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "CBO says inversions will erode corporate tax base \u2014 Bernie\u2019s upfront: \u2018We will raise taxes\u2019", "title": "It\u2019s a new inversion", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tax/2016/01/its-a-new-inversion-cbo-says-inversions-will-erode-corporate-tax-base-bernies-upfront-we-will-raise-taxes-212349", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "CBO says inversions will erode corporate tax base \u2014 Bernie\u2019s upfront: \u2018We will raise taxes\u2019", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Johnson and Tyco expect to save about $150 million a year on taxes with the inversion.\nTWISTING THE KNIFE: Democrats get annoyed at every inversion, but there\u2019s certainly reason to think that Tyco\u2019s involvement might be especially galling.\nIt\u2019s a new inversionWith help from Brian Faler and Katy O\u2019DonnellYES, IT\u2019S AN INVERSION: It had been, what, two months since the Pfizer-Allergan merger?\nTyco paid 12 percent of its profit in taxes over the past three years, versus an average 29 percent by Johnson Controls, according to S&P Capital IQ.\u201d The 56-44 split also hits the \u201choly grail of inversion planning,\u201d the WSJ said.\nQuick recap: Most states exempt necessities from the sales tax, but only a handful include tampons in that definition."}
