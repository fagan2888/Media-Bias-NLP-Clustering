But is caregiving itself beneficial to the caregivers? A new study has found that particularly among older women caring for ill husbands, happiness levels are higher if they do housework and chores for someone else rather than just themselves.\n\n\u201cA lot of studies have focused on the burden of caregiving, especially for women, so we expected to see worse well-being for wives caring for a husband,\u201d Vicki Freedman, an author of the study, told Reuters Health. Instead, in a survey of middle-aged and older Americans, they found that women who cared for disabled husbands actually had increased well-being. Husbands, however, did not appear to have a greater sense of well-being when caring for ill wives.\n\nThe researchers used data from a 2009 phone survey that reviewed 400 married couples. The survey recorded how certain activities \u2014 categorized either as \u201cchores\u201d or tasks done to \u201ccare\u201d for a spouse \u2014 affected happiness levels. The participants rated the activities based on how happy they felt after doing them.\n\nThe study found that women\u2019s happiness levels actually increased by about one-third of a point (0.35) at average if they cared for a husband. This is a small difference, but it\u2019s nearly the same as the boost in happiness that happens when people socialize casually, Freedman claims.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was surprising,\u201d Freedman told Reuters. \u201c[F]irst, that older women report greater happiness levels when providing care to their husbands than when carrying out the same kinds of tasks as chores \u2014 and second, that older women are no less happy when caring for their husbands than they are doing other kinds of activities.\u201d\n\nHowever, because the survey had only incorporated data from one day, the researchers are unable to make sweeping conclusions about whether caregiving is beneficial to overall happiness or mental health. Indeed, some studies have pointed to the very opposite.\n\nAccording to the Family Caregiver Alliance, caregivers between the ages of 66 and 96 have a 63 percent higher chance of dying than people who aren\u2019t caregivers. \u201cThe combination of loss, prolonged stress, the physical demands of caregiving, and the biological vulnerabilities that come with age place you at risk for significant health problems as well as an earlier death,\u201d the Family Caregiver Alliance website reads. Meanwhile, even though caregivers are often under high levels of stress, they are less likely to maintain self-care and health. They\u2019re more likely to be sleep-deprived, and have poor eating habits. They also may not have enough time to exercise, as they are always putting someone else in front of their own needs. This often leads to depression or substance abuse among caregivers. Caregivers themselves need support and assistance to manage their stress and mental health.\n\nSo where may this small uptick in well-being be coming from? The study conducted by Freedman and her research team \u2014 though it needs more evidence to back it up \u2014 points to the notion that there is joy to be found in caring for someone else. Perhaps simply the thought of doing something selfless completely overrides any general disdain for doing chores like cleaning or shopping. \u201cFindings underscore that there are positive aspects of spousal caregiving for older wives that offset the innately unpleasant nature of household tasks,\u201d the authors of the study write.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "caregivers mental health, caregivers happiness well-being", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study shows that older women who care for sick spouses actually find their daily household tasks less frustrating than people who aren\u2019t caregivers.", "title": "Does Selfless Caregiving Make You Happier?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/does-selfless-caregiving-make-you-happier-taking-care-sick-spouses-improves-womens-well-being-271127", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/12/older-couples.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study shows that older women who care for sick spouses actually find their daily household tasks less frustrating than people who aren\u2019t caregivers.", "title": "Does Selfless Caregiving Make You Happier?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/does-selfless-caregiving-make-you-happier-taking-care-sick-spouses-improves-womens-well-being-271127", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/12/older-couples.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/12/older-couples.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-12T17:52:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-12T17:59:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study shows that older women who care for sick spouses actually find their daily household tasks less frustrating than people who aren\u2019t caregivers."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd189e\"", "article_summary": "The survey recorded how certain activities \u2014 categorized either as \u201cchores\u201d or tasks done to \u201ccare\u201d for a spouse \u2014 affected happiness levels.\nThe study found that women\u2019s happiness levels actually increased by about one-third of a point (0.35) at average if they cared for a husband.\nA new study has found that particularly among older women caring for ill husbands, happiness levels are higher if they do housework and chores for someone else rather than just themselves.\nHusbands, however, did not appear to have a greater sense of well-being when caring for ill wives.\nInstead, in a survey of middle-aged and older Americans, they found that women who cared for disabled husbands actually had increased well-being."}
