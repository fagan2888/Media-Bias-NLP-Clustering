A southeast Kansas special education teacher has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery involving a 15-year-old boy who has cerebral palsy, is blind and confined to a wheelchair.

The Pittsburg Morning Sun reports Matthew Ward DeMoss was sentenced Thursday to three months in jail for the Jan. 15 incident in Pittsburg. The sentence was suspended and DeMoss was placed on unsupervised probation for a year and ordered to write a letter of apology to the victim.

The boy's mother says DeMoss grabbed her son by the nose and screamed at the child, who could not defend himself.

DeMoss was allowed to resign his position with SEK Interlocal 637 after he was charged earlier this year.

The Kansas Department of Education says DeMoss still holds a valid teaching certificate in the state.
