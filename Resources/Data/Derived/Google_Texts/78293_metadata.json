Here are 12 thoughts and questions:\n\nWORLD over the past 20 years has published about 60 investigative stories of various kinds. Through God\u2019s grace (and some procedures we\u2019ve followed) we have not had to retract any of them, nor have we ever been sued for libel\u2014but we\u2019re aware that any issue could end that streak.\n\nLast week major sections of an investigative article that received huge media play, Rolling Stone\u2019s report on a gang rape and rape culture at the University of Virginia, turned out to be false, and the editors had to admit that.\n\nEthical questions emerge as investigations continue. We sometimes have to deal with issues of leaked documents and deception, which we accept in times of war\u2014for example, making Hitler think the D-Day invasion would be at a different place. We can extend that thinking to those who are clearly at war with biblical truth, such as abortionists, but it\u2019s easy to fall down a slippery slope, so we need to be careful. WORLD has a reputation for truth-telling, and if we deceive others in pursuit of a story by creating our own sting operations and doing hidden-camera investigations, we may win a battle but lose a war.\n\nAs a story develops we discuss it in editorial meetings to sharpen its focus. Some financial investigations are complex, but we need to avoid \u201cinside baseball stories\u201d that only fans understand. (We don\u2019t want to be left explaining the equivalent of the infield fly rule to readers who will be too bored to turn the page.) We make sure reporters have research assistance, if necessary.\n\nOnce a reporter sends in a draft, the work continues. On many investigative stories editors go line by line with the reporter: How do you know this? How are you sure about that? At least three persons, and often more, look carefully at every story before it is published. I sometimes ask our reporters for one more check: When submitting a story, underline any portion that says or suggests a person has committed a crime or done anything that would injure the person\u2019s reputation. This underlining is the reporter\u2019s attestation that he has double-checked those facts.\n\nWhen an article makes accusatory statements about a person or organization, the accused party needs to be given the opportunity to respond in the article. If we have criticized a person by name in a way that could harm his reputation, and if we did not give his view within an article or a column, we are likely to offer guaranteed space in our letters-to-the-editor section of the magazine for him to respond.\n\nState-of-mind is important here: We should humbly realize that the Ninth Commandment\u2014\u201cyou shall not bear false witness\u201d\u2014indicts us all. If it merely said, \u201cDo not lie,\u201d then sometimes we could defend ourselves, because lying implies a conscious state. But we can be bearing false witness even when we think we are sincere, if our presuppositions and attitudes propel us away from honest accounts. Operating from our own understanding, none of us can hope to stand before God and be told: Well done, good and faithful reporter.\n\nThese policies I\u2019ve laid out have been our practice for 20 years.
