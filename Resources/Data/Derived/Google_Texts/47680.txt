Chad Minton's résumé is impressive. He has been a chef at exclusive hotels, including San Francisco's Ritz-Carlton, and most recently was executive chef at the luxurious Ojai Valley Inn & Spa in California. But this fall, he jumped at the chance to work in New York when he was tapped as executive chef of Hyatt's boutique Andaz Hotel in midtown Manhattan.



"Being in New York is the dream of every cook. It's the culinary capital of the world," said Mr. Minton, who ticked off the names of his local heroes: Alfred Portale, Larry Forgione and David Burke.



What he likes best about being here is getting back behind the stove. In Ojai, he had access to the freshest veggies from the hotel's extensive farming operation, but he spent more time traversing the big property on a golf cart than actually preparing food. At the Andaz, he's busy creating seasonal menus for the property's eateries, including its main restaurant, the Shop, as well as its cellar bar and its meeting and event spaces.



Meanwhile, the Flatiron resident is enjoying walking his English bulldog, Oliver Bojangles, and exploring local restaurants like Curry Hill's Dhaba and Kips Bay's Grass Cow Burgers & Shakes.
