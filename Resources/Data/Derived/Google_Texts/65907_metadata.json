The two briefly encountered one another on the seventh floor, and moments later Gurley lay dead of a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nLiang had been on the job just 18-months at the time of the incident and has since been criminally indicted on charges including second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. In addition, Ballinger's suit contends Liang acted \"without reason or provocation\" and \"negligently and recklessly.\" It also argues that the city housing authority \"created a hazardous and trap like condition\" by failing to provide adequate lighting in the staircases.\n\nAt a Thursday news conference, Ballinger's attorney Scott Rynecki also charged that officers had been instructed by superiors to no longer employ so-called vertical patrol methods during their shifts but were actually engaging is such practices at the time of Gurley's shooting.\n\n\"There was no reason or provocation for having a weapon out of a holster and in the hand,\" said Rynecki, adding that he hoped the suit would lead to citywide reforms, among them the hiring of an independent auditor to review the training on how officers handle their weapons while on patrol.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "More than a year after he was gunned down by police in a darkened in the stairwell of a darkened East New York housing project, the family of unarmed Akai Gurley has filed a wrongful-death suit naming the city and New York Police Department as primary defendants.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "More than a year after he was gunned down by police in a darkened in the stairwell of a darkened East New York housing project, the family of unarmed Akai Gurley has filed a wrongful-death suit naming the city and New York Police Department as primary defendants.", "title": "Akai Gurley's Family Sues NYPD, New York Housing Authority in 2013 Brooklyn Staircase Shooting Death Incident", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/55131/20150523/akai-gurleys-family-sues-nypd-new-york-housing-authority-in-2013-brooklyn-staircase-shooting-death-incident.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/36225/new-york-police-department-nypd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "More than a year after he was gunned down by police in a darkened in the stairwell of a darkened East New York housing project, the family of unarmed Akai Gurley has filed a wrongful-death suit naming the city and New York Police Department as primary defendants.", "title": "Akai Gurley's Family Sues NYPD, New York Housing Authority in 2013 Brooklyn Staircase Shooting Death Incident", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/55131/20150523/akai-gurleys-family-sues-nypd-new-york-housing-authority-in-2013-brooklyn-staircase-shooting-death-incident.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/36225/new-york-police-department-nypd.jpg", "creator": "@latinpost", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/55131/20150523/akai-gurleys-family-sues-nypd-new-york-housing-authority-in-2013-brooklyn-staircase-shooting-death-incident.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Title": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23"}, "news_keywords": "akai, gurleys, family, sues, nypd, new, york, housing, authority, in, 2013, brooklyn, staircase, shooting, death, incident", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Subject": "Latin Post"}, "article_summary": "Also named as defendants are the New York City Housing authority and patrolman Peter Liang, the officer who fired the fatal shots around Thanksgiving 2014.\nIt also argues that the city housing authority \"created a hazardous and trap like condition\" by failing to provide adequate lighting in the staircases.\nIn addition, Ballinger's suit contends Liang acted \"without reason or provocation\" and \"negligently and recklessly.\"\nSeveral media outlets have reported Liang shot the 28-year-old Gurley after he and Ballinger had entered the building where she lived.\nThe two briefly encountered one another on the seventh floor, and moments later Gurley lay dead of a gunshot wound to the chest."}
