Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., and Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., repeatedly questioned Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg on bank loans awarded to NewSat, an Australian company benefiting from more than $100 million in taxpayer-backed financing, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing today.\n\n\u201cThis is more evidence that we\u2019re beyond broken here at the Export-Import Bank,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cAt this point, [NewSat] appears to be handing you a $100-million loss.\u201d\n\nEx-Im\u2019s Board of Directors unanimously approved more than $300 million in loans for NewSat and disbursed $139 million to the company. Last year, however, the company entered into \u201ctechnical default\u201d with Lockheed Martin after it failed to make several payments. Lockheed Martin was building NewSat\u2019s Jabiru-1 satellite.\n\nThe Australian company then filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States in April, and NewSat is now selling its assets.\n\nEx-Im often touts its default rate of less than 1 percent. However, NewSat\u2019s ability to repay its loan remains unseen.\n\nDespite the skepticism from Mulvaney and Huizenga, Hochberg reassured the panel Ex-Im is still negotiating with the company.\n\n\u201cEvery loan we make is not going to perform perfectly and flawlessly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is one that is, frankly, right now, troubled. We\u2019re working through a solution.\u201d\n\nNewSat\u2019s satellite is close to completion, but Lockheed Martin is the primary owner. According to documents filed with a Delaware bankruptcy court, NewSat was given a May 18 deadline to secure more financing with Ex-Im and private financiers in an effort to save the project. If it couldn\u2019t, NewSat faced having its contract with Lockheed Martin cancelled.\n\n>>> New Report on Export-Import Bank Finds Problems With Transparency, Cronyism\n\nEx-Im ultimately refused to extend more financing to NewSat, citing \u201cpolicy/business decisions,\u201d according to court filings, and Mulvaney was skeptical about why the bank would choose that option.\n\n\u201cApparently the bankruptcy court gave you the opportunity to protect your investment or your loan by finishing the project. You chose not to do so,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nLockheed Martin is now able to sell the satellite without repaying Ex-Im and private creditors for the $139 million it received from NewSat. NewSat made the payments to Lockheed Martin by using the Ex-Im loans.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lost $100 million, and you\u2019ve given a several-hundred-million dollar windfall to Lockheed Martin at the expense of the taxpayer,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nIn the years since the bank\u2019s reauthorization in 2012\u2014which included many reforms\u2014the Government Accountability Office issued a number of recommendations to improve Ex-Im and its operations. In September 2014, the Government Accountability Office recommended the bank improve the means by which it assessed collateral on different transactions.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mulvaney questioned why Ex-Im had no security interest in collateral, despite these recommendations.\n\n\u201cYou lent $100 million to a satellite start-up, and you kept no security interest, no collateral at all?\u201d Mulvaney asked.\n\nAlso included in Ex-Im\u2019s 2012 reforms and finalized in 2014 were \u201cknow your customer\u201d practices, and Huizenga said that had the bank correctly vetted NewSat, it would\u2019ve protected itself from such a loss.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that either you knew about it and had some suspicions and went ahead with it, which obviously would be a bad decision, or you didn\u2018t have the systems in place to actually root it out,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cEither one of those is a bad scenario from my perspective, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it\u2019s beyond broken and we\u2019re not going to be able to save the Export-Import Bank from itself.\u201d\n\nNewSat\u2019s Jabiru-1 satellite was frequently touted as Australia\u2019s first non-government, non-foreign owned satellite.\n\nHowever, the company has been under intense scrutiny after internal audits\u2014which were sent to Ex-Im\u2014detailed conflicts of interest and excessive spending by the company\u2019s top executives. The Daily Signal documented the company\u2019s troubles in March.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s Board of Directors approved up to $300 million in financing to the satellite company. However, just $139 million was disbursed, according to data from the bank.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expires June 30, and with just 14 legislative days left before the deadline, its future has been the subject of intense debate on Capitol Hill.\n\nRep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, staunchly opposes the bank and argues it furthers corporate welfare and cronyism. Though many Republicans on the panel are pushing for Ex-Im\u2019s end, the issue has proved to be divisive among the GOP.\n\n>>> Commentary: How Congress Can Put a Stop to Cronyism and Corporate Welfare", "article_metadata": {"description": "Members of Congress criticized Ex-m's top official for pursuing a deal in which the bank could be on the hook for more than $100 million.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Members of Congress criticized Ex-m's top official for pursuing a deal in which the bank could be on the hook for more than $100 million.", "title": "GOP Lawmakers Question \u2018Troubled\u2019 $100 Million Ex-Im Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150603_ExImHearing_Quinn1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-09T14:57:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1dMOu6G"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Members of Congress criticized Ex-m's top official for pursuing a deal in which the bank could be on the hook for more than $100 million.", "title": "GOP Lawmakers Question \u2018Troubled\u2019 $100 Million Ex-Im Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150603_ExImHearing_Quinn1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-06-03T16:45:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-09T14:57:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Mick Mulvaney, Bill Huizenga, NewSat, Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, Fred Hochberg, Lockheed Martin, House Financial Services Committee"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is more evidence that we\u2019re beyond broken here at the Export-Import Bank,\u201d Huizenga said.\nLast year, however, the company entered into \u201ctechnical default\u201d with Lockheed Martin after it failed to make several payments.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lost $100 million, and you\u2019ve given a several-hundred-million dollar windfall to Lockheed Martin at the expense of the taxpayer,\u201d Mulvaney said.\nLockheed Martin is now able to sell the satellite without repaying Ex-Im and private creditors for the $139 million it received from NewSat.\nEx-Im\u2019s Board of Directors approved up to $300 million in financing to the satellite company."}
