A October 2011 picture of Hillary Clinton with Blackberry in hand on the military plane on her way to Libya became an iconic symbol of her time as Secretary of State. Trey Gowdy now says that in all of the emails Clinton has turned over to the House Committee on Benghazi there is not a single email from the trip to Libya or that October night.



Bob Schieffer asked Trey Gowdy on Sunday’s Face the Nation if there any gaps of time in the stack that was turned over. Reports have come out that the Hillary Clinton camp had full control over which emails were handed over. Gowdy said there were months and months of time missing from the emails.



“With respect to the president, it’s not up to Secretary Clinton to determine what is public record,” said Gowdy.
