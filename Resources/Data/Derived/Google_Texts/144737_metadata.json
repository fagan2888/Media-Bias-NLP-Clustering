It no longer pays for companies to subsidize the cost of their retirees\u2019 health care, so many have exited these programs.\n\nNow that they are in the open market, retirees and seniors are confronted by soaring premiums when they seek to purchase a health plan. This is especially true for branded prescription drugs.\n\nAs a consequence, seniors are being forced to move from branded drugs to generics, and from generics to over-the-counter medicines. Clearly, quality deteriorates as you move down the scale.\n\nThis is not conducive to good health, I would say. Besides, some retirees\u2019 drug bills will more than double this year compared with last year. If this is not Obamacare-induced inflation, I would like to know what is.\n\nFurther affecting older Americans\u2019 financial security is the fact that many pols view cutting Social Security benefits as a means of reducing the government\u2019s budget deficit \u2014 even though Social Security is running a surplus and thus is actually adding to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nMost recently, Congress considered reducing seniors\u2019 cost of living allowances (COLA), which would have taken thousands of dollars out of older Americans\u2019 pockets. Others want to go after Medicare by cutting benefits or forcing seniors to pay higher premiums or co-payments.\n\nYou might as well put these older Americans on an ice floe and set them adrift.\n\nTax increases to pay for Obamacare have already cut into many seniors\u2019 buying power besides jacking up their drug bills and premiums to pay for health care.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not making things any easier for retired folk. Its low-interest-rate policy has reduced the income seniors used to get from safe, fixed-income securities such as bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills, notes and bonds.\n\nThe bottom line is that older Americans are faced with more expenses to pay for their health and less income to cover these costs. Those pols who step up to the plate and try to ameliorate the quandary seniors are in stand to pick up a nice chunk of supporters which could be very helpful, come the next elections.\n\nAfter all, older Americans not only vote \u2014 they vote at higher rates than most of the rest of the population, and they are loyal.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The government is soaking senior, especially in terms of drug costs, writes Irwin Kellner.", "creator": "@MktwKellner", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CX178_senior_ZG_20141022152634.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Irwin Kellner", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The government is soaking senior, especially in terms of drug costs, writes Irwin Kellner.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/older-americans-are-getting-thrown-under-the-bus-2015-05-05", "author": "Irwin Kellner", "parsely-title": "Older Americans are getting thrown under the bus", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-05T08:30:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The government is soaking senior, especially in terms of drug costs, writes Irwin Kellner.", "title": "Older Americans are getting thrown under the bus", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/older-americans-are-getting-thrown-under-the-bus-2015-05-05", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CX178_senior_ZG_20141022152634.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CX178_senior_ZG_20141022152634.jpg"}, "article.id": "A688A1CC-F2CF-11E4-B0D7-DE00E100AC01", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "After all, older Americans not only vote \u2014 they vote at higher rates than most of the rest of the population, and they are loyal.\nYou might as well put these older Americans on an ice floe and set them adrift.\nMost recently, Congress considered reducing seniors\u2019 cost of living allowances (COLA), which would have taken thousands of dollars out of older Americans\u2019 pockets.\nThe bottom line is that older Americans are faced with more expenses to pay for their health and less income to cover these costs.\nIt no longer pays for companies to subsidize the cost of their retirees\u2019 health care, so many have exited these programs."}
