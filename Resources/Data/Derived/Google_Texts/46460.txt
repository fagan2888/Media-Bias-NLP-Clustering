Before we get into the fine print of President Obama’s “apology” for what’s happening to Americans losing their health insurance because of ObamaCare, we’d like to add some perspective.

We do so by comparing what Obama just said to the unequivocal language George W. Bush used when he addressed the failures of his Iraq policy in January 2007.

Here’s Bush: “The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people, and it is unacceptable to me. Our troops in Iraq have fought bravely. They have done everything we have asked them to do. Where mistakes have been made, the responsibility rests with me. It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq.”

In addition to taking all the blame, his actions showed he meant it. He fired his defense secretary. He came up with a new strategy, the surge. And it worked.

Instead of giving a nationally televised address, Obama slipped a reference to Americans losing their health insurance into an NBC interview: “I am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me. We’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and that we’re going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.”

Again in contrast to Bush, the responsible Cabinet officer keeps her job, the failing strategy remains intact and the president makes a lame joke that he would fix it himself if he knew how to write code.

Bush’s mea culpa led to the successful surge in Iraq.

Anyone believe that the half-hearted “sorry” we heard from Obama will lead to a similar success for ObamaCare?
