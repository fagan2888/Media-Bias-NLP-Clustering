People are illegally selling their electronic food stamp cards on Craigslist and other social media sites for cash. CBS13 found two people here in Sacramento, both with the same idea, using Craigslist as free advertising to blatantly and illegally sell their state benefits. Our hidden cameras were rolling as a woman, who we\u2019ll call Lorie, told our undercover producer about her brilliant idea to game the system for a quick buck. \u201cEveryone said I was crazy, but I thought they\u2019d say, \u2018that\u2019s freaking brilliant man,\u2019 \u201d she said. Another man, who we\u2019ll call Joe, rolled up on a skateboard. He showed us his CalFresh card he illegally put up for sale on Craigslist. \u201cSee, right now it still has $116 on it,\u201d he told our undercover producer. Rather than use that money for food like he\u2019s supposed to, Joe offered to sell us the card for just $60 cash. \u201cI just need the money right now,\u201d said Joe. \u201cI moved back in with my mom.\u201d\n\nObviously the food stamps program was never conceived so moochers and (presumably) unemployed skateboarders could sell their benefits online in exchange for quick cash. It\u2019s bad enough that EBT card recipients are already using their taxpayer subsidies to purchase alcohol and lap dances. But this might be a new low. Now, apparently, with the click of a mouse, recipients can instantly turn welfare into cash. The federal government, meanwhile, seems utterly incapable of monitoring these fraudsters and hucksters, even though what they\u2019re doing is patently illegal:\n\nThe annual cost of food stamp fraud, nationwide, is three-quarters of a billion dollars. People attempting to buy or sell food stamps are breaking the law. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that we\u2019re aware of. It\u2019s an issue we\u2019re serious about and that we\u2019re monitoring,\u201d said Weston. The department has started using custom software to scour social media daily \u2014 Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter \u2014 in search of illegal ads like the ones Lorie and Joe put up. \u201cWe need to leverage technology ourselves in order to keep ahead of these people,\u201d said Weston.\n\nThere will always be parasites who game the system in order to subsidize their own care-free lifestyles. But this is truly a shame. It undermines the program\u2019s true purpose: to feed those who earnestly cannot feed themselves.\n\nLord knows what these recipients\u2019 are doing with all that cash. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: they\u2019re not spending it all on food.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you ever needed more evidence that EBT recipients are abusing America\u2019s welfare system, look no further than what\u2019s going on in Sacramento, California. .05/25/2016 9:23:30AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "If you ever needed more evidence that EBT recipients are abusing America\u2019s welfare system, look no further than what\u2019s going on in Sacramento, California.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Caught: Food Stamp Recipients Sell Benefits on Craiglist for Cash", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2013/11/04/caught-food-stamp-recipients-sell-benefits-for-cash-n1736236", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2010/43/99d8f0f4-d546-472a-92a8-6c4a23c757bf@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "If you ever needed more evidence that EBT recipients are abusing America\u2019s welfare system, look no further than what\u2019s going on in Sacramento, California.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Caught: Food Stamp Recipients Sell Benefits on Craiglist for Cash", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2013/11/04/caught-food-stamp-recipients-sell-benefits-for-cash-n1736236", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2010/43/99d8f0f4-d546-472a-92a8-6c4a23c757bf@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Caught: Food Stamp Recipients Sell Benefits on Craiglist for Cash, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d02\"", "article_summary": "CBS13 found two people here in Sacramento, both with the same idea, using Craigslist as free advertising to blatantly and illegally sell their state benefits.\nPeople attempting to buy or sell food stamps are breaking the law.\nPeople are illegally selling their electronic food stamp cards on Craigslist and other social media sites for cash.\nRather than use that money for food like he\u2019s supposed to, Joe offered to sell us the card for just $60 cash.\nNow, apparently, with the click of a mouse, recipients can instantly turn welfare into cash."}
