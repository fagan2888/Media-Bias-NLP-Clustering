He upset everyone. He helped pioneer the fiscal conservatism and federalist emphasis of the post-Bush Republican Party, but criticized the plan to defund Obamacare as \u201cdishonest.\u201d He put holds on hundreds of bills during his time in the Senate, including a veteran\u2019s suicide prevention bill right before he left Congress. He swears that the Senate revoked his ability to practice medicine pro bono while also serving was retribution for blocking bills and calling out other members on earmarks he found egregious. This was the senator who once called Harry Reid an \u201cabsolute asshole.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Flake is not like this. No one would ever confuse the two men. But the truth is, he might be Coburn\u2019s successor on Capitol Hill \u2014 at least, he\u2019s certainly trying to take on the Oklahoman\u2019s legacy.\n\nA tan, tall, blonde man with a blindingly white smile, Flake refuses to curse. The Arizona senator is polite to a fault, easygoing, and according to the senior senator of his state, incredibly handsome.\n\n\u201cIf I looked like Jeff Flake, I\u2019d be president of the United States,\u201d John McCain said.\n\nThe cleancut image belies a Republican unorthodoxy on a number of key issues that\u2019s separated him from many of his colleagues. He is for large immigration bills that would eventually allow illegal immigrants to earn citizenship. His work with the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d on immigration earned him the scorn of conservative right. He\u2019s supportive of approving the president\u2019s nominees, including Loretta Lynch for Attorney General. He supports open relations with Cuba and lifting the travel ban there (more than once he\u2019s been termed \u201cObama\u2019s ally\u201d on the issue).\n\nBut now that Republicans have the majority in Congress, Flake is hoping that he\u2019ll be able to go back to being known for the thing that got him to Congress in the first place: federal spending. While he served in the House, the Club For Growth championed Flake, who was something of an earmark hipster \u2014 against them before it was cool. He rankled Republicans and Democrats alike during every appropriations season, spending hours on the floor trying to defund other lawmaker\u2019s projects funneling money home.\n\nBecause of the emphasis, Flake got yelled at, a lot. There was the time Republican Curt Weldon proclaimed he wasn\u2019t going to let Flake stand on the floor in\u201d total and complete ignorance and spout off a bunch of gobbledygook\u201d when Flake challenged an earmark in Weldon\u2019s Pennsylvania district.\n\nThen there was the time Jose Serrano, a Democrat from the Bronx, was livid that Flake tried to cut $300,000 from the Bronx council of the arts.\n\n\u201cThe more you get up on me sir, the more I realize you don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d he said on the floor.\n\nDespite his hundreds of attempts, Flake was successful in his anti-earmark crusading only once: targeting a North Carolina Republican for a Christmas tree project in his district.\n\n\u201cIt was Patrick McHenry\u2019s perfect Christmas tree project. And he had angered the Democrats so many times, they wanted to punish them more than they wanted to protect earmarks,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go after both parties, if you want credibility.\u201d\n\nWhile Flake continued to push his House agenda on spending and took up many of Coburn\u2019s causes \u2014 including doing things like offering Coburn\u2019s amendment to the Keystone XL pipeline \u201cto identify and eliminate duplicative green building programs across the federal government\u201d, those efforts went largely unnoticed due to the oxygen taken up by looming fiscal deadlines and partisan fights Flake tends to shy away from.\n\nMeanwhile, a bigger platform should be opening \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised the Senate\u2019s return to regular order when it comes to the budget and appropriations. And that\u2019s where Flake vows to return to being the kind of pain in the ass he was in the House.\n\nAsked why he hasn\u2019t gotten more attention for his work on fiscal issues in the Senate thus far, Flake said there just hasn\u2019t been enough of a focus on spending in the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just difficult when we haven\u2019t done appropriations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve had no appropriation bills on the floor and there\u2019s really been no focus on discretionary spending so that\u2019s the tough part.\u201d\n\nFlake\u2019s begun a press effort around the topic, issuing a \u201cweekly roasting of egregious federal spending\u201d that\u2019s straight out of Coburn\u2019s playbook. Coburn\u2019s yearly \u201cWastebook\u201d highlighted similar offenses: money for a 3-D pizza printer, a $297 million \u201cmega-blimp,\u201d and money for a \u201csuperheroes documentary.\u201d\n\nHis 2012 Senate race earned him the endorsements of a wide swath of conservative groups and figures like Sarah Palin. But his time in the Senate and goodwill with conservatives has hit a bit of a rough spot as he worked on passing a large immigration bill in the Senate with a bipartisan group (conservative radio host Laura Ingraham said she\u2019d move to Arizona to primary Flake if she had to). And he\u2019s had to learn to take some heat back home just by virtue of representing an entire state rather than one very conservative district.\n\nPart of that, too, is that Flake just isn\u2019t as flashy or attention grabbing as some of his fellow freshman senators, like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul. He hasn\u2019t tried to block legislation, and doesn\u2019t believe Republicans can seriously defund Obamacare through appropriations. And it\u2019s difficult to get Flake to say a bad word about President Obama.\n\n\u201cI do disagree with him a lot but when I do agree with him I\u2019m not afraid to say it,\u201d Flake said.\n\n\u201cYou can get some good headlines by being partisan but you\u2019ll be a flash in the pan,\u201d he added.\n\nBut those that have known him longest say Flake\u2019s the real deal on spending \u2014 and don\u2019t think the issues Flake has chosen to take on should shock anyone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed. He talks more about Cuba and immigration reform now but it\u2019s been years he\u2019s been advocating for those things,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon, a conservative hardliner in the House who noted that Flake\u2019s higher profile in the Senate just draws more attention to some of the positions he\u2019s long held.\n\nAnd there\u2019s still this idea that this approach \u2014 the occasional breaks with the party\u2019s momentum \u2014 are the basis for other successes. Before Flake was elected to the House in 2001, he and Salmon visited Capitol Hill. Coburn was the first and most obvious person Flake said he wanted to meet.\n\n\u201cI went in and Matt said, \u2018This is Jeff Flake,\u2019 and Dr. Coburn said, \u2018Are going to be as big of a \u2018blankety-blank\u2019 as you need to be?\u2019\u201d Flake recalled. (A devout Mormon, Flake says swearing is not one of his vices.)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do that, if you want credibility on an issue and that\u2019s why Tom Coburn was so effective. You couldn\u2019t tell if he had a partisan bone in his body sometimes he was going after who ever did it,\u201d Flake added. \u201cPeople knew and respected him because of that, it wasn\u2019t a personal thing.\u201d\n\nCoburn, meanwhile, is back in Oklahoma and receiving treatment for prostate cancer. His view on Congress these days is pretty grim: He left Congress in part because of his illness but mostly because he didn\u2019t feel like he could really be effective anymore. Frustrated with the process, Coburn said he told McConnell he\u2019d be retiring about a year and a half before he actually announced he would be. He\u2019s more focused these days on beating cancer (\u201cI think I\u2019m meaner than cancer,\u201d he says) and working with state legislatures \u201cto help them regain their role in fighting the federal government.\u201d\n\nBut he has some faith that Flake will be able to cause a ruckus. Much like Flake, Coburn said his holds and attempts to defund earmarks and or programs through amendments never really went in anywhere: but that was never the point. And he warned that if Flake is successful at drawing attention to spending in the way he was, he should expect to not have too many friends left in the Senate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s smarter, younger, and better looking than me and he can make a big impact if he wants,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cBut if Jeff does the most effective job at this he\u2019s not going to be very well liked even though he has the most beautiful smile.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were to inform the American public about the stupidity about what we were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you embarrass people for their stupidity, you\u2019re going to take a lot of heat for that.\u201d\n\nFlake has already begun some of the work Coburn left behind: his staff has already begun pouring through programs in the EPA and the USDA they want to bring attention to. Earmarks may be a thing of the past, but there are plenty of government programs that home-state senators inevitably want to protect.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come after him with knives,\u201d Coburn said.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3723606, "userid": 686094}, "description": "The Arizona Republican wants to live up to Tom Coburn's legacy and get back to what started his rise to the Senate in the first place....", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
