DENVER (CBS4)– Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner says Obamacare isn’t working. The Republican representing Colorado has joined the majority of his party claiming the Affordable Care Act needs to be replaced with something else.

“While American families were promised they could keep their health insurance if they liked it, they were promised premiums would decrease, they’ve seen nothing but hardship and increases in cost,” said Gardner.

Gardner believes the ACA needs to be repealed and replaced which is a possibility if a GOP candidate wins the presidential election.

CBS4’s Jim Benemann interviewed Pres. Obama about the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday.
