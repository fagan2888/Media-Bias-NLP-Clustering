Soviet troops freed Hungary from Nazi rule at the end of the war.\n\nOne of the least known atrocities of World War II took place on Aug. 2, 1944, at the German Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau when nearly 3,000 Roma people were killed overnight.\n\nCommemorations and conferences took place this week in Krakow, Poland, and at the former Auschwitz-Birkenau camp nearby with participants from 20 European countries. Besides many Roma groups, delegates of the United Nations, the European Commission, the European Parliament and government officials took part in the events, saying Europe\u2019s youth needs to be more aware of the Roma genocide.\n\n\u201cThe collective amnesia and apathy regarding the Roma Genocide during World War II is an apt demonstration of Europe\u2019s current treatment of its 12-million-strong Roma community,\u201d Zeljko Jovanovic, director of Open Society Foundations\u2019 Roma Initiatives Office told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Roma are in many ways underprivileged especially in the Eastern part of the European Union. Poverty and petty crime is relatively high among the gypsy population and so is their number in prosecution compared to the majority society. Access to education, especially higher education, is lower and the ratio of Roma professionals is below the countries\u2019 average.\n\nHungary\u2019s major opposition parties, except for far-right Jobbik, also participated in the events in Budapest, their representatives also stressing the responsibility of the current government in raising the acceptance of the Roma in the society.\n\n\u201cWe must say no to violence, we must reject it, no-one can give the go-ahead to violence, there\u2019s no acceptable explanation,\u201d Hungary\u2019s ministry responsible for social issues said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Central Europe this weekend commemorated the 70th anniversary of a World War II attempt to exterminate all European Roma, a German Nazi initiative that cost the lives of 500,000 Roma and Sinti.", "title": "Central Europe Commemorates 70th Anniversary of WWII Roma Genocide", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/08/04/central-europe-commemorates-70th-anniversary-of-wwii-roma-genocide/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DY402_Roma1_P_20140803112312.jpg"}, "site": "EmergingEurope", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Central Europe Commemorates 70th Anniversary of WWII Roma Genocide", "description": "Central Europe this weekend commemorated the 70th anniversary of a World War II attempt to exterminate all European Roma, a German Nazi initiative that cost the lives of 500,000 Roma and Sinti.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Veronika Gulyas", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Emerging Europe Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Emerging Europe Real Time", "article.summary": "Central Europe this weekend commemorated the 70th anniversary of a World War II attempt to exterminate all European Roma, a German Nazi initiative that cost the lives of 500,000 Roma and Sinti.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-04T09:20:28-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/08/04/central-europe-commemorates-70th-anniversary-of-wwii-roma-genocide/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-NEB-7734", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Central Europe this weekend commemorated the 70th anniversary of a World War II attempt to exterminate all European Roma, a German Nazi initiative that cost the lives of 500,000 Roma and Sinti.", "title": "Central Europe Commemorates 70th Anniversary of WWII Roma Genocide", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/08/04/central-europe-commemorates-70th-anniversary-of-wwii-roma-genocide/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DY402_Roma1_P_20140803112312.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Emerging Europe Real Time", "article.id": "BL-NEB-7734", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-04T09:23:06-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd046d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe collective amnesia and apathy regarding the Roma Genocide during World War II is an apt demonstration of Europe\u2019s current treatment of its 12-million-strong Roma community,\u201d Zeljko Jovanovic, director of Open Society Foundations\u2019 Roma Initiatives Office told The Wall Street Journal.\nOne of the least known atrocities of World War II took place on Aug. 2, 1944, at the German Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau when nearly 3,000 Roma people were killed overnight.\nA Roma boy looking after the banners used at the remembrance walk in Budapest at the 70th anniversary of the Romani Phorraimos during the WWII The Wall Street JournalCentral Europe this weekend commemorated the 70th anniversary of a World War II attempt to exterminate all European Roma, a German Nazi initiative that cost the lives of 500,000 Roma and Sinti.\nAccess to education, especially higher education, is lower and the ratio of Roma professionals is below the countries\u2019 average.\nGyula Horvath, one of the Roma participants of the Budapest remembrance walk, was wearing a brown triangle, a sign the Roma had had to wear just like Jews were forced to display yellow stars."}
