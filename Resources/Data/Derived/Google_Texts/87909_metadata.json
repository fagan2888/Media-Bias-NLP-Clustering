The phrase is such a familiar saw now that marketers are starting to argue for other heirs to the throne including \u201ccontext\u201d and \u201cdistribution.\u201d While it\u2019s unlikely anything will unseat content, it\u2019s an interesting discussion to have. At a recent Cynopsis Digital Monetization Summit, Steve Bradbury, COO of Zazoom conducted a panel discussion that included audience members in an exercise to fill in the blank, \u201cContent and _________ are King.\u201d If we concede that content is king, then what is the next most important element that helps content rule the marketing kingdom?\n\nThe audience came up with 18 options, with \u201cconsumer\u201d coming out on top. What did this exercise teach us? Content on its own can\u2019t succeed. Far too often brands have a Field of Dreams approach \u2013 if you build it they will come, as if it were a birthright. It\u2019s honorable that they\u2019ve committed to creating content, but content alone simply isn\u2019t enough. Brands have to take into consideration just what content they\u2019re creating, who they\u2019re creating it for, how it will affect the audience emotionally, how it will be distributed and more. Just as the King has his court, content needs other elements of a marketing strategy to give it the best chance to succeed.\n\nWith that in mind, here five questions to keep in mind for your next content marketing initiative:\n\n1. Does it move me? Not all content is created equal. Not even close. When it comes to content that is most likely to be shared or go viral, it\u2019s the content that resonates with the audience and moves them emotionally that is best positioned for success. Content that is unique, creative and useful will also strike a chord within your audience members, persuading them to share. If your content isn\u2019t hitting some emotional chord\u2014as loudly and provocatively as possible\u2014it will be difficult for that content to succeed.\n\nWestJet\u2019s award-winning real-time giving campaign (and subsequent work with the Ronald McDonald House Charities Canada) wasn\u2019t just impressive, it was incredible. It was so moving during the holiday season that people were compelled to share.\n\nBuzzwords: Emotion, Resonance, Creativity\n\n2. Do I care? Some pieces of content are so good that they transcend the boundaries of age, gender, race and wealth. But most content targets a specific audience, unique in its own way. They are consuming a specific type of content at a specific time on a specific channel. They have their specific wants and needs and concerns. If your content ignores any of these elements, then it\u2019s more likely to be ignored by the target because it doesn\u2019t matter to them. Without the right context and timing, there\u2019s no relevance. If the content isn\u2019t relevant, the audience will simply move on.\n\nNewcastle did a great job with their latest \u201cIndependence Eve\u201d campaign, creating content that fits perfectly within the context of Britains least favorite holiday, Independence Day.\n\nBuzzwords: Context, Relevance, Timing\n\n3. Who is talking about it? If you look at the marketing content that has been the most successful over the last few years\u2014Old Spice, Oreo, Kony2012, Newcastle\u2014they all have one thing in common: people just had to talk about it. Content that compels people to talk and share will drive social contagion. Without it, it\u2019s just another piece of content.\n\nIn the case of Old Spice, a real-time YouTube response campaign targeting influencers (at first) helped fuel the distribution of the content, which was time sensitive (people had to immediately know that it was happening in order for it\u2019s real-time nature to be effective and impressive). Getting the right people talking and sharing is what made it such a success.\n\nBuzzwords: Influencers, Word of Mouth, Conversation\n\n4. What do you want me to do? Ultimately, all content must have a purpose. It seems obvious, but you\u2019d be surprised how many brands will create content simply because they think it\u2019s a great idea and not because it\u2019s tied to a real business goal. Whether it\u2019s to grow a social following, solicit donations or drive purchase, the content must compel a user to take action and engage. If you simply want your content to reach as many people as possible, are you giving your audience call-to-action to share? Are you incentivizing it in any way?\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign\u2019s equality sign campaign struck gold in 2013 when they gave a simple call-to-action to equality supporters around the world: Change your photo to a red and white equals sign. Ultimately around 2.7 million people changed their Facebook profile picture.\n\nBuzzwords: Engagement, Call-to-Action\n\n5. Where did I see it? We\u2019d all love to know the recipe for viral success. Then the only thing we\u2019d spend money on is creating the content and it will be so good the audience can\u2019t help but share. Unfortunately, that recipe doesn\u2019t exist. And with such an alarming rate of content\u2014videos, articles, e-books, games, experiences & more\u2014being created on a daily basis, the signal to noise ratio makes it even more difficult to draw eyeballs to your specific content. That\u2019s where distribution comes in. With an effective distribution strategy, even just to initially seed the content; brands can have enough of a spark to light a fire. Just make sure to focus on funding the production of quality content first.\n\nIn an unorthodox move, President Barack Obama joined comedian Zack Galifinakis on an episode of Between Two Ferns to publicize the Affordable Care Act and Healthcare.gov. The video was an instant viral success and helped put what is commonly seen as a dry topic (healthcare reform) in front of an elusive millennial target.\n\nBuzzwords: Distribution, Cash\n\nThere\u2019s no question that content can\u2019t rein as king all by itself. Emotion, context, distribution and more, are also essential to its success. What elements did we miss?\n\nJon Thomas is a Senior Digital Strategist at TracyLocke and frequent contributor to Say Daily.
