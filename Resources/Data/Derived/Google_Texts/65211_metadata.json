They can be large or small, simple or complex. Some even include mechanical parts that can turn the blocks into moving objects.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, hence the appeal, said Longmont LEGO artist Imagine Rigney.\n\nRigney, 19, is, not surprisingly, asking for LEGO sets for Christmas this year.\n\nThe blocks have topped Rigney's Christmas list since he was a little boy and have provided some of the enthusiast's most vivid holiday memories.\n\n\"I remember when I was maybe 4 or 5, my grandmother gave me an old LEGO computer game that wasn't sold anymore and I fell in love with the game and one of the old sets in the game,\" Rigney said. \"I asked Santa for the old set, it was called the Chrome Crusher. I had been dreaming about it and it was so amazing to see it on Christmas day.\"\n\n\"The LEGO Movie,\" released earlier this year, has increased interest in the toy this year, Rigney said. But the appeal and variety of LEGO sets will remain after the hype of the movie fades, he said.\n\n\"LEGOs make it possible to do anything you want,\" Rigney said. \"All of the dreams I had as a kid are coming true now, now that I have the means and capabilities to do it through LEGOs.\"\n\nWhitney Bryen: 303-684-5274, wbryen@times-call.com or twitter.com/soonerreporter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27174503/longmont-area-kids-letters-santa-lego-sets-dominate", "modificationDate": "2014-12-21T14:36:43-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1219/20141219__21TCCLIF~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n  Times-Call community reporter", "description": "In the age where children are playing with tablets and  video games controlled by voice and body movements, one traditional toy still dominates Christmas lists in Longmont.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27174503:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-20T11:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27174503/longmont-area-kids-letters-santa-lego-sets-dominate", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1219/20141219__21TCCLIF~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In the age where children are playing with tablets and  video games controlled by voice and body movements, one traditional toy still dominates Christmas lists in Longmont.", "title": "Longmont-area kids' letters to Santa: LEGO sets dominate"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "In the age where children are playing with tablets and  video games controlled by voice and body movements, one traditional toy still dominates Christmas lists in Longmont.", "title": "Longmont-area kids' letters to Santa: LEGO sets dominate", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27174503/longmont-area-kids-letters-santa-lego-sets-dominate", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1219/20141219__21TCCLIF~2.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-20T11:00:00-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-12-19T19:13:24-0700", "sailthru.title": "Longmont-area kids' letters to Santa: LEGO sets dominate", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Whitney BryenTimes-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1219/20141219__21TCCLIF~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-19T20:15:53-0700", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Longmont Colorado Lifestyles news, Longmont Colorado news, Lifestyles Longmont news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news."}, "article_summary": "Among more than 100 letters to Santa collected by the Longmont Times-Call this year, more than half included requests for LEGO sets.\nBut the appeal and variety of LEGO sets will remain after the hype of the movie fades, he said.\nDuring a visit with children at the Longmont Public Library Wednesday, Santa Claus said LEGO sets are among the most requested toy.\nIn his letter to Santa, Longmont resident Isaias asked for \"LEGOs, a dog for uncle, books, gloves and a couch for my room.\"\nAn anonymous letter to santa listed eight gifts, including a LEGO castle set, LEGO Chima lions and figures and \"random LEGOs.\""}
