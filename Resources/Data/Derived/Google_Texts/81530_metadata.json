Ted Cruz visited Madison in his final push for votes ahead of Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nIn a final push for Wisconsin voters, presidential candidate Ted Cruz came to Madison Monday for a town hall at the Masonic Center.\n\nThe event, hosted by Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, provided Cruz a platform to reiterate his message before voters cast their ballots in Tuesday\u2019s primary elections. Gov. Scott Walker joined the Texas senator halfway through the event to voice his support for the candidate.\n\n\u201cHere in Wisconsin, people work for something and not against something,\u201d Walker said on why he will vote for Cruz instead of Donald Trump.\n\nFormer presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was also at the event, as well as U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi.\n\nDuring the event, Cruz remained positive about his chances, maintaining that a Wisconsin victory would keep the nomination away from fellow candidate Trump and mark a trail to the party nomination. When Kelly questioned Cruz\u2019s future in the race, especially in the face of substantial support for Trump, Cruz responded to any doubts that he can outperform the current Republican frontrunner.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the last two weeks,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cDonald Trump has gotten his rear end whipped.\u201d\n\nSelected audience members posed questions to the candidate, with topics including abortion, Obamacare and the federal deficit.\n\nCruz outlined his plan for the future of health care, vowing to allow people to purchase insurance across state lines, expand health savings and de-link health insurance to jobs if he were elected president.\n\nOn the issue of abortion, Cruz stated that he hoped to \u201cchange American hearts and minds\u201d toward his pro-life stance. In order to reduce the deficit and curb government spending, Cruz emphasized his prerogative to establish a flat tax and focus on economic growth.\n\nWhen host Megyn Kelly questioned whether or not he would back Trump as the nominee, Cruz offered an alternate solution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Donald as the nominee, so we are going to beat him,\u201d Cruz said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://d2cmkzs15gh0fk.cloudfront.net/20160226Q1xFdMCMLZ/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "In a final push for Wisconsin voters, presidential candidate Ted Cruz came to Madison for a town hall at the Masonic Center on Monday.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Cardinal", "description": "In a final push for Wisconsin voters, presidential candidate Ted Cruz came to Madison for a town hall at the Masonic Center on Monday.", "title": "Cruz talks abortion, Trump at Madison town hall \n - The Daily Cardinal", "url": "http://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/cruz-talks-abortion-trump-at-madison-town-hall", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.car/16231_news_cruzf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.car/16231_news_cruzf.jpg", "site": "@dailycardinal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Daily Cardinal", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://d2cmkzs15gh0fk.cloudfront.net/20160226Q1xFdMCMLZ/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "The Daily Cardinal", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In a final push for Wisconsin voters, presidential candidate Ted Cruz came to Madison Monday for a town hall at the Masonic Center.\n\u201cDonald Trump has gotten his rear end whipped.\u201dSelected audience members posed questions to the candidate, with topics including abortion, Obamacare and the federal deficit.\n\u201cHere in Wisconsin, people work for something and not against something,\u201d Walker said on why he will vote for Cruz instead of Donald Trump.\nWhen host Megyn Kelly questioned whether or not he would back Trump as the nominee, Cruz offered an alternate solution.\nFormer presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was also at the event, as well as U.S. Sen.
