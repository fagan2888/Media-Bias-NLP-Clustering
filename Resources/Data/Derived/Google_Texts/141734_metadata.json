(Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSnedeker wins Pebble in record style\n\n\n\n\u2014 Brandt Snedeker shot a fourth consecutive round in the 60s, a 5-under-par 67 Sunday, and finished with a record score and a second win in three years at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n\n..\n\nWith a four-day total of 265, Snedeker ended at 22 under par, the lowest in history for the tournament.\n\n\n\nIn mostly beautiful weather on the Monterey Peninsula, Snedeker, 34, ended three shots ahead of Nick Watney, who came in second after a 3-under 69. Charlie Beljan, after a 69, was another shot behind at 269.\n\n..\n\nDustin Johnson, in his second event after a six-month, self-imposed absence that the tour denied was a suspension for the use of illegal substances, was part of a three-way tie for fourth with Jason Day and Pat Perez at 270. Jordan Spieth, Matt Jones and third-round leader Jim Furyk shared seventh place at 271.\n\n..\n\nFuryk, who shot a 63 on Saturday, stumbled to a 2-over 74 Sunday.\n\n\n\nJohnson, who won the rain-shortened AT&T in 2009 and successfully defended his title in 2010, closed with a 6-under 66.\n\n\n\nJ.B. Holmes, loser to Day last weekend in a two-hole playoff for the Farmers Insurance Open title at San Diego, shot 65 Sunday, as did Brendon Todd. They tied for eighth place at 272 along with Chesson Hadley, Vaughn Taylor, Alex Prugh, Daniel Berger, Jon Curran and Andres Gonzales.\n\n..\n\nSnedeker closed with back-to-back 67s at Pebble Beach Golf Links, where only the fog of the week arrived around noon Sunday and had no effect on the golf.\n\n\n\nSnedeker, a Vanderbilt grad, earned his seventh career PGA Tour win, but it was his first since the 2013 RBC Canadian Open. In the wraparound 2013-14 season, he compiled only four top-10 finishes in the 25 events he entered.\n\n..\n\nKnown for his short game, Snedeker said he briefly lost his touch on and around the greens. As high as No. 4 in the World Golf Rankings after his AT&T win in 2013, Snedeker was rated No. 63 before this weekend.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fun not being eligible for the Masters and not playing World Golf Championships,\u201d said Snedeker, who now gets back into the Masters thanks to his latest win.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had nobody to blame but myself,\u201d he said of his slump. \u201cI need to get out there and get it done.\u201d\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brandt Snedeker shot a fourth consecutive round in the 60s, a 5-under-par 67 Sunday, and finished with a record score and a second win in three years at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.", "title": "Snedeker wins Pebble in record style | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Brandt Snedeker shot a fourth consecutive round in the 60s, a 5-under-par 67 Sunday, and finished with a record score and a second win in three years at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.", "title": "Snedeker wins Pebble in record style | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150215/SPORTS05/150219378/1003", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150215/SPORTS05/150219378/AR/0/AR-150219378.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Golf", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Golf,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-02-15 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Brandt Snedeker shot a fourth consecutive round in the 60s, a 5-under-par 67 Sunday, and finished with a record score and a second win in three years at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.", "title": "Snedeker wins Pebble in record style | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150215/SPORTS05/150219378/1003", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150215/SPORTS05/150219378/AR/0/AR-150219378.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Gary A.
