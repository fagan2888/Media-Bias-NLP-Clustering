Statewide, the rate for young children was higher, rising by 18 percent, and on par with Orange County for children ages 5 to 17, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of the latest available rates by county.\n\n\n\nAll told, 4,088 children in Orange County and more than 68,000 elsewhere in California visited the ER for asthma treatment in 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly more work to be done if this many kids are going to the emergency department,\u201d said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program of the Oakland-based Public Health Institute. \u201cWe know a lot about what works. We absolutely should be able to reduce the rates we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasons for the increase in ER visits are complex, experts say. They include parents not properly administering medications, poverty and inadequate insurance coverage, persistently high levels of indoor and outdoor pollution in some regions and the limited reach of programs that seek to manage symptoms or prevent them.\n\n\n\nDr. Amy Harrison, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County, suggested that the recession had driven some families to her hospital\u2019s ER, because they had lost their insurance or had high-deductible insurance that led them to forego prescriptions and regular doctor visits.\n\n\n\nBecause the state data doesn\u2019t extend beyond 2012, it remains unclear how expanded coverage offered since last year under the Affordable Care Act and California\u2019s Medicaid program will affect emergency room visits. But experts hope to see more funding for programs that manage or prevent asthma symptoms through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n\n\n\nAlthough ER visits declined in some counties, including Alameda, San Mateo and Marin, the overall rise in California has frustrated public health experts who have spent millions of dollars and countless hours to improve and expand asthma prevention programs. The state and federal governments spend $1.54 million annually on such projects in California, including grants to schools to improve indoor air quality and training community health workers.\n\n\n\nAcross California, local and regional asthma programs aim to educate families and doctors to help keep kids out of the hospital. At the county level, including in Orange and Los Angeles counties, medically equipped vans called \u201cBreathmobiles\u201d provide comprehensive care in community settings with a goal of making sure children don\u2019t end up repeatedly in the ER.\n\n\n\nBeginning in March, the Breathmobile began stopping at the Orange County Health Care Agency in Santa Ana once a month.\n\n\n\nThe Breathmobile worked for Daniel Lee, 5, of Buena Park, who was still experiencing severe asthma symptoms after five trips to the ER last year. It turned out the doctors at the hospital had mixed his medications incorrectly \u2013 a common mistake when kids are treated in emergency rooms rather than by asthma-trained pediatricians, said Dr. Olga Guijon, associate medical director of the Breathmobile for CHOC.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll he wants to do is play soccer,\u201d said his mother, Young Lee, during a recent visit to the Breathmobile in Anaheim. \u201cBut every time he\u2019s running around on the field, he says: \u2018I feel weird.\u2019 So he has to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\nDaniel has improved drastically after being treated at the Breathmobile and having his medication adjusted, his mother said.\n\n\n\nThough often effective, these community programs are expensive and can\u2019t serve enough children to make a real difference statewide, said John Capitman, a California State Fresno public health professor and executive director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute.\n\n\n\nAnd health outreach workers have found it difficult to get reimbursed by insurers, including Medi-Cal, for proven strategies including home visits to minimize risks, Capitman said.\n\n\n\nSome families seek treatment in the ER for symptoms that easily could be dealt with in a clinic because they can\u2019t get a timely doctor\u2019s appointment or don\u2019t have a regular doctor \u2013 especially those without health insurance.\n\n\n\nSometimes, a bad cold and flu season can aggravate asthma that otherwise is well-controlled.\n\n\n\nBut some families simply don\u2019t know how to manage their child\u2019s condition at home, or know when to seek medical care before an ER visit becomes necessary, said Dr. Rami Keisari, medical director of the Pediatric Asthma Disease Management Program at the county-run Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges we have is getting parents to use the medications every day,\u201d Keisari said. \u201cWe have a really hard time convincing parents that this is a chronic condition.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rising rates don\u2019t seem to reflect an actual increase in the respiratory disease \u2013 about 15 percent of California children have been diagnosed with asthma, a number that has remained fairly steady since 2001.\n\n\n\nThe rates of ER visits vary widely by county, from a high of 300 visits per 10,000 children under age 5 (Madera County) to a low of 32 visits (Sutter County) in 2012. Younger children visit the ER at higher rates because they are more likely to have undiagnosed asthma and because their lung function is more difficult to measure, complicating the task of finding the right combination of medicines, Kelsey Lamb said.\n\n\n\nThe rate of ER visits for children 5 and older more than doubled in rural Madera County and nearly doubled in Merced.\n\n\n\nIn Sacramento County, they rose by 48 percent and in Los Angeles, the largest county in the nation, by 17 percent.\n\n\n\nAffected children often live in homes with dust, mold or pets, which trigger asthma symptoms. They may need two inhalers \u2013 one for school and one for home \u2013 but insurance sometimes pays only for one.\n\n\n\nWhile particulate matter and ozone air pollution levels are declining somewhat in the region, they still can be high enough to trigger asthma attacks, said Capitman.\n\n\n\nStaff writer Jenna Chandler and Kaiser Health News reporter Heidi de Marco contributed to this story.\n\n\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "undef", "description": "Life: Asthma visits to ER are on the rise for O.C. children | asthma, county, children, health, visits, california, orange, percent, rates, programs", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "BARBARA FEDER OSTROV", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Children in Orange County and across California increasingly seek emergency room treatment for asthma, despite millions of dollars spent on programs to control the disease.In Orange County, between 2005 and 2012 the rates of ER visits for asthma symptoms swelled by about 14 percent for children ages 5 to 17 and by 6 percent for children under 5.
