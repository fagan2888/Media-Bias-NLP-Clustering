KENTWOOD, MI – Autocam Corp. President and CEO John Kennedy says his outspoken opposition to the Affordable Health Care Act, or Obamacare, is not based on his politics as much as his views on “social justice.”

As he celebrates the 25th annivesary of Autocam Corp., which makes precision parts for the automotive and medical industry, Kennedy has become more well known for his high-profile opposition to the federal health care mandate.

Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, became a headliner for Obamacare opponents by challenging the law's mandate that employers who provide health care coverage must provide birth control pills and “morning-after” pills designed to abort pregnancies shortly after conception.

After losing at the U.S. District Court level and the appellate level, Kennedy is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court with the help of “Catholic Vote” and other groups involved in his initial case against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

His workers are well-paid and treated fairly as an extension of his religious beliefs, Kennedy said. “I want to stay consistent with the same faith that informs my values as a business person,” he said.

Kennedy says his 600 U.S. employees earn an average of $53,000 a year and have health savings accounts from which they can buy birth control or contraceptives. “They can use their HAS debit card to buy anything they want to buy.

But Kennedy said he objects to the government’s insistence that his self-insured company pay for the drugs. Since he has begun complying with the federal mandates, Kennedy said he has avoided learning how many, if any, of his employees are using their benefits for birth control or contraception.

“I’m a person who loves freedom. I love the opportunities I’ve been given.”
