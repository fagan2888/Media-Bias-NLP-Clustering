Land of Lincoln mailed a notification letter on Jan. 19, telling customers they had until Jan. 31 to find new coverage if they wished to continue seeking care at in-network rates at University of Chicago Medicine.\n\nBlumenthal said the change forced him to purchase a plan costing $170 more per month, as well as pay more than $500 for medication in mid-January.\n\nHartzmark said he was forced to purchase a plan costing $825 more per month for the same coverage.\n\nThe plaintiffs are also asking the judge to certify a class of other plaintiffs in the case, potentially including anyone who bought Land of Lincoln 2016 policies because the policies included coverage for care through University of Chicago Medicine.\n\nThe complaint comes as another strike against the troubled health insurer, created as a co-op in 2012 under the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Land of Lincoln secured a $160 million loan from the federal government in 2012 to launch operations. It secured an insurance license from the state of Illinois in 2013.\n\nAccording to reports published in Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, Land of Lincoln has now lost $50 million since its inception, and has stopped taking on new customers.\n\nThe class action complaint, which included counts of consumer fraud and unjust enrichment, asked the court to issue injunctions barring Land of Lincoln from continuing to engage in \u201csimilar conduct,\u201d or from obtaining releases from potential class members. The plaintiffs also requested damages including restitution, and statutory, compensatory and punitive damages, with interest, plus attorney fees.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Clinton A. Krislov and Christopher M. Hack, of Krislov & Associates, of Chicago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two Chicago men have slapped a troubled provider of Obamacare health insurance policies with a class action lawsuit, alleging Land of Lincoln Health misled them into purchasing health plans on the belief the plans would include coverage for procedures at University of Chicago Medicine, even though Land of Lincoln allegedly knew the plans would not.", "author": "Jonathan Bilyk", "og": {"url": "http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510661798-obamacare-health-insurer-land-of-lincoln-health-hit-with-class-action-over-u-of-c-coverage-bait-switch", "image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/96/c9/137880/large_Land_of_Lincoln_Health.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two Chicago men have slapped a troubled provider of Obamacare health insurance policies with a class action lawsuit, alleging Land of Lincoln Health misled them into purchasing health plans on the belief the plans would include coverage for procedures at University of Chicago Medicine, even though Land of Lincoln allegedly knew the plans would not.", "title": "Obamacare health insurer Land of Lincoln Health hit with class action over U of C coverage 'bait & switch'"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/96/c9/137880/large_Land_of_Lincoln_Health.jpg", "title": "Obamacare health insurer Land of Lincoln Health hit with class action over U of C coverage 'bait & switch'", "description": "Two Chicago men have slapped a troubled provider of Obamacare health insurance policies with a class action lawsuit, alleging Land of Lincoln Health misled them into purchasing health plans on the belief the plans would include coverage for procedures at University of Chicago Medicine, even though Land of Lincoln allegedly knew the plans would not.", "card": "summary", "site": "@CookRecord"}, "articleid": 510661798, "article": {"published": "2016-02-04", "modified": "2016-02-04", "author": "http://cookcountyrecord.com/author/jonathan-bilyk"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Both men, who are not related, said they had purchased the health coverage through Land of Lincoln specifically because the plans had purportedly included coverage for care through University of Chicago Medicine.\nLand of Lincoln secured a $160 million loan from the federal government in 2012 to launch operations.\nOn Feb. 2, plaintiffs Daniel Blumenthal and Michael Hartzmark, who live in Chicago\u2019s Hyde Park neighborhood, filed their complaint in Cook County Circuit Court against Chicago-based Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Company, which does business as Land of Lincoln Health Inc.\n\u201cPrior to Dec. 18, 2015, University of Chicago informed defendant (Land of Lincoln) that it was not open to renegotiating their reimbursement rates,\u201d the complaint said.\nAccording to reports published in Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, Land of Lincoln has now lost $50 million since its inception, and has stopped taking on new customers."}
