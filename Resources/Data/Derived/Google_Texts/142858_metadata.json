Ultimately, it failed due in part to a lack of capital, according to state regulators, with thousands of consumers having to switch to new insurance carriers earlier this year.\n\n\"It was undercapitalized,\" said Bruce Ramge, spokesman for the Nebraska Department of Insurance. \"It operated through a series of loans from the federal government.\"\n\nWith this in mind, Medica will stress its track record as an insurance provider with 40 years experience, said Dannette Coleman, a senior vice president with the company.\n\n\"We're not an entity that was created out of legislation,\" Coleman said. \"We've got stability \u2014 this is something that we've been doing for years successfully. I think the people of both Iowa and Nebraska are going to need to understand that to feel safe.\"\n\nNebraska consumers appreciate more competition, but some will be wary if Medica comes in with very low premiums, said Brian McPike, president of Compensation Programs, Inc., an insurance agency in Lincoln, Neb.\n\nCoOportunity Health offered premiums that were substantially lower than other insurers, he said. The premiums attracted 10 times the number of enrollees expected, McPike said, but the growth contributed to the coop's financial problems.\n\nHe said of Medica: \"It's good \u2014 as long as they price it correctly.\"\n\nMedica did not release enrollment projections for its business in either Iowa or Nebraska. For 2014, the company posted strong financial results in its fully insured business, with operating income of about $123.5 million on $3.38 billion in revenue.\n\nMedica has about 1.5 million members across commercial and government health insurance markets in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Expansion plans at Minnetonka-based Medica now include Nebraska, too.", "title": "Medica to sell insurance in Nebraska, touting access to Mayo", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/medica-to-sell-insurance-in-nebraska-touting-access-to-mayo/304115021/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Expansion plans at Minnetonka-based Medica now include Nebraska, too.", "title": "Medica to sell insurance in Nebraska, touting access to Mayo", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/medica-to-sell-insurance-in-nebraska-touting-access-to-mayo/304115021/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Expansion plans at Minnetonka-based Medica now include Nebraska, too."}, "article_summary": "As is true in Iowa, Medica in Nebraska will tout access to the Rochester-based Mayo Clinic for certain diagnoses.\nMedica has about 1.5 million members across commercial and government health insurance markets in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\nThe coop was popular with Iowa and Nebraska consumers when it launched in late 2013.\nThe health insurer announced on Monday its plans to sell policies for 2016 in Nebraska, with sales to individuals who buy non-group policies both on and off the government-run health insurance exchange.\nI think the people of both Iowa and Nebraska are going to need to understand that to feel safe.\""}
