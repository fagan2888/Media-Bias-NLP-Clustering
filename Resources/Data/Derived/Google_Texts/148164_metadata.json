The office, a division of the Department of Education, only reluctantly wades into criminal justice matters. When the board does act, the publication reported, it is often years after patients have been neglected, sexually assaulted and even killed.\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told WNYC that his office questions whether the Department of Education is \"the right agency\" to put in charge of nurse licensing, saying, \"Should the state education department have the responsibility of licensing nurses, or is that too far afield for them and should the department of health do it?\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the ProPublica report\n\n- listen to Cuomo's interview\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS failed to report disciplined providers\n\nPhotos of dying patient posted to Facebook get four hospital workers fired\n\n'Safe Patient Project' reveals medical horror stories\n\nHospital safety blog takes medical errors public\n\nHow hospitals' 'culture of secrecy' keeps error victims out of the loop\n\nAfter report on nurse drug abuse, Virginia gov calls for background checks", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York's inattention and slow response to incidents of patient harm make the state a haven for criminal and incompetent nurses, according to a report published by ProPublica.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "New York's inattention and slow response to incidents of patient harm make the state a haven for criminal and incompetent nurses, according to a report published by ProPublica.", "title": "New York laws enable criminal, incompetent nurses", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/new-york-laws-enable-criminal-incompetent-nurses/2016-04-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Andrew Cuomo,criminal investigations,HR & Workforce Management,New York,nurse licensure,nurse misconduct,ProPublica", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "article_summary": "New York's inattention and slow response to incidents of patient harm make the state a haven for criminal and incompetent nurses, according to a report published by ProPublica.\nThe office, a division of the Department of Education, only reluctantly wades into criminal justice matters.\nThe Office of Professions, which oversees nurse licensing in the state, does not require applicant nurses to undergo background checks or submit fingerprints, allowing those with criminal records to fly under the radar, ProPublica reported.\nDespite a nationwide movement to improve nurse oversight and crack down on licensee misconduct, these reforms have largely passed New York by, according to the report.\nWhen the board does act, the publication reported, it is often years after patients have been neglected, sexually assaulted and even killed."}
