(AP) - The Jets not only won the New York-area preseason bragging rights, they showed they\u2019re a lot closer to being ready for the regular season than the Giants.\n\nQuarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick threw two touchdown passes and Antonio Cromartie scored on a 59-yard interception return in the waning seconds of the first half in the Jets\u2019 28-18 win Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe have a ways to go, and we know we have our work cut out for us, but the guys are starting to gel and we did some good things,\u201d Jets coach Todd Bowles said.\n\nAfter struggling in place of the injured Geno Smith in the first two preseason games, Fitzpatrick hit 9 of 14 passes for 127 yards. He threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker and added a 24-yarder on a screen pass to Zac Stacy as the Jets (2-1) showed balance on offense.\n\n\u201cEverybody was moving in the same direction, and everybody was moving in the right direction,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nRashad Jennings scored on a 1-yard run for the Giants (1-2), whose first-team offense has produced 10 points in 12 preseason possessions. Eli Manning (12 of 16 for 90 yards) was having a good half until Cromartie stepped in front of James Jones and scored with 6 seconds left in the half.\n\n\u201cHe read it,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing a long time. I think there was a little hesitation by Eli. He went to him at the last minute and Cro broke. He studies a lot of film.\u201d\n\nBoth teams rested most of their starters after the first half.\n\nPunt returner Walter Powell supplied the biggest highlight of the second half, returning a punt by Robert Malone 54 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter.\n\nJosh Brown kicked a 48-yard field goal for the Giants on the opening possession of the second half. Ryan Nassib threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Cunningham and a 2-point pass to Julian Talley with 7:31 to play.\n\nThe teams will play again in a regular-season game on Dec. 6.\n\nThe Jets did more on both sides of the ball than the Giants. They established a running game, picking up 67 yards on 14 carries in the first half.\n\nThe Giants were limited to 37 yards on 14 carries and their only drive of significance was a 14-play, 85 yard drive that was kept alive by two Jets penalties.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be perfect, but we\u2019ve got to eliminate the self-inflicted wounds,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cWhen we do that, we\u2019ll have the consistency down that we\u2019re gonna need during the season.\u201d\n\nThe Giants\u2019 defense once again had trouble on crossing patterns and it had a major blown coverage on the screen pass to Stacy. He caught it and there was nothing in front of him but turf.\n\nINJURIES: Jets first-round draft pick Leonard Williams - the No. 6 pick overall - sustained a knee injury in the first half and did not return. Bowles did not know the severity of the injury. An MRI is planned Sunday.\n\nWilliams has been starting in place of Sheldon Richardson, who is suspended for the first four games of the regular season after violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nGiants defensive end Robert Ayers was a late scratch after injuring his ankle and Achilles tendon in warmups. Rookie guard-tackle Bobby Hart sustained a knee injury. Safety Josh Gordy left with a hip injury.\n\nReceiver Victor Cruz, who is coming off knee surgery, still has yet to play in the preseason. He was out with a calf problem Saturday.\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS: Malone, who is pushing veteran Steve Weatherford for the starting job, had a 67-yarder on his first kick.\n\nDecker returned punts for the Jets because Jeremy Kerley was out. He misjudged the ball on Malone\u2019s 67-yarder and fumbled another deep in Jets\u2019 territory.\n\nBesides Powell\u2019s punt return, Chris Owusu had two kickoff returns for 76 yards.\n\nBECKHAM CATCHES ONE: After failing to catch a pass in the first two games, Odell Beckham Jr. caught five passes for 31 yards. He also had a circus catch over star cornerback Darrelle Revis but the catch was out of bounds.\n\nEXTRA POINTS: Giants defensive tackle Markus Kuhn seemed to get a piece of Nick Folk\u2019s extra point after Stacy\u2019s touchdown. The Jets made up for it after Cromartie\u2019s TD when Stacy ran for a 2-point conversion.\n\nCUTTING DOWN ON PENALTIES: After picking up 17 penalties in last week\u2019s win over the Falcons, the Jets had eight for 50 yards. Bowles made the Jets run gasers this week if they had more than five penalties in any practice.\n\nThe Giants had seven for 51.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Jets not only won the New York-area preseason bragging rights, they showed they're a lot closer to being ready for the regular season than the Giants.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Jets not only won the New York-area preseason bragging rights, they showed they\u2019re a lot closer to being ready for the regular season than the Giants.", "title": "Fitzpatrick throws 2 TD passes, Cromartie scores on INT", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/fitzpatrick-throws-2-td-passes-cromartie-scores-on/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/a489eb3ff23e8826800f6a706700b331.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/a489eb3ff23e8826800f6a706700b331.jpg", "description": "The Jets not only won the New York-area preseason bragging rights, they showed they're a lot closer to being ready for the regular season than the Giants.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fitzpatrick throws 2 TD passes, Cromartie scores on INT"}, "Author": "TOM CANAVAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Ryan Nassib threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jerome Cunningham and a 2-point pass to Julian Talley with 7:31 to play.\nQuarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick threw two touchdown passes and Antonio Cromartie scored on a 59-yard interception return in the waning seconds of the first half in the Jets\u2019 28-18 win Saturday night.\nAfter struggling in place of the injured Geno Smith in the first two preseason games, Fitzpatrick hit 9 of 14 passes for 127 yards.\nHe threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Eric Decker and added a 24-yarder on a screen pass to Zac Stacy as the Jets (2-1) showed balance on offense.\n\u201cEverybody was moving in the same direction, and everybody was moving in the right direction,\u201d Fitzpatrick said."}
