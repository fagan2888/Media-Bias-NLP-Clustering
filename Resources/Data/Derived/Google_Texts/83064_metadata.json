(AP) \u2014 Tiffany Mitchell sank her fourth and final 3-pointer, looked to the South Carolina bench and then shimmied.\n\nCoach Dawn Staley may have wanted to do the same. After all, it surely was a moment worth celebrating.\n\nMitchell scored 20 points, leading five Gamecocks in double figures, and third-ranked South Carolina handled No. 13 Kentucky 93-63 in the semifinals of the Southeastern Conference women\u2019s tournament Saturday.\n\nA day after the Gamecocks turned in their worst offensive performance of the season, Staley\u2019s team delivered one of its best.\n\nThis one helped the top-seeded Gamecocks (30-1) advance to their second straight SEC title game. They will face either No. 16 Mississippi State or Tennessee in the championship game Sunday.\n\nIf South Carolina plays like it did against the Wildcats (23-7), it could be hoisting another trophy.\n\n\u201cI want to bottle it up and take it into (Sunday) night\u2019s championship game,\u201d Staley said.\n\nThe Gamecocks opened up a double-digit lead in the first quarter, used an 11-0 run early in the third to make it a 20-point game and then turned it into a laugher with a barrage of 3-pointers in the fourth.\n\nBianca Cuevas hit consecutive treys, Mitchell sank her fourth of the game and then Tina Roy added another in a two-minute span that put South Carolina up 77-50 with 6:40 remaining and started the celebration.\n\n\u201cI mean, it just felt good,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt felt right at the moment. I was feeling good. Our team was up. We were all just hyped. The whole entire game was very emotional. It\u2019s not really uncharacteristic of me. I just don\u2019t do it a lot. But this game we were just feeling great, so I just let it go.\u201d\n\nMitchell made 8 of 16 shots, including 4 of 8 from behind the arc, and finished with her sixth 20-plus-point performance of the season.\n\nSEC player of the year A\u2019ja Wilson (18 points), Cuevas (15), Alaina Coates (13) and Khadijah Sessions (10) also reached double figures for South Carolina. Coates added 10 rebounds for her 17th double-double of the season and third in the last four games.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No. 3 South Carolina women handle No. 13 Kentucky, 93-63", "title": "No. 3 South Carolina women handle No. 13 Kentucky, 93-63", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "No. 3 South Carolina women handle No. 13 Kentucky, 93-63", "title": "No. 3 South Carolina women handle No. 13 Kentucky, 93-63", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/06/no_3_south_carolina_women_handle_no_13_kentucky_93_63/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/sec-kentucky-south-carolina-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No. 3 South Carolina women handle No. 13 Kentucky, 93-63", "title": "No. 3 South Carolina women handle No. 13 Kentucky, 93-63", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/sec-kentucky-south-carolina-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Long", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SEC player of the year A\u2019ja Wilson (18 points), Cuevas (15), Alaina Coates (13) and Khadijah Sessions (10) also reached double figures for South Carolina.\nIf South Carolina plays like it did against the Wildcats (23-7), it could be hoisting another trophy.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsJACKSONVILLE, Fla.
