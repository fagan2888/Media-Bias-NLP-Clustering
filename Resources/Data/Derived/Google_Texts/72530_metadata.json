Bush is known to be a supporter of Common Core. Yet there he was insisting that the federal government shouldn\u2019t be involved in creating educational standards.\n\nBush said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content; that is clearly a state responsibility.\u201d He added that he\u2019s for higher standards, but not for federally created ones.\n\nGiven Bush\u2019s past support for Common Core, Marco Rubio wasn\u2019t buying Bush\u2019s disavowal of support for federal standards. He responded:\n\nHere\u2019s the problem with Common Core: the Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion, they will turn it into a mandate. . .They will use Common Core or any other requirements that exist nationally to force it down the throats of our people and our states.\n\nBush countered: \u201cIf states want to opt out of Common Core, fine; just make sure your standards are high.\u201d\n\nInformed voters weren\u2019t the only ones confused by this exchange; some experts in education policy seemed confused, as well. Rick Hess, an education scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Examiner:\n\nThere\u2019s no real disagreement when Bush and Rubio agree that they\u2019re for high standards for children, Bush says the federal government shouldn\u2019t be involved, and Rubio says curriculum reform is needed at the state and local level.\n\nBut a careful reading of the exchange reveals disagreement. Bush said, in effect, that he\u2019ll rely on states to push back against the feds and that they better be sure their standards are good enough. Rubio doesn\u2019t want the feds to be \u201csuggesting\u201d or evaluating standards in the first place.\n\nFurthermore, as Stanley Kurtz shows, the disagreement between Bush and Rubio goes even deeper than this. Sure, Bush says that states can opt out of Common Core. But he has been at the vanguard of a movement to make it very difficult for the states to do so. Kurtz writes:\n\nBush and his Common Core-supporting allies have been pretending to favor local control for years. Yet Jeb has repeatedly backed the most controversial Obama administration moves to consolidate what amounts to a national curriculum.\n\nWhat are these \u201ccontroversial moves\u201d?\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s solution has been to offer \u201cRace to the Top\u201d funding to states, or waivers of onerous federal education requirements, on condition that states adopt Common Core. . .The Obama administration has also directly funded two Common Core-aligned national testing consortia and charged them with developing curricular and instructional materials. This means that the federal government has set up and funded third parties to accomplish what it is legally prohibited from doing. . . . Federal carrots and sticks, along with massive infusions of Gates Foundation money, at a moment when state budgets were stressed to the breaking point by the financial crisis, stampeded more than forty states into adopting a completely untested reform, often sight unseen or before the standards themselves had been finalized.\n\nWhere did Jeb Bush stand on this? According to Kurtz:\n\nI am sorry to say that Jeb Bush has been a leading supporter and cheerleader of this process from the start, often portraying what was in fact an illegitimate federal power-grab as a sterling example of local control. In a co-authored 2011 opinion piece making \u201cThe Case for Common Educational Standards,\u201d Bush and New York educator Joel Klein deny federal overreach and present the states as voluntarily enrolling in Common Core. They speak of two testing consortia \u201cof the states,\u201d without noting federal financing of these national consortia. Bush and Klein portray a program explicitly designed to create uniform national standards as embodying \u201cthe beauty of our federal system.\n\nThat\u2019s not all.\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported on Jeb\u2019s appearance with Obama in March of 2011 to push the president\u2019s education agenda. Bush\u2019s alliance with the Obama administration on education policy was in fact broad and deep. They differed on school choice, yet were aligned on much else, Common Core above all. Consider the following 2010 video of an appearance by Obama education Secretary Arne Duncan at Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education. Duncan goes on about how many states have adopted Common Core (between 7:10 and 9:50), while repeatedly denying federal responsibility for the change. The Secretary doth protest too much, methinks. After Duncan\u2019s talk, he and Jeb jointly take questions from the audience. Here it becomes obvious that on education policy, Jeb sees himself as allied with Duncan and Obama\u2014in opposition to local-control-loving conservatives (as well as liberal teachers unions). Jeb\u2019s political solution to attacks on the Common Core is to \u201cpush the two groups who are not reform-minded further away from what I think is the mainstream.\u201d (See video between 27:30 and 29:30.)\n\nNo wonder Obama operative Dan Pfeiffer tweeted after Thursday\u2019s debate: \u201cWhen I worked in the White House, we were always grateful to @JebBush for his efforts to help us urge states to adopt Common Core.\u201d\n\nI agree with Kurtz\u2019s conclusion: \u201cJeb Bush is a candidate of real ability, and a strong conservative in many respects. But obfuscation on Common Core will not suffice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Many informed voters who watched Thursday\u2019s GOP presidential debate may have come away confused about Jeb Bush\u2019s stance on education.
