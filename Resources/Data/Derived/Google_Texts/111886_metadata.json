Its admirable goal is to spur tourism and economic growth. However, if and when participating countries fail to share pertinent security information, its benefits become severely outweighed by threat.\n\nToday, there are 38 countries participating in our Visa Waiver Program, including many countries whose citizens have been, and are being, recruited by ISIS. For example, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind of the horrific attacks in Paris, was a citizen of Belgium \u2013 a participant of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program.\n\nAlthough we know the Department of Homeland Security continuously vets all visa applicants against our terrorism databases, we also know that we do not routinely get the critical information we need to identify and stop foreign fighters bound for the U.S., which is why I introduced the Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act.\n\nMy bill empowers DHS by giving it the authority to suspend a country\u2019s participation in the program if it fails to provide us with the pertinent information needed to stop terrorists from entering the U.S. Additionally, my bill strengthens our counterterrorism efforts by codifying the Department\u2019s newly adopted practice of collecting additional biographical data before an applicant can travel into the U.S. visa-free.\n\nLast week, the House took an important step to stop terrorists trying to exploit the U.S. refugee resettlement program by passing the American SAFE Act. However, there are other known vulnerabilities, including within our Visa Waiver Program, and today\u2019s global reach of terrorism demands that we do more to protect our citizens.\n\nOver the past two weeks, since the Paris attacks, we\u2019ve seen a flurry of legislative proposals to keep foreign fighters off U.S. soil, including a Senate proposal to limit visa-free travel for individuals who have traveled to Syria and/or Iraq in the past five years.\n\nI welcome that proposal and any other proposal that may improve our Visa Waiver Program. However, my bill, which is supported by U.S. Travel and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, has already \u2013 unanimously \u2013 passed the Homeland Security Committee and should now go before the full House, consistent with regular order.\n\nWe cannot afford to wait.\n\nMiller has represented Michigan\u2019s 10th Congressional District since 2003.
