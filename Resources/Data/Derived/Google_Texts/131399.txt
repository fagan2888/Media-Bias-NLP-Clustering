In addition more than 300 people have been injured.

Of these, 15 died at the airport of whom six were Belgian and nine were foreign nationals.

The 13 victims of the metro blast included 10 Belgians and three foreign nationals.

The foreigners killed in the attacks were British, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Swedish and U.S. nationals.
