It means equal pay for equal work. It means overtime pay for workers who have earned it. It means continuing to extend the right of quality, affordable health care for every American in every state, because we\u2019ve got some states that aren\u2019t doing the right thing. We have states who just out of political spite are leaving millions of people uninsured that could be getting health insurance right now. No good reason for it. If you ask them what\u2019s the explanation they can\u2019t really tell you.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe principle of one person, one vote is the single greatest tool we have to redress an unjust status quo. You would think there would not be an argument about this anymore. But the stark, simple truth is this: The right to vote is threatened today in a way that it has not been since the Voting Rights Act became law nearly five decades ago.\n\nAcross the country, Republicans have led efforts to pass laws making it harder, not easier, for people to vote. In some places, women could be turned away from the polls just because they\u2019re registered under their maiden name but their driver\u2019s license has their married name. Senior citizens who have been voting for decades may suddenly be told they can no longer vote until they can come up with the right ID.\n\n\u2026\n\nAnd as President, I\u2019m not going to let attacks on these rights go unchallenged. We\u2019re not going to let voter suppression go unchallenged. So earlier this week, you heard from the Attorney General \u2014 and there\u2019s a reason the agency he runs is called the Department of Justice. They\u2019ve taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009, and they\u2019ve defended the rights of everybody from African Americans to Spanish speakers to soldiers serving overseas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama gave a rousing and passionate call to action where he told Republicans that he will continue to\u00a0challenge every single attempt to suppress the vote.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama gave a rousing and passionate call to action where he told Republicans that he will continue to\u00a0challenge every single attempt to suppress the vote.", "title": "President Obama Makes Republicans Pay For Trying to Take Away Your Right To Vote", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/04/11/president-obama-republicans-pay-vote.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/obama-national-action.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-11T22:45:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "published_time": "2014-04-11T22:45:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T22:45:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe8e\"", "article_summary": "Video:The president said:Opportunity means making the minimum wage a wage you can live on.\nPresident Obama gave a rousing and passionate call to action where he told Republicans that he will continue to challenge every single attempt to suppress the vote.\nThey\u2019ve taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009, and they\u2019ve defended the rights of everybody from African Americans to Spanish speakers to soldiers serving overseas.\nAcross the country, Republicans have led efforts to pass laws making it harder, not easier, for people to vote.\nBut the stark, simple truth is this: The right to vote is threatened today in a way that it has not been since the Voting Rights Act became law nearly five decades ago."}
