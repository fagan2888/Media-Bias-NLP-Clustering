The new health center will deliver an expanded level of services that include immunizations, behavioral health, nutrition, counseling, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology and WIC.\n\nThe primary service area for the center is residents in the cities of Wayne, Westland, Romulus and Inkster where Evans noted there is only one primary care doctor for every 4,100 residents. But the services are available to anyone and not limited by residency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rated as worst for healthcare in the state. I don\u2019t care how you crunch the data, we\u2019re still at the bottom,\u201d Evans said. \u201cHow do we address it when communities don\u2019t have the money they should. We need to pool our resources and talents. We\u2019re looking for a new model.\u201d\n\nThe expanded center is the result of a partnership, Evans said, not just with the communities of Wayne County but also with Beaumont Health, the University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry and the county Department of Health, Veterans and Community Wellness.\n\n\u201cOur residents will greatly benefit from these new partnerships,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more convenient for residents to receive the health services they need and deserve. For example, when you visit this center, physicians and health care professionals from the Family Medicine program of Beaumont Hospital-Wayne are working side by side with Wayne County\u2019s public health nurses.\u201d\n\nUnder what is termed \u201cNo Wrong Door,\u201d the goal is to provide the needed health care in one location and also seek out people who may not be aware that they qualify for programs, according to Dr. Mouhanad Hammami, director of the Department Health, Veterans and Community Wellness.\n\n\u201cThere are significant uninsured and under-insured people. The Affordable Care Act has gone a long way to addressing that but there are still underserved people,\u201d Hammami said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that they qualify for ACA.\u201d\n\nIf the center needs to refer someone to another facility, Hammami said that care will be provided on the same income-based sliding scale as the center uses. \u201cIf they are low income, they will pay a nominal fee and that is often waived,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with public service announcements, fliers and other informational venues, Hammami said that health center staff will also work to glean what health care needs people have when they come in for an immunization, for example.\n\n\u201cOur front desk personnel will do screening. Someone might be applying for a (health department) permit. The staff will ask if there is a child in the family or a veteran,\u201d Hammami said. \u201cWe will rely on word-of-mouth. When they come in for WIC, we\u2019ll ask if they have a primary care physician.\u201d\n\nThe remodeled dental area isn\u2019t expected to be completed for another 3-4 weeks and will feature five dental chairs donated by UDM Dental School, whose students will provide care.\n\n\u201cWe understand that dentistry is an important part of health. You will not be healthy without a health mouth,\u201d said Dr. Mert Aksu, dean of the UDM School of Dentistry. \u201cYou have a better outcome with a clean mouth.\u201d\n\nA number of public officials attended the ribbon-cutting including Wayne County Commissioner Al Haidous, D-Wayne, who was recognized by Hammami for his support of the project.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud to see this event in Wayne, the heart of Wayne County. It will provide many important services,\u201d Haidous said. \u201cFor many years, Wayne County was business as usual. Change is difficult. You need strong leadership. Change had to be implemented as quick as possible.\u201d\n\nHaidous credited Evans with working to make changes to benefit residents, like the health center, without worrying about the political impact.\n\nLeAnne Rogers is a reporter for Hometown Life.
