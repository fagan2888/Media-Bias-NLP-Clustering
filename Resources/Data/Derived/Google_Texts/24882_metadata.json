Throughout the course of the school year, Jasmine and her classmates will try out gardening, boat-building and maybe even a little puppeteering.\n\nJasmine, a third-grader on the A honor roll, loves it all. But her favorite part happens during the homework session, where she sometimes finishes early. \u201cMy favorite thing to do is help people when they need help,\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cI am good at my times tables, adding and subtraction.\u201d\n\nJasmine has been participating in Kaleidoscope, a fee-based after-school program offered by the Charleston County School District that serves about 4,000 students in 45 elementary schools, offering a meal, some structure and a safe environment while parents are at work. This school year, in a partnership with the nonprofit organization Charleston Promise Neighborhood, the district is conducting an extended-learning pilot program at five high-poverty elementary schools: Sanders-Clyde, Mary Ford, Chicora, Memminger and Angel Oak.\n\nThe biggest change in the five schools\u2019 Kaleidoscope programs this year is the presence of several community organizations offering extracurricular activities \u2014 in most cases free of charge to the students\u2019 families. Four of the schools offer the program for free; Angel Oak follows the example of the other Kaleidoscope programs in the district by applying a sliding-scale fee based on family income.\n\nPart of the theory behind the pilot program is that kids need more than just reading, writing and arithmetic to succeed \u2014 and that children at Title I schools, which serve large populations of low-income families, are missing out on some of those additional things.\n\nExpandED Schools, an organization advocating for expanded school days, estimates that by the time children from middle-class families reach the sixth grade they will have spent 6,000 more hours on learning activities than their peers who were born into poverty. That figure takes into account several studies showing income-based gaps in preschool, reading with parents, and extracurricular activities like sports and visits to museums.\n\nDanielle Daniels, site coordinator for Kaleidoscope at Sanders-Clyde, a school on the upper east side of the Charleston peninsula, said the program has already made a difference in the lives of the 200 students in the pilot program. \u201cThey\u2019re participating in enrichment activities that they would never get to do otherwise,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nShe also said that offering the program for free \u2014 an arrangement made possible by $1 million in funding largely provided by Charleston Promise Neighborhood \u2014 was essential at her school, where all of the students receive free subsidized lunch due to their families\u2019 level of income. \u201cMy students would not be able to attend Kaleidoscope if they had to pay a fee,\u201d Daniels said.\n\n\u2018He can\u2019t fly yet\u2019\n\nIn a Kaleidoscope enrichment class at Sanders-Clyde taught by artists and volunteers from Redux Contemporary Art Center, second-grader Kaidin Doctor showed off a few of the sketches from his sketchbook. There\u2019s a woman with a purple face and a side-swept ponytail, and then there\u2019s a tall, gangly owl named Hoot with red, orange and yellow plumage.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t fly yet,\u201d Kaidin explained. \u201cHe\u2019s too young.\u201d\n\nChambers Austelle, a visual artist who helps lead the class, said she has spent part of her time with the students focusing on self-esteem \u2014 something they seemed to lack when she started in August.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in, I realized it was very easy for them to feel defeated and be like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to do that,\u2019 \u201d Austelle said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been coming up with more guided projects ... We\u2019re setting up projects where they\u2019re able to be successful.\u201d At the end of the semester, the students will present their own original, fully formed characters in the form of handmade puppets. Hoot might be flying by then.\n\nJason Sakran, school district\u2019s director of expanded learning and community education, said that while the pilot program still has an academic focus, with qualified teachers being recruited to stay after school and help out, it also has a goal that goes beyond most academic standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on unraveling years and years of generational poverty, years and years of things that the district has not done well,\u201d Sakran said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it in a year. It takes time, so I want to set the expectation that we\u2019re not going to turn it around overnight. We\u2019re in for the long haul.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about giving the kid at Sanders-Clyde chess once a week. It\u2019s about helping him to think about himself differently,\u201d he added.\n\nBut will it work?\n\nWilma Lee, a resident of Bridgeview Village whose sons Stevon and Emone attend Kaleidoscope at Chicora Elementary, said the program has worked wonders for the children there.\n\n\u201cThey learn a lot of good manners,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey learn to follow directions and take instruction.\u201d\n\nKatie McCabe, education initiatives program manager for Charleston Promise Neighborhood, said the pilot program focuses heavily on improving what educators call social and emotional learning. To test the pilot\u2019s effectiveness, staff members rated students at the beginning of the school year using the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA), a 72-item scale that attempts to measure factors like awareness and management of feelings. At the end of the pilot\u2019s first year, they\u2019ll rate the students again and see if they have improved.\n\nFor all its psychological and at times intangible goals, the Kaleidoscope pilot also has some programs in place to help with traditional learning. At Sanders-Clyde, Kaleidoscope students who have fallen behind grade level in their reading skills have the chance to participate in Reading Partners, an intensive one-on-one intervention.\n\nEricka Parker, a third-grade teacher at Sanders-Clyde, said that 11 of her students were reading on a first-grade level at the start of the school year. Eight of them enrolled in Kaleidoscope, and now she said they are reading at a mid-second-grade level or higher. She said she was thrilled when one of the students asked her during the school day if he could finish reading a book during Kaleidoscoipe.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re reading in class, and every day we\u2019re reading in after-school,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendous, just to see them feel more confident.\u201d\n\nParker volunteered to help run the homework-help sessions at Kaleidoscope in part because she knew her students needed extra help. She said she gets paid a little extra for the work, but the hours are long, often stretching from 6:30 a.m. to 6:15 p.m.\n\nIs it worth the effort? \u201cThey\u2019re a lot more confident,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cThey participate a lot more in class.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long day, so if you\u2019re going to be here, you\u2019ve got to do it because you want to help them and you love it.\u201d\n\nReach Paul Bowers at (843) 937-5546 or twitter.com/paul_bowers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charleston County School District tests an intensive new extracurricular program at high-poverty schools, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, After-school programs,Charleston County School District,Kaleidoscope,Sanders-Clyde Elementary School,Title I schools", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When school lets out at 2:30 at Sanders- Clyde Elementary, Jasmine Jones sticks around for an after-school program with a twist.", "title": "Charleston County School District tests an intensive new extracurricular program at high-poverty schools", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151115/151119606/charleston-county-school-district-tests-an-intensive-new-extracurricular-program-at-high-poverty-schools", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151115/pc16/151119606/AR/0/AR-151119606.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151115/pc16/151119606/AR/0/AR-151119606.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When school lets out at 2:30 at Sanders- Clyde Elementary, Jasmine Jones sticks around for an after-school program with a twist.", "title": "Charleston County School District tests an intensive new extracurricular program at high-poverty schools", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151115/pc16/151119606/AR/0/AR-151119606.jpg?201511152219", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151119606}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Charleston County School District tests an intensive new extracurricular program at high-poverty schools , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, After-school programs,Charleston County School District,Kaleidoscope,Sanders-Clyde Elementary School,Title I schools", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-15T22:19:00Z", "author": "Paul Bowers"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "When school lets out at 2:30 at Sanders- Clyde Elementary, Jasmine Jones sticks around for an after-school program with a twist."}, "article_summary": "This school year, in a partnership with the nonprofit organization Charleston Promise Neighborhood, the district is conducting an extended-learning pilot program at five high-poverty elementary schools: Sanders-Clyde, Mary Ford, Chicora, Memminger and Angel Oak.\nAt Sanders-Clyde, Kaleidoscope students who have fallen behind grade level in their reading skills have the chance to participate in Reading Partners, an intensive one-on-one intervention.\n\u201cThey learn to follow directions and take instruction.\u201dKatie McCabe, education initiatives program manager for Charleston Promise Neighborhood, said the pilot program focuses heavily on improving what educators call social and emotional learning.\nFor all its psychological and at times intangible goals, the Kaleidoscope pilot also has some programs in place to help with traditional learning.\nWhen school lets out at 2:30 at Sanders- Clyde Elementary, Jasmine Jones sticks around for an after-school program with a twist."}
