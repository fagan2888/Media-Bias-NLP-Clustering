Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nThe mainstream media just opened the door for conservatives to demand President Barack Obama release his Columbia University records immediately. How nice of them! Thank you!\n\nThe media decided to investigate Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s claims about getting a scholarship offer from West Point. They say Dr. Carson made a \u201cfalse claim.\u201d\n\nDid he?\n\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s muddled and debatable, although clear that one of the world\u2019s most prominent brain surgeons certainly doesn\u2019t need to exaggerate any claims about his education. Dr. Carson claimed he was \u201coffered\u201d a scholarship by a well-known Army general if he applied to West Point. He wanted to be a doctor and chose not to. Was it an actual scholarship offer, or just a casual conversation? Politicians exaggerate or remember things to their benefit all the time. But his claim, however interpreted, didn\u2019t cost taxpayers a dime.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said of Obama\u2019s whoppers. Obama\u2019s lies about Obamacare alone have cost American taxpayers millions, even billions in higher premiums and medical costs. Like millions of others, I lost my insurance based on Obama\u2019s lies, and now I\u2019m paying far more and getting far less. Obama promised the world and delivered disaster.\n\nNow THAT\u2019S a significant lie.\n\nJonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, even admitted fraud was committed to fool the \u201cdumb voters.\u201d\n\nBut, let\u2019s compare apples to apples. The media is going after Dr. Carson for supposedly making false claims about his college record. So isn\u2019t this the perfect time to demand fair, unbiased and equal treatment of Obama\u2019s college record? As any good trial lawyer would say, \u201cThe media opened the door to this one.\u201d If you can investigate Dr. Carson, then you must investigate Obama\u2019s claims about college as well.\n\nApples to apples. The media is trying to disqualify Dr. Carson\u2019s right to the presidency based on his college records. Why did they never check Obama\u2019s college records? Why are Obama\u2019s Columbia records STILL sealed seven years into his presidency?\n\nThe media anxiously called West Point demanding to verify Dr. Carson\u2019s claims, but never called Columbia to verify Obama\u2019s claims. Why? If claims about college from 30 or 40 years ago are important for Dr. Carson, why not Obama?\n\nDid Obama make false claims about his college experience? No one can prove it (yet) because his college records are sealed. Why? What is he hiding? If it matters for Carson, it should even more for a man already sitting in the White House with his fingers on the economy and the nuclear button.\n\nIt\u2019s time to DEMAND that Obama release his Columbia college records.\n\nFair is fair. If what a young man claims happened at college many years ago is important for Carson, then it\u2019s important for Obama too.\n\nI graduated Columbia University in June of 1983. According to Obama not only were we in the same graduating class, we had the same majors, Political Science and Pre-Law. That would mean we took the same classes. I thought I knew every classmate in Columbia\u2019s Political Science department.\n\nYet neither I nor anyone I knew ever met, saw, or heard of Obama.\n\nThis was reinforced two years ago in 2013 when I attended my Columbia University 30th class reunion.\n\nI asked everyone \u2013 \u201cDid you ever see Obama at Columbia?\u201d Not one classmate answered affirmatively.\n\nI simply couldn\u2019t believe no one claimed to have met a classmate, who supposedly was in our class, and who was later to become president of the United States. So, I tracked down Professor Henry Graff, perhaps the most honored professor in Columbia history and Columbia\u2019s Presidential historian. I interviewed Graff that same year for TheBlaze.\n\nProfessor Graff never met Obama; heard of him; or saw him.\n\nProfessor Graff said it was virtually impossible to graduate Columbia as a Political Science major without attending his history classes. Yet Graff never heard of him. He even studied his old records to verify Obama\u2019s existence at Columbia \u2026 and found nothing.\n\nGraff asked other Columbia professors. None remembered Obama ever being in their classes. All of this is on the record from my interview, published in 2013 here at TheBlaze.\n\nObama is \u201cthe ghost of Columbia.\u201d With his records sealed we can only conclude his existence at Columbia is just a rumor.\n\nIsn\u2019t this an important issue for the media? Something is wrong, yet no one in the mainstream media cares about the possibility Obama might have made false claims about his college records?\n\nYet in Dr. Carson\u2019s case, they were champing at the bit to investigate a casual boast of a one-time meeting with a general.\n\nNow, assuming Obama did graduate from Columbia, but never went to class (a very strange story)\u2026\n\nHow did a poor student from Occidental, an average non-Ivy League college, transfer into Columbia in the first place? Columbia only accepts a handful of transfers and those are always \u201cthe best of the best\u201d scholars from the top of their classes at Harvard, Yale or Princeton. Clearly Obama didn\u2019t meet that standard.\n\nWhy are Obama\u2019s college records sealed? Did they show bad behavior? Was he caught using drugs? Were his grades terrible?\n\nOne possibility is that Obama beat the long odds of being accepted for transfer into Columbia by claiming status as an Indonesian \u201cforeign student.\u201d People familiar with the admissions process tell me that was a likely way to jump ahead of other applicants. But, of course, if true it would be out and out fraud.\n\nCould that be why Obama sealed his college records? He released his birth certificate, yet never released his college records. Why?\n\nPerhaps critics have been looking in the wrong place. Is it possible Obama\u2019s college records are the weakness in his narrative? We\u2019ll never know, unless the media demands access to his Columbia college files. Ghost or no ghost, he is clearly hiding something.\n\nIf the media thinks Dr. Carson\u2019s claims about his college experience 40 years ago are relevant, then clearly Obama\u2019s college claims are relevant too. It\u2019s time for all of us to demand Obama release his Columbia college records. It\u2019s time for the media to scrutinize Obama the same way they are scrutinizing Ben Carson, Donald Trump, and every other GOP Presidential candidate.\n\nDr. Carson\u2019s claims haven\u2019t cost taxpayers a dime. But Obama\u2019s presidency has cost all of us dearly. If it was all built on a lie, on fraud, we have a right to know.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
