The touch \u2014 or heavy hand \u2014 of a changing economy is inescapable. We all struggle to keep up with how we both describe the change and adapt to new models that work for everyone. But, as we approach Labor Day \u2014 a celebration of the American worker \u2014 we find that trendy words oversimplify a historic societal shift that warrants more thought from all of us.\n\n\u201cDisrupting\u201d old business models has a rebellious feeling to it. The \u201cgig\u201d economy \u2014 picking up a side job to earn extra cash \u2014 now feels fashionable. And nothing sounds more enlightened than a \u201csharing\u201d economy. Yet, a closer look reveals something deeper.\n\nIn the spring of this year, the California Applicants\u2019 Attorneys Association conducted a statewide poll on a variety of issues. One of them considered the growing use of \u201cindependent\u201d contractors as replacements for employees. There it is again \u2014 \u201cindependent\u201d \u2014 a California-cool word that fails to convey its precarious nature. As you might expect, when California voters were asked how they felt about the trend, 49 percent approved of it and 37 percent disapproved.\n\nBut when the next poll question exposed voters to the fact that using independent contractors helped businesses avoid any responsibility for health benefits and fair wages, voters reversed course with 70 percent opposing the trend. In fact, the voters most likely to be early adopters of the \u201cgig\u201d economy \u2014 millennials \u2014 are the strongest opponents of the trend with 83 percent in opposition.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s all the rage to debate whether Uber is cool, it is troubling that the company now finances the cars their \u201cindependent\u201d drivers use. This looks a lot more like sharecropping in the South\u2019s 19th century Reconstruction Era than a \u201cshared\u201d economy model for a 21st century California.\n\nUber and others aren\u2019t causing the shift. They are simply adding to it in a way that feels cool and convenient. But, instead of people standing around a Home Depot parking lot looking for a \u201cgig\u201d \u2014 that side job that has now become the only job or one of several jobs \u2014 it\u2019s a growing number of men and women sitting around in Uber-financed black cars waiting for their smartphone to vibrate.\n\nThe sheer volume of people who can no longer find a steady, good-paying job is turning us back to a time when longshoremen had to show up every morning to ask \u2014 yes, ask \u2014 for a day\u2019s work. The system was called the \u201cshape up,\u201d and it led to some of our nation\u2019s most militant labor movement activism with 95 percent of longshoremen joining their union. The change resulted in a protracted strike and then \u201cBloody Thursday.\u201d\n\nI am not suggesting that history will repeat itself. I am suggesting that we should learn from history and reshape public policy instead of just modernizing the \u201cshape up.\u201d Public policies need to address a growing gap. On one side, we have an \u201cemployee\u201d workforce covered by Obamacare, protected by workers\u2019 compensation, and able to make use of unemployment insurance to feed a family during the inevitable bad times. On the other side, we have day laborers with an app. And nothing else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t go back in time. That\u2019s not an answer. But, as we enjoy the day off to celebrate the contributions of hardworking Americans, we must recognize the changing nature of work, analyze the uneven nature of its impacts and adjust our social policies to reflect a marriage between our technological abilities and our societal values.\n\nRusty Hicks is executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our society is being rewired in ways we never imagined.
