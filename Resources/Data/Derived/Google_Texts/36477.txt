GODFREY — Godfrey Street Department workers have a new three-year contract after more than five months of negotiations with the village.

The village board of trustees unanimously approved the contract at Tuesday night’s board meeting. Both the city and members of the Teamsters Local 525 made concessions, said Trustee Michael Stumpf, who served on the negotiating committee with Trustee Sarah Johnes.

“It’s a very good contract for the village and for the employees,” Stumpf said. “These guys do a fantastic job. They have never faltered.”

Points of contention between the two parties were health insurance costs and wage increases. Historically, union members have not paid out-of-pocket for health insurance. Under the new contract, workers will contribute no out-of-pocket insurance costs the first year, $2.50 per week the second year and $5 per week the third year.

Workers asked for a 4-percent increase in wages per year, but settled for 2 percent.

Negotiations were drawn-out and required federal mediation services because of either side’s unwillingness to concede, said Stumpf.

“They had asked for a 4 percent raise (per year) with nothing out of pocket. In today’s world, in 2015, that’s just not feasible.”

Teamsters President and Business Representative Kyle Bollinger was unavailable for comment by deadline Wednesday.

This is the first three-year contract the union has secured in several years. A series of one-year contracts preceded the newest one while the village observed how the Affordable Care Act would affect health insurance costs.

Teamsters Local 525 represents workers in Calhoun, Greene, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison and Montgomery counties.
