The stunt was a clever and effective way for Obama to promote his healthcare plan in 2014\u2014Funny or Die partnered with the White House to produce several videos promoting and explaining the Affordable Care Act at the time\u2014and for Obama to get in a few zingers. Obama comes off as cool and smart and in control, a good look for a 21st century president.\n\nThat may be what Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O\u2019Malley is going for in this Texas Travesty \u201cOff the Record\u201d interview with University of Texas students Xavier Rotnofsky and Rohit Mandalapu. The Travesty is a humor publication, and the interview is humorous:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to say, you\u2019re even more handsome in person,\u201d says Rotnofsky, after kissing O\u2019Malley. \u201cI\u2019d like you to be attracted to my campaign for my ideas and my progressive accomplishments,\u201d O\u2019Malley responds. \u201cBut also for those eyes,\u201d says Mandalapu, \u201cand those looks,\u201d adds Rotnofsky.\n\nO\u2019Malley answered the students\u2019 questions, like \u201cWho would you most want operating on your brain, Dr. Oz, Dr. Seus, or Ben Carson?\u201d and \u201cWhat scandals can we expect to hear about it?\u201d without skipping a beat. He also rapped these lyrics:\n\nThe NRA hates me cuz I don\u2019t like guns/ Guns guns guns guns/ I don\u2019t like them guns/ But if you look at the polls/ You might get the impression/The United States president/won\u2019t be my next profession/But just FYI, bro/you\u2019re so dang wrong/soon my polls will be higher/than Cheech and Chong.\n\nRotnofsky and Mandalapu aren\u2019t quite as famous as Galifianakis, but they have gotten some media attention. The pair were elected to UT\u2019s student government this year after running a joke campaign. The pair, both editors of the Travesty, were carrying out a tradition started years earlier. This is the first time the Travesty candidates were elected.\n\nO\u2019Malley, for what it\u2019s worth, seems to be pleased with the results:\n\nLoved sitting down with @TexasTravesty \u2013 though I still prefer \"eagle\" to #IrishStallion https://t.co/9yb25XPJsC \u2014 Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) December 2, 2015\n\nA member of O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign team told the Washington Post that O\u2019Malley \u201chas a blast meeting with college students.\u201d\n\nPlus Rotnofksy and Mandalapu have been taking their positions seriously\u2014the pair pushed for the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue on UT\u2019s campus. And as there are apparently no rules at all during this election cycle, we can\u2019t blame O\u2019Malley for trying something new.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "What is happening.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "What is happening.", "title": "Watch this very weird interview with Martin O'Malley", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/240770/martin-omalley-texas-travesty-interview/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-02-at-1-22-11-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What is happening.", "title": "Please enjoy this very weird interview with Martin O'Malley", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/240770/martin-omalley-texas-travesty-interview/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-02-at-1-22-11-pm.png?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "martin o'malley, martin o'malley texas travesty, texas travesty martin o'malley, martin o'malley interview, martin o'malley ut interview, martin o'malley ut, ut martin o'malley, martin o'malley texas, texas martin o'malley, martin o'malley campaign"}, "article_summary": "He also rapped these lyrics:The NRA hates me cuz I don\u2019t like guns/ Guns guns guns guns/ I don\u2019t like them guns/ But if you look at the polls/ You might get the impression/The United States president/won\u2019t be my next profession/But just FYI, bro/you\u2019re so dang wrong/soon my polls will be higher/than Cheech and Chong.\nThat may be what Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O\u2019Malley is going for in this Texas Travesty \u201cOff the Record\u201d interview with University of Texas students Xavier Rotnofsky and Rohit Mandalapu.\nThe Travesty is a humor publication, and the interview is humorous:\u201cI\u2019ve got to say, you\u2019re even more handsome in person,\u201d says Rotnofsky, after kissing O\u2019Malley.\nYou might recall a very good interview with President Barack Obama, conducted by comedian Zach Galifianakis.\nAnd as there are apparently no rules at all during this election cycle, we can\u2019t blame O\u2019Malley for trying something new."}
