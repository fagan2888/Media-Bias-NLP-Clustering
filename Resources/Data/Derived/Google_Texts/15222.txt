Texans are better informed than ever when it comes to Obamacare, but many are still unable to afford coverage.

Uninsured Texans say cost is the main reason they do not have insurance, according to a new report released today by Rice University’s Baker Institute and the Episcopal Health Foundation in Houston.

As part of an ongoing research project tracking the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Texas, researchers found that 69.1 percent of uninsured Texans find health insurance too expensive.

Lead researcher Elena Marks said that the survey of 1,500 adults includes Texans who are eligible to buy health plans in the ACA’s health insurance exchange as well as those living below 100 percent of the poverty line who would otherwise have qualified for Medicaid if Texas leaders hadn’t rejected an expansion of the program.
