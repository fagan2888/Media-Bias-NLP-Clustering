Blame this uncertainty on Peyton Manning. Someday, they might name the MVP award after Manning in the way the league honored Vince Lombardi with the Super Bowl hardware.\n\nManning has been MVP five times, while no other player has won it more than three times.\n\nHe probably won\u2019t win a sixth after this season. The problem with Manning\u2019s case this season is that he\u2019s merely topping the charts a year after his statistics went off the charts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still extremely valuable to his team, but everybody compares him to 55 touchdowns,\u201d said Tony Dungy, an analyst on NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and an MVP voter.\n\nManning is tied for the league lead this year in wins (11), is second in touchdown passes (37) and fourth in yards (4,143). Yet, after obliterating all the significant single-season records a year ago, Manning isn\u2019t getting much buzz for an unprecedented sixth MVP award.\n\n\u201cListen to what we\u2019re saying: The guy is probably going to finish with 40 touchdowns and 4,700 yards, and we\u2019re going to say, \u2018Ah, well. He had an OK year,\u2019 \u201d said Shannon Sharpe, a Pro Football Hall of Fame player who has one of the 50 MVP votes and his own podcast at www.shannonsharpe.com.\n\n\u201cHe set the bar so high. It\u2019s like when Michael Jordan scored 35 or 40 points. Think about in the history of the game, how many guys have thrown for 40 touchdowns and 4,700 yards?\u201d\n\nOnly five, including Manning in 2013. So if Manning is down the list among MVP candidates in 2014, who is at the top of the list?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get down on Aaron Rodgers because of the Buffalo game are we?\u201d Sharpe said.\n\nJim Miller has, somewhat. Among MVP voters, Miller is considered the lowest common denominator around these parts. Manning got 49-of-50 MVP votes last season. Miller voted for New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cI soured on Rodgers last week,\u201d said Miller, a host on NFL Sirius Radio and former Chicago Bears quarterback. \u201cHe was my leader in the clubhouse. I need to see him rebound. I want to see how Dallas finishes with DeMarco Murray. And Tom Brady is on my list again. Those are my top three guys. And J.J. Watt would be the dark horse.\u201d\n\nBrady is Sharpe\u2019s second choice. But he scoffs at the notion Rodgers\u2019 zero-TD, two-interception performance in a 21-13 loss at Buffalo last week should cost him a second MVP trophy.\n\n\u201cWhat about all those drops?\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cJordy Nelson had a 94-yard touchdown that Aaron Rodgers walked out there and placed in his hands. So is everybody going with Andrew Luck, who\u2019s second in the league in turning the ball over?\n\n\u201cNow everybody has fallen back in love with Tom Brady. OK, Buffalo was Aaron Rodgers\u2019 worst game. Did Tom Brady look any better against Kansas City? And those weren\u2019t drops.\u201d\n\nSharpe doesn\u2019t think Murray should be MVP because he\u2019s not carrying the Dallas Cowboys with Dez Bryant and Tony Romo the way Adrian Peterson did with the Minnesota Vikings in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen 1,800-yard seasons,\u201d Sharpe said.\n\nNothing speaks to the unpredictability of this year\u2019s MVP race more than Dungy\u2019s choices.\n\n\u201cThe guy I\u2019m really looking at \u2014 and he won\u2019t win it \u2014 but if you look at what\u2019s happened, it\u2019s Bobby Wagner,\u201d Dungy said about the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 middle linebacker. \u201cThey looked like an average team. He comes back and all the sudden they go on this binge, and they look like a Super Bowl team again. And he\u2019s been the biggest difference.\n\n\u201cIt will probably go to one of those quarterbacks. But if you\u2019re voting on who made the biggest difference in their team, he and (Rob) Gronkowski made the biggest difference. Gronkowski was out and it looked like the Patriots were just an average team, and when he got back healthy and they took him off the pitch count, they\u2019ve taken off.\u201d\n\nWith Manning seemingly not a top contender for once, the MVP race is uncharacteristically wide open. Which might not be such a bad thing for the Broncos. Manning\u2019s teams never won the Super Bowl in his five MVP seasons. He did not win the MVP in 2006, the year he was Super Bowl MVP.\n\n\u201cI got in an argument with a guy on Twitter last week,\u201d said Dungy, who was Manning\u2019s Indianapolis coach in 2006. \u201cThe guy was saying the Broncos can\u2019t win like this. Something\u2019s wrong with him. I said wait a minute, he threw 20 passes (in a 22-10 victory at San Diego) and averaged 11.6 yards per pass, which is going to be the league leader if you do that all year.\n\n\u201cHe played great Sunday. They won by two touchdowns on the road \u2014 what do you want? We want five touchdowns and 400 yards.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis\n\nMVP candidates\n\n1. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Packers The case for: Despite a bad game at Buffalo last weekend, he\u2019s still the NFL\u2019s top-rated passer with a 111.2 rating, 35 touchdown passes, five interceptions. The case against: After his two-interception, zero-TD game against the Bills, Rodgers won\u2019t win if he doesn\u2019t play well in final two games.\n\n2. DeMarco Murray, RB, Cowboys The case for: 1,678 yards rushing; leads the league by more than 400 yards. His 11 rushing touchdowns also lead the league. Broken hand could help win the award if he plays well in Dallas\u2019 final two regular-season games. The case against: Probably won\u2019t get the 2,000 yards needed to upend a QB.\n\n3. Andrew Luck, QB, Colts The case for: No other player does more to carry a team. Leads the NFL with 4,492 yards passing and 38 TD passes. The case against: Only Jay Cutler and Blake Bortles have thrown more picks than Luck\u2019s 14. Tied with Cutler for most fumbles lost (six).\n\n4. J.J. Watt, DL, Texans The case for: Leads defensive players with five touchdowns (including three receiving). Also has 16\u00bd sacks and 10 pass deflections. The case against: His team won\u2019t make the playoffs.\n\n5. Tom Brady, QB, Patriots The case for: Has a win over Peyton Manning and the Broncos. His 28 touchdown passes (six interceptions) in a 9-1 stretch could make New England the AFC\u2019s top playoff seed. The case against: Struggled until tight end Rob Gronkowski returned; only the sixth-rated passer.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Making a case for MVP: Packers\u2019 Aaron Rodgers tops list of possible candidates", "title": "Making a case for MVP: Packers\u2019 Aaron Rodgers tops list of possible candidates", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/18/making-a-case-for-mvp-packers-aaron-rodgers-tops-list-of-possible-candidates/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141218__20141219_B1_SP19FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141218__20141219_B1_SP19FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-18T22:07:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T12:00:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00f0\"", "article_summary": "The case against: After his two-interception, zero-TD game against the Bills, Rodgers won\u2019t win if he doesn\u2019t play well in final two games.\nSo if Manning is down the list among MVP candidates in 2014, who is at the top of the list?\nHe probably won\u2019t win a sixth after this season.\n\u201cThe guy I\u2019m really looking at \u2014 and he won\u2019t win it \u2014 but if you look at what\u2019s happened, it\u2019s Bobby Wagner,\u201d Dungy said about the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 middle linebacker.\nThe case against: His team won\u2019t make the playoffs."}
