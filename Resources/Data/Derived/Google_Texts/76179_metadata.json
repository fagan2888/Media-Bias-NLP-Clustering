We naturally hold the phone vertically (ya know, when we use our phone as an actual phone), but it's important you know how to record video properly... HORIZONTALLY.\n\nEvery relatively-new TV or monitor is in 16:9, or widescreen. When you play vertical video, it leaves a lot of empty space on the sides; making everything smaller and more difficult to see.\n\n\n\nWe love it when you send us your video and pictures to our see it snap it send it page, but we want to be able to show it across the whole screen when we share it on TV. When we get vertical video, our editors have to put those weird blurry panels on the side of the video so it's not black empty space. Nobody likes that, right?\n\nSo remember, when you're taking family videos and pictures during the holidays, tilt your phone horizontally. You'll be happy when you want to go back and watch home videos 20 years from now, and the video is larger and clearer!\n\nShare this PSA with your friends to help get the point across [disclaimer: has some bad language]\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015.
