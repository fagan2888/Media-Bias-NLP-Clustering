Discovered on July 8, it had probably been under way since the Fourth of July weekend, authorities estimated.\n\nRELATED: A Million Gallons of Salty Wastewater Leaks Near Fort Berthold Water Supply\n\nThe size of the July spill rivaled that of a 2006 pipeline rupture that \u201cbelched more than a million gallons of saltwater into a northwestern North Dakota creek, aquifer and pond,\u201d the Associated Press reported. \u201cThe cleanup efforts are ongoing at that site, which has been called the worst environmental disaster in state history.\u201d\n\nThe spill region was tested by contractors hired by pipeline owner Crestwood Midstream Services Inc., whose subsidiary Aero Pipeline LLC operated the pipeline. At an environmental forum on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, home to the Three Affiliated Tribes, tribal environmental director Edmund Baker, also running for election as head of the tribal council, said he had not been shown any study results.\n\nThree Affiliated Tribes natural resources administrator Claryca Mandan told the Associated Press that Baker would have had to request that paperwork and that it could not be made public without clearance from the tribe\u2019s legal department.\n\n\u201cBoth Crestwood and the tribe have refused requests from The Associated Press for those tests and soil tests,\u201d the newswire said. \u201cThe tribe has also refused Associated Press requests for spill reports, even though they are identified as public documents in the tribes\u2019 environmental code.\u201d\n\nBaker spoke at an environmental forum held last week on the reservation, AP said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the absolute dark as to what the severity was when it happened, both soil and water,\u201d Baker said, according to AP. \u201cThey say that it didn\u2019t reach the lake. They say, no, it\u2019s not in the groundwater.
