Also-ran (and frequent election flier) Carlo \u201cMazunga\u201d Poliak got 523 votes (or 2 percent).\n\nInnis and his supporters concluded there must be something wrong with the election, and they demanded an \u201caudit\u201d of the results.\n\nBecause it must be a problem with the election, right? It could not possibly be that Innis lost this election fair and square.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t possibly be that people didn\u2019t like Innis (or Hardy, for that matter)? It couldn\u2019t possibly be that voters took a look at their platforms and found them wanting? Confirmed Monroe voter Tom Grover told the Review-Journal\u2019s Laura Myers that he cast his vote to object to the socially conservative platforms advocated by Innis and Hardy. Grover can\u2019t be alone, can he?\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be voters didn\u2019t warm to Hardy and Innis beating each other up over bankruptcies, unpaid bills and the Affordable Care Act, could it?\n\nIt couldn\u2019t possibly be that voters saw Innis and Hardy falling all over themselves to defend ranting racist rancher Cliven Bundy and were repelled, could it?\n\nWhat about Innis himself? Might not some voters have been driven to other candidates, including Monroe, by the hypocrisy of him asking for their votes when Innis himself has barely bothered to cast a ballot in recent years? Might voters have been nervous about turning over the federal purse to a tax dodger who\u2019s still settling his debts with the IRS?\n\nWhat about Cathie Lynn Gisi, a Hardy supporter who taught at a school affiliated with Innis\u2019 full-time employer, the Congress of Racial Equity? After asking a tough question of Innis at a debate, she was told her services were no longer needed. Couldn\u2019t that have turned off some voters?\n\nWhat about the simple reality that Monroe had the most normal-sounding name on the ballot? If you didn\u2019t know Cresent, Niger and \u201cMazunga,\u201d Mike sounds like a safe choice. And let\u2019s not forget he\u2019s more familiar to Nevada voters, having run for Congress in 2006 and 2010. (That first run came before Innis even moved to Nevada, in 2007.)\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be that it was a bad primary election for conservatives such as Innis, right? In almost every contested race, the more conservative, state Republican Party-endorsed candidate lost to the less conservative, establishment-backed candidate. (The lone exception: Assemblyman Jim Wheeler, R-Minden, who was famously caught on tape saying he\u2019d reluctantly vote to bring back slavery if his constituents wanted it.)\n\nNo, it must be cheating. It must be a plot, involving untold individuals tinkering with the results in multiple Nevada counties (Monroe beat Innis in Esmeralda and White Pine counties, and came close in Lyon). It must have been shadowy forces conspiring to deny Innis a victory.\n\nAnd for what? A primary win in a district that has 33,212 more Democrats than Republicans, and that will almost certainly be won by Democratic incumbent Rep. Steven Horsford. Who would risk committing a Class B felony and two to 20 years in state prison for that?\n\nNone of these facts has stopped Innis, his campaign team and right-wingers all over the Internet from openly speculating \u2014 sans evidence, of course \u2014 about a rigged election, meeting any skepticism with smug assurances that something just doesn\u2019t seem right here.\n\nBut insinuations and suspicions are not evidence. Innis has until Monday to call for (and put up the money to pay for) a recount. We\u2019ll see if he does so.\n\nIn the meantime, he may want to consider the idea that there are perfectly legitimate reasons why he fell short in his race, reasons that have nothing to do with election integrity and everything to do with him.\n\nSteve Sebelius is a Las Vegas Review-Journal political columnist who blogs at SlashPolitics.com.
