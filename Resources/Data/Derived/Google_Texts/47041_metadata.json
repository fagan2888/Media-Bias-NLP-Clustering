It\u2019s also been two months since Salido had medication for his bipolar disorder.\n\nIn Alameda County officials estimate 18,000 offenders in its two jails will now qualify for Medi-Cal.\n\nA drug, Risperdal, prescribed by a jailhouse psychiatrist, had quelled Salido\u2019s angry moods. \u201cIt helped me be more relaxed,\u201d he said. \u201cNot as much on the edge and feeling like everybody is out to get me.\u201d\n\nNow Salido, who served two years for burglary, assault and gang involvement, has no health insurance and until recently had few options for refilling his medication.\n\nMany inmates leave county jails and state prisons with mental health problems and chronic physical ailments \u2014 and no health coverage. Because they typically are not custodial parents, ex-offenders have long been ineligible for a public health insurance program aimed at kids, mothers and the disabled.\n\nBut earlier this year, California and 25 other states, under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, opened up Medicaid to single and so-called \u201cchildless\u201d adults. The change in eligibility criteria will extend Medicaid coverage to vast numbers of ex-offenders with very low incomes.\n\n\u201cHistorically, 10 or 11 percent of folks in detention have been eligible for Medicaid,\u201d said Alex Briscoe, health director for Alameda County. \u201cThat number is well over 90 percent as of January,\u201d since the ACA took full effect.\n\nIndeed, of those newly eligible under the Medicaid expansion, experts predict one out of three nationally will be former inmates or detainees. Health officials in Alameda County estimate 18,000 offenders in its two jails will now qualify. Recently, Rodrigo Salido began the process of enrolling in Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid, at a clinic, Healthy Oakland. He got a preliminary check up there, but once he gets his card will be able to visit a primary care doctor and see specialists.\n\nMen and women involved in the criminal justice system are more likely to be sicker than the general population, with higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, depression, mood disorders and alcohol and drug addiction. Many have spent years \u2014 perhaps their entire adult livens \u2014 without health insurance and have medical conditions that must be stabilized when they\u2019re incarcerated.\n\n\u201cThey come to us in bad shape, and we get them as good as possible,\u201d said Richard Lucia, the undersheriff for Alameda County.\n\nAt Santa Rita jail in Dublin, one of the largest detention facilities in the United States, the pharmacy dispenses some 350,000 prescription drugs each month and spends $28 million each year on medical and mental health services. But because recidivism rates are so high in Alameda County \u2014 two out of three inmates re-offend \u2014 the jails\u2019 medical clinics often end up re-stabilizing the same inmates.\n\n\u201cThey leave and they get in bad shape again,\u201d said Lucia. \u201cAnd they come back to us, and we fix them up again.\u201d\n\nThe churning of sick offenders costs the county when inmates are in custody \u2014 but it also strains public hospital budgets when they\u2019re released. \u201cWhen they do need care they come to our emergency department. They cost us between $600 and $800 a visit,\u201d said Briscoe, the county health director. \u201cThe cost drivers on our system are intense.\u201d\n\nThe Medicaid expansion, county officials contend, offers a rare opportunity to connect men and women with criminal records to ongoing medical and mental health services, and to directly reimburse the county\u2019s general fund for medical care outside of correctional facilities.\n\nWhile it remains against federal law to use Medicaid to pay for day-to-day medical care for inmates, the program, funded by federal and state dollars, will cover hospital stays longer than 24 hours. Those longer hospital visits often involve costly and complicated surgeries, and the county estimates it could save $3 to $5 million a year in off-site hospital care.\n\n\u201cThat would shift the cost, essentially, from the county to the state or to the federal government,\u201d said Undersheriff Lucia.\n\nOver the last few months, a constellation of Alameda County agencies, including the sheriff\u2019s office, public health and social services, have been feverishly working to create new protocols that will automatically enroll all eligible inmates into Medi-Cal. Other enrollment efforts are underway in Contra Costa, San Francisco, Solano and Lassen counties, and in Cook County, Illinois, the state of Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe bureaucratic and technical challenges are immense: archaic information technology platforms must be re-tooled to share data with other county systems; arrested individuals often give false information about their marriage status, number of children, home address and income, foiling Medi-Cal eligibility background checks; and labor union rules permit only certain county workers to approve Medicaid applications.\n\nOvercoming those obstacles is a priority, Alameda county officials said, not only because of the potential cost savings, but also because the Medi-Cal expansion offers a solid chance at reducing the county\u2019s dismal recidivism rate. Several studies have shown that ex-inmates who have access to health care when they leave jail, especially mental health and substance abuse counseling, are less likely to re-offend.\n\nStill, a Medi-Cal card is no panacea for troubled lives. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat away the problems that face poor communities,\u201d said Briscoe, the county health director. \u201cIt\u2019s about a good job. It\u2019s about a sense of belonging. It\u2019s about a place to sleep, but healthcare can be a tool for social justice if it\u2019s delivered effectively and creatively, and that\u2019s why the Medicaid expansion is such a great opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news organization covering health care policy and politics.
