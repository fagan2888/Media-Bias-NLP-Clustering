Ward is drawing near.\n\nDenver\u2019s hard-hitting safety practiced for the second straight day Thursday and appears on track to play Monday night for the first time since suffering a high-ankle sprain Nov. 29 against New England.\n\nHis return would provide a big lift for a Broncos\u2019 secondary that just gave up season highs in points and passing yards to the Steelers.\n\nDespite missing three games, Ward is still third on the team with 57 tackles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made progress. I think he\u2019s had two good days. He did a lot more today than yesterday,\u201d Kubiak said of Ward.\n\nThe depth at safety has been tested recently with injuries to Ward, Darian Stewart, Omar Bolden and David Bruton. Bruton was placed on injured reserve Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s half of our secondary,\u201d defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said about how the safety injuries affect the defense.\n\nStewart and Bolden both missed practice for the second straight day. They are each battling hamstring injuries, which are notoriously tricky and can often linger.\n\nKubiak said he expects Stewart to be a full participant in practice Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s feeling pretty good. We\u2019re just being smart here,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cWe have an extra day so we\u2019re going to try to use it.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t as optimistic with Bolden. Kubiak said he\u2019s been unable to get a grip on when Bolden will be able to return.\n\nStewart missed Sunday\u2019s game against Pittsburgh, while Bolden has missed the Broncos\u2019 last two contests.\n\nGuard Evan Mathis is back taking his full load at practice after being limited by an ankle injury over the last few weeks. Kubiak expects Max Garcia, Louis Vasquez and Mathis to play a lot of snaps going forward.\n\nLinebacker Todd Davis missed his second straight practice with an ankle injury.\n\nCameron Wolfe: cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning preps for Saturday workout; T.J.
