As publisher, my paramount duty is to ensure the continued quality and success of The New York Times. Jill is an outstanding journalist and editor, but with great regret, I concluded that her management of the newsroom was simply not working out. During her tenure, I heard repeatedly from her newsroom colleagues, women and men, about a series of issues, including arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication and the public mistreatment of colleagues. I discussed these issues with Jill herself several times and warned her that, unless they were addressed, she risked losing the trust of both masthead and newsroom. She acknowledged that there were issues and agreed to try to overcome them. We all wanted her to succeed. It became clear, however, that the gap was too big to bridge and ultimately I concluded that she had lost the support of her masthead colleagues and could not win it back.\n\nBut, as the New Yorker\u2019s Ken Auletta explained earlier this week, \u201cabrasiveness has never been a firing offense at the Times,\u201d and therefore \u201cthere is a reason that gender has been widely discussed in relation to Abramson\u2019s firing and how she was judged, even if it was not the decisive factor.\u201d\n\nThe discussion of sexism continued on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where New York Times Washington Bureau Chief and Political Editor Carolyn Ryan, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina and NBC News correspondent Maria Shriver joined host David Gregory for a panel discussion.\n\nRyan acknowledged that sexism is a cultural issue, but said that the Times is not a part of that narrative. The New York Times is \u201cbeing caricatured as a bastion of sexism,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t true, and hasn\u2019t been my experience there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former HP CEO explains why Abramson's ouster was sexist on \"Meet the Press\" VIDEO", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Jill Abramson has been \u201cexcised from history\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former HP CEO explains why Abramson's ouster was sexist on \"Meet the Press\" VIDEO", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Jill Abramson has been \u201cexcised from history\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/18/carly_fiorina_jill_abramson_has_been_excised_from_history/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/new-york-times-executive-editor.jpeg-e1400431144690-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former HP CEO explains why Abramson's ouster was sexist on \"Meet the Press\" VIDEO", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Jill Abramson has been \u201cexcised from history\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/new-york-times-executive-editor.jpeg-e1400431144690-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Carly Fiorina, carolyn ryan, Jill Abramson, Maria Shriver, meet the press, New York Times, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As publisher, my paramount duty is to ensure the continued quality and success of The New York Times.\nThe New York Times is \u201cbeing caricatured as a bastion of sexism,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t true, and hasn\u2019t been my experience there.\u201d\nHe wrote:I decided that Jill could no longer remain as executive editor for reasons having nothing to do with pay or gender.\nRyan acknowledged that sexism is a cultural issue, but said that the Times is not a part of that narrative.\nJill is an outstanding journalist and editor, but with great regret, I concluded that her management of the newsroom was simply not working out."}
