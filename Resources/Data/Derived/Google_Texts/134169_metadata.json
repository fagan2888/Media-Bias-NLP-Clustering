Attracting new businesses would make up for that shortfall, Bigelow said. She said normally the city takes in about $1.1 million in business personal property tax revenue every year.\n\nBusinesses are taxed on personal property that includes any items that are removable or moveable like equipment, light fixtures and furniture. Bigelow said about 91 percent of businesses in Centennial will not have to pay the business personal property tax next year as a result of the change.\n\n\u201cCompared to our surrounding communities, it\u2019s quite a substantial increase,\u201d Bigelow said, adding most of the surrounding communities only have exemptions of $10,000 to $20,000. \u201cSo $100,000 was pretty significant. We hoped it would attract new businesses into our city limits.\u201d\n\nRobert Golden, president and CEO of the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce headquartered in Centennial, said Centennial\u2019s move is a positive one and will make the chamber\u2019s job of recruiting new businesses to Centennial easier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty aggressive move, but it\u2019s a positive one and we say hats off to them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing it have the positive impact that they say it will.\u201d\n\nHe also said he expects it to cause surrounding communities to take notice and re-think their own tax exemptions.\n\nCentennial Mayor Cathy Noon said the city council hopes businesses will think about reinvesting in or expanding their businesses with the money they save.\n\nShe said business personal property tax is a big complaint in the state.\n\n\u201cWhat we heard from businesses is that it\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s the reporting they have to do,\u201d Noon said. \u201cAll we can do is give the exemption for our portion of the tax so we were actually being more pro-active than reactive to make the statement that we want to be business-friendly.\u201d\n\nClayton Woullard: 303-954-2953, cwoullard@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yhclayton", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Centennial makes business personal property tax exemption $100,000", "title": "Centennial makes business personal property tax exemption $100,000", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/11/centennial-makes-business-personal-property-tax-exemption-100000/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T12:49:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-11T12:49:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She said normally the city takes in about $1.1 million in business personal property tax revenue every year.\nShe said business personal property tax is a big complaint in the state.\nCentennial City Council has increased the tax exemption for business personal property to $100,000, an attempt to make life easier for existing businesses and attract new ones.\nBigelow said about 91 percent of businesses in Centennial will not have to pay the business personal property tax next year as a result of the change.\nBusinesses are taxed on personal property that includes any items that are removable or moveable like equipment, light fixtures and furniture."}
