O\u2019Rourke to write a book, titled The Baby Boom: How It Got That Way (And It Wasn\u2019t My Fault) (And I\u2019ll Never Do It Again),summarizing his early life and the impact the Baby Boomer had on American history? O\u2019Rourke\u2019s generation, by all accounts runs the world \u2014 what does he have to show for it?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the timing,\u201d O\u2019Rourke began, referring to why he wrote his book when he did. \u201cThe youngest baby boomer is turning 50 this year as we speak. Michelle Obama just had her 50th birthday this year \u2014 she is at the very at the tag end of it. It\u2019s a good time for a sum up. I wasn\u2019t going to do a proper memoir, or an autobiography. It\u2019s been beaten to death. Besides, neither of my parents tried to kill me with an axe. So I just didn\u2019t have the hook.\u201d\n\nAnytime something big happens anywhere, O\u2019Rourke writes in his book, someone over 50 writes the check \u2014 which can lay much of the blame of the financial crisis and other economic disasters at their feet.\n\n\u201cRightly, quite rightly,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe are the generation who invented playing with money, you know. People use to save it or lose it, but mostly they spend it, not often, but if you could. We were the first t0 come up with playing with money. In fact, a lot of what has gone on in the world has to do with the baby boomers infinite, youthful sense of play. We are forever the puppies of the universe, and sometimes thats good. You know, we don\u2019t fight for real, like grown-up dogs do, very much. We include all of the other puppies in our play.\n\n\u201cBut on the other hand, when we are given serious duties of responsibility \u2014 you want to pick and choose among us very carefully, before you give us any serious duties of responsibility,\u201d he continued. \u201cFunnily enough, we turned out to be excellent in the military, after a rather rocky start in the war of Vietnam. [A]s adults, senior officers in things like the Gulf War, and Iraq War and Afghan War \u2014 whatever one may think of the war \u2014 the conduct of the us military officer class\u2026 [W]e may have had our slip-ups in our personal lives, in typical baby boomer fashion, but I mean, on the battlefield, there have been no Lieutenant Calleys from the baby boom. Who would have thought that? But when it comes up to group responsibility of money\u2026Hah! [I]t\u2019s live for today.\u201d\n\nCatch the rest of TheDC\u2019s featured segments from the exclusive interview with O\u2019Rourke this week, and be sure to review previous parts of the interview.\n\nPJ O\u2019Rourke: Republicans LOST their chance to repeal Obamacare\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie McHugh", "description": "Anytime something big happens anywhere, O'Rourke writes in his book, someone over 50 writes the check -- which can lay much of the blame of the financial crisis", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "What prompted the legendary libertarian satirist P.J.
