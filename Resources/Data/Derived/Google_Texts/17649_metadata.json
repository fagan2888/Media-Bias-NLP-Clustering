Just days after notorious former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke called on his radio audience to support Donald Trump out of duty to the white \u201crace,\u201d the billionaire got a shout-out from somebody on the other end of the spectrum: Nation of Islam leader and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.\n\nFarrakhan said during his annual Saviour\u2019s Day sermon on Feb. 28: \u201cHave you noticed that there\u2019s civil war brewing in the Republican Party? They don\u2019t want Trump at all. \u2026 Let me just say why I think they\u2019re all on Mr. Trump. They have decided he must never become president. Why? What has he done? Well, one of the things that he\u2019s done is told them I\u2019m a billionaire. And he\u2019s only man probably in the last 100 years that stood in front of some of the members of the Jewish community and told them to their face, \u2018I don\u2019t want your money.\u2019 Any time a man can say to those who con\u00adtrol the pol\u00adi\u00adtics of Amer\u00adica, \u2018I don\u2019t want your money,\u2019 that means if I don\u2019t take your money, you can\u2019t con\u00adtrol me. And they can\u00adnot afford to give up con\u00adtrol of the pres\u00adi\u00addents of the United States.\u201d\n\nRelated: If Trump Prevails, Conservatives Could Rip the GOP Apart\n\nFarrakhan, however, stopped short of an explicit endorsement of the billionaire, saying, \u201cNot that I\u2019m for Mr. Trump, but I like what I\u2019m look\u00ading at.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has had some awkward moments with members of the Jewish faith, suggesting that he shares Duke\u2019s and Farrakhan\u2019s hatred for Jews seems a bit of a stretch. For example, his daughter Ivanka married an Orthodox Jew, converted to the faith herself and is raising Trump\u2019s grandchildren as Jewish.\n\nTrump also regularly praises his Jewish son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for his intelligence and business acumen.\n\nStill, the former reality television star ignited a firestorm on Sunday when he declined to disavow Duke and the KKK, whose anti-Semitism rival\u2019s Farrakhan\u2019s, in a CNN interview.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Just days after notorious former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke called on his radio audience to support Donald Trump out of duty to the white \u201crace\u201d the billionaire got a shout-out from somebody on the other end of the spectrum: Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.", "title": "Does Trump Have a Fan in \u2026 Louis Farrakhan?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/01/Does-Trump-Have-Fan-Louis-Farrakhan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03012016_Farrakhan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/01/Does-Trump-Have-Fan-Louis-Farrakhan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03012016_Farrakhan.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Just days after notorious former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke called on his radio audience to support Donald Trump out of duty to the white \u201crace\u201d the billionaire got a shout-out from somebody on the other end of the spectrum: Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca535\"", "article_summary": "They say \u201cgame recognize game,\u201d so perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that bigots are coming out of the woodwork to praise Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.\nTrump also regularly praises his Jewish son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for his intelligence and business acumen.\nFarrakhan said during his annual Saviour\u2019s Day sermon on Feb. 28: \u201cHave you noticed that there\u2019s civil war brewing in the Republican Party?\nThey don\u2019t want Trump at all.\nWell, one of the things that he\u2019s done is told them I\u2019m a billionaire."}
