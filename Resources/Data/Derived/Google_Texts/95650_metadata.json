Today, ashes are smudged in the sign of a cross on a person's forehead as a public display of their commitment to their faith.\n\n\"Actually it's a very humbling thing because you're now being pointed out as someone who follows Christ, and sometimes we'd rather not have the limelight on us,\" said Antony. \"It's easier to just stay behind the scenes, but the Lord asks us to be a witness to the whole world, and that's what the point is.\"\n\nAs part of the religious tradition, Catholics will also fast on Ash Wednesday by eating one full meal and two small meals, and they will not eat meat Wednesday or on any Friday during Lent. It is also common practice among Catholics to give up some sort of indulgence during the 40 days.\n\nHelena Drolshagen from Fort Smith said she plans to give up ice cream during the 40 days.\n\n\"Christ gave up a lot for us,\" she said. \"So it's like you get to experience what he did for us and give up something yourself.\"\n\nRather than give something up, some people choose to do something extra during the Lenten season like charity work or random acts of kindness. Landon Turner from Fort Smith committed to reading scripture each day through Easter Sunday.\n\n\"I know it's hard for most people to find time in their day to pray even so to find that little extra time to read the bible is probably a good way to grow closer to Christ,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ash Wednesday (March 5) begins the season of Lent.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Fort Smith/Fayetteville News | 5newsonline KFSM 5NEWS", "description": "Ash Wednesday (March 5) begins the season of Lent.", "title": "Ash Wednesday Begins Season Of Lent", "url": "http://5newsonline.com/2014/03/05/ash-wednesday-begins-season-of-lent/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://localtvkfsm.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/promo218311133.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://localtvkfsm.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/promo218311133.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@5NEWS", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@5NEWS"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Get the local news and weather where you live from 5NEWS.
