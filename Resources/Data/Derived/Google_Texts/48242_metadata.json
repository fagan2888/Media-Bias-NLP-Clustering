There is an increased likelihood of trafficking problems across state lines. Last week, during congressional hearings about DOJ\u2019s decision, U.S. Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, discussed concerns about the transport of marijuana across state lines, to states that have not legalized it. He pointed to audits that found problems in Colorado\u2019s medical-marijuana program even before the state legalized recreational use.\n\nIncreased availability of the drug will mean the number of drugged-driving crashes will increase. In Colorado, fatalities involving drivers testing positive for marijuana increased 114 percent between 2006 and 2011. Also in Colorado, youth admissions to emergency rooms for marijuana-related injuries have increased.\n\nMarijuana is an addictive gateway drug that harms Minnesota\u2019s children and public safety in every community in our state. As sheriff of Hennepin County, I am concerned that legalization of marijuana in other states and reduced federal prosecution will increase the availability of marijuana in Minnesota.\n\nI have seen firsthand in Hennepin County that there is a direct connection between marijuana and violent crime. Drug task forces here have linked marijuana to assaults and homicides. In the Hennepin County Adult Detention Center, marijuana is the most commonly detected drug among the 36,000 inmates who are booked into the facility each year. According to our most recent data, approximately 54 percent of males arrested for violent crime test positive for marijuana in Hennepin County.\n\nThe DOJ announcement sends the wrong message about the dangers of marijuana, especially to youths. Scientists have concluded that it harms adolescent brains and is linked to both lower IQ scores and learning problems. More teenagers are treated for marijuana abuse than for alcohol plus all other drugs combined.\n\nThose in favor of legalizing marijuana argue that it would eliminate the criminal gangs and violence that result from illegal sales. These are false promises. There is no silver bullet that will eliminate the crime associated with marijuana sales. Governments will put restrictions on legal marijuana such as age limits and, potentially, limits on the potency of the drug. The criminal gangs will conduct illegal sales to those who want to avoid the restrictions.\n\nMarijuana is illegal under federal law and should remain that way. We have seen decades of declining crime rates in Hennepin County and across the country. Law enforcement agencies and our community partners have worked hard to achieve these gains. The DOJ decision will make it more difficult for law enforcement nationwide to maintain public safety in our communities.\n\n----------------\n\nRich Stanek is the Hennepin County sheriff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government's decision makes things harder for the rest of us.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The federal government's decision makes things harder for the rest of us.", "title": "Hennepin County sheriff: Lax marijuana enforcement is bad", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/hennepin-county-sheriff-lax-marijuana-enforcement-is-bad/224151231/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1heal1215.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1heal1215.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government's decision makes things harder for the rest of us.", "title": "Hennepin County sheriff: Lax marijuana enforcement is bad", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/hennepin-county-sheriff-lax-marijuana-enforcement-is-bad/224151231/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1heal1215.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1heal1215.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "U.S. Department of Justice"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "marijuana,Colorado,Law Enforcement,U.S. Department of Justice"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd304\"", "article_summary": "As sheriff of Hennepin County, I am concerned that legalization of marijuana in other states and reduced federal prosecution will increase the availability of marijuana in Minnesota.\n----------------Rich Stanek is the Hennepin County sheriff.\nAccording to our most recent data, approximately 54 percent of males arrested for violent crime test positive for marijuana in Hennepin County.\nI have seen firsthand in Hennepin County that there is a direct connection between marijuana and violent crime.\nLaw enforcement agencies and our community partners have worked hard to achieve these gains."}
