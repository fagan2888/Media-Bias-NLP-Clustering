Good news, Americans who enjoy living. You’re likely to live a little longer.

U.S. life expectancy at birth rose in 2012 to 78.8 years from 78.7 years in 2011, according to new data released by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention on Wednesday. Life expectancy is the expected average number of years of life remaining at a given age—in this case, birth.

What’s driving our (slightly) longer lives? Reductions in death from threats such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease and chronic lower respiratory disease, the CDC says.

U.S. life-expectancy trends have been moving upward for centuries, thanks to big drops in infant and child mortality. As Gregg Easterbrook noted recently in the Atlantic, U.S. life-expectancy at birth was just 47 years when the 20th century began, though Americans who managed to live past an early age lived fairly long lives. By 2050, U.S. life expectancy at birth could be 88 years. And by the end of this century, it could possibly be 100, with huge ramifications for the nation’s social trends, economy and politics.

The CDC report also carries some disappointing news. As you can see from the chart above, the persistent gap in life expectancy between women and men—4.8 years—didn’t narrow in 2012. Life expectancy for women is 81.2 years, compared to 76.4 for men.

Worse, the report shows that while we’re making progress reducing deaths from most of our leading causes—cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, stroke, etc.—we’re not doing so well on suicide. Besides “unintentional injuries,” suicide was the only major cause of death whose death rate rose in 2012. There were 12.6 deaths from suicide per 100,000 people that year, up from 12.3 deaths the prior year.
