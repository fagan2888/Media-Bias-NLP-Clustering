But the need among low-income families is growing in many parts of the state, social service agencies say \u2014 in some cases exceeding levels seen during the recession.\n\nMany factors contribute to this apparent discrepancy. Housing and heating costs continue to rise in Massachusetts as hourly wages stagnate, putting more families on the margins, even if they are not considered poor by federal standards, according to public policy researchers. In addition, rising household income is not being distributed evenly, with the largest share going to the highest-income households.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile the economy has improved, it has improved less for the lower-income people we serve,\u201d said Carl Nagy-Koechlin, executive director at South Shore Housing in Kingston, which runs several housing assistance programs. \u201cWhatever improvements there may be with wages and lower unemployment are wiped out or worse by rising housing prices.\u201d\n\nOverall, however, Massachusetts fared better than the country as a whole, according to 2014 American Community Survey data from the Census. The median income rose to $69,160 a year, up 2 percentcq since 2013, while nationwide, the median income ticked up 1 percent.\n\nThe state poverty level was at 11.6 percent, about the same rate it was in 2010, compared to 15.5 percent nationally.\n\nIn Massachusetts, which adopted a universal health care law in 2006, the percentage of residents without health insurance declined slightly, to 3.3percent in 2014 from 3.7percent the year before, the Census reported. Nationally, the uninsured rate fell to 11.7 percent from 14.5 percent as Medicaid expanded and more people had access to insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough the Massachusetts economy has moved in the right direction, with higher employment rates, lower levels of cash assistance, and stable food stamp usage, the state has become less affordable for some people, largely because of rising housing costs, said Mark Melnik, acting director of the Economic & Public Policy Research group at the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal poverty level is the same for every state \u2014 $24,250 for a family of four \u2014 and does not accurately capture the numbers of families living on the edge in a high-cost state like Massachusetts, Melnik said: \u201cYou might not technically be in poverty, but you\u2019re in need.\u201d\n\nAnd the need is growing in many communities, including many outside the Boston metropolitan area, according to social service agencies.\n\nThe Salvation Army, which has 32 centers across the state offering food and heating assistance, served more than 59,000 families last year, a 58 percent jump since 2009.\n\nIn North Adams, the number of meals served at Salvation Army soup kitchens doubled between 2013 and 2014 \u2014 possibly a result of people moving there in search of affordable housing, but struggling to find work, said Salvation Army spokesman Drew Forster.\n\nIn Athol and Pittsfield, the Salvation Army centers have had significant increases in people visiting food pantries and seeking help paying heating bills. In the past, many of the needy were individuals and elderly on government assistance. But in recent years, more and more families are showing up for meals, said Captain Elliott Higgins, who recently became commanding officer in Pittsfield after overseeing the Athol center for the past five years.\n\n\u201cPositions that are available are minimum wage to $12 an hour,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got two parents, three or four children, that just doesn\u2019t cover the expenses.\u201d\n\nHousing assistance is in great demand across the state, according to antipoverty advocates. In Lowell, 12,000 people are on the waiting list for Section 8 housing subsidies, said Peggy Shepard, grant director at Community Teamwork, which also operates two family homeless shelters. The average wait for a voucher: 10 years.\n\n\u2018While the economy has improved, it has improved less for the lower-income people.\u2019 Carl Nagy-Koechlin, executive director at South Shore Housing\n\n\u201cThe need is ever-growing, unfortunately,\u201d Shepard said.\n\nThe numbers of people in need has remained steady on the Cape and Islands, said Frederic Presbrey, president of the Housing Assistance Corporation on Cape Cod, but their situations are more dire: more people struggling with addiction, fewer with the education and skills to succeed in today\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThey come with us with nothing by way of ability to support themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAcross Boston, the story is similar. The number of people served annually by the antipoverty agency Action for Boston Community Development has grown to a projected 108,000 clients this fiscal year from fewer than 95,000 in 2010. John Drew, ABCD\u2019s chief executive, said the gap between haves and have-nots has become more \u201cstartling\u201d over the years, with pockets of intense poverty around the city.\n\nIndeed, the only segment of wage earners in Massachusetts that experienced statistically significant growth in income between 2013 and 2014 were households earning more than $200,000 a year, growing by nearly one percentage point, according to the census data.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t changed really any of our real structures that will help alleviate poverty and child poverty,\u201d Drew said. \u201cWe\u2019re triaging it, we\u2019re doing our best to make people not fall off the map, we\u2019re doing our best to make sure they don\u2019t freeze in the winter and don\u2019t starve.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not solving problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.333176060", "eomportal-id": 955269, "description": "Median household income rose slightly in Massachusetts between 2013 and 2014, according to the Census.
