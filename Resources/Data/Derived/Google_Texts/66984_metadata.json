French firebrands saw laws less as absolute, but instead as useful to the degree that they contributed to supposed social justice and coerced redistribution. They ended up not with a Bill of Rights and separation of powers, but instead with mass executions and Napoleonic tyranny.\n\nUnfortunately, the Obama administration is following more the French model than the American.\n\nSuddenly, once-nonpartisan federal bureaucracies have become catalysts for fundamentally transforming America. Often-ideological bureaucrats have forgotten their original mission. NASA might do better to ensure that our astronauts are independent of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russian rockets rather than claiming that its primary mission is to reach out to the Muslim community.\n\nIntelligence directors vie with one another to please superiors with fatuous but politically correct analysis.
