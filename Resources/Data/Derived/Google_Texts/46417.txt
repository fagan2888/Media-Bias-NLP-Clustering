A new study ranking Florida among the top 10 most corrupt states in the country barely made the radar for most media outlets because the mundane facts and figures weren't sexy.

The study by researchers at the University of Hong Kong and Indiana University is important, though, because it might explain why the Sunshine State, ranked 10th most corrupt, is so cold to Floridians who need government the most.

The researchers studied more than 25,000 convictions of public officials between 1976 and 2008 and patterns ins tate spending to develop a corruption index.

The study, The Impact of Public Officials' Corruption on the Size and Allocation of U.S. State Spending, estimates the 10 most corrupt states cost their residents an average of $1,308 each from 1997 to 2008. That means corruption cost Floridians upwards of $20 billion during that period.

The researchers hypothesized that the most corrupt states "are likely to spend less on items that provide fewer opportunities for corrupt officials to collect bribes, such as education, welfare, health and hospitals."

The research proved that hypothesis correct.

"The harmful impact of corruption on education," says the report, "persists even after expenditures on educatoin is divided into subcategories: elementary and secondary education and higher education."

Gov. Rick Scott is touting the state's new $20.7 billion K-12 budget, the largest in state history, but per-pupil spending is still $177 less than its highest point in 2007-2008.

In fact, the Census Bureau released a report earlier this month ranking Florida among the 10 states that spend the least per student.
