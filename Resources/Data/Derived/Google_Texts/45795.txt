A couple who grew closer after surviving the Boston Marathon bombing last April married at a dazzling dream wedding Friday.

Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino — who suffered heartbreaking injuries — were voted the most “deserving” couple on the wedding-planning website The­Knot.com, which footed the bill for their special day after they got engaged.

Despite the tragedy, they insist they have grown stronger and fallen deeper in love. They tied the knot at the Biltmore in Asheville, NC.
