Book festivals are a gathering of people \u2014 both readers and writers \u2014 who love books. And I love books. I love to run into other authors. I love to have an audience, obviously. I don't live in a \"booky\" sort of world. I live in the countryside outside of Carmel, Calif. \u2014 cowboy country. [A passionate rider, Smiley has four horses and three dogs.] A lot of authors are from my area, but they are all dead \u2014 there's Robert Louis Stevenson [who lived in Monterey in the late 1870s] and John Steinbeck, but there aren't too many authors to hang out with.\n\n\n\nQ: You have set much of your fiction \u2014 such as A Thousand Acres [a retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear that's set on a farm] and your new Last Hundred Years trilogy, Some Luck, Early Warning and Golden Age, out this October \u2014 in Iowa. Tell us about your connection to the Hawkeye State.\n\nA: When I first moved to Iowa in 1972, my husband and I chose to live in an old farmhouse about 30 miles southwest of Iowa City. It was real farm country, and there was the Amish settlement Kalona. I used to look at everything that was going on. If you grow up St. Louis [where Smiley grew up], you think about how important you are \u2014 you don't think about farming. It just stayed with me.
