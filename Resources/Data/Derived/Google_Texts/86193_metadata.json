For providers without deep pockets, the burden of this mandate is tremendous \u2013 a full-time compliance officer typically earns a six-figure salary.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150515/216345\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150515/216346\n\nTo help these smaller providers meet the ACA's strict standards, Star Compliance Services and Texas Dentists for Medicaid Reform are hosting a series of Medicare and Medicaid Compliance Seminars in Texas cities; registered attendees will receive a free, comprehensive Compliance Starter Kit valued at approximately three hours of consultation with a compliance attorney. Upcoming dates include June 12 in Houston, June 26 in San Antonio and July 17 in Dallas. Leading these seminars will be attorney and compliance expert Gregory Ewing, who is also the president of TDMA.\n\n\"If providers do not have their practices or businesses in full compliance, they are at significant risk of being snared in an investigation. We want to make it as easy as possible for providers to come into compliance,\" said Ewing.\n\nThe horror stories emerging in the wake of new, stronger regulations are giving everyone pause. Prosecution of non-compliant providers has risen 78% since the rollout of the ACA, and with the feds collecting $7 in fines for every enforcement dollar spent, going after the little guy appears to be big business.\n\n\"Many providers simply do not have the resources to have a full-time compliance officer or the know-how to implement such a program themselves. Thus the purpose of the kit and seminars. We learned from our first seminar that providers want more than just information. They want instruction and something they can implement right away, and that's what the Compliance Starter Kit offers,\" explained Ewing.\n\nThis summer's Medicare and Medicaid Compliance Seminars follow on the heels of a hugely successful, sold-out gathering in Weslaco in February. With confusion and anxiety within the dental and medical communities at high tide, Ewing and his associates decided to host more seminars to reach more providers throughout Texas.\n\nAbout Star Compliance Services\n\nStar Compliance Services is the host and organizer for Medicaid and Medicare healthcare compliance seminars in Texas, and a repository of knowledge and trends on the evolving issue of regulatory compliance in the wake of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAbout Texas Dentists for Medicaid Reform\n\nTexas Dentists for Medicaid Reform (http://www.tdmr.org/) is organized by dentists who are concerned about the future of dental care for the over three million Texas children eligible for Medicaid. TDMR was founded in 2012 to press for due process rights for Medicaid providers after Medicaid dentists were unfairly accused of Medicaid fraud and massive payment holds were implemented with little recourse.\n\nContact:\n\nGeorge Ewing\n\n956-365-9694\n\nEmail\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-compliance-services-texas-dentists-for-medicaid-reform-responding-to-tough-new-regulatory-environment-with-compliance-starter-kit-and-informative-seminars-for-smaller-healthcare-providers-300084512.html\n\nSOURCE Star Compliance Services", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "texas", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "HARLINGEN, Texas, May 18", "description": "HARLINGEN, Texas, May 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Star Compliance Services, Texas Dentists for Medicaid Reform Responding to Tough New Regulatory Environment...", "author": "Star Compliance Services", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-compliance-services-texas-dentists-for-medicaid-reform-responding-to-tough-new-regulatory-environment-with-compliance-starter-kit-and-informative-seminars-for-smaller-healthcare-providers-300084512.html", "image": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150515/216346", "type": "website", "description": "HARLINGEN, Texas, May 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Nestled within its 900-plus pages of legalese, the Patient...", "title": "Star Compliance Services, Texas Dentists for Medicaid Reform Responding to Tough New Regulatory Environment With Compliance Starter Kit and Informative Seminars for Smaller Healthcare Providers"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "Star Compliance Services, Texas Dentists for Medicaid Reform Responding to Tough New Regulatory Environment With Compliance Starter Kit and Informative Seminars for Smaller Healthcare Providers", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "Star Compliance Services, texas, Small Business Services, Health Care & Hospitals, Dentistry, Health Insurance, Insurance, Human Resource & Workforce Management", "date": "2015-05-18T08:40:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "About Texas Dentists for Medicaid ReformTexas Dentists for Medicaid Reform (http://www.tdmr.org/) is organized by dentists who are concerned about the future of dental care for the over three million Texas children eligible for Medicaid.\nContact:George Ewing956-365-9694EmailTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-compliance-services-texas-dentists-for-medicaid-reform-responding-to-tough-new-regulatory-environment-with-compliance-starter-kit-and-informative-seminars-for-smaller-healthcare-providers-300084512.htmlSOURCE Star Compliance Services\nTDMR was founded in 2012 to press for due process rights for Medicaid providers after Medicaid dentists were unfairly accused of Medicaid fraud and massive payment holds were implemented with little recourse.\nThis summer's Medicare and Medicaid Compliance Seminars follow on the heels of a hugely successful, sold-out gathering in Weslaco in February.\nAbout Star Compliance ServicesStar Compliance Services is the host and organizer for Medicaid and Medicare healthcare compliance seminars in Texas, and a repository of knowledge and trends on the evolving issue of regulatory compliance in the wake of the Affordable Care Act."}
