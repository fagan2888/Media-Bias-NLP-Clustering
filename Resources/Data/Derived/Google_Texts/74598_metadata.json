One night later came the We Want Bernie party, hosted by Progressive Democrats of America in a low-key taqueria.\n\nAnd on the third day, Bernie Sanders himself appeared \u2014 and named what many of the liberal activists who gathered here for a conference last week consider the original sin of the Obama presidency.\n\n\u201cToday, the largest six financial institutions in this country have assets of some $10 trillion, equivalent to 60 percent of the GDP of America,\u201d the senator from Vermont told a crowd of 11,000. \u201cAfter we bailed them out, because they were \u2018too big to fail,\u2019 most of them are now a lot bigger than they were before.\u201d\n\nThe surge of Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign has been widely viewed as a gambit, by liberals, to force Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to the left.\n\nBut many liberal activists see no other way for Clinton to win. They are not just supporting Sanders\u2019s agenda, or asking Clinton to embrace free college tuition or vast new infrastructure spending. They are telling an alternative history of modern liberalism.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a White House contender in 2016, is known for his stances on budget issues and war. Here are his takes on Obamacare, Social Security and more. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nTo these activists, it was the Democrats\u2019 failure to prosecute Wall Street after the 2008 crash that enabled the tea party movement and the Republican Party\u2019s comeback in Congress. It was the kludged, mandate-driven design of the Affordable Care Act that prevented it from being a boon to Democrats, as Medicare for all might have been.\n\nAnd Sanders has carried that story into the primaries. In a February speech, he bemoaned how President Obama had \u201cmissed the opportunity, politically, of doing what [Franklin] Roosevelt did when he was elected and making it clear to the American people what is happening and why.\u201d In an interview last year with Bloomberg News, he said that \u201cthe key mistake of the Obama administration, starting from the day after he was elected, was to more or less disband the grass-roots network that he had put together to get elected.\u201d\n\n[How the National Rifle Association helped get Bernie Sanders elected]\n\nSanders\u2019s campaign, and its allies, are pledging never to repeat that. In late June, the grass-roots group Ready for Warren gave up on drafting Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to run for president and rebranded itself as the pro-Sanders Ready to Fight. It joined the ranks of Progressive Democrats of America \u2014 whose founder, Tim Carpenter, died in 2014 after beseeching Sanders to run \u2014 and the Occupy-colored People for Bernie.\n\nSome of the best-attended panels at last week\u2019s Netroots Nation conference here dealt with how activists could bypass the mainstream media and make a bad bill or bad law or bad police tactic too infamous to continue. Some of the loudest applause came when Warren recounted how progressives had campaigned against some Obama administration appointees.\n\n\u201cAs soon as [Obama] got elected, they should not have held back their pressure,\u201d said Netroots Nation participant Felipe Andres Coronel, a rapper best known by his stage name, Immortal Technique. \u201cWe should have put the pressure on and made it even harder. There were people who made their presence known. Wall Street made its presence known.\u201d\n\nOutside of Netroots Nation, among the Democrats who had followed the Obama strategy, these critiques sounded part cruel and all wrong.\n\n1 of 42 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Sen.

They\u2019re in this parallel universe.\u201d\n\nDavid Axelrod, the Obama campaign strategist who was a senior White House adviser during the crisis years, said Sanders-style criticism ignores the reality of the economic crash. \u201cThere was a constant tug and pull between the need to discipline an industry whose excesses had triggered the crisis and keeping the system from collapsing, which would have exacerbated an already reeling economy,\u201d he said. \u201cSenators don\u2019t face such conundrums. Presidents do.\u201d\n\nTo the Netroots activists, the problem was that the Obama administration considered this a \u201cconundrum\u201d at all. Going after the bankers, they say, would not have crashed the economy, and it was not their fault that Obama hired people who failed to understand that. Now, all they can do is try to ensure that the next Democrat hires the right people.\n\nWhen the doors opened here for Sanders\u2019s speech on Saturday morning, those who had been waiting in line sprinted to get as close as possible to the stage.\n\nSanders and Warren \u201care saying the sorts of things \u2014 like Jon Stewart is saying the sorts of things \u2014 we wish we heard everywhere,\u201d said Connie Aglione, 67, an Arizona activist.\n\nAthena Soules, 36, an artist who designed banners for the Occupy Wall Street movement, said Sanders\u2019s success is possible in part because of the energy generated by the 2011 protests that began in Lower Manhattan. She unfurled a banner \u2014 \u201cFeel the Bern,\u201d it read \u2014 surrounded by fellow activists.\n\n\u201cWe learned the hard way from Obama,\u201d Soules said.\n\nSaid Katherine Brezler, 33, the national digital organizer for People for Bernie: \u201cWe elected Barack Obama on the idea that we were going to get a universal health-care system. We have 35 million people uninsured in this country.\u201d\n\nPressuring politicians to the left was the original idea when Netroots Nation was founded in 2006 by readers of the Daily Kos group blog. The conference (originally \u201cYearly Kos\u201d) matched Democratic candidates with a growing, active left. In 2007, every major presidential candidate participated in a forum, where Clinton said that some lobbyists \u201crepresent real Americans\u201d \u2014 a quote that haunted her. Her 2008 primary defeat was celebrated as a victory of activist power over a tired establishment.\n\n[Opinion: Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t Barack Obama, and 2016 isn\u2019t 2008]\n\nIn 2011, the White House dispatched senior adviser Dan Pfeif\u00adfer to the conference for a bristling audience Q&A. This year, there was no White House presence to speak of, and that was welcome. There was no visible organizing for Clinton \u2014 who skipped the conference \u2014 and that was barely noticed unless reporters asked about it.\n\n\u201cThe way that the Obama victory sucked out all the energy of progressive politics in the United States \u2014 it harmed us across the board,\u201d said Charles Lenchner, 45, an activist who had campaigned to get Warren into the presidential race. \u201cWhat a terrible time that was.\u201d\n\nLenchner cited the collapse of ACORN, a community group that lost congressional funding after a conservative video sting, as a nadir of the Obama years. For some, the lowlights started earlier. There was the selection of Rahm Emanuel as White House chief of staff, of Timothy F. Geithner as treasury secretary.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of expectations, which were probably set by the media, that Obama was going to be able to do all of this stuff,\u201d said Kathryn Babcock, 69, a retiree from Green Valley, Ariz. She had supported Clinton in the 2008 primary, then switched to Obama, and wept with joy when he was elected. \u201cThen he brought in all of those Wall Street types, just like everybody else,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was my first clue that this was going to be business as usual.\u201d\n\nAccording to many liberal activists, Obama\u2019s centrist tendencies stopped him from seizing a moment. They said so at the time. In December 2009, Rolling Stone reporter Matt Taibbi accused the Obama administration of hiring \u201cthe very people who caused the crisis in the first place.\u201d During the Affordable Care Act debate, many on the left insisted that the mandate-based compromise was not only worse but also less electorally viable than an expansion of Medicare or a \u201cpublic option\u201d to cover more people.\n\n\u201cI think the response early in the recession was probably more muted and quiet and moderate than it should have been,\u201d said Rep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cEverybody was too afraid.\u201d\n\nThe centrist Democrats called them crazy and self-destructive, a \u201cprofessional left\u201d \u2014 in the words of Obama\u2019s first spokesman \u2014 with no grasp of strategy. The professional left had an answer to that. The centrists could not explain why a party that came out of the 2008 election with 59 senators in its caucus and 257 House seats now has just 46 and 188. If that was not inevitable, then a major political moment had been missed. Whose fault was that?\n\n\u201cHow would the world be different today if, when the economic crisis had hit, Joe Stiglitz had been secretary of the treasury and Simon Johnson and Robert Reich had been the key economic advisers?\u201d Warren asked in her Netroots Nation speech Friday morning, referring to three popular figures on the left. \u201cThink about it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Frustration with the president\u2019s policies is becoming a core element of the senator\u2019s White House bid.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Frustration with the president\u2019s policies is becoming a core element of the senator\u2019s White House bid.", "title": "Liberal activists see Bernie Sanders as champion for causes failed by Obama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/liberal-activists-see-bernie-sanders-as-champion-for-causes-failed-by-obama/2015/07/19/8b5fc752-2e09-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/20/National-Politics/Images/481249622.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "daveweigel"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/liberal-activists-see-bernie-sanders-as-champion-for-causes-failed-by-obama/2015/07/19/8b5fc752-2e09-11e5-8353-1215475949f4_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "bernie sanders, netroots nation, sanders, sanders clinton, hillary clinton, elizabeth warren, occupy wall street, sanders warren", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts"}, "eomportal-uuid": "8b5fc752-2e09-11e5-8353-1215475949f4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "bernie sanders, netroots nation, sanders, sanders clinton, hillary clinton, elizabeth warren, occupy wall street, sanders warren"}, "article_summary": "Sen.
