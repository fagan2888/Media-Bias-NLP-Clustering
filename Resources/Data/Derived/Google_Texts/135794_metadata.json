Sannie Overly, a Democrat, went head-to-head at Midway College on Wednesday.\n\nAfter opening statements, the candidates were asked to name the most significant issue Kentucky faces.\n\nHampton, who is on a ticket with Matt Bevin, gave an answer about the pension shortfall, which would be the first and only time either candidate mentioned the pension fund all night. Overly, meanwhile, said the top issue was growing more and better paying jobs \u2014 which became a central theme of the debate.\n\nThe debate quickly turned to education, first with post-secondary education and what the two planned to do to help make college affordable.\n\nOverly said she and running mate Attorney General Jack Conway, \u201cwant to encourage programs that offer partnerships, a state wide apprentice program, and other opportunities so students can earn while they learn.\u201d\n\nHampton spoke of her time working her way through college and using loans, grants and scholarships. Hampton said that she and Bevin would work to strengthen partnerships and emphasize alternative education.\n\n\u201cWe sometimes talk about vocational training as if it\u2019s an afterthought. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a path to a very rewarding career in manufacturing,\u201d Hampton said.\n\nUnlike the first gubernatorial debate between Bevin, Conway and Independent Drew Curtis, there were fewer sharp elbows during Wednesday evening\u2019s televised debate.\n\nDisagreements over philosophy did become apparent over common core standards.\n\nCommon Core is a set of uniform standards for students in kindergarten through 12th grade \u201ccreated to ensure that all students graduate from high school with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in college, career, and life, regardless of where they live,\u201d according to the initiative.\n\nOverly is for the common core system, which Kentucky currently utilizes, saying that college readiness has doubled since implementing the uniform standards. She said that she and Conway would like to keep decision making on the local level.\n\nMeanwhile, Hampton, like Bevin, does not support common core saying it dumbs down the curriculum. During the debate, Hampton advocated for parental choice.\n\nOverly shot back that the results speak for themselves and said that Bevin has enriched himself from companies that sell common core software.\n\nAfter education, the conversation shifted to healthcare and more disagreements arose.\n\nOverly sited the success of Kentucky\u2019s portal to health insurance, known as Kynect, and how it is viewed as a success nationally.\n\nHampton said that she and Bevin would transfer Kentuckians who get their insurance through the portal back to the federal government, calling Kynect the \u201cTravelocity of healthcare.\u201d And, Hampton added that the Affordable Care Act system assumes adults cannot make decisions for themselves.\n\nFree will became a central theme on healthcare for Hampton, who is the former chair of the Bowling Green Southern Kentucky Tea Party.\n\nThe debate also focused on social issues with questions turning to Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis. Davis and her refusal to issue marriage licenses landed her behind bars for five days in jail after disobeying a federal judge.\n\nOverly stated that no one is above the law, but that she and Conway would support a tailored solution during the normal legislative session for county clerks.\n\nHampton reaffirmed that she and Bevin stand with Davis and that she thinks the U.S. Supreme Court cannot override a state\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe real sparks flew towards the end of the debate when sexual harassment in the work place and Jack Conway\u2019s remarks about his female dog came up.\n\nHampton jumped on Conway\u2019s remark from the Sept. 15 debate, which she said she found a little trifling. During the governor\u2019s debate, Conway was asked a question on the recently settled sexual harassment case in the General Assembly and how the Capitol has become a safer workplace for women.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this \u2014 when I became attorney general I think half of my directors were women,\u201d Conway said. \u201cMy first chief deputy was a woman. I\u2019m married to a strong professional woman in Elizabeth Davenport Conway. I\u2019ve got two little girls. I\u2019ve even got a female dog \u2014 they\u2019ve got me surrounded Sam, I\u2019ll tell you what.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s debate, Overly said that sexual harassment is a serious issue and one that she and Conway would have a zero tolerance policy for. She said they must encourage women to run for office.\n\nOverly turned her frustration towards Bevin, saying that rather than finding Conway\u2019s joke about having a female dog disturbing, she was upset about Bevin\u2019s attacks at her.\n\nAt the Belleramine debate on Sept. 15, Bevin said that Overly \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d have the backs of several female employees who made the claims of sexual harassment.\n\nHampton quickly retorted, saying that Overly fought to have her deposition sealed during the sexual harassment case. That deposition was never taken as the case was settled before Overly was deposed.\n\nDrew Curtis\u2019 wife and running mate Heather Curtis was not invited to participate in the debate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "MIDWAY \u2014 Set against the backdrop of Kentucky\u2019s lone women-only college, candidates for lieutenant governor Jenean Hampton, a Republican, and Rep.
