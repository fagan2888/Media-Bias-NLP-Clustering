To help acclimate to the Hawaiian heat, he rented a house on Kailua-Kona\u2019s fashionable Ali\u2019i Drive, as well as a block of hotel rooms for the 10 days leading up to the race. He also hired a private chef to prepare his meals, then flew to Hawaii and housed not only his wife and daughter but also his coach, massage therapist and physical therapist.\n\nTotal estimated cost: $100,000.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018You don\u2019t need to do that,'\u201d says Jose L. Lopez of Long Island Tri Coach, based in Mineola, New York, who guided Blumencranz through the intensive, 10-week buildup to Kona. \u201cI said, \u2018I can still train you; I don\u2019t need to be in Hawaii.\u2019 He said, \u2018I want you to be there with me.'\u201d\n\nBlumencranz, now 52, is a managing director for BWD, a large, privately held insurance brokerage and wealth-management firm in Plainview, New York. But his career success hardly makes him an anomaly in the sport. At events like Kona, it is not hard to find affluent competitors willing and able to put serious dollars behind their long-distance dreams.\n\nA 2015 survey conducted for the World Triathlon Corp. \u2014 the Tampa-based organizers of Kona and other Ironman races \u2014 found that the average annual household income for Ironman participants is $247,000. USA Triathlon, the largest multisport organization in the world, says the average income for all triathletes, including those at shorter distances, is $126,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a rich person\u2019s sport, but it\u2019s certainly an upscale person\u2019s sport,\u201d says Dr. Steven Jonas, a professor of public health at Stony Brook University, a longtime triathlete and the author of the best-selling book \u201cTriathloning for Ordinary Mortals.\u201d \u201cTo run a marathon, you need a pair of shoes, a pair of shorts and maybe a water bottle. To do a triathlon, you need a lot more.\u201d\n\nThe large portion of successful businesspeople involved in endurance sports isn\u2019t surprising, considering the personality traits they tend to share. These, says Dr. Michael Sachs, a sport psychologist at Temple University, include \u201chigh levels of motivation, goal orientation, mental toughness. They also realize that in order to be successful, they need to maintain physical and mental health, and one of the best ways to do that is exercise.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he says, there\u2019s a \u201ccoolness\u201d factor. \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a Boston Marathon T-shirt or an Ironman finisher\u2019s jacket, those are credentials you can\u2019t buy. You have to earn it.\u201d\n\nWomen, even successful women, are less likely to be found jetting around the globe or spending significant amounts of money in pursuit of their training and racing goals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know many women who are high-powered and wealthy and who are also endurance athletes who would go to these extremes,\u201d says the former professional triathlete Lee DiPietro, 57, of Delray Beach, and author of \u201cAgainst the Wind: An Ironwoman\u2019s Race for Her Family\u2019s Survival.\u201d But she said that could change.\n\nAlthough he had twice completed the Ironman distance race in Lake Placid, New York, Blumencranz is not an elite athlete.\n\n\u201cI never saw myself doing Kona,\u201d he admitted. Until, that is, a business associate dropped a word to a high-ranking executive with one of the race sponsors. \u201cI told my golf friends that, for me, getting the opportunity to race at Kona was like playing Augusta during the Masters.\u201d\n\nOn race day, Oct. 12, with his coach cheering him on, Blumencranz finished in 13 hours, 19 minutes, 56 seconds \u2014 far from the professional triathlete Frederik Van Lierde\u2019s winning time of 8:12:29 but also comfortably removed from the mandatory cutoff time of 17 hours.\n\n\u2014Marilynn Preston\u2019s Energy Express column will return next week.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2011/10/TRIATHLON.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b86\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI said, \u2018I can still train you; I don\u2019t need to be in Hawaii.\u2019 He said, \u2018I want you to be there with me.\nAlthough he had twice completed the Ironman distance race in Lake Placid, New York, Blumencranz is not an elite athlete.\nA 2015 survey conducted for the World Triathlon Corp. \u2014 the Tampa-based organizers of Kona and other Ironman races \u2014 found that the average annual household income for Ironman participants is $247,000.\nBy John Janc, The New York TimesWhen Marc Blumencranz had an opportunity to compete in the 2013 Ironman Triathlon World Championships in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, he spared no expense in his preparations to go the distance.\nUSA Triathlon, the largest multisport organization in the world, says the average income for all triathletes, including those at shorter distances, is $126,000."}
