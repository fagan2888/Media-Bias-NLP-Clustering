(He threw one more on the afternoon, ending the day with 51, a new NFL record.) The pass, initially ruled a catch, was reviewed, and upon review, officials upheld the initial ruling.\n\nFive days later, though, Texans interim head coach Wade Phillips says otherwise. Phillips told Houston media Friday that he asked the NFL for clarification on the catch after the fact, and the league told him that upon further review, Decker\u2019s reception shouldn\u2019t have been ruled a catch because he was juggling the ball.\n\n\u201cPoor Manning,\u201d Phillips told Houston media. \u201cHe thought he broke the record.\u201d\n\nNo matter what, the touchdown remains, and Manning still has the record, which he\u2019s sure to add to on Sunday.

The Broncos have a video of the reception (or incomplete pass, depending on your perspective) on their website.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Denver,Eric Decker,NFL,Peyton Manning,Quarterback,record,touchdown", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Texans interim head coach Wade Phillips told Houston media Friday that he asked the NFL for clarification on Manning's 50th touchdown, and the league told him that upon further review, Decker's reception shouldn't have been ruled a catch because he was juggling the ball.", "title": "Texans coach says NFL told him Peyton Manning's 50th TD pass wasn't actually a TD", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2013/12/27/texans-coach-says-nfl-told-him-peyton-mannings-50th-td-pass-wasnt-actually-a-catch/24529/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2013/12/peyton-decker-tamme-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Texans interim head coach Wade Phillips told Houston media Friday that he asked the NFL for clarification on Manning's 50th touchdown, and the league told him that upon further review, Decker's reception shouldn't have been ruled a catch because he was juggling the ball.", "title": "Texans coach says NFL told him Peyton Manning\u2019s 50th TD pass wasn\u2019t actually a TD", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2013/12/27/texans-coach-says-nfl-told-him-peyton-mannings-50th-td-pass-wasnt-actually-a-catch/24529/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2013/12/peyton-decker-tamme-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Texans interim head coach Wade Phillips told Houston media Friday that he asked the NFL for clarification on Manning's 50th touchdown, and the league told him that upon further review, Decker's reception shouldn't have been ruled a catch because he was juggling the ball."}, "article_summary": "With 6:57 remaining in Sunday\u2019s game in Houston, Peyton Manning threw a touchdown pass to receiver Eric Decker, the quarterback\u2019s 50th of 2013.\n\u201cPoor Manning,\u201d Phillips told Houston media.\nThe pass, initially ruled a catch, was reviewed, and upon review, officials upheld the initial ruling.\nThe Broncos have a video of the reception (or incomplete pass, depending on your perspective) on their website.\n(He threw one more on the afternoon, ending the day with 51, a new NFL record.)"}
