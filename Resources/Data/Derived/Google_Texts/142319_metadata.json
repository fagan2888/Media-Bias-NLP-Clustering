While applying for taxpayer funds is not necessarily a bad thing, residents are not happy with the prospect of their tax money going to subsidize Janet\u2019s Place.\n\nThe Temporary Town Hall was packed with residents out the door to hear the decision made by the Board as to whether or not the request would be granted.\n\nChairman Nancy Reed began the meeting with what would determine eligibility for funding for the sober house located at 40 Navillus Rd. The answer was not well received by those in favor. The main question asked by Reed in the determination of eligibility was \u201cWhat exactly are the funds being spent on?\u201d\n\nShe parsed out the language of the application, citing the verbiage in the application which scopes out a rehabilitation of the existing building.\n\n\u201cWe looked at their application,\u201d said Reed. \u201cThey have their deed, so they have already acquired the building. They are not creating housing.\u201d She went on to state that rehabilitation housing must first be acquired using CPC funds and therefore Janet\u2019s Place, which had not been acquired with said funds, is ineligible for funding from the CPC.\n\nJon Lazar, from East Coast Housing and a Development Consultant for Janet\u2019s Place, appeared somewhat stunned. \u201cAre you saying the application is refused?\u201d Reed was steadfast in the answer, which was crystal clear. CPC funds cannot be used to rehabilitate the property.\n\nLazar told the Board that they are looking to lower the mortgage to be able to offer rents more affordable to cover Phase I. Their plan was to complete the joining of the two buildings on the second floor. They are already joined on the first floor.\n\nReed reminded Lazar that this is a state law. Lazar seemed confused and said he\u2019d never heard of such a thing. He went on to say Janet\u2019s Place is creating 4-6 rooms to add more people and want to add a bathroom and one unit both handicapped accessible. Phase II would add an eave of some sort, possibly a dormer.\n\nAt that point, residents began speaking out, voicing their opinions.\n\nA man yelled to the residents, \u201cWait to be called before you speak!\u201d at which point residents asked \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to introduce myself,\u201d he said, and turned to the Board addressing Reed. \u201cMadam Chair, my name is William Gramer, counsel for Janet\u2019s Place. He then suggested a continuance for the meeting.\n\nReed then informed Gramer, \u201cThere is very specific language that we request which would explain how your proposal would be eligible for funding. You did not do that.\u201d She added, \u201cSaying you didn\u2019t have an opportunity to do that not once, but twice, does not sit well with myself.\u201d\n\nThe attorney then told Reed, \u201cThey did not know what they were writing.\u201d\n\n\u2018They\u2019 are Susan Timmons President and Director of Janet\u2019s Place and her co-director Shaun Sughrue.\n\nReed also cited that $6,500.00 was paid to Lazar to do this application to see if funding can be awarded. Lazar then turned to residents to show a plan outlining how the home would look, but they were not impressed.\n\nReed told Lazar and Gramer that filing the application, which needed to be in by January 1st at the last minute, put the Committee at a disadvantage saying, \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable putting my Committee under the gun. There\u2019s no mandate. We have to do our due diligence. Tonight we are going to talk about eligibility.\u201d\n\nGramer told Reed, \u201cYou seem to have made a determination.\u201d\n\nLazar said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to challenge this. I can\u2019t wait to go home and see it [the process] again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about sober houses right now,\u201d said Reed. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly go by what other towns do with their CPC money. I\u2019ve seen other towns use CPC money in violation of the Act. I don\u2019t want to do that in this town.\u201d\n\nReed then informed Gramer and Lazar, \u201cThere is nothing stopping you from revising your application. We\u2019re not obligated just because we\u2019re having a Town Meeting coming up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have distinctly defined yourself for rehabilitation\u201d said Reed.\n\nLazar answered, \u201cWe are more than qualified.\u201d\n\nReed then answered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, have you not heard me? It [Janet\u2019s Place] was not acquired with CPC funds. [The request] did not meet criteria.\u201d\n\nGramer then asked Reed if there were actions to take, to which Reed responded, \u201cWe can\u2019t go any further. There is no action to take.\u201d Finally, Town Manager Richard Montuori made a motion to move on with the meeting.\n\nResidents left feeling somewhat vindicated. Resident John Wade told the Crier \u201cWe can\u2019t even put a kitchen in.\u201d Wade\u2019s wife Marie Wade said, \u201cThey don\u2019t want this money to build ramps.\u201d\n\nAttorney Doug Sears who is representing residents Tom Skowronski and Walter Maciel who live on Navillus Rd. and oppose the project, told the Crier \u201cYou need to buy the lottery ticket to win. They didn\u2019t buy the ticket right.\u201d\n\nThe Crier asked Gramer if he thought it was viable for residents to use their tax dollars to subsidize the project. He declined to comment saying, \u201cI\u2019m just here for the eligibility piece.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Homenewshere.com", "description": "Officials said project proposal does not meeting eligibility requirements", "title": "Sober house hits wall with CPC", "url": "http://homenewshere.com/tewksbury_town_crier/news/article_02e8950c-a335-11e4-8333-c3f188ea7499.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/homenewshere.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/13/41343c94-a335-11e4-81a9-dbbbe63486cd/54c29ff80e39c.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C526", "height": 526}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Officials said project proposal does not meeting eligibility requirements", "fb": {"app_id": 104520852970031}, "keywords": "sober house,town crier,tewksbury,news", "news_keywords": "sober house,town crier,tewksbury,news"}, "article_summary": "Tonight we are going to talk about eligibility.\u201dGramer told Reed, \u201cYou seem to have made a determination.\u201dLazar said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to challenge this.\nChairman Nancy Reed began the meeting with what would determine eligibility for funding for the sober house located at 40 Navillus Rd.\nLazar told the Board that they are looking to lower the mortgage to be able to offer rents more affordable to cover Phase I.\nIt [Janet\u2019s Place] was not acquired with CPC funds.\nJon Lazar, from East Coast Housing and a Development Consultant for Janet\u2019s Place, appeared somewhat stunned."}
