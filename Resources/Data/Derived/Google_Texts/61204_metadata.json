So, what should Congress do next about the new national healthcare system? Based on that same poll, that\u2019s not an easily answered question: 29 percent of Americans support repeal of the law; 22 percent wish to expand the law; 20 percent support moving ahead with ACA as is; and 17 percent wish to scale back the law.\n\nWhile answers may be confusing one thing is crystal clear. There\u2019s a striking new trend in healthcare insurance: paying directly for services.\n\nOnce Patients, Now \u2018Consumers\u2019\n\n\u201cConsumers are seeing more and more of the costs directly,\u201d said Avik Roy, senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. Speaking at the Forbes Healthcare Summit 2014, Roy said consumers are \u201cpaying more of the premiums for their employer-sponsored insurance, and they\u2019re seeing more of the co-pays, while deductibles are higher.\u201d\n\nOthers speaking at the Summit agreed with Roy\u2019s view, including his belief that Obamacare is accelerating this trend. \u201cThree quarters of my employees are in high deductible plans,\u201d said David Goldhill, President and Chief executive officer, Game Show Network, adding that two thirds of employers say they will switch to high deductible plans if only to avoid the impending Cadillac tax \u2014 scheduled to take effect in 2018, this 40 percent tax will be applied to employers who do not provide cost-effective plans.\n\n\u201cA significant percentage of consumers are direct buyers of their healthcare \u2014 it\u2019s effective catastrophic care,\u201d said Goldhill. \u201cThat\u2018s a sea change.\u201d He predicts that, if the average person is paying directly for their healthcare, \u201cthe way they think about their insurance plan changes, and the way providers have to address people changes.\u201d\n\nUser Experience and Insurance\n\nClearly, many have already heard the call, including Kevin Nazemi, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Oscar Health Insurance. In particular, he is critical of the current user experience for healthcare insurance \u2014 have you ever received an explanation of benefits, which is anything but? In response, Nazemi focuses his company\u2019s efforts on the \u201cusability layer\u201d of insurance, with a website that helps you use \u201ctechnology to guide you to better care and help you keep track of your health.\u201d Meanwhile the Oscar plans offer free telemedicine, free generic drugs, and online price comparisons \u2014 new additions to the usual services.\n\nAnother entrepreneurial take on the same dilemma comes from Lisa Maki, a former Silicon Valley denizen who is CEO of PokitDok, a platform for business and health. PokitDok is \u201ceverything that you need to support a real-time, retail experience\u201d when purchasing health services, Maki says. To illustrate her product, she offers the example of someone with a high deductible plan who needs an MRI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to go out, and get a quote and see what it will cost me at all my local healthcare providers,\u201d Maki explains. \u201cPockit doc will get you that quote, let you book it, and pay for it upfront.\u201d All physician information is validated by the American Medical Association, while treatment, services, and pricing data are derived from the practices themselves as well as other sources.\n\nSo while Congress sorts out the policy side of Obamacare, technology professionals are bringing to market appropriate fixes for the practical side of the law. For many, these fixes could be as life-saving as their actual medical care. Nearly five percent of cancer patients declare bankruptcy, noted Peter Bach, the Director of Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, at the Forbes Healthcare Summit. A key Obamacare question is: Will that number grow or decrease in the coming years?\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly capitalized \"PokitDok,\" and did not identify the source of data.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, pokitdok,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Forced into high deductible healthcare plans, consumers are paying costs directly, changing how they view health insurance... and how insurance views them.", "title": "Meet The Future Of Obamacare And Your Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obamacare-news-more-consumers-paying-healthcare-costs-directly-high-deductible-plans-313290", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/health-spending.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Forced into high deductible healthcare plans, consumers are paying costs directly, changing how they view health insurance... and how insurance views them.", "title": "Meet The Future Of Obamacare And Your Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obamacare-news-more-consumers-paying-healthcare-costs-directly-high-deductible-plans-313290", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/health-spending.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/05/health-spending.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2014-12-05T17:13:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T08:50:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Forced into high deductible healthcare plans, consumers are paying costs directly, changing how they view health insurance... and how insurance views them."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5e6\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s a striking new trend in healthcare insurance: paying directly for services.\nIn particular, he is critical of the current user experience for healthcare insurance \u2014 have you ever received an explanation of benefits, which is anything but?\nNearly five percent of cancer patients declare bankruptcy, noted Peter Bach, the Director of Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, at the Forbes Healthcare Summit.\nTo illustrate her product, she offers the example of someone with a high deductible plan who needs an MRI.\nOnce Patients, Now \u2018Consumers\u2019\u201cConsumers are seeing more and more of the costs directly,\u201d said Avik Roy, senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research."}
