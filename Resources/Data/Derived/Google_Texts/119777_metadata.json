The pressure from the Conservative wing of the Republican Party is likely to be intense.\n\nIn a recent interview with this blog, former 3rd District Congressman Jon Runyan (R-NJ) said as a moderate Republican you're going to get hit from two sides. The former Philadelphia Eagle offensive tackler said he encountered as much opposition from the conservative Tea Party wing of his own party as he did from Democrats.\n\nMacArthur said he\u2019s discussed that with Runyan. He believes one of the reasons Runyan was so disillusioned by the experience is because he comes from a team sports background \u2014 where the distinction between teammates and opponents is clearly delineated.\n\nBut MacArthur, a former insurance executive, figures that if the conservative wing of the GOP is going to regard him as a turncoat for a willingness to reach across the aisle, so be it.\n\n\u201cThe best I can do is be who I am,\u201d MacArthur said. \u201cI campaigned on what I believe. I told people I was going to come here and work with Democrats and Republicans. That\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d\n\nHe signaled that centrist inclination by siding with the majority of Republicans in supporting John Boehner as House speaker. Scott Garrett (R-NJ) of the 5th District was the only New Jersey congressional representative to join with 24 Republicans who voted against Boehner.\n\n\u201cWe need leaders that are willing to work with everybody,\u201d MacArthur said. \u201cWith Republicans and Democrats, with liberals and conservatives and people in the middle. Because if we don\u2019t have people who are willing to do that, we won\u2019t get anything done.\u201d\n\nWhatever the future holds, he\u2019s pleased with his first couple of days.\n\nThe House already passed legislation he co-sponsored, exempting veterans getting medical care from the federal government from the 50-employee threshold that makes certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act apply to small businesses. He hopes that will give businesses an incentive to hire New Jersey\u2019s veterans and help decrease the unemployment rate among them, which is 10.8 percent \u2014 higher than the 6.4 percent for the state\u2019s general population.\n\nHe\u2019s pleased with his committee assignments as well.\n\nHe\u2019s on the Armed Services Committee, which he wanted because most of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst is in his district. He\u2019s also on the Natural Resources Committee, which he wanted because his district includes environmentally sensitive areas including Barnegat Bay and the Pinelands National Reserve.\n\nHis to-do list as a congressional representative includes reforms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Flood Insurance Program, prompted by people still waiting for relief from Hurricane Sandy.\n\nHe\u2019s already got a small place in Washington. In five months, once their youngest daughter graduates from high school, his wife will join him there. But he still intends to spend his weekends and breaks from Congress back in the district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back with the people who elected me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s essential. I don\u2019t want to get lost in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey's 3rd Congressional District covers large areas of Burlington and Ocean counties. Some of the cities it includes: Bordentown, Moorestown, Mt. Laurel, Brick, Seaside Heights, and Toms River.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis post is part of our South Jersey Politics Blog", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey s new 3rd District Congressman Tom MacArthur https //macarthur house gov/ R NJ says he doesn t want to be part of partisan gridlock in DC It may not be easy The pressure from the", "title": "Freshman Congressman Tom MacArthur's first impressions of life in D.C.", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "New Jersey's new 3rd District Congressman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) says he doesn't want to be part of partisan gridlock in DC."}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey's new 3rd District Congressman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) says he doesn't want to be part of partisan gridlock in DC.", "title": "Freshman Congressman Tom MacArthur's first impressions of life in D.C.", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_20150108-tom-mac-portrait-1200.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-09", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/new-jersey/77139-freshman-congressman-tom-macarthurs-first-impressions-of-life-in-dc", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Tom Joyce", "keywords": "district, he\u2019s, macarthur, people, jersey, because, republicans, congressional, former, democrats, which, committee, going, runyan, party, &nbsp, conservative, includes, house, that\u2019s", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_20150108-tom-mac-portrait-1200.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3952\"", "article_summary": "New Jersey's new 3rd District Congressman Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) says he doesn't want to be part of partisan gridlock in DC.\nThe former Philadelphia Eagle offensive tackler said he encountered as much opposition from the conservative Tea Party wing of his own party as he did from Democrats.\nIn a recent interview with this blog, former 3rd District Congressman Jon Runyan (R-NJ) said as a moderate Republican you're going to get hit from two sides.\nHe\u2019s also on the Natural Resources Committee, which he wanted because his district includes environmentally sensitive areas including Barnegat Bay and the Pinelands National Reserve.\nI don\u2019t want to get lost in Washington, D.C.\u201dNew Jersey's 3rd Congressional District covers large areas of Burlington and Ocean counties."}
