Why are we here? Is there life after death? What technically constitutes a \u201cschool shooting\u201d?\n\nWait, what?\n\nThat\u2019s right. \u201cWhat is a school shooting\u201d is the question right-wing gun-rights activists are posing after a study by gun violence prevention group Everytown for Gun Safety showed there\u2019s been a total of 74 school shootings in the United States, since 26 people, including 20 children, were killed in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, a school shooting is defined by Wikipedia as \u201can occurrence in which an individual discharges a gun and that incident takes place at an education institution.\u201d This seems pretty straightforward. There is a shooting at a school; it is a school shooting. But the problem lies in the fact that if this definition is true, then Everytown\u2019s list of school shootings, which are based on true, actual events, is accurate. And if that stands, gun-rights advocates will have a harder time defending their position of not even closing the tiniest of loopholes to make it even a tad more difficult for wannabe school shooters to gain access to guns.\n\nSo, what better way to combat this alarming list of school shootings than to redefine the term \u201cschool shooting\u201d itself? By doing this, according to gun-rights activists, you knock off, say, 59 of the 74 school shootings, leaving you with only 15 real, true, legitimate school shootings. ONLY 15! That\u2019s nothing. We can live with that, right? Apparently, gun-rights activists can. They sleep at night knowing the country\u2019s lax gun control laws took the lives of numerous students and teachers at only 15 school shootings. The sad thing is, media outlets are now using this new \u201crevised\u201d number.\n\nCharles C. Johnson is the brilliant conservative philosopher who shined a light upon this question for the ages over on his Twitter account as he went through each school shooting, excuse me, \u201cschool shooting\u201d on Everytown\u2019s list.\n\nLet\u2019s look through some of these \u201cnot school shootings\u201d or, as he calls them, \u201cfake school shootings.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t you just picture Mr. Johnson walking into this classroom full of grieving students, pointing at the deceased and declaring, \u201cYeah, this is not a school shooting\u201d?", "article_metadata": {"description": "What do you do if you want to avoid the tiniest of gun safety restrictions?
