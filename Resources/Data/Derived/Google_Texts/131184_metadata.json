Besides, they had a patchwork of other clean-water laws and regulations to worry about.\n\nThat changed this year, when U.S. District Judge Thomas O. Rice said Cow Palace Dairy, a large dairy in the Yakima Valley in Washington, used more fertilizer than its land could handle \u2014 which he declared amounted to \u201copen dumping.\u201d He ruled that posed an \u201cimminent and substantial danger\u201d to the surrounding community and the water it drinks, and said that meant opponents could sue under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 to try to stop the dairy.\n\nTypically, the law is associated with chemicals waste and manufacturing scrap.\n\n\u201cThis is the first case that would define manure as a solid waste,\u201d said Jessica Culpepper, a food safety and health attorney at Public Justice, a public interest law firm that is representing a community association in the case against Cow Palace and four nearby dairies that face similar accusations and will be part of an upcoming trial next month.\n\nObservers say the judge\u2019s decision to invoke the solid waste law, if upheld, could lead to a ripple effect throughout the country.\n\n\u201cThe decision is of intense interest to the animal agriculture industry,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said in a memo on the case last week.\n\nIn his Jan. 14 order, Judge Rice said the dairy\u2019s excess manure amounted to solid waste that\u2019s being discarded. He also said the dairy used \u201cpoorly designed\u201d storage lagoons that leaked liquid manure into the soil, canceling out its use for composting.\n\nThe case spotlights the steady shift away from small family farms in the U.S. to larger animal feeding operations. The resulting amounts of manure and air emissions already trigger four environmental laws \u2014 the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and Superfund Act, congressional researchers noted.\n\nDebora Kristensen, lead attorney for the dairy, said the 1976 solid waste law shouldn\u2019t be added to the list.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the statute was intended to cover this kind of thing,\u201d Ms. Kristensen said, saying the legislative history suggests Congress carved fertilizer out of the law.\n\nShe said Cow Palace had been under the \u201cvery watchful eye\u201d of the federal government for two years anyway, after the dairy entered a voluntary consent order with the Environment Protection Agency to address contamination in the region.\n\nThose leaky lagoons, she said, had been made in line with federal standards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re just doing whatever they want,\u201d she said of the dairies.\n\nThe judge, though, said the link between the dairy and groundwater contamination was hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cIts entire herd produces over 100 million gallons of manure per year, with millions of those gallons leaking from its lagoons and compost area, and being applied to fields that cannot possibly use the substance as fertilizer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven these numbers, any attempt to diminish the Dairy\u2019s contribution to the nitrate contamination is disingenuous, at best.\u201d\n\nMs. Culpepper said the case should offer a helping hand to others who want to protect their natural resources.\n\n\u201cI really hope,\u201d she said, \u201cthat this helps rural communities get clean water.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lawsuit over millions of gallons of manure is raising a stink in the animal agriculture sector, now that a federal judge \u2014 for the first time \u2014 has ruled farms may be held liable for how they use manure fertilizer under decades-old law on solid waste.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A lawsuit over millions of gallons of manure is raising a stink in the animal agriculture sector, now that a federal judge \u2014 for the first time \u2014 has ruled farms may be held liable for how they use manure fertilizer under decades-old law on solid waste.", "title": "\u2018Open dumping\u2019 court ruling could hold dairy farms liable for manure fertilizer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/open-dumping-court-ruling-could-hold-dairy-farms-l/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/03/e8543cea7b5514056d0f6a7067006127.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/03/e8543cea7b5514056d0f6a7067006127.jpg", "description": "A lawsuit over millions of gallons of manure is raising a stink in the animal agriculture sector, now that a federal judge \u2014 for the first time \u2014 has ruled farms may be held liable for how they use ma", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Open dumping\u2019 court ruling could hold dairy farms liable"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Environment, Thomas O Rice, Jessica Culpepper"}, "article_summary": "Observers say the judge\u2019s decision to invoke the solid waste law, if upheld, could lead to a ripple effect throughout the country.\nThe resulting amounts of manure and air emissions already trigger four environmental laws \u2014 the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and Superfund Act, congressional researchers noted.\nDebora Kristensen, lead attorney for the dairy, said the 1976 solid waste law shouldn\u2019t be added to the list.\nIn his Jan. 14 order, Judge Rice said the dairy\u2019s excess manure amounted to solid waste that\u2019s being discarded.\nHe also said the dairy used \u201cpoorly designed\u201d storage lagoons that leaked liquid manure into the soil, canceling out its use for composting."}
