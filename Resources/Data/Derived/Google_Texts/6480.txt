HACKETTSTOWN —The body of a 56-year-old woman was found in the roadway behind Lowes in Hackettstown last night, police said.

Update: Woman identified

The body was found behind the store on Mountain Avenue by an officer patrolling the area at about 10 p.m., Sgt. Darren Tynan said.

He described the location of the body as being in the roadway where deliveries usually arrive at the store and right next to the tree line of River's Edge apartments.

Tynan said the death does not seem to be the result of foul play, and there were no signs of trauma.

Police are still investigating, and more information, including the identification of the body, will be released Monday following an autopsy and family notification, Tynan said.
