One of those institutions would be the marbled shrine atop our third branch of American government, the Supreme Court. A new Associated Press poll shows that \u201conly 1 person in 10 is highly confident that the justices will rely on objective interpretations of the [Affordable Care Act] rather than their personal opinions\u201d in the Court\u2019s impending King v. Burwell decision.\n\nTo us, that 10 percent figure seems way too high. As far as we can tell, it\u2019s not 1 in 10 Americans who view our Supreme Court as a neutral collection of jurists who just want to call \u201cballs and strikes,\u201d but 1 American total: Chief Justice John Roberts. And maybe even not him?\n\nThe American people, the always trusty American people, have the Supreme Court\u2019s number here. As with so many cases about why the American people have lost trust in a powerful institution, we can look to some of the powerful institution\u2019s recent actions, going back at least to Bush v. Gore through Citizens United and Hobby Lobby and whatever primetime hit job comes next.\n\nThat next hit job may come soon in King v. Burwell, which, if ruled for the plaintiffs, would invalidate premium subsidies for those who\u2019ve purchased individual health insurance plans on federally facilitated exchanges. The expected decision based on tea-leaf readings coming out of oral arguments was 5-4 or 6-3 in favor of upholding the subsidies, which tells you a lot about how weak the case is. But there is another possible outcome: 5-4 to strike down the subsidies, because the Supreme Court is ruled by a five-member majority of conservative justices who think that the Affordable Care Act is dumb.\n\nThe last time a legal challenge to Obamacare of this breadth made it to the Supreme Court, four justices voted not just to strike down the individual mandate but the entire law as well, because they believed that the law was dumb. They didn\u2019t like it! Get rid of it! John Roberts originally sided with them but then, to the consternation of his conservative colleagues, switched his vote because such a hackish decision would have made the Supreme Court look too hackish. Roberts contented himself merely to gut the hell out of the Medicaid expansion and force the Obama administration to acknowledge that the individual mandate is a tax.\n\nVery few Court watchers are basing their predictions of the King decision on the merits of the case, and rightly so. If it was being decided on the merits of the case, everyone would be betting that it would be upheld 9-0. Does anyone think that\u2019s going to happen? No. It will all come down to how John Roberts, and perhaps Anthony Kennedy, feel about managing the politics. They want to screw over Obamacare but yeeeesh, would that backfire on the Court and conservatives? Would that make life more difficult for the Republican party heading into 2016? On the other hand: Would John Roberts ever eat lunch in Conservative This Town again if he sided with The Libruls to uphold a core component of Obamacare? It\u2019s all about finding the right balance of these competing political considerations. The Democratic and Republican parties rightly recognize the nature of the situation here and have spent months trying to get inside John Roberts\u2019 head. It is what it is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's great that we're no longer pretending the Supreme Court is immune to politics", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s grand ruse ends: Finally, Americans see the justices for the political hacks they are", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's great that we're no longer pretending the Supreme Court is immune to politics", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s grand ruse ends: Finally, Americans see the justices for the political hacks they are", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/11/supreme_courts_grand_ruse_ends_finally_americans_see_the_justices_for_the_political_hacks_they_are/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/john_roberts2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's great that we're no longer pretending the Supreme Court is immune to politics", "title": "Supreme Court\u2019s grand ruse ends: Finally, Americans see the justices for the political hacks they are", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/john_roberts2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, John Roberts, king v. burwell, law, Obamacare, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b0f\"", "article_summary": "One of those institutions would be the marbled shrine atop our third branch of American government, the Supreme Court.\nIt will all come down to how John Roberts, and perhaps Anthony Kennedy, feel about managing the politics.\nThe Democratic and Republican parties rightly recognize the nature of the situation here and have spent months trying to get inside John Roberts\u2019 head.\nThe American people, the always trusty American people, have the Supreme Court\u2019s number here.\nJohn Roberts originally sided with them but then, to the consternation of his conservative colleagues, switched his vote because such a hackish decision would have made the Supreme Court look too hackish."}
