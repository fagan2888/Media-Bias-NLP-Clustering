She said their longtime family mechanic sent Ken Shupe, the owner of Shupee Max in Travelers Rest, to help her, because he couldn\u2019t get there fast enough.\n\n\u201cWhen he got up there, he put his truck in the position to have it pulled up, pulled the chains down, went around the back, saw the sticker on the back of her car and the sign in her back window, came back and said, \u2018I can\u2019t tow you.\u2019 She said, \u2018Why? Is there something wrong with the car?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, you\u2019re a Bernie supporter.\u2019 She said, \u2018What, are you serious?\u2019 Needless to say she was in shock. Her jaw just dropped,\u201d McWade said.\n\nMcWade\u2019s daughter suffers from psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, early stage Crohn\u2019s disease and ankylosing spondylitis, which means her spine is in the process of fusing. She has to take multiple medications and supplements, according to WYFF.\n\nRead more: http://bit.ly/1TMt4pZ\n\nWhat others are clicking on:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A South Carolina mother says a tow truck driver refused to help her disabled daughter because she supports Bernie Sanders.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_09ba3f0df1447f40e98674ba9d62c747", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4i.com", "description": "A South Carolina mother says a tow truck driver refused to help her disabled daughter because she supports Bernie Sanders.", "title": "Disabled Bernie supporter left stranded on highway", "url": "http://nbc4i.com/2016/05/06/disabled-bernie-supporter-left-stranded-on-highway/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/nc_nobernietow0506_1920x1080.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A South Carolina mother says a tow truck driver refused to help her disabled daughter because she supports Bernie Sanders.", "creator": "@nbc4i", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/nc_nobernietow0506_1920x1080.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Disabled Bernie supporter left stranded on highway", "site": "nbc4i", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "Columbus, Ohio News, Weather and Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=380703612", "fb": {"pages": 38342932750}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "NBC4i.com", "google-site-verification": "Y7Un57nax7y1Nq_Ap5-4MFnKkuvSsOsEzQ67vpVKTFQ", "keywords": "bernie sanders, national, news National, News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBC4Columbus", "published_time": "2016-05-06T17:29:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-06T17:29:31+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbc4i.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6f1d97944cdcea2214c0f42e5738057f?s=16"}, "article_summary": "(WYFF) A South Carolina mother says a tow truck driver refused to help her disabled daughter because she supports Bernie Sanders.\nIs there something wrong with the car?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, you\u2019re a Bernie supporter.\u2019 She said, \u2018What, are you serious?\u2019 Needless to say she was in shock.\nMcWade\u2019s daughter suffers from psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, early stage Crohn\u2019s disease and ankylosing spondylitis, which means her spine is in the process of fusing.\nKelle McWade\u2019s 25-year-old daughter was in an accident on I-26 in Asheville.\nShe said their longtime family mechanic sent Ken Shupe, the owner of Shupee Max in Travelers Rest, to help her, because he couldn\u2019t get there fast enough."}
