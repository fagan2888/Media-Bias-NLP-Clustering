(CNN) Jeb Bush said in an interview aired Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that he believes he'll be in a better position to break away from the rest of the Republican field when he announces his presidential candidacy.

"I think this transition to a candidacy will allow me to be more direct about my advocacy of the leadership skills necessary for the next president to fix a few things," Bush told CNN's Dana Bash in Tallinn, Estonia, on Saturday.

"And as a candidate, contrary to someone who has been listening and learning along the way, I'll offer up alternatives to the path we're on as well, so I'll be more specific on policy," he said.

Bush, who has long been viewed as a likely presidential contender, is expected to announce his candidacy on Monday. But he believes it could take some time for him to break out of a crowded Republican pack, which already boasts 10 candidates.
