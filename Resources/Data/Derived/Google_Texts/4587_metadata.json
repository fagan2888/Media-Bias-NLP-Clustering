However, strangely enough, when unemployment rates increase in a larger population \u2014 mortality declines.\n\nCan a higher state unemployment rate actually be good for your health? While people suffer individually from joblessness, as a whole, researchers have found that a society\u2019s mortality rate decreases, adding years to your life. In a new study out of Drexel University and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, researchers sought to dig a little deeper to understand this contradiction. The study is the first to examine both of these effects concurrently, and found that they do occur at the same time \u2014 it\u2019s not one or the other, as some previous studies have concluded.\n\nThe researchers found that losing jobs was linked to a 73 percent increase in mortality. But an economic recession, surprisingly, had positive side effects \u2014 like a drop in fatalities and air pollution. With each percentage-point increase in the state unemployment rate, the risk of death dropped by about nine percent. \u201cMost people believe that being unemployed is a bad thing,\u201d said lead author Jose Tapia, an economist and population health researcher at Drexel University, in a press release. \u201cBut what many people don\u2019t realize is that economic expansions \u2014 which usually reduce joblessness \u2014 also have effects that are harmful for society at large.\u201d\n\nAir pollution, for example, greatly increases during economic booms, and this may be one of the factors behind a decrease in mortality when the economy slumps. \u201cOther potential causes for the decrease of mortality risk during recessions could be changes in levels of stress and risk of injury in the working environment,\u201d Tapia said. \u201cDuring economic expansions, work is done at a faster pace, more employees are commuting, workers have less average sleep, and so on \u2014 all of which can be linked to higher risk of heart attacks, vehicle crashes, industrial injuries and enhanced circulation of germs. All of this reverses in recessions.\u201d\n\nThe researchers used data from the Department of Labor and annual survey data, examining the time frame between 1979 and 1997 and studied how both employment conditions and contextual economic conditions affected the risk of death. \u201cThe increase in the risk of death associated with being unemployed is very strong, but it is restricted to unemployed persons, who generally are a small fraction of the population, even in a severe recession,\" Tapia said. \"Compared with the increase in the risk of death among the unemployed, the decrease of the mortality risk associated with a weakening economy is small, but the benefit spreads across the entire adult population. The compound result of both effects is that total mortality rises in expansions and falls in recessions.\u201d\n\nHowever, researchers remain at a point of disagreement about the issue. Some research showed that health was actually better during the Great Depression, but others argue that if you re-analyze the data and disaggregate it by city and state level, rather than across the entire nation, you get the exact opposite result, showing that the recession actually was detrimental health-wise. False \u201ccorrelations can occur when immediate effects are not decoupled from long-term trends, especially problematic with trending variables, such as GDP,\u201d the authors of another study about the Great Depression write, essentially contradicting other researchers. This simply leaves us with the fact that more research will need to be done in order for stronger conclusions to be made.\n\nSource: Tapia J.
