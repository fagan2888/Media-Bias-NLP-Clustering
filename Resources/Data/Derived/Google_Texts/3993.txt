Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton received another piece of good news to head into the weekend with: a stellar jobs report.

The Labor Department announced Friday that the U.S. economy added 271,000 jobs in October, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5%. To put that figure in perspective, the last time the jobless rate was 5% was in April 2008 — when Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama were battling for the Democratic nomination for president. At the end of Obama's first year in office, the unemployment rate peaked at 10% in October 2009.

The most striking bright spot in Friday's report was wage growth. After remaining stubbornly stagnant, average hourly earnings rose 2.5% — the best gain since 2009.
