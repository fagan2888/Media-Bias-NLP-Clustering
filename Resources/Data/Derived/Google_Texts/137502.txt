American president Barack Obama and Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper put down two wagers on this week’s USA-Canada hockey games. The North American leaders have one bet going for Thursday’s women’s hockey gold-medal game and another on Friday’s men’s hockey semifinal. What did they bet, you ask?

I’m betting @barackobama one case of Canadian beer per hockey game this week. #teamusa is good, but #WeAreWinter. #GoCanadaGo @WhiteHouse — Stephen Harper (@pmharper) February 20, 2014

.@pmharper and I bet on the women’s and men’s US-Canada hockey games. Winner gets a case of beer for each game. #GoTeamUSA! -bo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 20, 2014

Okay, but what kind of beer? Are we going for national stereotypes, like Budweiser vs. Molson? Trendier beers, like Blue Moon vs. Moosehead? Hipster beers, like PBR vs. wait, are there Canadian hipsters? Enough with this veil of government secrecy. Beer-drinking citizens/hockey fans demand transparency! And maybe a sixer of our own!

On the whole, this is kind of a boring wager. Don’t get me wrong, everyone can get on board with the swapping of some good brews, but usually the wagers are for something specific to each locale. You don’t trade American apples for Canadian apples, you swap American apples for Canadian oranges. It should be maple syrup for apple pie. Justin Bieber for Miley Cyrus. Universal health care for Obamacare. Phoenix Coyotes for Winnipeg Jets. Alex Trebek for Ryan Seacrest. Vancouver for Seattle. Let’s make this a painful bet to lose, not one that can be paid off after a trip to 7-11.

Following Canada’s dramatic win in the women’s gold medal game, Harper tweeted that he’s looking forward to some free beverages.
