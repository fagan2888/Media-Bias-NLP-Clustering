More drivers are hitting deer as the species enters it's seasonal breeding period.

Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Aaron McGuire says drivers need to be aware of their surroundings and be looking for deer, especially in November and December.

"We ask that people, you be prepared for that, if you see a deer in front of your car, the best thing to do is not to swerve, to hit it and pull over safely to the side of the road," Trooper McGuire said.

Trooper McGuire said that people shouldn't swerve for small animals or road debris either as it can cause an accident with another vehicle or object.

"The severe damage that we see that involve deer are always somebody that swerves to miss the deer and their vehicle overturns and they hit another vehicle. Very few and far between are the deer crashes where someone hits a deer and they are injured at all, let alone any kind of serious injuries," Trooper McGuire said.
