On a recent Sunday morning, I needed medical help and went to the Emergency Room at Riverview Hospital.

Fantastic was the way I was treated. The nurses, doctor and techs went above and beyond to take care of me.

I do not know all of their names but wish to thank them.

So folks, you do not have to go out of town for the best medical help. Itâ€™s right here in Wisconsin Rapids.
