Today, that unopened pack would be worth between $10,000 and $15,000.\n\nBrooklyn native and Hoboken resident Leighton Sheldon purchased his first pack of baseball cards in 1985 at the age of 8. Almost 30 years later, Sheldon now runs the nation\u2019s largest buyer of vintage baseball cards, \u201cJust Collect.\u201d\n\nSheldon\u2019s company also buys and sells football, basketball and hockey memorabilia, though his passion has always revolved around the baseball diamond.\n\n\u201cI played sports growing up but I would\u2019ve been fooling myself if I thought I would go on to play professionally,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cI decided to do, in my estimation, what I thought was the next best thing at the time which was getting into the baseball card industry.\u201d\n\nSheldon now staffs six full-time employees as well as a few part-timers who are enrolled at his alma mater, Rutgers. His company takes pride in offering all of its customers a free appraisal.\n\n\u201cWe like to buy baseball cards at a fair price but we do enjoy the experience,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cWe do it a little differently than everybody else.\u201d\n\nSheldon and his team name every collection based on the story behind it. They tell the story on their website, justcollect.com.\n\nFor instance, one of his collections, \u201cThe Lost and Found Collection,\u201d involved a family from New Jersey whose patriarch passed away believing that his collection of baseball cards had been lost. As family members were cleaning his house, they came across his 1941 \u201cPlay Ball\u201d baseball cards that were in \u201creally nice\u201d condition. The family eventually sold the collection to Sheldon without regret.\n\n\u201cThat story, along with others like it, made me realize that people felt good about selling to us and that separated us from the rest of the pack,\u201d Sheldon said.\n\nYesterday, Sheldon had with him approximately $100,000 worth of baseball cards he\u2019s acquired through auctions and private sellers.\n\nWith him was a 1915 Ty Cobb from a box of Cracker Jacks worth $6,000. A 1910 Cy Young from a cigarette box worth $3,000. A Jackie Robinson rookie card worth $3,000.\n\nAnd then the final two.\n\nFirst, a Cap Anson card. Anson was perhaps the greatest player during the 1800s. The card, printed in 1887, is currently on sale for $24,500.\n\nThe last is a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle Rookie card, which Sheldon used to explain his trade and how cards are graded and priced.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that people look at and appreciate and what dictates the value is the centering,\u201d he explained. \u201cSee how this has a defined border left to right, it looks pretty good, top to bottom is a little bit off, not too bad.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the Mantle rookie card is known for being off center.\n\nWhat dictates the grade and price more so than the centering are the corners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the corners of this Mantle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not bad, but I can see the lower left has a little bit of wear, that\u2019s consistent with a grade of five.\u201d\n\nThe final indicator is the condition of the card\u2019s surface.\n\n\u201cIf you look here, the blue is really strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not faded. There\u2019s also no creasing or wrinkling.\n\nIf a card has a wrinkle or a crease it will never score a grade above a four, even if every other attribute is perfect, which can be frustrating for both collectors and dealers.\n\nThe final price for this edition of Mantle\u2019s rookie card? $25,000.\n\nSheldon grew up a fan of Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly. Though Mattingly never won a World Series championship, shortly after Mattingly\u2019s retirement, Sheldon seized the opportunity to see his team play for a shot at the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves.\n\nWhile in college at Rutgers, Sheldon payed $200 for a nosebleed seat at Game 6.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a part of history,\u201d he said.\n\nHe certainly was as the Yankees went on to win in the sixth and deciding game.\n\nApparently he wanted to take a part of history with him as well.\n\n\u201cI dislodged my bleacher seat and took it out underneath my Windsor coat,\u201d he said. \u201cI still have it to this day. I put a date on it and everything. I\u2019d never sell it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Max Tyler | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "bayonne,hoboken", "title": "Love of baseball turns into thriving vintage card business in Hoboken", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Love of baseball turns into thriving vintage card business in Hoboken\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/hoboken_resident_is_vintage_ba.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15581374-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13602071\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-09T07:00:25Z\", \"author\": \"Max Tyler | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@hudson-county\",\"@news\",\"@river\",\"@sports\",\"bayonne\",\"hoboken\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15581374-small.jpg", "description": "In 1952, there may have been no better investment one could&#8217;ve made in the United States for 5 cents than buying a Topps baseball card pack and keeping it closed.
