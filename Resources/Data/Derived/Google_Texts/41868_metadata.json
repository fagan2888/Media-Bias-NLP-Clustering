Donaldson said he didn't know Brown personally, but was impressed by his record.\n\n\u201cHe's a go-getter. I looked at statistics, the number of arrests he made. He is a very hard worker. I have got nothing but good remarks about him,\u201d Donaldson said.\n\nDonaldson formed his plans for Butler and the police department when he knocked on 2,000 doors during the campaign, he said.\n\n\u201cIllegal drugs are what people talked about more than any other problem. It frustrates them. Drug use causes all kinds of other crimes,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown, 51, replaces Ronald Fierst, who has been chief for nearly two years and has worked at the department for 35 years.\n\nFierst will continue working at the rank of captain. He could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cI have nothing but the highest respect for him,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cIt was time for a change, though.\u201c\n\nBrown will earn $80,811 as chief. As a lieutenant, he earned a base salary of $62,000 plus overtime and extra pay for working certain shifts.\n\nDonaldson said neighborhood crime watches and community policing can make his city safer.\n\nBrown will oversee 22 officers. \u201cI was not looking to be chief. It was offered the job, and I accepted. I am real happy with it,\u201d Brown said.\n\nA native of the city, Brown, whose father was a mill worker at Pullman Standard, graduated from Butler Area High School in 1980. He joined the police department several years after working other jobs.\n\n\u201cI love my job. I like to help people. I enjoy being around people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe father of two children in middle school, Brown enjoys the outdoors, hunting, fishing and camping. He said camping trips with his family help ease the stress of police work.\n\n\u201cI like the outdoors. It's so peaceful. It's nice,\u201d he said.\n\nRick Wills is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
