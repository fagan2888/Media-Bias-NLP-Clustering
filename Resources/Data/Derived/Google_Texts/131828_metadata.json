So where do they take them?\n\n\u201cWherever the next available bed opening is determined,\u201d said Macon County Sheriff Robbie Holland. \u201cFrom Haywood to Manteo ... anywhere in the state the hospital finds a bed.\u201d\n\nThat kind of drive can eat up a lot of patrol hours and fuel, and can put a lot of wear and tear on patrol vehicles. In 2014 alone, Macon County Sheriff\u2019s Office spent 8,299 hours and $253,625 on involuntary committals.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that law enforcement departments all over North Carolina are trying to find a solution to while still following state laws. It\u2019s a multi-faceted issue with limited solutions.\n\n\u201cThe state reduced the number of beds for involuntary commitments, which creates a backlog,\u201d said Maj. Shannon Queen with the Jackson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cWe also have more people needing help and more people willing to get them help \u2014 society isn\u2019t looking bad on it \u2026 so it\u2019s good more people are coming forward, but it\u2019s reducing manpower on the road or in the jail.\u201d\n\nHolland said at least larger cities to the east have more hospitals in their jurisdiction and can deal with these situations better.\n\n\u201cI have spoken to sheriffs across the state, and all consider mental health commitments to be a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina appears to have the greatest problem due to lack of hospital space for psychiatric assistance.\u201d\n\nHolland said it\u2019s been an issue for his department since 2005, when transports began increasing due to the closing and availability of state beds within mental health facilities.\n\n\u201cStatutorily, we are required to transport, and the law does not state that we\u2019re required to stay with them while that process is being determined. However, safety concerns have historically required us to stay from beginning to end as a matter of public safety from the point a person is picked up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur reason for doing so is because from the start of the commitment process the person was deemed to be a threat to themselves or others.\u201d\n\nJeff Haynes, chief deputy for the Haywood County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said his officers have had to drive to the coast to find services for a patient. When it\u2019s that far away, the transport requires two officers.\n\n\u201cThis happens at least weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cOf the 117 clients we transported in 2014, 63 were transported farther east than Hickory.\u201d\n\nBudgeting\n\nHolland recently brought up the issue to Macon County commissioners, because it may affect his department\u2019s budget request for 2015-16. Transporting is not something that can be easily estimated, and Holland said it\u2019s not getting any better.\n\n\u201cHonestly, at times it is a guessing game. We never know what is going to happen in the coming year,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is go by the trends we have seen and the data we have collected during the previous budget years and predict.\u201d\n\nWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Holland may face some problems with part-time officers going over their allotted 20 hours a week due to involuntary committals.\n\n\u201cThe regulations do become more and more difficult, and unfunded mandates continue to make life difficult for those on the front line who are required to actually deal with the issues at hand,\u201d Holland said.\n\nAs a solution, Holland told commissioners he\u2019d be asking to replace those part-time positions with full-time detention center positions because those officers are typically responsible for transporting committals. He currently has five part-time officers assigned to the detention unit.\n\n\u201cIf (officers) work more than 19 to 20 hours a week consistently, they need to be on county retirement and we need to be taking it out of their check,\u201d said Mike Decker, Macon\u2019s human resources manager. \u201cIf they work more than 30 hours a week, we need to be providing them health care.\u201d\n\nHaynes said the Haywood Sheriff\u2019s office was working on putting together more concrete numbers on the cost of involuntary committals for this year\u2019s budget process, but the impact is clear when looking at staffing adjustments.\n\n\u201cWe added one full-time and one part-time transport officer midway through 2014 to address the need,\u201d he said. \u201cThese additional officers work four times per week. After-hours we depend on part-time staff, but it is difficult to keep their work hours under the new national part-time standards.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, transport mileage in Haywood County was more than 100,000 miles in 2014. At that rate, Haynes said, transport vans would only last a year or two before they need to be replaced.\n\nPossible solutions\n\nJack Register, executive director for the National Alliance on Mental Health in North Carolina, said the lack of beds for mental health patients makes it hard on local officers and on families of the patients when they have to travel hours to be with their loved ones in the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the idea that we have to have publicly funded access to care where people live,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people should still be in their hometown so family can be part of their recovery.\u201d\n\nNAMI is currently working with the state to create capacity solutions. Register said one of the problems is the constant shifting in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina has been under reform for 20 years \u2014 we need consistent stabilization for the entire system,\u201d he said.\n\nTelemedicine is making great strides but people still need to be hospitalized immediately. Telepsych technology allows a video link between a hospital and a psychologist. The mental health professionals can assess the patient via video with the psych unit to determine the needs of the patient and if necessary, locate bed space and place that patient immediately on the waiting list.\n\nRegister said mental health should be looked at no differently than if a patient needed emergency heart surgery or needed a cancer treatment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the General Assembly to understand the consequences for families and mentally ill patients that have to be transported,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, NAMI has had some success in training officers how to better deal with mentally ill patients during transporting. A recent Crisis Intervention Training Conference had 500 law enforcement officers in attendance.\n\n\u201cWe teach them how to work with someone in crisis because they may not be safe to be around,\u201d Register said. \u201cMore and more law enforcement are realizing it\u2019s a huge issue, so the silver lining is that more people are wanting to get involved.\u201d\n\nHaynes said there are contract agencies that do transporting, but it might end up being just as expensive as transporting in-house, because these agencies are such a niche business.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious the system is overloaded, and until something happens we will continue to spend days with patients, and those days have even reached weeks waiting on a placement,\u201d Holland said.\n\nHaynes said the sheriff\u2019s department is in regular contact with legislators and will make sure this issue is on their radar. But until more funding is allocated for mental health services in the state, officers will continue to follow the law and transport patients who need help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a topic near and dear to us \u2014 we need to put attention to it and look at creating positive resolutions,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil then, we have to comply with the law and get help for people who need it.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers\n\nMacon County Sheriff\u2019s Office increased expenses related to involuntary committals 2006-2015:\n\n\u2022 Increase in commitments \u2014 127 percent\n\n\u2022 Increase in officers utilized \u2014 423 percent\n\n\u2022 Increase in officer hours \u2014 651 percent\n\nInvoluntary commitments by year/average time spent with committals\n\n2006: 109/12 hours\n\n2007: 143/9.5 hours\n\n2008: 128/17.5 hours\n\n2009: 152/ 17.5 hours\n\n2010: 100/18.5 hours\n\n2011: 138/32 hours\n\n2012: 197/30 hours\n\n2013: 218/40 hours\n\n2014: 247/41 hours\n\n2014 Macon County Sheriff\u2019s resources on committals\n\n\u2022 1,113 officers spent 9,572 hours on commitments.\n\n\u2022 8,299 of those hours were spent at the emergency room with commitments.\n\n\u2022 Officers drove 55,021 miles transporting involuntary committals across North Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, issues, and events from Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties in western North Carolina.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Jessi Stone", "og": {"url": "http://www.smokymountainnews.com/news/item/15045-sheriffs-cope-with-exploding-costs-of-involuntary-committals", "type": "article", "description": "News, issues, and events from Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties in western North Carolina.", "title": "Sheriffs cope with exploding costs of involuntary committals"}, "title": "Sheriffs cope with exploding costs of involuntary committals", "robots": "index, follow", "keywords": "sheriff,mental health,north carolina"}, "article_summary": "In 2014 alone, Macon County Sheriff\u2019s Office spent 8,299 hours and $253,625 on involuntary committals.\n\u201cThe state reduced the number of beds for involuntary commitments, which creates a backlog,\u201d said Maj.
