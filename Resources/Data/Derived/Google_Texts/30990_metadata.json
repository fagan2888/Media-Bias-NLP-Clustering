In fact, as reported by MyrtleBeachOnline.com, many state employees and other proponents of the healthcare \u201claw\u201d are protesting the bill that would block its enforcement. The news site reports:\n\nActivists opposed to the legislative effort to impede the federal health-care law did some blocking of their own.\n\nFor the second week, the protesters stood in the driveway to the State House parking garage and were issued a dozen citations, mostly for disorderly conduct, when they did not quickly move back to the sidewalk. The tickets followed last week\u2019s protest, when 11 protesters were hauled off in Columbia police patrol cars and charged with blocking the roadway.\n\nDespite running afoul of the law, the protesters may have had some influence over State Senator Tom Davis (R-Beaufort), the bill\u2019s primary sponsor. As quoted in the same story, Davis reportedly said that \u201che wants to narrow the proposed ban on state agencies aiding Obamacare to exempt those required to carry out parts of the law.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s hardly the bold blueprint for state nullification of an unconstitutional federal act, as anticipated by our Founding Fathers.\n\nJames Madison, for example, in The Federalist, No. 45, recommended that state lawmakers \u201crefuse to cooperate with officers of the Union\u201d when the federal authority attempted to enforce any act not falling within its constitutionally enumerated powers.\n\nWhile Davis\u2019 language as reported by MyrtleBeachOnline.com is not as forceful as the Founders would prefer, in another interview he pointed to a solid Supreme Court case that supports his position of a state\u2019s right to refuse to carry the federal government\u2019s water.\n\nIn MedCityNews, Davis\u2019s reliance on the anti-commandeering principle was reported:\n\nAccording to Davis, his \"anti-commandeering\" measure is based on a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says the federal government cannot force states to use their resources to carry out laws approved by Congress.\n\nAs we have reported on many occasions, the concept of anti-commandeering prohibits the federal government from forcing states to participate in any federal program that does not concern \u201cinternational and interstate matters.\u201d\n\nWhile this expression of federalism (\u201cdual sovereignty,\u201d as it was named by Justice Antonin Scalia) was first set forth in the case of New York v. United States (1992), most recently it was reaffirmed by the high court in the case of Mack and Printz v. United States (1997).\n\nSheriff Richard Mack was one of the named plaintiffs in this landmark case, and on the website of his organization, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, he recounts the basic facts of the case:\n\nThe Mack/Printz case was the case that set Sheriff Mack on a path of nationwide renown as he and Sheriff Printz sued the Clinton administration over unconstitutional gun control measures, were eventually joined by other sheriffs for a total of seven, went all the way to the supreme court and won.\n\nThere is much more \u201cammo\u201d in this historic and liberty-saving Supreme Court ruling. We have been trying to get state and local officials from all over the country to read and study this most amazing ruling for almost two decades. Please get a copy of it today and pass it around to your legislators, county commissioners, city councils, state reps, even governors!\n\nThe Mack/Printz ruling makes it clear that the states do not have to accept orders from the feds!\n\nAccording to Davis, then, the House bill he helped re-write for the state senate relies, at least in part, on the decision handed down in the Mack/Printz case.\n\nApparently, though, despite taking a stance against Palmetto State enforcement of ObamaCare, Davis does not see his bill as an example of nullification. In fact, he seems not to accept nullification as a valid weapon in the arsenal of liberty.\n\nA report out of South Carolina published earlier this year contains a disturbing statement made by Davis.\n\nIn a statement published in January on a Tea Party website, Davis reportedly said nullification was not \"an available remedy\" and then went on to misinterpret Article VI's so-called Supremacy Clause and perpetuate the myth of unquestionable judicial authority. Read my take on those egregious errors here.\n\nIsland Packet quotes Davis\u2019s denial of a state\u2019s power to nullify ObamaCare: \u201cThe conversation really has gotten off the rails a little bit,\u201d Davis said Wednesday, after holding three public hearings across the state that drew hundreds. \u201cEverybody talks about nullification. This isn\u2019t nullification. We can\u2019t nullify.\u201d\n\nBut states not only can nullify every unconstitutional act of the federal government, they must do so if they are to faithfully adhere to the oath they swear as mandated by Article VI. What\u2019s more, the Founders of our Republic would expect state lawmakers to stand for state sovereignty.\n\nAs James Madison wrote in the Virginia Resolution of 1798:\n\nIn case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.\n\nPut simply: State legislators are duty bound to nullify.\n\nDavis believes, though, that the South Carolina legislature\u2019s only option is to delay enforcement of ObamaCare \u201cas best they can until such time as Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nNullification is growing in popularity because a quickly multiplying number of concerned citizens of every state are learning the hard way that Congress is unlikely to ever repeal any of the innumerable unconstitutional acts it has passed.\n\nThis same frustrated group of citizens also is beginning to realize the futility of filing legal complaints in the hope that the federal courts will strike down offensive measures.\n\nThey understand that while there might once have been a day when these tactics were effective, those days are gone and those responses to the federal government\u2019s abuses of power are futile.\n\nThat said, there is no reason that concerned citizens should not try every avenue toward restoring federalism, including working to convince Congress to repeal this offensive act.\n\nConcerned citizens refuse to wait on Washington to fix a problem Washington caused. Instead, they know they need to forcibly derail the \u201clong train of abuses and usurpations\u201d and \u201cprovide new Guards for their future security\u201d \u2014 the states and themselves.\n\nSenator Davis\u2019 opinion to the contrary, nullification is still the \u201crightful remedy.\u201d\n\nActs not authorized under the enumerated powers of the Constitution are \u201cmerely acts of usurpations\u201d and deserve to be disregarded, ignored, and denied any legal effect.\n\nMore state legislators need to learn this. Familiarity with these facts is fundamental to a reclaiming of state authority and removing the threat to liberty posed by the centralization of power in the federal government.\n\nSo, although it isn\u2019t perfect or as powerful as it should be and its sponsor doesn\u2019t have as firm a grasp on federalism as one would hope, his bill is a refutation of the federal government\u2019s erroneous perception that it has the right to rule over every aspect of the lives of Americans.\n\nDebate on Davis\u2019 bill continues in the South Carolina State Senate all this week. Governor Nikki Haley has not indicated whether she would sign the bill were it to find its way to her desk.\n\nJoe A.
