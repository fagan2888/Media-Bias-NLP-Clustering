Loesch, who is vehemently anti-Donald Trump, went after McEnany for her bleach blonde hair, her pearly white teeth and her flat chest. Oh, and her pro-Trump stances and what it means to be a real conservative.\n\nWeirdly, Loesch, who sources say is \u201cwell endowed\u201d breast wise, sounds a lot like Trump.\n\n\u201cA person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10,\u201d Trump, the GOP presumptive nominee, once said on Howard Stern\u2018s radio program.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to Loesch\u2019s remarks about the Harvard, Oxford and Georgetown educated McEnany, who routinely appears on CNN in tight fitting blue, red and black dresses that exemplify her breast size, which, in The Mirror\u2018s estimation might be a strong B-cup.\n\nLoesch, in part, was fiercely defending RedState\u2018s Ben Howe, who appeared on CNN Sunday on \u201cReliable Sources\u201d alongside McEnany, who attacked him for not really being conservative.\n\nHowe wrote, \u201cMy good friend Dana Loesch saw the exchange and went from amused, to mildly annoyed, to incensed on her radio show today as she threw the gauntlet down.\u201d The Right Scoop also wrote about Loesch\u2019s outburst and clearly had Loesch\u2019s back. \u201cWatch: Dana Loesch Destroys Trump Supporter Kayleigh McEnany,\u201d the headline roared.\n\n\u201cWhew! That was bru-tal!\u201d wrote RS. \u201cBut she [McEnany] deserved it for such an absurd statement. As if Trump is Mr. Conservative on anything. He doesn\u2019t even know what the word conservatism means!\u201d\n\nLoesch began her radio program by bringing up Jesus, who apparently ran out the back door when she unloaded on McEnany, asking repeatedly, \u201cWho is this chick?\u201d Loesch referred to herself in third person: \u201cShould I be real Dana or nice Dana?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what set her off:\n\nMcEnany on CNN: \u201cYou are not a conservative if you do not support Donald Trump. \u2026Where were they with John McCain who was for Cap and Trade, who was against the Bush tax cuts? Where was the \u2018Never McCain\u2019 movement? Where were they with Mitt Romney who laid out the blueprint for Obamacare? Where were they leading the \u2018Never Romney\u2019 movement? Those movements didn\u2019t exist. \u2026What you have going on here is an elitist establishment that is rejecting their voters that says they know better than their voters.\u201d\n\nLoesch began speaking over McEnany\u2019s clip by invoking the biblical figure and making barking dog noises: \u201cOh Jesus take the wheel. Take it Jesus. Take the wheel Jesus, it\u2019s Monday. Huhhh\u2026Yip Yip Yip Yip Ru Ru Ru Ru\u2026alright, you can just shut her up.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo ways I can do this,\u201d she continued. \u201cI can either be real or I can be nice Dana. Which one do ya want? Which one y\u2019all want? You want real or do you want nice? You want real or do you want nice?\u201d\n\nAnd then she went off.\n\n\u201cWho the hell is this chick?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho\u2019s this chick? You heard of her before? I never heard of her until a week ago. Who is she? I had to look her up because didn\u2019t know who she was. And I thought, well surely someone who has established themself as this keeper of the flame, as someone who has established themself as the definer of what is or is not conservatism\u2026surely this person, they have mondo expertise and they\u2019ve been in the trench and they have the bruises and scars to prove it, right?\u201d\n\nSo Loesch says she looked into McEnany\u2019s background.\n\n\u201cBeyond from having her lips overdrawn so she could repeatedly appear on cable news as a talking head for a particular issue, this chick has not been in any sort of battle nor has she ever been on the front line in anything ever,\u201d Loesch said. \u201cSo you can back up, Miss, I don\u2019t know what her name is, Michaela? I don\u2019t know. Back up. Stay in your lane.\u201d\n\nLoesch went on to say she and others have been on the front lines of the conservative movement since 2008, which included phone banking, going door to door, and fundraising. Loesch is also in the healthcare business. She is a pitch model for a \u201cheart healthy\u201d medical cure that purportedly helps your blood pressure. She does TV spots for SuperBeets, a circulation superfood that you drink. She promises that it increases your energy and stamina. She says she drinks it every morning.\n\n\u201cWhere was this chick?\u201d Loesch asks of McEnany. \u201cHow dare you? Where was this chick? We have enough of these dilly bar head bleach blonde people out there shrieking about well, you\u2019re not a conservative if you\u2019re not this.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Loesch stood up and went nuts on McEnany.\n\n\u201cSeriously, let\u2019s have this conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere were you several years ago? Because I surely didn\u2019t see you out there from my right or left. \u2026And baby cakes this was more than just going on television and flashing them pearly whites and your flat-chested red dress over sprayed bleach blonde hair while you sit here and preach all this stuff about who is or isn\u2019t a conservative. You like Trump? Let me act like him for a minute. Alright? I bet you love me now. Done with this crap. Who do you think you are? You didn\u2019t do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nLoesch, who later mocked \u201cgirls with lip gloss on television,\u201d said she had no regrets: \u201cI don\u2019t care how mean I sound. \u2026Don\u2019t want nuthin\u2019 don\u2019t start it.\u201d\n\nWatch Loesch\u2019s extended rant below.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Betsy Rothstein", "description": "Conservative radio host Dana Loesch annihilated CNN Trumpette Kayleigh McEnany in the most vicious of ways Monday on her radio show.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservative radio host Dana Loesch\u00a0exterminated CNN Trumpette Kayleigh McEnany in the most vicious of ways Monday on her radio show.
