The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2011 urged banks to better manage the risks of their merchant customers who employ payment processors, such as PayPal, for credit card transactions. The FDIC listed gun retailers as \u201chigh risk\u201d along with porn stores and drug paraphernalia shops.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department has launched Operation Choke Point, a credit card fraud probe focusing on banks and payment processors. The threat of enforcement has prompted some banks to cut ties with online gun retailers, even if those companies have valid licenses and good credit histories.\n\nPHOTOS: Best concealed carry handguns\n\n\u201cThis administration has very clearly told the banking industry which customers they feel represent \u2018reputational risk\u2019 to do business with,\u201d said Peter Weinstock, a lawyer at Hunton & Williams LLP. \u201cSo financial institutions are reacting to this extraordinary enforcement arsenal by being ultra-conservative in who they do business with: Any companies that engage in any margin of risk as defined by this administration are being dropped.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department representative said the agency is conducting several investigations that aim to hold accountable banks \u201cwho are knowingly assisting fraudulent merchants who harm consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring that our efforts to combat fraud do not discourage or inhibit the lawful conduct of these honest merchants,\u201d the Justice Department said in a May 7 blog post.\n\nPHOTOS: These pro-gun celebrities may shock you\n\nBut gun retailers say their businesses are being targeted in the executive branch\u2019s efforts:\n\n\u2022 T.R. Liberti, owner and operator of Top Gun Firearms Training & Supply in Miami, has felt the sting firsthand. Last month, his local bank, BankUnited N.A., dumped his online business from its service.\n\nAn explanatory email from the bank said: \u201cThis letter in no way reflects any derogatory reasons for such action on your behalf. But rather one of industry. Unfortunately your company\u2019s line of business is not commensurate with the industries we work with.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Black Rifle Armory in Henderson, Nevada, had its bank accounts frozen this month as the bank tried to determine whether any of Black Rifle\u2019s online transactions were suspicious.\n\n\u2022 In 2012, Bank of America suddenly dropped the 12-year account of McMillan Group International, a gun manufacturer in Phoenix, even though the company had a good credit history, the owner said. Gun parts maker American Spirit Arms in Scottsdale, Arizona, received similar treatment by Bank of America, the country\u2019s largest banking institution.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be happening with greater frequency and to many more dealers,\u201d said Joe Sirochman, owner of American Spirit Arms. \u201cAt first, it was the bigger guys \u2014 gun parts manufacturers or high-profile retailers. Now the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being choked out, and they need their cash to buy inventory. Freezing their assets will put them out of business.\u201d\n\nChoking off access to banks\n\nAfter McMillan Group owner Kelly McMillan publicized Bank of America\u2019s action on his Facebook account, he found that thousands of small gun-shop owners across the country were in the same situation. Banks were either dropping them, freezing their accounts or refusing to process their online sales, so he opened a credit card processing company for the gun industry called McMillan Merchant Solutions.\n\n\u201cFour generations of my family have been in this industry. This is my way to give back,\u201d said Mr. McMillan, adding that many of his customers were denied banking access because of the nature of their business. \u201cThis is an attempt by the federal government to keep people from buying guns and a way for them to combat the Second Amendment rights we have. It\u2019s a covert way for them to control our right to manufacture guns and individuals to buy guns.\u201d\n\nBankUnited N.A., which dropped Top Gun Firearms Training & Supply in Miami from its customer list, declined to comment.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Times, Bank of America said: \u201cWe would not deny banking services to an organization solely on the basis of its industry.\u201d\n\nThe banking giant blamed a misunderstanding with the Arizona gun manufacturers McMillan Group International and American Spirit Arms.\n\nHowever, the American Banking Association, the industry\u2019s advocacy group in Washington, said businesses deemed \u201crisky\u201d will be frozen out of the financial system if the Justice Department continues Operation Choke Point because the regulatory burden and risk of investigation will be too great for less-specialized banks to bear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being threatened with a regulatory regime that attempts to foist on us the obligation to monitor all types of transactions,\u201d Richard Riese, a senior vice president at the American Bankers Association, said in the April 28 issue of American Banker. \u201cAll of this is predicated on a notion that the banks are a choke point for all businesses.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Times, Mr. Riese said the cost of doing business with gun retailers outweighs the benefits for some banks, given that regulators deem the industry as \u201crisky,\u201d state laws vary on the sale of guns and ammunition, and the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement.\n\nThe Independent Community Bankers of America, an association for small banks, said enforcement actions from the Justice Department are too broad and overly aggressive.\n\n\u201cWhile preventing fraud is a top concern for community banks, it needs to be balanced with ensuring that businesses and consumers that operate in accordance with applicable laws can still access payment systems,\u201d bankers association President Camden Fine told the Justice Department in an April 7 letter. \u201cICBA requests that the DOJ suspend Operation Choke Point immediately and focus its resources directly on businesses that may be violating the law, rather than targeting banks providing payment services.\u201d\n\nJustice\u2019s operation threatens to \u201cclose access to the financial system to law-abiding businesses, because the mere prospect of an enforcement action is sufficient to cause financial institutions to restrict access to their payment systems to only established companies that present low risks,\u201d the organization said.\n\n\u2018No statutory authority\u2019\n\nRegulations on the financial industry have increased over the past few years, said Thomas P. Vartanian, chairman of Dechert LLP, a global law firm specializing in regulatory and financial matters.\n\nHe noted the chilling effect of overregulation by the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, an interagency behemoth that includes the departments of Commerce, Justice, Labor, Education, Homeland Security and Justice along with the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Secret Service, the FBI, the Social Security Administration and the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\u201cThe key to effective regulation is the balancing between too little and too much regulation,\u201d Mr. Vartanian said. \u201cThe problem here is that there are now so many regulators, including the Department of Justice, with their fingers on the scales on that balancing act.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans say the Obama administration is using its regulatory powers to shutter industries it doesn\u2019t like. Last year, 31 Republicans accused the Justice Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. of intimidating banks and payment processors to \u201cterminate business relationships with lawful lenders.\u201d\n\nIn a March hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee on consumer protection, Sen. David Vitter, Louisiana Republican, complained that several payday lenders \u2014 another industry labeled \u201crisky\u201d by the administration \u2014 were being dropped by their banks in his home state.\n\n\u201cThere is a determined effort from [the Justice Department] to the regulators to cut off credit and use other tactics to force [payday lenders] out of business,\u201d Mr. Vitter said. \u201cI find that deeply troubling because it has no statutory basis, no statutory authority.\u201d\n\nIn a House hearing in April, FDIC acting General Counsel Richard Osterman defended his agency\u2019s definition of what constitutes a \u201crisky\u201d business \u2014 subject to money laundering or other criminal behavior \u2014 but made it clear that no bank is outright prohibited from serving any such companies.\n\n\u201cWe have actually put out a policy statement on this issue to make it very clear from the very top that as long as financial institutions are properly managing their relationships and the risks, they\u2019re neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing these services,\u201d Mr. Osterman said.\n\n\u201cBasically, what we\u2019re saying is, these types of programs can be, can involve high-risk activities that could create litigation risk and reputation risk for financial institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, they need to do due diligence to ensure that the folks who they\u2019re banking are acting in a safe and sound manner.\u201d\n\nBut the cost of that due diligence, coupled with the threat of a lawsuit for doing business with a customer in an industry the government has defined as risky, is having a chilling effect on legitimate companies such as gun dealers, said Mr. Weinstock, the Hunton & Williams lawyer.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the most heavily regulated industries in America,\u201d said Mr. Sirochman of American Spirit Arms. \u201cWe have to ship our guns to another federal licensed dealers for pickup. The people that are picking up the rifles have to go through a background check to make sure they don\u2019t have any felonies. You can\u2019t own a gun or pass the background check if you do.\n\n\u201cAll this is, is an assault on our Second Amendment rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gun retailers say the Obama administration is trying to put them out of business with regulations and investigations that bypass Congress and choke off their lines of credit, freeze their assets and prohibit online sales.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Gun retailers say the Obama administration is trying to put them out of business with regulations and investigations that bypass Congress and choke off their lines of credit, freeze their assets and prohibit online sales.", "title": "Targeted?
