Drone operators are also prohibited under the FAA proposal from conducting flights that take the devices out of their line of vision \u2014 a big blow to companies such as Amazon that have touted the possibility of using the technology to conduct deliveries.\n\nThe rules make drone operators responsible for avoiding collisions with manned aircraft that are in the same airspace as the devices and prohibit drone flights that \u201cfly over people, except those directly involved with the flight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The drone was reported by pilots on four commercial airline flights.", "description": "The drone was reported by pilots on four commercial airline flights.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The drone was reported by pilots on four commercial airline flights.", "title": "Feds investigating drone sighting near Newark airport", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/250731-feds-investigating-drone-sighting-near-newark-airport", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/drone_110214gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/250731-feds-investigating-drone-sighting-near-newark-airport", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-10T12:48-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, FAA drone rules, Drone,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T12:48:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/250731-feds-investigating-drone-sighting-near-newark-airport", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The drone was reported by pilots on four commercial airline flights.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds investigating drone sighting near Newark airport"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds investigating drone sighting near Newark airport"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd401\"", "article_summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a drone that was sighted flying near commercial airplanes at Newark Liberty International Airport, The Associated Press reports.\nThe regulations also call for drone flights to be limited to daytime hours and conducted only by U.S. residents who are older than 17.\nCritics have complained about potential privacy violations from drone surveliance and aviation groups have raised concerns about interference with commercial airline flights.\nThe rules make drone operators responsible for avoiding collisions with manned aircraft that are in the same airspace as the devices and prohibit drone flights that \u201cfly over people, except those directly involved with the flight.\u201d\nThe agency said last week that it has approved more than 1,000 drone flights while it finalizes the regulations that will allow for a widespread expansion of their use."}
