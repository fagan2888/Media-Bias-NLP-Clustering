Not bad for a company that originated as a private social network among seven friends.\n\nThe new funds come from current investors Foundry Group, Techstars Ventures and FreshTracks Capital. The previous round \u2014 $5.5 million last fall \u2014 went toward hiring developers and adding several features to the site: drag and drop editing, drafts and full-screen browsing and navigation. Mobile apps for iOS and Android are set to release this spring.\n\n\u201cThe money we\u2019ve raised will be 100 percent used to let Ello continue to hire only the best people, and to let us take our time to grow and build Ello right, with the right features in the right order,\u201d Paul Budnitz, Ello\u2019s CEO, said in an e-mail.\n\nMark Solon, managing partner at Techstars Ventures, will also join the Ello board.\n\nWhen Ello reached the nation\u2019s radar last summer (even Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon weighed in), its appeal was as the anti-Facebook. Ello\u2019s team had no plans to track personal users or sell their data.\n\nBut the attention may have been too soon. The company was still in beta. Even as it started approving new users, the site was admittedly buggy. It was limited to computers. You couldn\u2019t share someone else\u2019s post that you liked. It was difficult to find friends. Bugs were fixed. Simple features were added, along with some complicated ones.\n\nCodePen, for example, allows developers and hobbyists to write web apps and embed them right into their Ello posts. (\u201cJustin [Gitlin, a front-end designer] added that on his own. We all walked in about a week ago and he\u2019d added it and we all applauded,\u201d Budnitz said.)\n\nThe Ello team has grown to 27 people, with about two-thirds located in metro Denver. Co-founders and head designers Todd Berger and Lucian Fohr are in Boulder. Other co-founders with software developer Mode Set are in Denver. Budnitz is in Vermont.\n\nA recent hire includes Pete Sheinbaum, the former CEO of Daily Candy, as Ello\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cOur dev team are all senior developers. We purposely hire rule breakers who have their point of view and are free to express it in the things they make,\u201d Budnitz said.\n\nAnd for those wondering about if that $6 million is all used up, Budnitz elaborated.\n\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t use up all our money yet,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019ve been growing steadily and they (investors) offered us more money, and it was a good deal so we took it.\u201d\n\nPast stories on social activity:\n\nView RSS feed\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Boulder,Denver,design,Ello,foundry group,FreshTracks Capital,funding,Paul Budnitz,Techstars Ventures,venture capital", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "Ello says hello to another $5 million | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/02/ello-says-hello-to-another-5-million/16512/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/ello_mobile.jpg?fit=495%2C219", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "Ello says hello to another $5 million", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/02/ello-says-hello-to-another-5-million/16512/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/ello_mobile.jpg?fit=495%2C219", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Anti-ad social networking site Ello raises another $5 million to expand and improve the company."}, "article_summary": "Ello, the little social networking site that could, just raised another $5 million from investors, bringing its total investment to $11 million.\nThe Ello team has grown to 27 people, with about two-thirds located in metro Denver.\nCodePen, for example, allows developers and hobbyists to write web apps and embed them right into their Ello posts.\nWhen Ello reached the nation\u2019s radar last summer (even Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon weighed in), its appeal was as the anti-Facebook.\nAnd for those wondering about if that $6 million is all used up, Budnitz elaborated."}
