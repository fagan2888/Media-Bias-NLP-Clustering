(NYSE: GE) could become one of the top players in the oil services and equipment industry if it decides to bid for Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI).\n\nA Justice Department lawsuit filed this week against Halliburton Co. (NYSE: HAL) to stop the merger of the world\u2019s second- and third-largest oilfield service companies could soon put Baker Hughes back in play, with GE seen as the most likely bidder. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have said they plan to contest the government\u2019s case, which could delay the timing of any future takeover offers. In December, GE was said to be exploring bids for various assets Halliburton was marketing in an attempt to secure antitrust approval for the deal.\n\n\"This is one way you could really accelerate yourself in the oil and gas industry,\" J. David Anderson, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said Thursday in a phone interview. \"Buy Baker to fill in the gap and all of a sudden,you\u2019re one of the more dominant oil service companies out there.\"\n\nGE has expanded its oil and gas business in recent years through more than $10 billion in acquisitions, making it the company\u2019s fourth-largest division. Yet, within the world of oilfield services and equipment manufacturing, the company ranks 11th, according to Tulsa, Oklahoma-based consultant Spears & Associates. Among GE\u2019s four largest business units in the oilfield sector, none rank larger than third for market share. A large acquisition would vault GE into the top tier.\n\n\"If they buy Baker Hughes, they\u2019re immediately in the top 3,\" Anderson said. \"This is sort of the big missing piece.\"\n\nMelanie Kania, a spokeswoman for Baker Hughes, did not immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment. David Lurie, a spokesman for GE, declined to comment.\n\nCentral Focus\n\nOil and gas has become central to GE as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt focuses operations on industrial manufacturing. He is selling the bulk of GE\u2019s finance arm and its home-appliances unit while expanding divisions making drilling equipment, gas turbines and jet engines.\n\nWith the oil market slumping, GE is likely to be opportunistic as it explores potential acquisitions, said Deane Dray, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThey are interested, but they\u2019re going to be very, very discerning on the valuation because they\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\nGE has a budget target of about $10 billion for dealmaking in the next few years. While the company could go well over that for the right acquisition, a large purchase may be difficult for some investors to stomach since that could conflict with GE\u2019s stock buyback plans, Dray said.\n\nEven small bolt-on deals could set up GE\u2019s oilfield equipment-making unit to cash in on a return to industry growth in a couple years, Anderson said. Providing offshore services and equipment to the oil industry looks \"dead\" until about 2018, he said.\n\nRegulatory Status\n\nIn addition, the timing of a large, single acquisition could be slowed by the overhaul of GE\u2019s lending operations, said Scott Davis, an industrial-company analyst with Barclays. After agreeing to sell more than $160 billion of assets over the past year, GE last week submitted an application to U.S. regulators to drop its designation as a too-big-to-fail financial firm.\n\nUntil GE is freed from the classification -- and the regulatory restrictions that come with it -- the company is unlikely to pursue larger deals that would require adding significant leverage to its balance sheet, Davis said.\n\n\u201cAnything $6 billion, $7 billion in size or less, I think they would do without hesitation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything above that and you start to get a little more risky.\u201d\n\nWhile it makes sense on paper for GE to make a play for Baker Hughes, a deal may never happen, said Andrew Cosgrove, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Getting bigger in oilfield services doesn\u2019t mean getting better, especially in a world where crude is not forecast to climb back to $100 a barrel anytime soon, he said.\n\nA large acquisition in the oil and gas business would not be \u201ca big part of that margin-uplift story that GE\u2019s trying to achieve,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if GE is interested in a deal, Baker Hughes may not be ready right away. Its merger agreement with Halliburton has made it harder for Baker Hughes to cut more of its costs during the downturn, Brian Ulhmer, an analyst at GMP Securities in Houston, said in an interview.\n\n\"You cut all those costs out, you slim it down, then I think you\u2019re positioning yourself for a sale,\" Anderson said.\n\nEnergy companies in the middle market continued to face financial pressure due to price volatility in the oil and gas sectors. Recently, Energy XXI Ltd. (NASDAQ: EXXI), Peabody Energy Corp. (NYSE: BTU), SandRidge Energy Inc. and Vaalco Energy (NYSE: EGY), have all expressed returns about continuing their operations, going forward. Foresight Energy (NYSE: FELP) and Linn Energy (Nasdaq: LINE) have also been working with lenders on debt negotiations.
