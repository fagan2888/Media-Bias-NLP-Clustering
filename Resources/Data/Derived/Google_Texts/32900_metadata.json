We\u2019ll explain.\n\nAssuming you have armchair knowledge of the situation in Washington right now, you know that House Speaker John Boehner has lead what is likely his final charge against President Obama, Harry Reid and the Affordable Care Act this week, resulting in a massive government shutdown.\n\nThe first in nearly 20 years.\n\nEven if you disagree with his politics, there\u2019s something to be said for Boehner\u2019s consistency. Self-destructive though he has been, he at least has the stones to stand by his convictions and the integrity to \u2026 wait, leaked emails show that Boehner was in secret talks with Reid, trying to keep Congress\u2019 Obamacare exemption while publicly damning it? Well, shit.\n\nAnd that was about it for Glenn Beck. Though many critics see Beck as little more than a conservative mouthpiece, he actually criticizes the GOP quite often, and harshly.\n\nCase in point: #DefundTheGOP is his baby.\n\nWatch his takedown below, in which he calls John Boehner a hypocrite and a \u201clying thief.\u201d\n\nHence, #DefundTheGOP. It\u2019s a promoted hashtag meant to get conservatives to stop giving money to Republicans until folks like Boehner are out of the picture. Think of it as Atlas Shrugged, but turned on the GOP.\n\nIs it working? You tell me.\n\nDamn Rhinos! Remember, Republican DOES NOT equal Conservative! #DefundTheGOP \u2014 Daniel Bornt (@DanBornt) October 3, 2013\n\n#DefundTheGOP I\u2019m proud of the Republicans who are standing their ground against Obamacare.
