Three new health center sites in Alabama are getting Affordable Care Act funding to help serve their communities.

Capstone Rural Health Center in Parrish, Quality of Life Health Services Inc. in Gadsden and Whatley Health Services Inc. in Tuscaloosa are receiving approximately $1,637,500.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell announced the funding Tuesday morning.

The new health centers are expected to increase access to health care services for nearly 8,220 patients in Alabama.

HHS credits the community health centers for helping 130,648 Alabama residents sign up for health insurance since 2013.
