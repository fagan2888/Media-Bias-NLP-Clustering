But were the Fox Business moderators able to get straight answers from the candidates on important issues?\n\nReason TV sucked out the hot air and drilled down to the substance. Watch the video above for The 3 Best and Worst Moments of the Fourth GOP Debate.\n\nThird Best Moment: America Shouldn\u2019t Police the World\n\nRand Paul finally came out of his debate hibernation to cast a shadow on the GOP\u2019s war hawk faction. The Kentucky senator countered Marco Rubio\u2019s assertions that he is a \u201ccommitted isolationist\u201d by pointing out that it\u2019s not very conservative to increase government spending on the military, as Rubio wants. True isolationism, according to the Senator, comes from the other candidates\u2019 threats to cut off dialogue with Russia, Iran, or other perceived enemies, a step that Reagan did not take even during the height of the Cold War.\n\nThird Worst Moment: More Bombs and Boots\n\nAside from Donald Trump, who paid lip service to limited foreign intervention mostly to needle Jeb Bush, the rest of the field launched a barrage of promises to keep the bombs flowing and the boots grounded, no matter the lives lost or the money spent. From creating no-fly zones in Iraq and Syria to arming every militia from Kurdistan to Ukraine, the ideas on parade offered no respite from the arrogance and fear tactics of the past two administrations.\n\nSecond Best Moment: Fewer, Simpler Taxes\n\nThe Republicans presented plans that generally simplify the tax code and reduce rates. While the extent and nature of the proposals varied, the candidates focused on the way the current complexity of the code favors wealthy, politically connected organizations\u2014which are uniquely able to hire the army of lawyers necessary to wade through it all, and to lobby Congress to insert favorable provisions.\n\nSecond Worst Moment: Immigrants Are Taking Our Jobs\n\nUnfortunately, that bit of sanity was balanced out by a fresh round of crazy about immigrants. After Donald Trump\u2019s usual wall schtick, Ted Cruz described immigration as an \u201ceconomic calamity\u201d for Americans, despite the evidence that immigration increases the standard of living for all. He even suggested that journalists don\u2019t cover this calamity because they don\u2019t face job insecurity or competition from foreign workers.\n\nBest Moment: Big Government Creates Crony Capitalism\n\nThe best moment of the night came with the Republicans\u2019 forceful arguments against crony capitalism and the growth in government that fuels it. Citing everything from Obamacare to Solyndra, the candidates pitched an end to government that picks winners and losers, systemically hurting the poor and the vulnerable while helping the rich and the well-connected.\n\nWorst Moment: Leadership Means Abandoning All Reason\n\nFinally, batting cleanup with the worst facepalm of the debate was Ohio governor John Kasich, whose vision of presidential leadership is to abandon all principle and reason during times of crisis. In response to everything from water crises to bank failures, Kasich believes that it is the job of the executive to do something in the heat of the moment, before rational reflection and the better part of human nature emerge to spoil the party. According to Kasich, \u201cPhilosophy doesn't work when you run something.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think were the best and worst moments of the debate? Tell us in the comments.
