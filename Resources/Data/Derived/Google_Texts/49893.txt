PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — Care New England has announced plans to scale back services at Memorial Hospital.

The hospital announced Monday that it will eliminate a number of positions as well as its maternity ward and intensive care unit.

Care New England Spokeswoman Susan McDonald told WJAR-TV the company doesn’t know how many jobs will be eliminated or which departments will see cuts.

Care New England CEO Dennis Keefe says the Affordable Care Act, the hospital surplus in Rhode Island and the flagging inpatient income at Memorial are reasons for the restructuring. Keefe says the ACA’s emphasis on preventive care rather than hospital stays forces facilities to be more streamlined.

Care New England took over Memorial in 2013.

The union that represents nurses at the hospital is opposed to the changes.
