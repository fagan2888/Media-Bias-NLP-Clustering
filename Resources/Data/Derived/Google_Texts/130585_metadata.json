According to the complaint, Marin\u2019s hours were reduced from 30 to 45 hours per week to 10 to 25 hours per week.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that, at a meeting attended by Marin, a general manager of Dave & Buster\u2019s stated that the ACA\u2019s provisions would cost the company as much as $2 million and to avoid that cost, it planned to reduce the number of full-time employees at Marin\u2019s store. The lawsuit assumes that similar meetings were held by Dave & Buster\u2019s across the country.\n\nThe lawsuit cited a news report in The Dallas Morning News, in which a human resources officer for the company said, \u201cLike many companies, D&B is in the process of adapting to upcoming changes associated with the health care reform.\u201d However, in response to a letter from Marin\u2019s attorney, the company stated that Marin\u2019s reduction in hours was part of a nationwide \u201cprogram in 2013 intended to right-size the number of full-time and part-time employees in [its] stores.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to reinstate employees to their full-time positions and restore their rights as participants in Dave & Buster\u2019s health plan. It also asks for an award to plaintiffs to make them whole for the loss of wages and benefits, with interest, from the date of reduction in their hours.\n\nLast year, a federal district court moved forward a lawsuit claiming an employer refused to advance a part-time employee to a full-time position to avoid paying for health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Healthcare", "Description": "The lawsuit claims Dave & Buster\u2019s effort to \u201cright size\u201d its workforce was done to avoid paying for health care benefits.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "According to the complaint, Marin\u2019s hours were reduced from 30 to 45 hours per week to 10 to 25 hours per week.\nThe lawsuit assumes that similar meetings were held by Dave & Buster\u2019s across the country.\nAn employee of Dave & Buster\u2019s Inc. in New York City has filed a lawsuit claiming the company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Section 510 interference of benefits provisions when it reduced full-time employees\u2019 hours following passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nLast year, a federal district court moved forward a lawsuit claiming an employer refused to advance a part-time employee to a full-time position to avoid paying for health coverage.\nIt also asks for an award to plaintiffs to make them whole for the loss of wages and benefits, with interest, from the date of reduction in their hours."}
