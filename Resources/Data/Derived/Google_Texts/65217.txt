TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA – The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced a saltwater license-free fishing day for this Saturday, Nov. 29.

Florida residents and visitors can experience Florida’s unique saltwater fishing opportunities first hand without being required to have a recreational saltwater fishing license.

Florida offers eight license-free fishing opportunities a year including four in freshwater and four in saltwater.

An annual license for residents can be purchased at 1-888-FISH-Florida or at License.MyFWC.com. All fishing license fees are used to support Florida fish and wildlife conservation and help attain additional funding for Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration projects.

“Florida is the fishing capital of the world and this saltwater license-free fishing day is a great opportunity to introduce friends and family to the joys of fishing during the holiday season,” said Gov. Scott. “Florida has many natural treasures and I encourage all Floridians and visitors to head to Florida’s coast and experience Florida saltwater fishing.”

All bag limits, seasons and size restrictions apply on these dates. For fishing tips, locations and rules, visit MyFWC.com/Fishing.
