A Texas health worker who apparently contracted Ebola from Thomas Duncan was wearing “full protective gear — gown, gloves, mask and shield,” according to Texas health officials.

But the virology experts at Huffington Post say not to worry … and Democrat hack Donna Brazile agrees!

Here’s what she tweeted earlier this morning:

What's on your menu? Despite a virtually unbroken litany of terror, war, and disease since ancient times, we have survived—and thrived. — Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 12, 2014

We live in a scary world. We can’t completely control how scary it gets, but we can control how scared we get. #HopeOverFear — Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 12, 2014

Yes, they want you to be afraid, but evidently not of the things that can really harm you. #HopeOverFear — Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 12, 2014

That last tweet came after Brazile retweeted a story about the new Ebola case in Texas.

So, in a nutshell, “they want you to be afraid” but you shouldn’t be. Because Ebola isn’t dangerous, even though it was transmitted to a health care worker in Texas.

Or something.

It’s Donna Brazile. Did you really think any of it would make sense?
