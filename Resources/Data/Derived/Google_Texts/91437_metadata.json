Since its first MinuteClinic opened in 2000,CVS has become the largest retail clinic operator with its 877 locations in 27 states, including California, Florida and Texas.\n\nThe Woonsocket, R.I.-based company is beckoning consumers to its clinics, pharmacies and Medicare drug plan, trying to serve as a node for collaboration with hospitals. The company is sharing pharmacy and primary care data with more than 40 health systems, including Sharp in California, Emory in Georgia and MedStar in Maryland.\n\nClinicians at health systems with a CVS-integrated electronic health record (EHR) can see all of a patient\u2019s prescriptions across locations \u2014 a major boon to medication adherence and admission prevention efforts \u2014 while patients visit CVS for medication refills, groceries and housewares, or a check up on symptoms with a nurse practioner.\n\n\u201cIt really goes back to today\u2019s healthcare consumers looking for care when they want it,\u201d as Bob Gilbert, MedStar\u2019s president of ambulatory services, recently told Kaiser Health News.\n\n[See also: Retail clinics popular with high earners.]\n\nChicago-based Walgreens, which operates 420 clinics in 21 states, is not yet quitting tobacco sales like CVS. But it is going after another large consumer health market for wellness and health rewards, in a partnership with WebMD. With the goal of incentivizing consumers \u201cto make healthier choices at home, work and on-the-go,\u201d the project will bring WebMD\u2019s virtual wellness and coaching programs to the shoppers at its 8,000 stores.\n\nWalgreens is going to incorporate WebMD content into its digital and mobile commerce platforms, while WebMED intends to offer visitors to its website \u2014 like individuals Googling their symptoms \u2014 access to Walgreens prescription refill and clinic appointment scheduling.\n\nWalgreens intends to market WebMD\u2019s virtual wellness programs for smoking cessation, exercise, weight control, stress reduction and chronic disease management, and link it to customer loyalty and rewards programs, to give consumers access to discounts and gift cards for healthy behaviors.\n\nThe Walmart effect\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart, the largest retail chain in the national and world, is nurturing new insurance sales and primary care services, along with its pharmacy business.\n\nAfter years of selling prescription drugs, co-branding Medicare drug plans and partnering with local hospitals and providers for some 100 walk-in clinics, Walmart is now going to be a provider itself \u2014 offering access to a nurse practitioner for $40, or $4 for the 1.1 million workers and dependents covered by the company health plan.\n\nStaffed by a private company, six new Walmart Care Clinics in Texas and South Carolina, and others to come, will offer a range of low-cost lab services \u2014 $8 for bladder infection, cholesterol and mono tests and $15 for hemoglobin blood sugar, urine protein and HIV tests \u2014 and be open 8 to 5 Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 Saturdays and 10 to 6 Sundays.\n\nThe new clinics are aimed at \u201csetting a new retail price in the healthcare industry,\u201d said Jennifer LaPerre, Walmart\u2019s senior director for health and wellness.\n\nLow-cost basic care and preventative tests \u2014 at prices patients know before they receive them \u2014 along with evening and weekend hours and online appointments make retail companies well-suited to serve the millions of newly-insured individuals with subsidized private plans or Medicaid and baby boomers covered by Medicare.\n\nHealth systems can offer convenience and quality as well as retailers, and perhaps can meet affordable prices, if they start now \u2014 before waves of retail health really wash in.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a Walmart clinic open 15 hours a day, that\u2019s the standard you may have to meet,\u201d said Lisa Bielamowicz, MD, the chief medical officer at the Advisory Board Company. Online and same day appointments and walk-in on-site lab tests \u201care eventually going to rise to be the standard,\u201d Bielamowicz argues.\n\nA number of health systems are trying to offer retail services at walk-in clinics, such as Alegent Health in Omaha (a part of Catholic Health Initiatives), Group Health in Seattle, and Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania. In greater Philadelphia, Abington Health, Temple Health and Einstein Healthcare have opened walk-in clinics and now compete against private operators like Patient First and Premier Immediate Medical Care \u2014 and walk in clinics at CVS, Target, Walgreens and Walmart, places where many people are already shopping.\n\nIn rural regions, Walmart especially has a big opportunity to be a major provider of primary care for many people. Bielamowicz thinks the company could also expand its ideas and make more transformative investments. \u201cYou could see how they could evolve this strategy.\u201d\n\nIn a presentation last year, she wondered: \u201cWhat if Walmart expands enough in primary care that it disrupts local, established patient-physician relationships and referral chains, combines clinical, pharmacy and consumer data to create comprehensive patient profiles and then uses that to create a membership model that can drive patient decisions, and then on top of everything, they\u2019re able to launch or partner with a nationwide affordable health plan and require aggressive price concessions to participate in their networks?\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/retail-health-double-edged-sword", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/147043698.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The emergence of digital and retail health is a clarion call for hospitals and medical practices to innovate and improve the patient experience.
