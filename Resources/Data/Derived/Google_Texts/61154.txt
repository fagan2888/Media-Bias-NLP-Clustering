Saturday was the first day of the long awaited Gulf Coast Salute, which took place at Tyndall Air Force Base.

Gulf Coast Salute

It has been four years since the last air show.

Thousands of community members, and dozens of vendors were set up inside the base.

Even though the weather was a little wet, that didn't dampen anyone's spirits.

There was a 90 minute delay, but once the weather cleared up, everyone enjoyed the show.

Two of the popular acts were the Thunderbird's and the F-22 Raptor Aerial Demo team.

The community is invited to attend the show Sunday starting at 9 a.m.
