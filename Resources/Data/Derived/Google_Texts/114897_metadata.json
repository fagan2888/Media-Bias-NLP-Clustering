Sanders, as Chelsea put it, \u201cwants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the [Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program], dismantle Medicare, dismantle private insurance.\u201d\n\nAt the debate, NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell took it up from there. \u201cSecretary Clinton,\u201d she asked, \u201cis it really fair to say that Senator Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?\u201d\n\nClinton was ready. \u201cWell, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time. People may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the 90\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions,\u201d Clinton said, as Sanders narrowed his eyes at her.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I believe,\u201d she went on. \u201cThe Democratic party in the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed. We finally have a path to universal health care. We\u2019ve accomplished so much already.\u201d\n\nHer voice rising, the applause gathering, she continued: \u201cI do not want to see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t want to see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Sanders?\u201d Mitchell prompted.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton didn\u2019t answer your question,\u201d Sanders retorted. \u201cBecause what her campaign was saying is, 'Bernie Sanders who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.' That is nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide health care for every man, woman and child as a right,\u201d he said.\n\nThe distinction is a central one in the Democratic primary: are you for a sausage maker (Clinton), or an egg-breaker (Sanders), as the American Prospect put it recently.\n\nClinton\u2019s history shows a little bit of both.\n\nIn 1993, a smoother, softer, First Lady Hillary Clinton, still carrying a whiff of Arkansas gentility, appeared before Congress to promote her voluminous health care reform proposal. \u201cFranklin Roosevelt hoped that health security would be the other half of the social security system,\u201d Clinton gently beseeched the committee, chaired by Michigan Rep. John Dingell. \u201cBut political realities forced President Roosevelt to discard that dream and the result, as we know, has been ongoing insecurity for millions of hardworking Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton plan was a disaster. It was criticized for being developed in secret and for being too complicated, but mostly, it was killed by a health-insurance-industry-funded ad campaign featuring a couple that\u2019s since become iconic in political advertising: Harry and Louise. The two were featured in a series of advertisements, sitting around a kitchen table, examining their bills. \u201cHaving choices we don\u2019t like is like no choice,\u201d Louise tells Harry. \u201cThey choose,\u201d Harry responds. To which Louise adds. \u201cWe lose.\u201d\n\nAfter that ad campaign, the Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress. For the rest of the 1990\u2019s, attempting massive reform became an object lesson in what not to do.\n\nWhen she came to New York in 1999 to run for U.S. Senate, Clinton carried that lesson with her. \u201cYou may recall that I have had some thoughts about health care and health care reform in the past,\u201d Clinton wryly told an audience at Bassett College in Cooperstown in July of that year, on a \u201clistening tour\u201d of the state.\n\n\u201cI remain committed to the idea of providing quality affordable health care to every American, but I now come from the school of smaller steps,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cSmaller steps\u201d became the buzzwords of that campaign. But by 2004, she was ready to raise comprehensive reform, again. \u201cNow Can We Talk About Health Care?\u201d was the title of a cover story she wrote for the New York Times Magazine.\n\n\u201cI learned the hard way that unless we have a consensus not only in the political system but among employers and citizens, we cannot withstand the overwhelming influence of the special interests,\u201d Clinton told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer on his show, days after that story appeared.\n\n\u201cThe system is broken,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut there are a lot of people who make a ton of money from it and they are not easily persuaded to act in the common good or even for the sustainability of the system which has been so profitable for them.\u201d\n\nBy 2007, Hillary Clinton was running for president and her first stop as a candidate was a health care clinic. By February of 2008, when only Clinton and Senator Barack Obama were left in the race, the substance of their health care plans was a subject of major debate.\n\nThe campaign had come to Ohio and Texas (which Clinton would win, before losing the nomination). Then, as now, the campaigning had gotten rough. The Obama camp had sent out a mailer against Clinton\u2019s health plan in Ohio, which Clinton said \u201ccould have been written by Republicans or the health insurance industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference between Senator Obama and myself is I know from the work I have done on health care for many years that if everyone is not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do what is called cherry picking, pick those who get insurance and leave others out,\u201d Clinton said as she sat in uneasy proximity to Obama on a debate stage.\n\n\u201cI have no objection to Senator Clinton thinking her approach is superior,\u201d Obama dug back. \u201cBut if, as we have heard tonight, we still don\u2019t know how Senator Clinton intends to enforce a mandate...then we have a situation that you can see right now in the state of Massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choosing to accept the fine because they still can\u2019t afford it even with the subsidies.\u201d\n\nObama, as we know, won the election. He appointed Clinton to be his Secretary of State. To write his health care plan, his team tapped Neera Tanden, formerly Clinton\u2019s chief policy advisor, who\u2019d written the plan Obama had once objected to so much.\n\nEmails released by the State Department between Clinton and Tanden show Clinton keeping a close eye on the bill\u2019s progress. In January 2010 (when Clinton was otherwise fully absorbed with reacting to the earthquake in Haiti), the Democrats had just lost the Senate seat held by the late Ted Kennedy. \u201cWhat\u2019s Plan B?\u201d Clinton wrote in an email to Tanden, who now heads the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nTanden sent back a lengthy response including (an ultimately rejected) option of stripping down the bill before sending it back to Congress. She ended her multi-page missive with a note: \u201cThe Massachusetts loss is so confoundingly stupid I don\u2019t even know how to wrap my head around it. I mean, there are no other races right now.\u201d\n\nOnce the Affordable Care Act passed, Tanden gloated a bit, that it had been the plan Clinton wanted all along, with an individual mandate. As Ben Smith put it in a Politico story that Tanden forwarded to Clinton: \u201cA year later, Hillary wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the central health care policy debate of the Democratic primary,\u201d Smith wrote, \u201cObama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble Clinton\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to last Sunday night\u2019s debate, when Clinton could not possibly have been more laudatory of President Obama. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe have the Affordable Care Act; that is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\u201d\n\nClinton couldn\u2019t say publicly what the emails say privately \u2014 that what passed was her bill, not Obama\u2019s, or at least not the one he\u2019d hugged so tightly in his 2008 campaign.\n\nInstead, in an emotional appeal to Democrats, Clinton is giving all the credit for the Affordable Care Act to Obama. \u201cThere are things we can do to improve it but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that debate \u2014 I think is the wrong direction!\u201d Clinton said in a fiery stem-winder.\n\nClinton is making the case that she is the one who can carry on the legacy of President Obama, a figure whose favorability is at 93 percent among Democrats, even higher among African Americans.\n\nWith Bernie Sanders leading by a wide margin in New Hampshire and drawing Iowa polls to a tie, Clinton's political life depends on her landing the argument that in the real world, where you have to work with Republicans, you need to make sausage, not break eggs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton is hoping to win the 2016 campaign by crediting Obama for a health care plan she developed.",
