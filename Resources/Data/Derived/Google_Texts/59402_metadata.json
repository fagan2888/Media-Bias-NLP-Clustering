The agency initially estimated the cost for Terremark\u2019s IT support at $10.8 million, but has since altered the contract 15 times.\n\nThe latest three changes came last month. They added more IT infrastructure in \u201cpreparation of anticipated traffic\u201d for the open enrollment deadline on March 31.\n\nA contract for \u201cCloud Computing Infrastructure Expansion\u201d detailed the thirteenth and fourteenth changes the administration has made in its deal with Terremark.\n\n\u201cCMS required additional cloud computing services and support over and above that contemplated at the time of the award,\u201d the document said.\n\nThe first change\u2014\u201cModification 00013\u201d\u2014was required to \u201cimprove performance of the Marketplace\u201d at a cost of $890,383.94.\n\n\u201cModification 00014\u201d was awarded on Feb. 17, providing cloud computing service and storage. The services cost $1,514,012.02.\n\n\u201cCMS executed Mod 00014 to obtain technology infrastructure and software requirements in preparation of anticipated traffic increase for the last month of open enrollment,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe agency also placed an order for a firewall upgrade, which included $56,782 worth of CISCO equipment. The additional services and equipment cost $2,461,177.96 overall.\n\n\u201cCMS could not have anticipated the need to add these additional services,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe modification was needed to obtain on-site support at the [Exchange Operations Center] XOC to improve efficiencies and communications with other Exchange contractors.\u201d\n\n\u201cCMS experienced a surge of traffic on the healthcare.gov website and exceeded the maximum limits on the number of concurrent users,\u201d they said. \u201cCMS believed if the additional were not added urgently, the Exchanges would not function as designed and citizens would continue to have issues using the Marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe agency said it could not order the equipment under the normal competitive bidding process because it must implement the law. \u201cCMS is not in a position to take the time to compete the added capacity requirements and successfully implement the exchange program as mandated by law\u201d\n\nWith the most recent additions, Terremark\u2019s contract for IT support has reached $62,409,776.87.\n\nThe administration is in its final push to encourage Americans to sign up for insurance on Healthcare.gov, and is holding events to target \u201cwomen bloggers\u201d and young Hispanic women this week. Much of its focus has been on getting young people to sign up, with poor results.\n\nRoughly four million people have signed up for health insurance through Obamacare as of late February, still well short of the administration\u2019s goal of 7 million.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ordered $2.5 million worth of IT equipment to prepare for \u201canticipated traffic\u201d during the last month of open enrollment on Healthcare.gov, accord", "title": "HHS Buys $2.5 Million Worth of IT Equipment for Obamacare\u2019s Final Enrollment Month", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/hhs-buys-2-5-million-worth-of-it-equipment-for-obamacares-final-enrollment-month/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ordered $2.5 million worth of IT equipment to prep", "title": "HHS Buys $2.5 Million Worth of IT Equipment for Obamacare\u2019s Final Enrollment Month", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "creator": "@LizWFB", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd917\"", "article_summary": "The additional services and equipment cost $2,461,177.96 overall.\n\u201cCMS required additional cloud computing services and support over and above that contemplated at the time of the award,\u201d the document said.\n\u201cCMS could not have anticipated the need to add these additional services,\u201d the agency said.\nThe agency initially estimated the cost for Terremark\u2019s IT support at $10.8 million, but has since altered the contract 15 times.\nThe services cost $1,514,012.02."}
