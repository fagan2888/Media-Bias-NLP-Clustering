Many people don't realize that,\" said Jen Aulwes, communications director for Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota.\n\nThe failure rate of long-acting reversible methods is less than 1 percent, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a which aims to provide reliable, balanced, nonpartisan information on sexual activity, contraception, abortion and childbearing.\n\nThe rate is low because it doesn't require user interaction, such as taking a pill daily or properly using a condom.\n\nTypical use of birth control pills is effective 91 percent of the time, and the typical use of condoms is effective 82 percent of the time.\n\nCondom use is still recommended because it is the only form of birth control that protects against sexually transmitted disease.\n\nPut another way, fewer than one in 100 women using an IUD or an implant will become pregnant during the first year of typical use, which is in the same range as that for sterilization, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Over the long term, long-acting methods are 20 times more effective than birth control pills, the patch, or the ring.\n\nIn recent years, Planned Parenthood has seen a huge increase in the number of people requesting long-term methods, Aulwes said.\n\nIn the U.S. during the last decade, the use of long-acting reversible birth control grew by 380 percent, from 1.5 percent in 2002 to 7.2 percent in 2011-2013.\n\nUse declined in the mid-80s and remained stable through 2002.\n\nSt. Cloud followed that trend.\n\nBuy Photo Nurse Megan Holderness and Dr. Julie Anderson talk about the Nexplanon implant IUD device Thursday at St. Cloud Medical Group offices. (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com)\n\nIn 2011, patients at the St. Cloud Planned Parenthood used 75 implants and 73 IUDs. In 2014, patients used 158 implants and 101 IUDs. In total, that's a 75 percent increase during that time.\n\nIn the past, women were told that if you didn't have children or were a young person, IUDs weren't a good method.\n\n\"That's just not true. They're incredibly effective for young people,\" Aulwes said.\n\nThe passage of the Affordable Care Act removed one sizable hurdle from the use of long-acting contraception.\n\n\"The up-front cost could be a big barrier,\" Aulwes said, at $1,000 or more. Now many women can get these methods without having to pay their insurance deductible or a copay.\n\nFor people who can't afford it or are uninsured, Planned Parenthood and other communities can often help.\n\nOf course, no one method is one-size fits all. It depends on a number of factors.\n\nA common experience staff at Planned Parenthood hear is that women don't feel like they're given all their birth control options when visiting their regular obstetrician or general practitioner.\n\nIt's important for providers to sit down and talk with the woman about what would be the best for her.\n\n\"One method isn't going to work for everyone,\" she said.\n\nAnd your preferences can change as life circumstances do.\n\n\"Definitely as your life changes, you may need or want different methods,\" she said. Age and health issues are among the factors that make a difference.\n\nNationally, women aged 25-34 use long-term contraceptives the most, about twice as much as their counterparts in the 15-24 and 35-44 age groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWomen who have had at least one birth use long-term contraception at a higher rate compared with women with no previous births.\n\nThey are effective and safe and reversible. And they've changed with the times.\n\n\"It's not your mother's or your grandmother's IUD,\" said Dr. Julie Anderson, who works in family medicine at the St. Cloud Medical Group.\n\nThe newer options are more hormonally directed tools.\n\nMany of the hormonal methods use lower doses than in decades past.\n\n\"The understanding of what the needs really are for contraception has really changed,\" she said.\n\n\"The majority of the medical community would consider these very safe,\" she said. There are risks and benefits with everything we do to our bodies, she says.\n\nRisk of blood clot only occurs in products with estrogen. There is not much evidence either way with progesterone.\n\nThe hormones not only inhibit ovulation but also thicken mucus so sperm never gets a chance to get to the eggs. It also keeps the lining of the uterus thick, which makes it less likely a fertilized egg will attach. It does not interfere with implantation of a fertilized egg, she said.\n\nBuy Photo A sample of several IUD options available. (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com)\n\nAnderson said her patients are using long-acting methods for more than contraception. They can help with irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, headches and other issues.\n\nAnderson says she's been putting more in place to help with perimenopausal bleeding.\n\n\"It's dramatically decreased the need for hysterectomies in women because of heavy bleeding problems,\" she said.\n\nThose who choose hormonal implants in the arm are finding it done with a device that keeps people from injecting it too deeply into the muscle.\n\nA lot of college-age women request the implant.\n\n\"Because it's easy. It takes literally 30 seconds to put in in the office, compared to the IUD, which is a little uncomfortable to place,\" she said.\n\nAnd you don't notice it's there unless you feel for it. It's not visible and there's no way for it to move, Anderson said.\n\nRegardless, long-acting reversible birth control could be a good option for many women.\n\nAulwes says patients should ask about methods, even if they've shied away from them in the past, as the methods and the cost may have changed.\n\nWhat should you think about when choosing a birth control method?\n\nIs your menstrual cycle an issue ?\n\nDo you get heavy bleeding, lots of cramping or other issues that affect your life?\n\nDo you plan to have a baby in the next month, three months, year, etc.?\n\nHow soon do you expect that to change?\n\nDo you prefer to get your menstrual cycle every month?\n\nAny complications with other health issues?\n\nSource: Jen Aulwes, communications director for Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota; Dr. Julie Anderson of the St. Cloud Medical Group.\n\nBy the numbers ...\n\nThe CDC released a report earlier this year on the use of long-acting, reversible contraception methods among women in the U.S. It found that use of long-acting methods increased nearly fivefold in the last decade among women aged 15-44, from 1.5 percent in 2002 to 7.2 percent in 2011-2013.\n\nWomen's health providers are three and a half times more likely to use an IUD or implant than the general population, according to a Planned Parenthood study. That's 42 percent of women\u2019s health care providers, compared to just 12 percent of women in the general population.\n\nSince 2009, Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota clinics have seen a 182 percent increase in the use of IUDs and implants.\n\nThose clinics saw IUD use increasing 87 percent and contraceptive implants growing 582 percent.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Planned Parenthood saw a 35 percent increase in patients with contraceptive implants and a 25 percent increase in patients with IUDs.\n\nIn 2011, patients at the St. Cloud Planned Parenthood used 75 implants and 73 IUDs. In 2014, patients used 158 implants and 101 IUDs. In total, that's a 75 percent increase during that time.\n\nLong-acting, reversible birth control methods\n\nAn overview of long-acting reversible methods. Consult your medical provider for more detailed information.\n\nIUDs\n\nHormonal IUDs\n\nIncludes brand names: Skyla, which lasts for three years, and Mirena, which lasts for five years. Both use levonorgestrel.\n\nOther uses: Approved to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. Mirena can reduce bleeding up to 90 percent after six months.\n\nCopper IUDs\n\nWorks like spermicide and prevents fertilization. No effects on the menstrual cycle.\n\n\u200bApproved for use up to 10 years.\n\nBenefits:\n\nOnce it is in place, you do not have to do anything else to prevent pregnancy.\n\nNo one can tell that you are using birth control.\n\nIt does not interfere with sex or daily activities.\n\nIt can be inserted immediately after an abortion, a miscarriage, or childbirth and while breastfeeding.\n\nAlmost all women are able to use an IUD.\n\nIf you wish to become pregnant or if you want to stop using it, you can simply have the IUD removed.\n\nThe hormonal IUD helps decrease menstrual pain and heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\nThe copper IUD also is the most effective form of emergency contraception.\n\nSide effects:\n\nWith the copper IUD, menstrual pain and bleeding may increase. Bleeding between periods may occur. Both effects are common in the first few months of use. Pain and heavy bleeding usually decrease within one year of use. Both hormonal IUDs may cause spotting and irregular bleeding in the first 3\u20136 months of use. The amount of menstrual bleeding and the length of the menstrual period usually decrease over time. Menstrual pain also usually decreases.\n\nA few women also may have side effects related to the hormones in these IUDs. These side effects may include headaches, nausea, depression, and breast tenderness.\n\nRisks:\n\nThe IUD may come out of the uterus. This happens in about 5 percent of users in the first year of using the IUD.\n\nThe IUD can pierce the wall of the uterus during insertion. It is rare and occurs in only about 1 out of every 1,000 insertions.\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes. The disease may cause scarring in the reproductive organs, which may make it harder to become pregnant later. The risk of the disease is only slightly increased in the first 20 days after insertion of an IUD, but the overall risk still is low (fewer than 1 in 100 women).\n\nRarely, pregnancy may occur while a woman is using an IUD.\n\nIn the rare case that a pregnancy occurs with the IUD in place, there is a higher chance that it will be an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nImplant\n\nFlexible rods about the size of a match stick are inserted into your upper arm. They are small and flexible.\n\nIt releases progestin into the system stopping ovulation. It works for up to three years, thickens the mucus of the cervix and keeps the lining of the uterus thin.\n\nSide effects:\n\nThe most common side effect of the implant is unpredictable bleeding. For some women, these bleeding patterns improve over time. Some women have less menstrual pain while using the implant. In some women, bleeding stops completely. Other common side effects include mood changes, headaches, acne, and depression. Some women have reported weight gain while using the implant, but it is not clear whether it is related to the implant.\n\nRisks:\n\nPossible risks include problems with insertion or removal of the implant. These problems occur in less than 2% of women. Although rare, if a woman becomes pregnant while the implant is inserted, there is a slightly increased risk that it will be an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nThe shot\n\nDepo-Provera. It protects against pregnancy for three months as a time, using progestin.\n\nCan cause bone-thinning.\n\nPatch or ring:\n\nBrand name: Nuva Ring, inserted into vagina. Leave in for three weeks, then take out.\n\nSource: WebMD.\n\nFollow Stephanie Dickrell on Twitter @SctimesSteph, call her at 255-8749 or find more stories at www.sctimes.com/sdickrell.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/life/wellness/2015/11/07/not-your-grandmothers-iud/74732582/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Long-acting birth control offers safe, effective options, provide more than contraception", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Long-acting birth control offers safe, effective options, provide more than contraception", "title": "More turn to IUDs", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/life/wellness/2015/11/07/not-your-grandmothers-iud/74732582/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Long-acting birth control offers safe, effective options, provide more than contraception", "title": "More turn to IUDs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6f290b3e3fd2a74c6e51b66a074a9d1b86c31272/c=0-835-2400-3235&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/04/StCloud/StCloud/635822485473999199-IUDs-1.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/sctimessteph"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "birth control, contraception, conception, birth, babies, parenting, women, women's choices, reproductive health, reproductions, sex, St. Cloud, Central Minnesota, St. Cloud Medical Group, long-acting reversible birth control, Planned Parenthood"}, "article_summary": "Long-acting, reversible birth control methodsAn overview of long-acting reversible methods.\nCondom use is still recommended because it is the only form of birth control that protects against sexually transmitted disease.\nOver the long term, long-acting methods are 20 times more effective than birth control pills, the patch, or the ring.\n(Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com)Anderson said her patients are using long-acting methods for more than contraception.\nIn the U.S. during the last decade, the use of long-acting reversible birth control grew by 380 percent, from 1.5 percent in 2002 to 7.2 percent in 2011-2013."}
