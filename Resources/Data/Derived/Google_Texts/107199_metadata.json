Tom Cole's Flickr\n\nNearly four years, 47 failed repeal votes, and one Supreme Court loss after Obamacare became the law of the land, opponents of health care reform aren\u2019t done. And according to a leading GOP congressman, they \u201cnever\u201d will be.\n\nAppearing on NPR\u2019s post-State of the Union coverage Tuesday night, Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) was asked by host Robert Siegel whether Republicans would end their quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Cole, a close ally of House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-OH), laughed off the suggestion. \u201cI think Republicans are never going to stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he told Siegel.\n\nSIEGEL: He appealed for an end to votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Do you think that\u2019s behind us now, that indeed Republicans might be better with the Affordable Care Act in place to run against in November? COLE: [Laughter] I think Republicans are never going to stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Look, that\u2019s something that\u2019s not popular, no Republican voted for it. Frankly all the polling suggests it\u2019s become progressively less popular over the last several months so I doubt that that\u2019s going to disappear but I also think you have to recognize political reality. There\u2019s a Democratic senate, the president\u2019s not likely to accept the repeal of his signature issue.\n\nListen to it:\n\nDespite Cole\u2019s assertion that Republicans will never give up their zeal for repeal, some cracks are beginning to appear in the GOP\u2019s opposition to Obamacare. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who credits Obamacare with inspiring him to run for the Senate in 2010, exhorted his Party this month to \u201crecognize th[e] reality\u201d that \u201cwe have to deal with the people that are currently covered under ObamaCare.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just a piece of paper that you can repeal and it goes away,\u201d Johnson told the New York Times.\n\nIndeed, even in the Republicans\u2019 State of the Union response, Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers (R-WA) didn\u2019t call for full repeal of the landmark health care law, instead acknowledging that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t go back to the way things were.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
