Mike Fitzpatrick is getting some help from a former Congressional colleague.\n\nThe Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC (ARS PAC) is releasing a new ad in support of Fitzpatrick as well as a poll that shows him favored to win re-election.\n\nARS PAC is run by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and her husband NASA astronaut Mark Kelly. The organization was set up after Giffords was famously seriously wounded by an assassin in January 2011.\n\nThe group endorsed Fitzpatrick back in June and had previously indicated it would mobilize to support those candidates it backed.\n\nAd\n\n\u201cCongressman Mike Fitzpatrick isn\u2019t afraid to lead,\u201d the narrator of the commercial asserts. \u201cHe\u2019s working with Democrats and Republicans to keep us safe from gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe thirty-second spot praises Fitzpatrick for authoring a bill to keep guns out of the hands of the mental ill (H.R. 329) as well as co-sponsoring a bill an act to prevent stalkers and domestic abusers from purchasing firearms (H.R. 1565).\n\n\u201cWe can get it right,\u201d the narrator concludes. \u201cIt just takes a leader. Like Mike Fitzpatrick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more bipartisan leaders like Mike Fitzpatrick in Congress \u2013 leaders who aren\u2019t afraid to stand up to powerful special interests and to stand up for commonsense solutions to gun violence,\u201d said Hayley Zachary, Executive Director of Americans for Responsible Solutions. \u201dBy reaching across the aisle to cosponsor legislation to close loopholes on gun sales, Congressman Fitzpatrick was not only showing some leadership, but reflecting the reasonable views of his constituents.\u201d\n\nARS PAC also explained that this is a six-figure buy that will air in the Philadelphia TV market on broadcast and cable for at least the next two weeks.\n\nPoll\n\nIn addition to the ad, the organization also conducted a poll of the race, the first publicly-released survey so far.\n\nThey found Fitzpatrick leading Democratic opponent Kevin Strouse by a 60%-30% margin. Among voters with knowledge of both candidates, however, the incumbent\u2019s lead shrinks to 57%-32%. Just 40% of respondents were aware of both candidates, a number that is likely to increase as Strouse has just started airing his own campaign spot.\n\nThe group\u2019s survey shows Fitzpatrick with high favorability (63% to 21%) and job approval (64% to 25%) ratings.\n\nAmong the other results found by the ARS PAC poll are:\n\n90% of PA-8 voters support universal background checks and 88% back the prevention of sales to domestic abusers\n\n57% believe gun laws should be made stronger compared to 34% who think they should be kept as they are now\n\nVoters prefer a generic Republican over a generic Democrat on the congressional ballot by a three point, 43%-40%, margin\n\nTom Wolf and Mike Stack lead Tom Corbett and Bucks native Jim Cawley 46% to 43%\n\nNow, there are several large caveats that should be taken into consideration when reading the results of this poll.\n\nAny survey conducted by an interest group should receive increased scrutiny. For instance, the PAC didn\u2019t release the wording of the questions that they asked respondents or the demographic crosstabs. Also, the narrow lead for Tom Wolf in a competitive congressional district contrasts with his large statewide advantage. Finally, it could be argued it is in the group\u2019s interest to produce results that show the candidate they are supporting is doing well.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Strouse campaign isn\u2019t buying the poll results.\n\n\u201cRepublican pollsters don\u2019t exactly have a good track record over the past few cycles,\u201d Strouse Campaign Manager Brendan McPhillips said. \u201cAmerican Viewpoint\u2013the Republican firm used in this poll\u2013is no different. One only needs to see that they have Corbett trailing Wolf by only 3 points here when he is down 25 points statewide as proof of how ludicrous this poll is. To say that this poll is a joke would be a generous statement.\u201d\n\nMcPhillips went on to dispute Fitzpatrick\u2019s record and laid out his own candidate\u2019s views on gun control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Americans for Responsible Solutions would be misled into supporting an empty suit who has played gun violence prevention advocates by casually attaching his name to a bill that he didn\u2019t lift a finger to even get a committee hearing on, let alone a vote,\u201d McPhillips continued.\n\n\u201cKevin Strouse would be a strong advocate for comprehensive background checks and improving our mental health system to prevent tragedies like the ones that occurred in Arizona and Sandy Hook. Kevin also believes that leadership means more than offering empty words followed by no meaningful action, and it is shameful that this dysfunctional Republican Congress was unable to make progress on an issue supported by 90% of Americans.\u201d\n\nSeptember 18th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 6 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The group, which is dedicated to sensible gun control measures, is throwing its support behind Rep.
