Regarding to the Republicans' latest attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I would like to briefly point out why this act is necessary for so many working Americans.

I am the hard-working owner of a small business and have found myself, like millions of Americans, having to switch health insurance plans through no fault of my own. I had very good insurance until I was divorced against my wishes. It has been three years since then, at which point COBRA expires.

Meanwhile, I have developed significant medical problems, which before the Affordable Care Act would have prevented me from being able to buy my own insurance at all. My health issues prevent me from seeking a full-time job with benefits. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I finally have a decent plan with relatively reasonable premiums and don't have to lose sleep wondering how my medical bills will be paid.

I invite anyone opposing the meager but necessary Affordable Care Act to take on the enormous bills I would incur should this act be repealed, as well as those of the millions of others currently finding relief.
