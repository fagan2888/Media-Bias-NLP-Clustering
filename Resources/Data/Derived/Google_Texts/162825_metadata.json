Much confusion exists over the lawsuit my office recently filed against the IRS, similar to the confusion over the Affordable Care Act itself. Simply put, our lawsuit seeks a declaration by the court as to what the law means and how it affects state government.\n\nWe raise these questions respectfully, but since litigation is adversarial by nature some view this as an extension of political arguments in Washington D.C. regarding the ACA. Our case is part of the constitutional process by which new laws are tested and our judicial branch interprets their meaning. Obtaining a conclusive answer from the judiciary is important so that as the state\u2019s lawyer I can provide proper legal advice to my government clients.\n\nState government does not pay federal income taxes and the federal government does not pay state income taxes. This is called intergovernmental tax immunity, part of dual sovereignty and a bedrock of our constitutional system. As an employer, state government withholds taxes from the compensation we pay our employees who owe state and federal taxes. But state government itself does not fill out an IRS income tax form.\n\nSo when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was constitutional under Congress\u2019 authority to impose taxes, it naturally raised the question whether states also would be subjected to the ACA employer mandate\u2019s tax penalties. The IRS now seeks to impose tax authority over state government. If that occurs, it would significantly alter the relationship between the federal government and states in a negative way.\n\nMy office does not represent individuals or private sector employers but rather the sovereign authority of Indiana. When we realized state government could face tens of millions of dollars in IRS tax penalties if even one part-time state employee was misclassified in their benefits-eligibility category, I decided to proactively bring this question to the courts, rather than wait for the state to be hit with an enormous tax bill \u2013 a penalty that would only serve to transfer state and local tax dollars to the federal IRS.\n\nWe seek relief from the employer mandate for state government and schools; but it will be up to the court to structure a remedy. Our lawsuit does not challenge the ability of citizens to shop for insurance coverage using the new federal exchange or to insure young people on their parents\u2019 plans to age 26; it asks whether the IRS is correctly interpreting the ACA statute Congress passed.\n\nAs attorney general, my obligation is to defend our state\u2019s authority and the decisions of our state\u2019s policymakers. Usually this means defending the state when it is sued by plaintiffs. But from time to time the state must initiate its own lawsuits challenging federal actions that infringe upon our state\u2019s authority. This is one of those rare occasions.\n\nGreg Zoeller is attorney general of Indiana and a Republican.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "article_summary": "State government does not pay federal income taxes and the federal government does not pay state income taxes.\nAs attorney general, my obligation is to defend our state\u2019s authority and the decisions of our state\u2019s policymakers.\nAs an employer, state government withholds taxes from the compensation we pay our employees who owe state and federal taxes.\nBut from time to time the state must initiate its own lawsuits challenging federal actions that infringe upon our state\u2019s authority.\nBy Greg ZoellerIndiana Attorney GeneralCan the IRS require Indiana\u2019s state government to pay a tax penalty just like any other employer?"}
