This Thursday at 1 p.m. EST, Elizabeth Gilbert will lead The Wall Street Journal Book Club‘s live discussion about Hilary Mantel’s “Wolf Hall.” Join us to find out why Ms. Gilbert calls “Wolf Hall” “the best book of the century” and what the book taught her about writing historical fiction.

“I don’t think of this as a historical novel, I think of it as a contemporary novel, a really contemporary novel, like she’s on the cutting edge of the best writing that you can be doing in the 21st century,” Ms. Gilbert says. “It just happens that she set it in the past.”

Hilary Mantel will also be answering questions from readers. Please submit your questions about the novel using the form below, or send questions through our book club Facebook group or on Twitter with the hashtag #WSJbookclub.
