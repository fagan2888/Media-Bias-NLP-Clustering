Rather than succumb to the myth of reinvention, we would do well to explore the myriad ways our accumulated skills and lessons\u2014the failures along with the more uplifting moments\u2014can come together to contribute to a new purpose, a second act that provides both means and meaning.\n\nA related mistake is to blithely assume that transitions are quick.\n\nFresh starts invariably involve false starts and detours. Lots of them. They can also involve fallow periods \u2013 long stretches where not much happens and life gets in the way. You have a few meetings with a coach and commit to taking a few steps every week. Maybe you read a book and underline a few passages that resonate. Then you stall. You get called into an eldercare emergency or take a little break from your \u201cnext act\u201d project. You recover, set up a few informational interviews and sign up for a conference. You\u2019re back on a roll, and sign up to a pro bono consulting project. Maybe you enjoy the work and being part of a team, but realize you\u2019re less interested in working on the organization\u2019s issues than you thought. But someone you met in that project recommends you for a board and before you know it, you\u2019re now jumping into that role. And on it goes, in sinuous and fitful fashion\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this go on for months, even years, before a person settles into the work that ends up nourishing them for a long stretch. I\u2019ve also seen those explorations become the work itself, a time of life that involves immersing deeply for six months to a year in one undertaking, and then moving on to a new project. The encore career that emerges is comprised of many chapters, but contains an underlying coherence as well.\n\nMarc Freedman is CEO and founder of Encore.org, a nonprofit organization working to promote encore careers\u2014second acts for the greater good.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "I see two common mistakes.", "title": "You Don\u2019t Have to Reinvent Yourself in Your Second Career", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/01/16/you-dont-have-to-reinvent-yourself-in-your-second-career/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "You Don\u2019t Have to Reinvent Yourself in Your Second Career", "description": "I see two common mistakes.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "I see two common mistakes.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-16T15:13:28-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/01/16/you-dont-have-to-reinvent-yourself-in-your-second-career/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-2138", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "I see two common mistakes.", "title": "You Don\u2019t Have to Reinvent Yourself in Your Second Career", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/01/16/you-dont-have-to-reinvent-yourself-in-your-second-career/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-2138", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-16T15:28:36-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd5e\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s the biggest mistake people make when it comes to starting a second career?\nThe encore career that emerges is comprised of many chapters, but contains an underlying coherence as well.\nMarc Freedman is CEO and founder of Encore.org, a nonprofit organization working to promote encore careers\u2014second acts for the greater good.\nYou\u2019re back on a roll, and sign up to a pro bono consulting project.\nBut someone you met in that project recommends you for a board and before you know it, you\u2019re now jumping into that role."}
