Tobacco smoke has been linked to adverse health effects, such as lung and oral cancer, though that's not why Costco did it. Instead, the company said the decision was more about business than public health.\n\n\"Tobacco is a very low margin business, tends to have higher theft and is labor intensive in some cases (due to local municipality regulations) \u2014 further, we felt we could better use the space to merchandise other items,\" a spokesman from Costco told The Street.\n\nAccording to The Street, Costco officials first hinted at the ban during a call with analysts, where they said tobacco sales had fallen to a \"low double digit.\" The company hasn\u2019t made an official announcement because \"[press releases] are a waste of money.\"\n\nThe retail giant\u2019s move is another blow to the tobacco industry, which has seen a significant drop in the percentage of Americans who smoke in the past 50 years. In 2014, the smoking rate hit an all-time low of 17.8 percent, and the rate is still dropping, The Huffington Post reported. Not to mention other retailers have quit selling these kinds of products, too.\n\nIn 1996, Target was the first large retail store to stop selling cigarettes, citing costs related to efforts to keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors, The New York Times reported. In 2014, CVS also stopped selling cigarettes in its 7,600 of its pharmacies nationwide. However, unlike Costco and Target, CVS said its decision was an effort to \"help people on their path to better health.\"\n\n\"CVS Caremark is continually looking for ways to promote health and reduce the burden of disease,\" CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen A. Brennan previously said in a statement. \"Stopping the sale of cigarettes and tobacco will make a significant difference in reducing the chronic illnesses associated with tobacco use.\"\n\nCigarette use is responsible for the deaths of more than 480,000 people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite the many studies and graphic anti-smoking ads shedding light on the cancers and diseases associated with the habit, more than 20 percent of men and more than 15 percent of women in the United States still light up.\n\nCVS\u2019 ban did lead to a 1 percent decrease in cigarette sales, so who's to say Costco's elimination won't have a similar effect?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "costco, wholesale, stop, selling, tobacco, products, hundreds, locations", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The company felt it could better use the space to merchandise other items, according to a spokesman.", "title": "Costco Stores Quit Selling Cigarettes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/costco-wholesale-tobacco-products-cigarettes-378622", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/20/costco.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The company felt it could better use the space to merchandise other items, according to a spokesman.", "title": "Costco Stores Quit Selling Cigarettes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/costco-wholesale-tobacco-products-cigarettes-378622", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/20/costco.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/20/costco.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-03-20T18:41:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-20T18:41:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The company felt it could better use the space to merchandise other items, according to a spokesman."}, "article_summary": "Tobacco smoke has been linked to adverse health effects, such as lung and oral cancer, though that's not why Costco did it.\nHowever, unlike Costco and Target, CVS said its decision was an effort to \"help people on their path to better health.\"\nIn 2014, CVS also stopped selling cigarettes in its 7,600 of its pharmacies nationwide.\n\"Stopping the sale of cigarettes and tobacco will make a significant difference in reducing the chronic illnesses associated with tobacco use.\"\nThe New York Daily News reported the retailer has spent the past few years quietly phasing tobacco products out of nearly 300 stores; there are 488 in total."}
