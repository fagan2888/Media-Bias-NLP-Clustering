It\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might think.\n\nIf the disease does pop up here, it will be a big deal \u2014 but probably not as nightmarish as you might imagine.\n\nFirst of all, virtually no public health or infectious disease specialists think an imported case of Ebola could touch off an outbreak.\n\nThat\u2019s because the virus is not spread through the air (except perhaps by certain medical procedures which generate sprays of virus-containing droplets). People can catch it only if they\u2019re exposed to bodily fluids of obviously sick Ebola victims.\n\nNo airport screening program could detect such silent infections.\n\nMoreover, U.S. medical personnel have the training and equipment to prevent its spread, and public health experts know how to identify and isolate contagious patients and track down close contacts who might have been exposed.\n\nStill, against the increasingly dire backdrop of West Africa\u2019s epidemic, Boston\u2019s 20 hospitals, two dozen community health centers, public health officials and others have been preparing since August for the possibility that Ebola could appear here.\n\n\u201cMy husband calls it the Ebolacoaster,\u201d says Dr. Sharon Wright, director of infection control at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, speaking of the intense back-to-back \u201cwhat-if\u201d planning sessions.\n\nThe risk of an imported case of Ebola, Wright says in an interview, \u201cis probably more than I would have thought a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\nA Silent Infection\n\nBoston\u2019s not alone. Health centers across the country are sorting out Ebola preparedness plans at a feverish pace. \u201cEbola doesn\u2019t pose a health risk to the U.S. public, but we\u2019re taking precautions at home,\u201d Dr.Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on a conference call Tuesday.\n\nOne complication specific to the Ebola virus is that it can take up to three weeks after someone is infected before symptoms appear.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s entirely plausible that someone gets on a plane in West Africa and arrives here from other points of entry from the U.S. or abroad,\u201d says Dr. Larry Madoff, director of epidemiology and immunization at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \u201cThey can be perfectly healthy while they\u2019re traveling and come down with the disease once here.\u201d\n\nNo airport screening program could detect such silent infections.\n\nReality Check\n\nEarlier this month one research team put the risk of an imported Ebola case in North America at somewhere between 1 and 18 percent by the end of September, based on analysis of air traffic from West Africa to the rest of the world.\n\nThe risk has undoubtedly declined since then as commercial flights to and from Ebola-affected countries have been curtailed by an estimated 70 percent.\n\n\u201cThat just delays the international spread,\u201d says Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University, a co-author of the analysis. \u201cIt might not happen in September or October. But perhaps in November. We have to expect the importation of cases as the number of cases in West Africa grows quickly.\u201d\n\nAnd those numbers are soaring exponentially. A CDC analysis published Tuesday predicts as many as 1.4 million cases of Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone by Jan. 20, 2015, if a crash campaign to control the epidemic doesn\u2019t get at least 70 percent of victims into effective treatment in the next month or two. Currently only about 18 percent of Liberian victims are believed to be getting care that minimizes the chance of spread, and about 40 percent of Sierra Leone victims.\n\nBoston\u2019s role in the medical relief campaign could expose this area to a higher risk of Ebola importation. Medical volunteers, such as those organized by Boston-based Partners in Health, are traveling to and from affected countries at an increasing rate.\n\n\u201cAs we see more people go over, the possibility that people coming back might develop Ebola gets higher,\u201d Wright says.\n\n\u201cIt is still a low-likelihood event. If the recommended precautions are followed, there should not be any exposures and therefore no illnesses in health care workers,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHowever, the personal protective equipment is hot and uncomfortable, and sometimes hard to remove, so there is the chance that people may make mistakes.\u201d\n\nA Focus On Health Workers and College Kids\n\nDr. Anita Barry of the Boston Public Health Commission says medical volunteers may get exposed to the virus without realizing it. \u201cIf we see Ebola, I think it\u2019s going to be most likely in health care workers who have gone to volunteer over there,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s one group we have to pay attention to.\u201d\n\nAt least health care workers \u201cknow how to monitor their symptoms,\u201d Northeastern\u2019s Vespignani notes, and would most likely quarantine themselves if signs of Ebola infection appeared.\n\nBut Ebola might appear in Boston through other routes. Local colleges and universities have students and faculty with connections to West Africa. And the area has communities of West African immigrants. If someone from these groups inadvertently brought the virus here, the infection might be wrongly perceived as a simple cold or flu.\n\nSo community health centers and university clinics are being warned to look out for anyone with a history of travel to West Africa and symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained bleeding or bruising.\n\nBoston EMTs are undergoing training to transport any suspected Ebola patient without getting exposed themselves. And if someone balks at being taken to the hospital, Barry of the Public Health Commission says, \u201cI can give them authorization\u201d to transport involuntarily.\n\nTaking Precautions\n\nBoston hospitals are also making plans in the event they have to care for patients with Ebola.\n\n\u201cWe would close part of a wing \u2014 four or five beds,\u201d says Beth Israel\u2019s Sharon Wright. \u201cYou\u2019re setting up a mini-containment area. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that has to come to the area \u2013 gowns, personal protective equipment, and a lot of trash generated when all that comes off.\u201d\n\nAnother reason to isolate such patients, Wright says: \u201cI can only imagine the concern from other patients and family members if they found out they were on a floor with a possible Ebola patient.\u201d\n\nIt could take three to five days to determine if a suspected case is indeed Ebola, she says. Massachusetts doesn\u2019t have a laboratory where the virus can be diagnosed, so blood and tissue samples would have to be sent to labs in either Albany or Atlanta.\n\nMeanwhile, elaborate precautions would be needed to ensure that neither personnel nor equipment got contaminated. Ebola is considered a BL-4 pathogen \u2013 a virus that should only be handled in a laboratory rated as Biosafety Level 4, the maximum containment level. No hospital in the area runs that type of lab.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about how to handle a BL-4 pathogen in a hospital lab that\u2019s typically a BL-2,\u201d Madoff says. \u201cHospitals are considering setting up mini-labs near the suspected Ebola patient\u2019s room so samples could be processed by specially trained technicians under protective hoods.\u201d\n\nAnd all these precautions would be conspicuous, to say the least, and likely trigger a panic.\n\n\u201cOur general stance is if there\u2019s no public threat, we don\u2019t see a reason to disclose\u201d a suspected case, Barry says. But she acknowledges that this news would probably leak. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got yourself in a heck of a mess, because people would think you\u2019re not being truthful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boston prepares intensively for the possibility that a case of Ebola will crop up here, though the risk is low and contagion could be easily contained.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Boston prepares intensively for the possibility that a case of Ebola will crop up here, though the risk is low and contagion could be easily contained.", "title": "\u2018The EbolaCoaster\u2019: Boston Prepares Intensively For What-Ifs", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/if-ebola-comes-to-boston", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/09/ebolatrain-620x348.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/if-ebola-comes-to-boston", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/09/ebolatrain-620x348.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "'The EbolaCoaster': Boston Prepares Intensively For What-Ifs"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-24", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 11:17:18 -0400"}, "article_summary": "\u2018The EbolaCoaster\u2019: Boston Prepares Intensively For What-IfsBy Richard KnoxEbola in Boston?\nOne complication specific to the Ebola virus is that it can take up to three weeks after someone is infected before symptoms appear.\nAnd if someone balks at being taken to the hospital, Barry of the Public Health Commission says, \u201cI can give them authorization\u201d to transport involuntarily.\nFirst of all, virtually no public health or infectious disease specialists think an imported case of Ebola could touch off an outbreak.\nThe risk of an imported case of Ebola, Wright says in an interview, \u201cis probably more than I would have thought a few weeks ago.\u201dA Silent InfectionBoston\u2019s not alone."}
