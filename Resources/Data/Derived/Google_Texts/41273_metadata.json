To help you make sense of it all, Frank Lalli, former editor of Money magazine and author of an upcoming book on finding affordable healthcare, will answer questions through the month of October in his daily blog.\n\nQ: What if I decide not to buy health insurance next year? Will I get fined?\n\nA: If you willfully decide not to get health insurance for yourself next year\u2014or for your dependents\u2014the IRS will almost surely ding you. The requirement to buy health insurance is called the individual mandate, and it is perhaps the most controversial and misunderstood part of Obamacare. And that\u2019s saying a lot!\n\nThe goal of the Affordable Care Act is to get every American decent health insurance and therefore the best available medical care. That\u2019s a worthy goal. But as Washington state\u2019s insurance commissioner Mike Kreidler says: \u201cYou simply cannot guarantee everyone coverage\u2014regardless of their health status\u2014without requiring that everyone participates.\u201d\n\nTo oversimplify, insurance payments from the young and healthy will help cover the costs of the old and sick. Unless the young and healthy get in the boat, the financial weight of the old and sick will sink Obamacare and this country will continue to have around 50 million uninsured people and another 25 million with inadequate health plans. You can see them in your local hospital\u2019s emergency room every day, and, right now, you help pay their medical bills each year with your taxes.\n\nThe individual mandate is the law of the land, validated by the Supreme Court. If you don\u2019t get coverage in 2014 at work, on your own or through a government plan like Medicare, the IRS will penalize you when you file your tax return in 2015.\n\nYou may have heard that the first year penalty for ignoring Obamacare is only $95\u2014so, no big deal if you ignore the mandate and don\u2019t get insurance. But that\u2019s only part of the story.\n\nIf you decide against getting insured next year, the IRS will fine you $95 or 1 percent of your income, whichever is greater. And the IRS will collect the money through your 2015 refund or your withholding.\n\nIn addition, you also will be fined for up to two uninsured tax dependents you claim on your return, such as a wife and child. As the regulations read today, experts say that if your health plan at work only covers you, you will be fined for your uninsured mate or child or your other dependents.\n\nAlso, the mandate\u2019s fine\u2014which the government\u2019s jargon meisters call a \u201cshared responsibility payment\u2019\u2019\u2014jumps sharply to $695 or the greater of 2.5 percent of your income in 2016.\n\nThere are a few exemptions. You will not have to pay a penalty, under these conditions:\n\n\u2022 If you earn so little that you are exempt from filing income tax;\n\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t afford the insurance\u2014that is, if the cost of available coverage would eat up more than 8 percent of your income;\n\n\u2022 If you go without insurance for a maximum of three months\u2014perhaps while you are between jobs;\n\n\u2022 And if you are a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or an established religious sect conscientiously opposed to accepting government benefits, such as the Amish. By the way, don\u2019t even dream about starting your own sect; exempt religious groups have to date back to at least 1950.\n\nBefore you decide to \u201cgo naked\u201d without insurance next year, consider this thought. \u201cIt\u2019s very risky to go without decent insurance,\u201d says Linda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute Health Policy Center in Washington, D.C. \u201cPeople get all sorts of nasty surprises.\u201d\n\nThe nasty bills for any of those surprises would be your real penalty.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, doctors, Frank Lalli, health, health care costs, healthcare, insurance, Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid, Medicare, medications, Obamacare, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, rx, save on prescriptions", "author": "Frank Lalli", "og": {"url": "http://parade.com/170826/franklalli/will-i-be-fined-if-i-dont-buy-health-insurance/", "site_name": "Parade", "image": "http://static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/insurance-fined-ftr.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Will You Be Fined If You Don't Buy Health Insurance?"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new healthcare options introduced this month can be complex\u2014and confusing.
