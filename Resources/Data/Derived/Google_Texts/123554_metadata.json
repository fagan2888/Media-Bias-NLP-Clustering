She thought the hunt in a neighborhood she knows so well would be a hoot.\n\n\u201cThis is a dream to be able to walk around this neighborhood, get to know it better and show others around,\u201d she said.\n\nSharp knew most of the answers to the clues, and Chakarei eagerly followed along.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to win,\u201d he said.\n\nBrother Jeff Fard \u2014 who helped put the event together \u2014 said this kind of camaraderie was exactly what the gathering was all about.\n\n\u201cThis festival is a response to violence in the area, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Fard said. \u201cThis is what communities should be doing. Events like this show that this space is owned by the entire community and is not ruled by fear.\u201d\n\nLive music carried throughout Holly Square as attendees danced without reservation, ate and browsed through several local shops that set up booths.\n\nLynda Rawlins was one such reveler whose smile was almost as big as her dance moves.\n\n\u201cI am elated,\u201d Rawlins said. \u201cI am proud of my people today. We have good brothers and sisters, good music, good food. I am so happy to be here.\u201d\n\nFard snapped photos and greeted the community he loves as he made the rounds.\n\n\u201cThis community will be known for a lot more than violence,\u201d he said as he watched people celebrate the day.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Holly Square fills with dancing, eating, music and community", "title": "Holly Square fills with dancing, eating, music and community", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/holly-square-fills-with-dancing-eating-music-and-community/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__Salsa_And_Soul_Unityp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__Salsa_And_Soul_Unityp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T15:12:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:49:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We have good brothers and sisters, good music, good food.\nTonya Sharp, who lives in the Holly community, looked jubilant as she passed by live music along the scavenger hunt\u2019s path.\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Salsa and Soul Unity Fest partnered with the Northeast Transportation Connections\u2019 Walk Fest to promote community safety and togetherness in the Holly Square neighborhood.\nParents, kids and kids at heart took off throughout the Holly Square on a scavenger hunt promising exercise, neighborhood history and a walking tour of the area.\n\u201cThis community will be known for a lot more than violence,\u201d he said as he watched people celebrate the day."}
