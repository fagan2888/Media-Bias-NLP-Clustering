Killings of Israelis have become relatively rare in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. While there appeared to be no direct link between the two latest episodes, they jolted Israeli complacency, fed popular distrust of Palestinians and deepened skepticism about the recently resumed Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.\n\nNaftali Bennett, a right-wing minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, called for a re-examination of the government\u2019s decision to release batches of long-serving Palestinian security prisoners from Israeli jails in the coming months as part of the American-brokered peace effort.\n\nThe Israeli military identified the latest victim as Sgt. Gabriel Koby, 20, from the city of Tirat Hacarmel and said in a statement that he was hit by direct gunfire aimed at a group of soldiers who were guarding the Jewish settlement in Hebron and the thousands of civilians visiting the city for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.\n\nBarely two hours before the Hebron shooting, another Israeli soldier, Sgt. Tomer Hazan, 20, was buried in a military cemetery near the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam. Sergeant Hazan was killed Friday by a Palestinian man with whom the sergeant worked at a restaurant and who lured him to the West Bank.\n\nAngry Israelis demonstrating Sunday night outside the Bat Yam restaurant where both Sergeant Hazan and his killer had worked held a sign reading, \u201cBibi is good for terrorists,\u201d using the prime minister\u2019s nickname.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a move apparently intended to appease the right wing, Mr. Netanyahu gave the go-ahead for Jews to move into a building they recently bought in Hebron, saying, \u201cWe will continue with one hand to fight terrorism and terrorists, and with the other hand, to strengthen Jewish settlement.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Bat Yam residents lighted memorial candles on the sidewalk outside the shuttered shawarma restaurant, Tzahi Meats, arranging them to spell out the dead soldier\u2019s name in Hebrew. The restaurant owner has come under attack for having hired a Palestinian worker who, Israeli authorities said, did not hold a valid permit for working in Israel. A banner hanging outside the restaurant announced that it would be closed for the coming week as a token of shared grief with the family of Sergeant Hazan, who served in an administrative day job in the Air Force\u2019s pilotless drone unit.\n\n\u201cIs that what Tomer\u2019s life is worth? A week?\u201d said one local resident who asked to be identified only by her first name, Kalanit, to avoid tensions with her neighbors. \u201cArabs should not be employed in this town, period,\u201d she added.\n\nSergeant Hazan\u2019s death touched a nerve in a country where most 18-year-olds are drafted for years of compulsory military service. It came amid many warnings by the Israeli military of Palestinian plots to abduct Israeli soldiers. Israeli security officials said that Nidal Amer, 42, who confessed to killing Sergeant Hazan and concealing his body in a water well, told investigators that he had hoped to trade the soldier\u2019s body for the release of a brother who is serving a 30-year term in an Israeli prison for his role in attacks on Israelis.\n\nIt remained unclear how Mr. Amer persuaded the soldier to share a taxi with him to just outside Beit Amin, where most of the suspect\u2019s family lives. There was speculation in Israel that the soldier had been tempted by what he thought would be some kind of lucrative deal.\n\nSergeant Hazan and Mr. Amer had lived not far from one another in the four months since Mr. Amer came to work at Tzahi Meats, where the soldier often served customers and made deliveries in the afternoons after getting off from his army job.\n\nMr. Amer has a wife and eight children in the Arab-Israeli town of Jaljulia in central Israel, but people living and working in the vicinity of Tzahi Meats said he stayed mostly with other Arab workers in an apartment in a rundown building nearby. Nobody was in the first-floor apartment on Sunday, but T-shirts with the Tzahi Meats logo, a pair of jeans and several towels hung on a washing line.\n\nSergeant Hazan\u2019s family apartment is within walking distance of the restaurant.\n\nYarin Palas, 19, who works a couple of doors from Tzahi Meats, said Mr. Amer had prepared his lunch sandwich every day. Like many neighbors here who knew Sergeant Hazan and Mr. Amer, Mr. Palas described Mr. Amer as a friendly type who never aroused suspicion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Palas recalled one conversation with Mr. Amer that, with hindsight, had taken on a dark overtone. \u201cOnce he asked me if I was a soldier,\u201d Mr. Palas said. \u201cIt seems he was looking for a soldier.\u201d\n\nDespite their physical proximity, Sergeant Hazan and Mr. Amer came from very different worlds.\n\nMr. Amer appears to have been partly estranged from much of his family. His wife of 18 years, Najat Qremta, said he had more or less abandoned her and their children. He had stopped paying rent on their apartment a few years ago, so she and her children live in one windowless room.\n\nRelatives in Beit Amin said Mr. Amer spent most of his time in Israel and visited only once every month or two.\n\nMr. Amer\u2019s mother, Fatima, 74, said he had come to the house on Friday afternoon carrying a bag. He was silent, smoked a lot and looked tired, she said.\n\nHis father, Abdullah, said: \u201cIt is against our principles to kill a man who gave you his trust. It does not matter if he is Jewish or non-Jewish.\u201d\n\nOn a steep hill in the West Bank, a farmer pointed out the shallow well with a single bloodstain where he said Sergeant Hazan\u2019s body had been hidden.\n\nThe sergeant was known as a kind, fun-loving young man who was well loved by his family and friends. Relatives who eulogized him in the crowded cemetery described him as an enthusiastic participant in the noisy karaoke parties that are popular in Bat Yam.\n\nOne of his three brothers, Ophir, described Sergeant Hazan in the eulogy as the family\u2019s fashion and hairstyle consultant who was always in motion. Whenever he told his brother to slow down and rest, he said, Sergeant Hazan replied, \u201cYou only live once.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130922105506, "twitter": {"description": "The soldier, identified as Sgt.
