'THERE'S NOTHING WORSE than coming home to a room that looks like a catalog," said Jeremiah Brent. "The spaces we live in should tell our story."

Mr. Brent, 28, follows an ethos of lived-in luxury for the work he does at his two-year-old interior design firm. His clients include stylist Rachel Zoe and hair stylist Rita Hazan; he also codesigned the Hollywood Hills home he shares with his fiancé, designer and television personality Nate Berkus.

Now Mr. Brent is expanding his decorative repertoire with a collection of candles made with D.L. & Co., available Nov. 13 through e-tailer Gilt.

"I'm inspired by deep, earthy smells, especially of the outdoors," said Mr. Brent, who cited quenched fires and freshly watered herbs as references. The collection of soy-wax candles includes three scents: Figo, a mix of grapefruit and fig; Fogo, a spicy blend of tobacco flower and amber; and Rosa, which combines orange blossom and rose. Mr. Brent said it was important for him to get the gold-mirrored glass vessel just right: "It's also a fantastic vase or tumbler when the wax is gone."
