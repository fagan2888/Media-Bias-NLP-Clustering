As a result, it has also brought renewed attention to the unique system of health insurance regulatory authority we have in California.\n\nEvery other state regulates health insurance through the department of insurance (or equivalent), whereas our state divides this authority between the California Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Health Care. The history of our bifurcated regulatory authority dates back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the controversies surrounding early efforts by the state to contract with prepaid health plans to provide care to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. These difficulties led to enactment of the Knox-Keene Act in 1975, which placed the regulatory authority for HMOs in the Department of Corporations rather than in CDI.\n\nWhy create this separation of authority in the first place? According to a 2001 CHCF report, a major reason is that CDI at the time was viewed as too aligned with health insurers rather than consumers. In 1999, the Legislature passed further managed care reforms and established DMHC as a separate agency to oversee these reforms and to regulate Knox-Keene licensees.\n\nGiven this history, has the time come to put authority over all health insurers back into a single agency? Obviously, achieving greater administrative efficiency is a powerful argument in favor. But the more difficult question is, if only one agency should regulate health insurers, which one should it be? And, do the historical reasons for maintaining separate agencies still apply? The simple answer to the latter question is no; California has had a series of insurance commissioners who have demonstrated their willingness to take on industry interests and to fight for consumer interests, including the current commissioner. But bringing all health insurance regulation back into CDI risks diluting the success of DMHC as a separate, distinct agency protecting the rights of Californians enrolled in managed care.\n\nOn the other hand, moving all regulatory authority into DMHC eliminates the unique role the Insurance Commissioner can play as an elected, rather than appointed, official. On balance, a single agency exclusively focused on health insurance regulation seems the best option, because of both the size of the market and the unique nature of health insurance compared to most other forms of insurance. This argues for DMHC being the sole agency. Perhaps the Legislature should also consider making the head of an expanded (and renamed) DMHC an elected official to assure the public that the head of such a combined agency will continue to be sufficiently responsive to consumer interests. Otherwise, simply combining all health insurance regulation in a single agency will seem like a gain in administrative efficiency at the expense of a lost, independent voice on behalf of consumer interests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>We asked legislators, regulators, consumer advocates and health care experts to weigh in on a new report saying the timing is right for California to move away from bifurcated oversight and designate a single health insurance regulator.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "We asked legislators, regulators, consumer advocates and health care experts to weigh in on a new report saying the timing is right for California to move away from bifurcated oversight and designa\u2026", "title": "Timing Right for State To Align Health Insurance Oversight Under One Roof?", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/timing-right-for-state-to-align-health-insurance-oversight-under-one-roof/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-08-20T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e00\"", "article_summary": "Every other state regulates health insurance through the department of insurance (or equivalent), whereas our state divides this authority between the California Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Health Care.\nAs a result, it has also brought renewed attention to the unique system of health insurance regulatory authority we have in California.\nOn balance, a single agency exclusively focused on health insurance regulation seems the best option, because of both the size of the market and the unique nature of health insurance compared to most other forms of insurance.\nOn the other hand, moving all regulatory authority into DMHC eliminates the unique role the Insurance Commissioner can play as an elected, rather than appointed, official.\nThese difficulties led to enactment of the Knox-Keene Act in 1975, which placed the regulatory authority for HMOs in the Department of Corporations rather than in CDI."}
