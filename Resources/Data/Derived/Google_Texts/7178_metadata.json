Independents are more divided, with 26% saying it\u2019s good, 51% saying it\u2019s bad, and the rest saying they don\u2019t know.\n\nMost respondents say that what they\u2019ve seen, read or heard over the last few weeks about the law has made no difference to their opinion of it. (There\u2019s been mixed news over the past few weeks. The Department of Health and Human Services disclosed that a hacker had breached the HealthCare.gov site in July and uploaded malicious software, and has been chasing around 310,000 people to send in additional paperwork confirming they\u2019re legally in the U.S. or see their coverage cut off Sept. 30. At the same time, Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican governor made his state the 27th to expand Medicaid under the law, and fresh reports that premiums for 2015 have largely stayed in check has buoyed supporters.)\n\nClick to see more poll charts and data.\n\nSentiment is about the same as it was among registered voters ahead of 2012 and 2010 elections. In 2012, 40% of registered voters in the NBC/Journal poll thought the law was a good idea and 44% thought it was bad. In 2010, 36% of registered voters thought it was good and 46% thought it was bad.\n\nFor 2014, Latino voters are the only electoral group identified in the NBC/Journal poll where supporters of the law outnumber opponents. Among suburban women, voters over 65, undecided and independent voters and white women more dislike it than back it.\n\nThe poll also shows the Democratic party maintaining an edge over Republicans in voters\u2019 perceptions of who\u2019s best at dealing with health care. Some 39% of voters think Democrats have an advantage, compared with 31% who favor the GOP. But Democrats\u2019 8-point lead is well below the big double-digit margins the party enjoyed in the years before the overhaul was debated and passed.\n\nA new monthly tracking poll also released Tuesday by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation has almost identical findings.\n\nThat survey shows a similar split in support for the law, with 47% of respondents saying they had an unfavorable view of the law and 35% saying they liked it. There were also similar divisions along party lines, though the poll found that health-care took a back seat to the economy in importance for voters of all stripes.\n\nThe NBC/Journal poll was carried out Sept. 3 to 7 with 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. The Kaiser poll was conducted August 25 to Sept. 2 with a sample of 1,505 adults, giving the poll a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\nMore from the September poll:", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Voters who think the federal health law is a bad idea still significantly outnumber those who think it's a good idea heading into November midterms, the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows.", "title": "Americans Still Not Sold on Obamacare \u2013 WSJ/NBC Poll", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/09/09/americans-still-not-sold-on-obamacare-wsjnbc-poll/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EB218_govit0_P_20140811161737.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Americans Still Not Sold on Obamacare \u2013 WSJ/NBC Poll", "description": "Voters who think the federal health law is a bad idea still significantly outnumber those who think it's a good idea heading into November midterms, the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Louise Radnofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Voters who think the federal health law is a bad idea still significantly outnumber those who think it's a good idea heading into November midterms, the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-09-09T22:31:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/09/09/americans-still-not-sold-on-obamacare-wsjnbc-poll/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-48793", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Voters who think the federal health law is a bad idea still significantly outnumber those who think it's a good idea heading into November midterms, the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows.", "title": "Americans Still Not Sold on Obamacare \u2013 WSJ/NBC Poll", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/09/09/americans-still-not-sold-on-obamacare-wsjnbc-poll/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EB218_govit0_P_20140811161737.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-48793", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-09T23:19:59-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Among all registered voters captured in the September poll, 34% are in favor of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and 48% are against it.\nIn 2012, 40% of registered voters in the NBC/Journal poll thought the law was a good idea and 44% thought it was bad.\nThe NBC/Journal poll was carried out Sept. 3 to 7 with 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\nIndependents are more divided, with 26% saying it\u2019s good, 51% saying it\u2019s bad, and the rest saying they don\u2019t know.\nSentiment is about the same as it was among registered voters ahead of 2012 and 2010 elections."}
