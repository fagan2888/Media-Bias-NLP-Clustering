Sound familiar? It does if you're a fan of the Swamp Thing.

I bet you didn't know the well-known comic book and movie character has a tie to KELOLAND. That's because a big fan who collects everything Swamp Thing lives in Sioux Falls.

John Boylan now holds the Guinness World Record for Largest Swamp Thing Collection in the World.

Saturday, at a reception to show off his pieces, Swamp Thing experts stopped by to authenticate his collection.

"It's really exciting, especially today when we were doing the review process. I've never been in a room where five adult men were talking about my favorite comic book character and it absolutely blew me away. The witnesses we had, these guys have been in the comic book field for years. And to see their face when I showed them something they've never seen before is the most rewarding thing ever," Boylan said.

Boylan says this is the first time he has seen his entire collection on display. So, even he is a bit overwhelmed with just how much Swamp Thing Stuff he owns.
