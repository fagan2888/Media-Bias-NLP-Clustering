If you have Dish, it wasn\u2019t Fox News.\n\nAfter contract negotiations came to a halt between 21st Century Fox and Dish Network, the Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network went dark for Dish customers on Saturday and remain dark still.\n\n21st Century Fox is the parent company of FNC and FBN, as well as several sports and entertainment channels. Dish Network is a satellite TV provider with more than 14 million customers and \u2013 until recently \u2013 a distributor of Fox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that a \u201csenior Fox News executive\u201d told them that \u201cthere are currently no talks between the two companies.\u201d\n\nContract negotiation between Dish Network and 21st Century Fox stalled when Dish refused a fee increase for Fox\u2019s other channels, a price Fox calls standard for the changing news industry.\n\nWarren Schlichting, the senior vice president of programming at Dish, said in a statement that \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re about to close on a house and the realtor is trying to make us buy a new car as well.\u201d\n\nSchlichting accused Fox of using its news channels as \u201cleverage to triple rates on sports and entertainment channels that are not in this contract.\u201d\n\nTim Carry, the executive vice president of distribution at Fox News Channel, told the Wall Street Journal that Dish \u201cdid not want to accept terms and commitments that have become customary in a Fox News renewal.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Carry added that:\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the millions of Fox News viewers on Dish were used as pawns by their provider\u2026 Hopefully they will vote with their hard-earned money and seek another one of our other valued distributors immediately.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Dish customers have lost access to channels because of stalled negotiations. In October, channels such as CNN, Cartoon Network and Turner Classic Movies were blacked out for a month as Dish negotiated with Turner Broadcasting. Earlier this month, customers also temporarily lost access to CBS and its affiliates.\n\n\u201cThis is the third time in as many months that Dish customers have suffered through a blackout due to Dish\u2019s intransigence,\u201d Carry told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cDish\u2019s record speaks for itself and makes its rhetoric about \u2018reasonable\u2019 agreements ring hollow.\u201d\n\nFox launched a website, keepfoxnews.com, where it encourages Fox fans to switch TV providers. Viewers can enter their ZIP codes and discover TV providers that still offer Fox. The website also encourages Fox fans to call and email Dish to register their complaints about losing the networks, and to use the hashtag #DontBlockFOXNews.\n\nCarry told Bloomberg that the website has \u201cgenerated 22,000 e-mails and 7,000 phone calls requesting that Dish reinstate the channel.\u201d\n\nDish has also launched its own website dishstandsforyou.com, where it tells customers \u201cWe regret that Fox has chosen to remove their programming from DISH customers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dish subscribers can't watch Fox News.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Dish subscribers can't watch Fox News.", "title": "Why Dish Network Isn\u2019t Carrying Fox News Right Now", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/159184348.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-22T14:24:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zVRd4J"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Dish subscribers can't watch Fox News.", "title": "Why Dish Network Isn\u2019t Carrying Fox News Right Now", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/159184348.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-12-22T11:22:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-22T14:24:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Fox News, Fox News Channel, Dish Network, Dish, dish channels, cbs, cnn, fox news dish dispute"}, "article_summary": "After contract negotiations came to a halt between 21st Century Fox and Dish Network, the Fox News Channel and the Fox Business Network went dark for Dish customers on Saturday and remain dark still.\nDish Network is a satellite TV provider with more than 14 million customers and \u2013 until recently \u2013 a distributor of Fox.\n\u201cThis is the third time in as many months that Dish customers have suffered through a blackout due to Dish\u2019s intransigence,\u201d Carry told the Wall Street Journal.\nThe website also encourages Fox fans to call and email Dish to register their complaints about losing the networks, and to use the hashtag #DontBlockFOXNews.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that a \u201csenior Fox News executive\u201d told them that \u201cthere are currently no talks between the two companies.\u201dContract negotiation between Dish Network and 21st Century Fox stalled when Dish refused a fee increase for Fox\u2019s other channels, a price Fox calls standard for the changing news industry."}
