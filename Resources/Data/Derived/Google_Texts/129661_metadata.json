Shows USA CO2 rates since 1975. We have dropped recently thanks to a recession.\n\nThe recent decline in CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions is partly thanks to the recession, increase in cleaner gas production and a decrease in coal production. With the recession being the largest contributor to the decline in pollutants in the atmosphere over the United States.\n\nSince 2005 we have reduced emission by nine percent each year but without a change in how we produce and use energy this number will likely start to get smaller or possibly once again grow.\n\n\n\nCredit: Climate Central. Shows projected emission rates under different scenarios.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
