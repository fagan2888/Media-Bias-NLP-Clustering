He later earned a paralegal degree.\n\nIt was while working as a paralegal at a Tampa law firm that Green began working on residential eviction cases and eventually started a part-time evictions business. The law firm asked him to work exclusively for them or take his business full-time.\n\nGreen chose his business, and he\u2019s been in charge of Evictions Plus for 22 years.\n\n\u201cI love what I do,\u201d Green said. \u201cI don\u2019t work for a living. I play a game. As long as I win the game, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nAs more and more former homeowners became renters after the housing bust and recession, the eviction business has stayed steady. The number of evictions filed with the Hillsborough County Clerk of the Circuit Court has ranged from 10,000 to more than 13,000 for each of the last six years.\n\nWhile plenty of businesses will handle evictions, Green is one of a relatively small number of Hillsborough County companies that only handle evictions.\n\nGreen averages about 45 evictions a month. He\u2019s done as many as 75 in one month. He\u2019s done 19 in one day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hustling,\u201d Green said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work.\u201d\n\nGreen says the business mostly involves preparing the proper paperwork, filing it with the Hillsborough County Clerk of the Circuit Court and delivering a copy to the tenant.\n\nGreen, who is a certified process server in Hillsborough County, presents the eviction lawsuit by giving it to tenants or placing it on their door if no one answers.\n\n\u201cWe are not attorneys and can\u2019t represent them in court,\u201d said Green, who can process an eviction anywhere in the state. \u201cWe are strictly processing the information. We do all the running around and processing for them (the landlord). We are saving them the headache of waiting in line.\u201d\n\nThe eviction process from beginning to end can take two and a half weeks in Hillsborough County, Green said. The Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office serves the final 24-hour eviction notice -- known as the writ of possession -- and returns to the home after 24 hours to make certain the eviction has gone through. Green is on scene every step of the way looking out for his client\u2019s best interest.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 problem for evictions is communication,\u201d Green said. \u201cThere is a lack of communication between the landlord and the tenant. That is why they hire us.\u201d\n\nBy the time Green has filed the paperwork and contacted the tenant, the tenant is aware there\u2019s a problem, Green said. The landlord has contacted the tenant, served them with notices and told them eviction is a possibility.\n\nOften, the tenant is purposely buying time while wasting the landlord\u2019s time and money, Green said.\n\n\u201cThe misnomer is that process servers are bad, evil people bringing them (the tenant) bad news,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019re not. We\u2019re providing them information they need to know. If they choose to ignore it, that\u2019s their problem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for his eviction company to have a conflict with a tenant, Green said. The tension, he says, is between the landlord and the tenant. Green prefers that a landlord not show up to the home once he\u2019s been hired.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of the people we evict shake our hands and thank us when we\u2019re done,\u201d Green said. \u201cBecause I treat them with the same respect I treat everybody.\u201d\n\nSteve Choate has hired Green to handle evictions on Hillsborough County property he owns.\n\nChoate, who lives near Key West, doesn\u2019t like the tension that can escalate during an eviction process. He says he tries to develop relationships with his tenants, visiting them regularly and bringing them gifts during the holidays.\n\nWhen someone isn\u2019t paying rent, though, he turns to Green.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like feeling like the bad guy, even though it\u2019s a business decision,\u201d Choate said. \u201cIf I was too soft, I\u2019d be broke. It wouldn\u2019t be a good business decision.\u201d\n\njpatino@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7659\n\nTwitter: @jpatinoTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 09 Feb 2014 17:18:17 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Anthony Green has always had a taste for law and law enforcement.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Anthony Green has always had a taste for law and law enforcement.", "title": "Evictions are booming business for Tampa man", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/evictions-are-booming-business-for-tampa-man-20140209/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-02-09T17:18:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Evictions are booming business for Tampa man"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-09T17:18:17Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-09T17:18:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa81\"", "article_summary": "While plenty of businesses will handle evictions, Green is one of a relatively small number of Hillsborough County companies that only handle evictions.\nIt was while working as a paralegal at a Tampa law firm that Green began working on residential eviction cases and eventually started a part-time evictions business.\nAs long as I win the game, I\u2019m happy.\u201dAs more and more former homeowners became renters after the housing bust and recession, the eviction business has stayed steady.\nChoate, who lives near Key West, doesn\u2019t like the tension that can escalate during an eviction process.\nGreen chose his business, and he\u2019s been in charge of Evictions Plus for 22 years."}
