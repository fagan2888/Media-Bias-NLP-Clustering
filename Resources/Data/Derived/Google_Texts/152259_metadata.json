QEs have begun releasing public performance reports, Brennen stated.\n\nThe QE program helps create publicly available performance reports and data.\n\nThis information is used to improve provider quality, bolster transparency efforts, and help employers, consumer groups, patients, and caregivers make more intelligent healthcare decisions.\n\nThere are currently 12 certified QEs. Eleven of these will report on a regional scale. One QE will report nationwide.\n\nNow a second nationwide QE, Amino, has been given the green light.\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m excited to announce further growth in the QE program with the approval of a second nationwide QE, Amino. With the addition of Medicare data, Amino will enhance its free service to help Americans make care decisions, including, for example, determining the providers from whom they choose to receive services,\u201d Brennen wrote.\n\n\u201cPrior to the Affordable Care Act, provider reporting was fragmented, making it difficult for providers and consumers to access a comprehensive picture of provider performance on quality and cost. The QE program enables qualified entities to create a more complete picture of provider quality and cost of care by combing Medicare data with data from multiple health plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we continue our effort to make actionable information available to consumers and providers alike, we are looking forward to the future release of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that will implement changes to the QE program enacted by Congress under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA).\u201d\n\n\u201cThis legislation expands permissible uses and disclosures under the QE program. We look forward to receiving comments from interested stakeholders when the NPRM is released.\u201d\n\nA brief look back on QE\u2019s beginnings\n\nThe very first QE program was The Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI). HCCI confirmed one of the primary benefits of the QE program is the simple art of credibility.\n\n\u201cPublic reporting, as permitted with these data, when combined with cost and quality data from commercial health plans and state Medicaid data will represent the most credible information source for consumers, regulators and employers on health care cost and quality variation,\u201d said David Newman, HCCI\u2019s Executive Director.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exciting developments are underway for the healthcare industry with a new nationwide QE program, announced Niall Brennan, CMS Chief Data Officer, this week.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-shares-new-qualified-entity-program-growth-developments", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-11-12-cms-pqrs.png", "type": "article", "title": "CMS Shares New Qualified Entity Program Growth Developments"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exciting developments are underway for the healthcare industry with a new nationwide QE program, announced Niall Brennan, CMS Chief Data Officer, this week.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-11-12-cms-pqrs.png"}, "title": "CMS Shares New Qualified Entity Program Growth Developments", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "CMS confirms a second nationwide QE programBrennen shared a series of \u201cexciting developments\u201d regarding the Qualified Entity (QE) program, which was established under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m excited to announce further growth in the QE program with the approval of a second nationwide QE, Amino.\nHCCI confirmed one of the primary benefits of the QE program is the simple art of credibility.\nAccording to Brennan, CMS has been a government leader in the advancement of data transparency; CMS released data on geographic variation in Medicare utilization and quality and data on provider level utilization.\nThe QE program helps create publicly available performance reports and data."}
