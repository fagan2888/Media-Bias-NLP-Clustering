(AP) - Republican candidate for governor Jay Dardenne has started his TV advertising with a spot that appears to take aim at the race\u2019s GOP front-runner U.S. Sen. David Vitter without naming him.\n\nIn the 30-second spot, a narrator describes Dardenne, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, as holding elected offices for 25 years without a \u201chint of scandal,\u201d a seeming swipe at Vitter\u2019s prostitution scandal.\n\nThe ad says Dardenne \u201ctalks straight because he\u2019s not a Washington politician. He brings us together. He doesn\u2019t drive a wedge through our heart with partisan politics.\u201d It calls Dardenne a governor who will \u201cmake Louisiana proud.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one striking at Vitter\u2019s link to a Washington prostitution ring in 2007. An outside political action committee called the Louisiana Water Coalition, is airing TV and radio spots reminding voters more directly of the prostitution scandal. Vitter has called that a \u201cgutter campaign against me full of stale attacks.\u201d\n\nWith his new ad started Tuesday, Dardenne becomes the last of the four major contenders in the race to enter the television campaign. His TV advertising begins with fewer than six weeks before the Oct. 24 election.\n\nRepublican Scott Angelle, a member of the Public Service Commission, has been advertising for months, while Vitter went up with his first ad in August. Democrat John Bel Edwards, a state representative, started airing his first TV spot over the Labor Day holiday.\n\nDardenne\u2019s campaign says it will remain on air uninterrupted until election day. Dardenne has said he waited until this month to advertise because voters hadn\u2019t been keeping track of the governor\u2019s race until now.\n\n\u201cAs voters begin to pay attention, we are going to show them what this race is about. They don\u2019t have to settle for the same old partisan, scandal plagued politics,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nDardenne\u2019s also got less cash to spend on advertising than Vitter.\n\nIn the last round of campaign finance reports, Vitter had $5 million in his campaign account, compared to nearly $1.9 million for Dardenne, nearly $1.1 million for state Rep. John Bel Edwards and just over $1 million for Angelle. A separate political action committee supporting Vitter reported $4.4 million, far more than PACs supporting other contenders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidate for governor Jay Dardenne has started his TV advertising with a spot that appears to take aim at the race's GOP front-runner U.S. Sen.
