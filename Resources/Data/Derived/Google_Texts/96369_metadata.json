On-demand workers alone are projected to grow from a current base of 3.2 million to 7.6 million by 2020. New research from Intuit shows that 28 percent of these freelance workers do not have a health plan \u2013 more than double the 12 percent of Americans who don\u2019t have insurance. This partnership combines the two leading financial and health decision experiences to support professional, creative, and on-demand workers nationwide.\n\n\u201cSelf-employment gives people the freedom and flexibility of being their own boss, but it comes with challenging compliance requirements and a constant struggle for financial stability. We\u2019re working to ease that burden and bring stability to the self-employed,\u201d said Alex Chriss, vice president of Intuit\u2019s Small Business Group. \u201cProviding our customers with Stride\u2019s tailor-made healthcare recommendations to maximize tax credits, access tax savings, and assist in complying with the Affordable Care Act is the next step in expanding QuickBooks Self-Employed.
