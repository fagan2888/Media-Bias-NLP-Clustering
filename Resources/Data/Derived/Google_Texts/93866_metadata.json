IMAX movie theaters and museums? A butterfly habitat in Terminal 3? Airports are not the congested, fast-food crammed eyesores they used to be.\n\nGiven the current groundswell of upgrades, renovations and innovations at domestic and international airports, you might actually look forward to a flight delay.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has the best airport food,\u201d raves George Chuang, a private equity investor. \u201cI fly through there and purposely book a later connection just to eat there. You don\u2019t even have to leave the transit area. The best thing is the dim sum.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s travelers are not just choosing airlines\u2014they\u2019re also selecting the airports they\u2019re flying into and out of\u2014for the perks. And why not? Airports are moving away from being hellish purgatories for the grounded into aeries worthy of flight, with retail meccas packed with restaurants, hotels and spas that feel more like a resort than a terminal.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 10 of the World\u2019s Most Luxurious Airports\n\nAt the Amsterdam Schiphol in the Netherlands, you can admire paintings by Rembrandt and Steen in an annex of the Rijksmuseum, or sit in an armchair and read books by Dutch authors translated into 29 languages in the airport library. Schiphol also has the distinction of having its very own noise-reducing Buitenschot Land Art Park.\n\nAt the Changi Airport in Singapore, the lost and overwhelmed can find napping lounges and free foot-massage machines; \u201cExperience Agents\u201d offering assistance; gardens with waterfalls, orchids and butterflies; and a rooftop swimming pool that will reopen at the end of August.\n\nThe U.S. has been a latecomer to this trend, but it\u2019s wheeling down the runway to catch up. A few weeks ago, New York announced ambitious plans to rebuild LaGuardia Airport, famously derided as a \u201cthird-world\u201d experience by Vice President Joe Biden last year. The $4 billion overhaul will replace all four terminals with a single terminal and make LaGuardia \u201cthe newest major airport in the United States,\u201d doubling the current operational space for airliners, and connecting LaGuardia to mass transit rail service and a high-speed ferry.\n\nRelated: The Hottest Travel Spots for Americans in 2015\n\nSan Francisco International Airport already lets you stretch and unwind in a free yoga studio, order glasses of Napa vintages at the wine bar or take in rotating art exhibits from the SFO Museum. You also can pop into an XpresSpa for a quick manicure or massage.\n\nAt the Portland International Airport in Oregon, a herd of goats was brought in to eat and clear out the blackberries, thistle and Scotch broom near the PDX airfield. And they\u2019re not the only ones grazing there. The small airport is a favorite with travelers for its on-time departures, in-line baggage screening, restaurants, shops and free Wi-Fi. There\u2019s also a food truck corner where passengers can munch on local eats.\n\nRelated: Your Wait at Airport Security Is About to Get Worse\n\nHumans are not the only ones getting an upgrade. New York\u2019s JFK Airport recently unveiled its plans for the ARK, a new $48 million luxury terminal for pets, horses, birds and livestock. That\u2019s 178,000 square feet devoted to the 70,000 animals expected to pass through annually \u2014 all of which will have access to a 24-hour clinic run by Cornell University\u2019s veterinary college. Look for climate-controlled stalls plus a best-in-show doggy resort with a bone-shaped pool, massage therapy and paw pedicures. Pet suites will be equipped with webcams and flat-screen TVs so owners can still stay in touch with their dogs during their stay.\n\nOnce the ARK is completed in 2016, renovations will transform the Trans World Flight Center, Eero Saarinen\u2019s iconic architectural landmark, into the TWA Flight Center Hotel, a complex with over 500 hotel rooms, restaurants, a museum and a 10,000 square foot observation deck.\n\nUntil then, click here to see 10 of the World\u2019s Most Luxurious Airports.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Biergartens and breweries?
