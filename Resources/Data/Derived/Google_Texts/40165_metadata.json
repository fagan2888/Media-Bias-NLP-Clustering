His mother works in customer service. The kid\u2019s no genetic freak, hardly bred for football greatness. He\u2019s just another kid with a dream, as improbable as the next.\n\nEight-year-old Montee Ball doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s improbable, though. He doesn\u2019t know that Wentzville, Mo., is hardly prime football recruiting territory, or to play a sport at its highest level requires as much talent as it does determination. He doesn\u2019t know that a decade and a half later, he\u2019ll be paired with arguably the greatest quarterback of a generation, a man who might as well have been raised on another planet, or that their unlikely partnership might help him climb out of the struggles of a tough rookie year.\n\nHe just knows he\u2019s going to play in the NFL.\n\nWhen Ball was in second grade, his teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. His answer came fast and sure: Football player. The NFL.\n\n\u201cShe was like, \u2018That\u2019s good, but think of something else you want to do, because the percentage is extremely low,\u2019 \u201d Ball said. \u201cBut \u2026 my dad always told me, if you have a backup plan, you\u2019ve already failed.\u201d\n\nBall hasn\u2019t needed that backup plan. It didn\u2019t matter that he couldn\u2019t play running back until he was 12 and he was finally under the weight limit required to touch the ball. It didn\u2019t matter that when he showed up to Timberland High School the summer before his freshman year, he was just a big back with potential, and that it took his coach, Craig Collins, another two years to realize Ball was a major college talent.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that when he went to Wisconsin for college, he was third on the Badgers\u2019 depth chart, then still a backup as a sophomore. It didn\u2019t matter, because Ball was going to play in the NFL.\n\nBy his junior year, Ball was a human highlight reel. He set NCAA record after NCAA record, most notably scoring 39 touchdowns as a junior to tie Barry Sanders for the most ever in a single season. Ball was the littlest big man on a campus known for producing cornfed lineman, eventually going in the second round to the Broncos \u2014 his favorite team as a child \u2014 in the 2013 NFL draft.\n\nBut the fairy tale ends there, or perhaps it breaks for intermission. Ball\u2019s rookie season \u2014 until last Sunday \u2014 has been marred by fumbles and time on the bench. But, after rushing for 117 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Ball the Broncos staked their second-round pick on seems to be surfacing.\n\n\u201cMontee has been thrown into the fire as a rookie,\u201d Manning said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly made some mistakes, like all rookies do, all players do. I\u2019m still waiting for somebody to break my NFL record for interceptions as a rookie. Got to be a 16-game starter to do it, though.\u201d\n\nOn paper, it\u2019s an unlikely pairing, Manning and Ball, but in reality, these are two of the most single-minded, goal-oriented players on the Broncos.\n\nSince the start of training camp, Manning has pulled Ball aside at practices to offer suggestions. He\u2019s helped slowed down the game for him, Ball said, although the rookie still struggles to stay on the wavelength of a four-time MVP.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to catch up to how he sees the game, but as a running back,\u201d Ball said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s different as a quarterback. All I can say is he\u2019s really helped me take every play for what it is.\u201d\n\nEven now, Manning and the Broncos are still learning exactly what kind of player Ball can be. At Wisconsin, he rarely caught passes, but turns out, he\u2019s a better receiver than the Broncos imagined. He rarely had to block in college, but when asked to do it, he\u2019s exceeded expectations too. Most important, he\u2019s putting his mistakes behind him.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just kind of unwrapping the whole gift of what he can do,\u201d running backs coach Eric Studesville said.\n\nFor a player whose name dots the NCAA record books, the past has somehow become irrelevant. This is a new world, light years from that far-out St. Louis suburb and the comfort of Madison. Ball isn\u2019t dwelling on it, though.\n\nAfter all, he didn\u2019t tell that teacher he wanted to be a college star. He told her NFL, and here he is, that improbable goal unfolding in front of him.\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joanniesen\n\nNCAA star to pros\n\nMontee Ball set an NCAA record with 77 rushing touchdowns.
