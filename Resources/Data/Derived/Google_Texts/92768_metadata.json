Their courage is an example to all of us.\"\n\nFree Sign Up Newsletter!\n\nThe Becket Fund noted in its statement shared with The Christian Post that a new website has been set up to explain The Little Sisters' case against the Obamacare contraceptives mandate, ahead of a Supreme Court hearing is expected to take place in March.\n\nThe Catholic nuns group, which serves and takes care of the elderly poor, suffered a blow back in July after the 10th Circuit Court ruled that the Affordable Care Act mandate does not violate the rights of organizations, since it provides an accommodation that circumvents the organizations to provide birth control and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees.\n\nThe Little Sisters group has explained, however, that its issue is not the cost of the coverage, but being forced to participate in a plan that provides contraceptives and abortifacients, which go against Catholic beliefs.\n\nThe Little Sisters say the new website also provides a solution to the long-standing issue which both protects religious freedom and the right of the government to offer such services to women who want them.\n\n\"Rather than trying to force religious plans to offer these services, the better solution is for the government to provide these services through the ACA healthcare exchange to any employees who want them but can't get them through employer plans,\" the Little Sisters offers.\n\nAs the statement notes, in January over 200 members of Congress sent a brief to the Supreme Court in support of the Little Sisters.\n\n\"The government's defense of its so-called 'accommodation' for religious nonprofits \u2014 an 'accommodation' that requires petitioners to take an action they believe to be morally wrong \u2014 cannot satisfy the strict demands of [Religious Freedom Restoration Act],\" the brief contends.\n\n\"In questioning petitioners' assertion that the conduct compelled by HHS is morally wrong, the government ignores the repeated commands of this court.\"\n\nThe Catholic organization has insisted that it is not trying to prevent the government from providing such services, but objects to rules that would force the Little Sisters to provide them.\n\n\"Giving all women access to contraception through the healthcare exchange is a simpler and fairer way for the government to provide these services to more women while protecting the religious freedom of the Little Sisters, who never wanted this fight and just want to get back to caring for the elderly in need,\" the website adds.", "article_metadata":
