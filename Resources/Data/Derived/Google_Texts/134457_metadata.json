His signature mode is sarcasm.\n\nIt was on display last week when a lawyer made the mistake of saying that Justice Scalia was right \u2014 but only \u201cin a literal sense.\u201d\n\nReactions and Analysis\n\nThe justice pounced. \u201cOh, I see,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat sense are we talking here? Poetic?\u201d\n\nThere was laughter in the courtroom, and the lawyer was knocked off his stride.\n\nThe moment was routine. And there is little question that Justice Scalia is the most sarcastic member of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut it is one thing to make that assertion. It is another to quantify it.\n\nFor that, you would need a Sarcasm Index.\n\nLuckily, we live in an empirical age. Richard L. Hasen, a law professor and political scientist at the University of California, Irvine, has developed the necessary tools.\n\nJustice Scalia registered 2.78 on Professor Hasen\u2019s index, dwarfing the showings of every justice he has served with. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. came in a very distant second, at 0.43. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not even register.\n\nProfessor Hasen\u2019s methodology is clever but not airtight. He considered assessments of Supreme Court opinions in law review articles from 1986, when Justice Scalia joined the court, through the end of 2013.\n\nThere were 134 opinions described as sarcastic or caustic, and Justice Scalia wrote 75 of them, more than all the other justices combined. The index took that number and divided it by the number of years the justice has served.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral methodological objections come to mind. One is that law professors tend to be liberal and so may be more apt to criticize Justice Scalia, a conservative. But the rest of the index is about equally divided between liberal and conservative justices.\n\nAnother possible objection is that people repeat the conventional wisdom and reinforce stereotypes. Justice Scalia may be sarcastic in the way President Gerald R. Ford was said to have been clumsy and Vice President Dan Quayle dim.\n\nIn an interview, Professor Hasen said he had taken that possibility into account. \u201cMy control for that,\u201d he said, \u201cis that I live in the real world.\u201d\n\nJustice Scalia might have a different objection. \u201cI\u2019m a snoot,\u201d he once said.\n\n\u201cSnoots are those who are nit-pickers for the mot juste, for using a word precisely the way it should be used,\u201d he explained.\n\nProfessor Hasen, on the other hand, used a broad definition of sarcasm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a combination of harsh language and irony,\u201d he said. Many standard reference works agree, defining sarcasm to include hostile or contemptuous remarks.\n\nBut Justice Scalia would probably differ, based on a database search that revealed him to be a student of the question. He seemed to define sarcasm in a narrower way, as limited to saying one thing while meaning another.\n\nThe word sarcasm or a variant appeared five times in Supreme Court opinions since he joined the court, and he is the author of four of those opinions. (The fifth use of the word was in a quotation.) All four used the narrower definition.\n\nIn 1994, he rejected the argument that \u201cmodify\u201d can mean \u201cto change fundamentally.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018Modify,\u2019 in our view, connotes moderate change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt might be good English to say that the French Revolution \u2018modified\u2019 the status of the French nobility, but only because there is a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a 2000 dissent, he mocked the majority\u2019s reasoning as \u201ca wonderful replication (except for its lack of sarcasm) of Anatole France\u2019s observation that \u2018the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn a 2006 dissent, he said the majority\u2019s assertion that something not obvious was plainly so \u201crises to the level of sarcasm.\u201d\n\nAnd in a 2013 dissent, he said opponents of the ratification of the Constitution \u201csarcastically predicted that the general, suspicionless warrant would be among the Constitution\u2019s \u2018blessings.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAll of those examples concern sarcasm in the sense of irony. If the Sarcasm Index is to satisfy a snoot, it may need an adjustment. But Justice Scalia\u2019s primacy does not seem threatened under the narrower standard.\n\nJournalists like conflict and quotable remarks and so are indulgent of Justice Scalia\u2019s sarcasm. Professor Hasen, like many lawyers and scholars, disagrees.\n\n\u201cI think it is a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a great deal of value to civility, especially when the court is writing in a sensitive area.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible that Justice Scalia\u2019s sarcasm is counterproductive, alienating potential allies and inviting misreading. His deadpan put-downs of Justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, for instance, cannot have helped his relationships with them.\n\nAnd his acid dissent in a 2013 gay rights case helped propel the cause of same-sex marriage. The \u201clegalistic argle-bargle\u201d in Justice Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion, Justice Scalia wrote, suggested that it was only a matter of time until the court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\nLower court judges eagerly treated Justice Scalia\u2019s critique as prophecy, propelling the issue back to the Supreme Court, which on Friday agreed to hear four same-sex marriage cases. Should the court rule in favor of the couples seeking to marry, Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent will be one for the ages.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150119105001, "twitter": {"description": "A professor developed a measure for sarcasm by Supreme Court members, and Justice Antonin Scalia dwarfed the showings of every justice he has served with.", "title": "Scalia Lands at Top of Sarcasm Index of Justices.
