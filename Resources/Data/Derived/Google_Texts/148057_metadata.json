Reid is a Mormon, he has been an ardent supporter of LGBT rights and \u201cworked to ban workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d That\u2019s a big feather in Reid\u2019s political hat, according to the letter writer, considering the, well, extremely liberal and open-minded work practices of the ladies at the facility.\n\nAnother curious passage in the letter to the minority leader of the Senate notes that \u201cmany of your colleagues are intimately aware of our offerings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThere\u2019s no real explanation of exactly what that revelation means, but one doesn\u2019t have to exercise the imagination too greatly to get the point. The letter does mention that Sheri\u2019s Ranch offers \u201cnumerous Jacuzzi rooms popular with our friends from the political arena.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Harry Reid\u2019s office has not responded \u2014 at least not publicly \u2014 to the invitation from the very grateful \u201ccourtesans\u201d of one of Nevada\u2019s pleasure destinations.\n\nh/t: PJ Media\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We\u2019re sure that our venue will be a big hit with your friends, family, and co-workers...\"", "author": "Norvell Rose", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"We\u2019re sure that our venue will be a big hit with your friends, family, and co-workers...\"", "title": "Wow!
