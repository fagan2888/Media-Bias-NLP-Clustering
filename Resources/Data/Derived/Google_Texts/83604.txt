A popular artist is back for Chalk the Walk in downtown Sioux Falls.

After making headlines with his sidewalk chalk Superman last year, Mike Dowling decided to feature some popular little guys this year. Dowling thought the minions from "Despicable Me" would be fun for the kids. You'll find them on the ground near the Phillips Avenue Diner.

He says this three-dimensional art is something new and exciting.

"For me, it's just something different that I don't do on a daily basis. And when I saw this three-dimensional street art, I was just really intrigued by it. And I just wanted to give it a shot; see if I could do pull it off. And for me, it's just a satisfaction of doing something different. Doing something that the public likes. And just having fun with it," Dowling said.

The finished project features the minions with a hand in the air that children can stand on to give the illusion they are being held up.
