YUMA, Ariz. — At the Sunset Community Health Center, most of the people who were eager to sign up for the new health insurance marketplace when enrollment opened Oct. 1 don’t even bother showing up anymore. They’ve all been advised to wait until early December or to try enrolling on the phone or via snail mail.

“Nobody’s been able to sign up,” said Sylvia Armendariz, an eligibility-outreach worker who helps applicants navigate the process at the center. “Due to the system glitches we’ve had, it’s been unsuccessful for me to access the website ... You try to register and it freezes.”

At the Regional Center for Border Health in nearby Somerton, one person is assigned the task of logging in to the troubled HealthCare.gov federal site every morning and every afternoon to see if it’s finally up and running. So far, every attempt has been thwarted by error messages.

“My first experience was with somebody sitting down to register, and we had to reschedule the visit,” said Yadira Escamilla, a family coordinator and navigator who runs the center’s Women’s Health Clinical Services. “To me, it was kind of embarrassing, but it’s just out of my control.”

But just across the state line in California, more than 35,000 people have signed up for health care mandated by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Covered California, the state-run exchange, has generated complaints of long waits but has been largely spared the technical glitches that have brought the federal marketplace to a halt.

And so it goes for residents of the District of Columbia and the 16 states that have set up their own insurance exchanges and those in the 19 states that chose not to participate and left their residents to rely on the federal insurance marketplace. (The remaining 15 states are in a federal-state partnership.) The federal site’s troubles have generated calls to push back the enrollment deadline, something the Obama administration is resisting.
