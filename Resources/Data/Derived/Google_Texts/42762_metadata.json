The station almost turned itself into a pretzel to attack Obama\u2019s pledge to cure cancer without coming out in favor of the disease which took David Bowie and Alan Rickman this week.\n\nIt started even before the speech as Faux Fox Democrat Caddell Pre-Smears Obama\u2019s State Of The Union. However, it was preordained that Fox News Hates Obama\u2019s State Of The Union Address, Loves GOP Nikki Haley\u2019s Rebuttal.\n\nThose Foxy Friends on Fox & Friends provided several comedy bits. First, Fox\u2019s Dr. Marc Siegel: President Obama Is \u201cThe Wrong Commander-In-Chief For The War On Cancer\u201d:\n\nMARC SIEGEL: Absolutely, he\u2019s the wrong commander-in-chief for the war on cancer. Now 45 years ago, President Nixon actually put his money where his mouth is. He got $100 million, which was a lot in those days. He got the National Cancer Act passed. The National Cancer Institute started getting behind all the new treatments and research, and it led to 45 years of exciting advances in cancer. Now, right now, Anna, we\u2019re on the cusp of some major advances in cancer. So, President Obama\u2019s timing is right. We have personalized medicine coming out. We have immunotherapy where everybody\u2019s tumor is looked at as different than everybody else\u2019s, where we have treatments that cause the immune system to target the cancer, very, very, very exciting genetic treatments. But guess what won\u2019t cover this stuff? Obamacare. Because Obamacare is one size fits all. Obamacare is not going to say, hey, this cancer that you have that no one else has, we\u2019re going to get insurance to cover it. Obamacare is narrow networks of doctors. It doesn\u2019t include most of these major medical centers, the cancer institutes. It won\u2019t include these treatments that are $100,000 per year. And not only that, as you just said, it stifles innovation. $500 billion in taxes over ten years under Obamacare. Research and development is going on overseas. It\u2019s not going on here. STEVE DOOCY (HOST): Doctor, we certainly want them to eventually eradicate cancer. But, is, you know, is the national government being mobilized? You pointed out that Nixon asked for $100 million to fight cancer. Whereas, is this an actual effort on behalf of the Obama administration? Or is it an homage to Joe, who in the last year lost his son to cancer, and this would be a good project for him?\n\nAnother laff-riot was when Fox & Friends [said]: Obama Ripped His State Of The Union Speech From The West Wing by contrasting a snippet from that show with the SOTU:\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: With the new moon shot America can cure cancer. So tonight I\u2019m announcing a new national effort to get it done. Let\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. ROB LOWE ON THE WEST WING: We\u2019ve reached for the stars, and never have we been closer to having them in our grasp. And so I announce to you tonight, we will cure cancer by the end of this decade. DOOCY: Moon shot, reach for the stars. CLAYTON MORRIS: If you\u2019re going to rip off somebody, rip off Aaron Sorkin.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised how often Fox \u201cNews\u201d crops up in 6 Years of Right-Wing Media Attacks on Obama\u2019s State of the Union Addresses and Worst Right-Wing Media Reactions To Obama\u2019s Final State Of The Union Address, which is why\n\nThe Final Year Of Obama Derangement Syndrome Is Gonna Be A Doozy.\n\nIt\u2019s all a part of the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Channel\u2019s continued attack on PWB \u2014 POTUS WHILE BLACK.\n\nFox\u2019s Gutfeld: Obama Was\n\nNominated Because \u201cHistorical Black\n\nBeats Historical White\u201d Woman\n\nFox\u2019s Geraldo Rivera:\n\n\u201cThe Nation Was Not Ready\n\nFor A Black President\u201d\n\nBlack Fox News Guest Says\n\nBlack Americans are \u2018Poorer,\n\nDumber and More Criminalized\u2019\n\nDoocy: You talk about over the last 40 years, trillions of dollars have been put to fight poverty, yet poverty is proliferating in many neighborhoods because? Crystal Wright: Well, because of Democrats and the con that they\u2019re running on black Americans. They have made black Americans poorer, dumber, and more criminalized. Doocy: Why do you say that? That\u2019s their end game? Wright: It\u2019s not just me. Look, 93% of, you know how the President goes around, wants to talk about regulating legal gun ownership? I\u2019ve never seen Barack Obama talk about the black lives being killed by other blacks in Chicago DC, or Baltimore. 93% of all black homicides are committed by other black people. And you know the number one cause of death among young black men ages 15 to 34? Guns! Illegal guns, cuz [t]hey\u2019re killin\u2019 each other! That\u2019s the con job. But yet, black people keep voting against their interests, and I would argue the Democrat Party is literally killing black Americans from the womb to the streets.\n\nThe pre-interview ensures Fox knew exactly what she was going to say, which is a message Fox wanted to convey.\n\nMeanwhile, after Donald Trump says Tavis Smiley is a racist, Watch Tavis Smiley brilliantly deflect Fox News talking points on race on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d and it\u2019s just fun as Smiley Hits Back at Trump for Calling Him Racist: \u2018I\u2019m Not the One Who Went After Muslims.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not just racism. Fox \u201cNews\u201d excels in xenophobia, as this exchange on The Five demonstrates perfectly:\n\nFox\u2019s Eric Bolling Calls El Chapo\n\n\u2018The One Mexican We Want\u2019\n\nBefore Bolling spoke on the subject, cohost Greg Gutfeld \u201cquipped\u201d about El Chapo, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he go to San Francisco? It\u2019s a sanctuary city!\u201d \u201cHow about taking him to Gitmo?\u201d cohost Dana Perino \u201casked.\u201d \u201cOh, sorry, all closed up,\u201d cohost Kimberly Guilfoyle snarked. Then it was Bolling\u2019s turn. BOLLING: The one Mexican we want, we can\u2019t get over here and put him in jail. Instead\u2026 Later, after realizing the import of what he had just said, Bolling asked, \u201cCan I just clarify my comment? The one \u201cillegal\u201d Mexican.\u201d \u201cThis is why the Republicans will lose the election,\u201d cohost Geraldo Rivera added.\n\nYa think?\n\nIn a totally misogynist attack on all those brilliant journalists, Sports Writer Attacks Female Fox News Hosts for \u2018Dressing Like Hookers,\u2019 which is merely FFF\u2018s excuse to play this video from a few years back extolling these journalistic geniuses.\n\nIt\u2019s a toe-tapper.\n\nPASSAGES: According to a recent Gabriel Sherman story at New York Magazine, With Roger Ailes Absent, Fox News Is Drifting \u2014 There Isn\u2019t Even a \u2018Trump Strategy,\u2019 which essentially reports that Roger Ailes Reportedly \u201cA Diminished Force\u201d At Fox News. Among the pull quotes NewsHounds identifies is this one that caught my attention:\n\nThe succession question seems to be taking on new urgency after three sources say Ailes threatened to quit this summer when Murdoch elevated his sons, Lachlan and James, to take over the media empire. After their promotions were announced, Ailes put out his own statement on Fox Business that declared he would continue reporting directly to Rupert. Eventually, an uneasy accord was reached: Rupert gave Ailes a new contract, but Fox issued a follow-up press release clarifying that Ailes would report to Rupert as well as Lachlan and James. Since that stinging public rebuke, executives have noticed Rupert around the Fox News hallways. \u201cHe\u2019s marking his territory,\u201d one person briefed on the matter told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a pissing match with Roger. Rupert is basically saying, \u2018I know you built this place, but I own it and I\u2019ll remind you of that by coming here.'\u201d\n\nHowever, he could be marking his territory for an entirely different reason: a show of testosterone to impress his new finance:\n\nWhich led to the funniest thing I saw all week:\n\nThere\u2019s nothing suspicious in the timing that Neil Cavuto Signs New Deal With Fox News Channel just before the debate. This comes as Satview cuts Fox News channel:\n\nSatview Broadband in Elko [Nevada] says its decision to cut Fox News from its channel offerings was a result of Fox raising rates. \u201cFox News raised our rates and asked us to carry programs that nobody watches,\u201d Satview President Tariq Ahmad said in a phone interview Wednesday. Fox News reportedly told the cable company that in order to continue offering its channel, Satview would also have to carry Fox Business. \u201cI said no,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t want to play games. Somebody has to stand up for it.\u201d\n\nHowever, even Fox admits that no one watches FBN as it announced Fox Business Network Will Unbundle Channel Before Debate So More People Can Watch.\n\nSPEAKING OF LAST NIGHT\u2019S GOP DEBATE: Al Jazeera Points Out Fox News\u2019 Climate Change Denial Ahead Of Fox Business\u2019 Debate \u2022 Fox\u2019s Eric Bolling Advises GOP Debaters To Turn Every Debate Question \u201cInto A Hillary Clinton Takedown\u201d \u2022 Megyn Kelly, Krauthammer Praise Trump for \u2018New York Values\u2019 Smackdown \u2022 The Fox Business Debate Is A Complete Disaster For The Republican Party \u2022 Here Are The Winners And Losers From The Fox Business Republican Debate \u2022 5 Reasons To Be Glad That You Didn\u2019t Watch The Fox Business Republican Debate\n\nOnly 5???\n\nEVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN: The Trump/Kelly feud is back on:\n\nJealous Donald Trump\n\nAttacks Megyn Kelly Again,\n\nSays Nobody Wants To Woo Her\n\nTrump: \u2018Who the hell\n\nwants to woo\u2019 Megyn Kelly?\n\nDonald Trump Won\u2019t Stand\n\nFor Claims That He Wooed\n\nThe \u2018So Average\u2019 Megyn Kelly\n\nYet, almost as if suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome:\n\nFox News Has Given Donald\n\nTrump Nearly $30 Million In Free\n\nAirtime During The Presidential Campaign\n\nClearly no Trump strategy.\n\nSPEAKING OF TOTALLY BIASED MEGYN KELLY: Megyn Kelly Hams Up Outrage That Philly Officials Are \u2018So Focused On Protecting Islam\u2019 In Wake Of Cop Shooting \u2022 Fox\u2019s Kelly On Muslim Immigration: \u201cIs Germany Over As We Know It? Is Europe?\u201d \u2022 Megyn Kelly Attacks DNC Chair For Inviting A Muslim Representative From CAIR To State Of The Union Address \u2022 Megyn Kelly Yells At DNC Chair Over CAIR Muslims At State Of The Union \u2022 Megyn Kelly Grills DNC Chair For Saying Nikki Haley Chosen to Address GOP \u2018Diversity Problem\u2019 \u2022 Megyn Kelly Hides Her Racial Animosity Toward Obama During Tavis Smiley Interview\n\nMUSLIMS, BENGHAZI, & XENOPHOBIA: You just know if this was Hillary Clinton, Fox \u201cNews\u201d would be hammering this home 24/7. However, Fox News Ignores Evidence To Absolve Cruz Of Wrongdoing In FEC Filing.\n\nLast week FFF demonstrated how Fox \u201cNews\u201d is using the movie 13 Hours to resurrect Benghazi BS. It continues as Fox\u2019s Kilmeade Uses Benghazi Movie To Push Debunked \u201cStand Down Order\u201d Myth.\n\nFor the uninitiated here are Four Benghazi \u201cBombshells\u201d That Turned Out To Be Duds. Watch:\n\nThen there\u2019s always this as Fox Hosts Say Discriminatory Stop And Frisk, Mosque Surveillance Measures \u201cMake Total Sense\u201d And Are \u201cSuccessful\u201d because that\u2019s \u2018Merka for ya.\n\nCREDIT WHERE CREDIT\u2019S DUE: Sure, he\u2019s promoting a new book, but he was telling the truth when Greg Gutfeld On The Daily Show Calls Trump \u2018A Classic Rock Band With Four Hits.\u2019 However, the audience turned quickly when Daily Show Crowd Jeers Fox\u2019s Greg Gutfeld For Dissing Rest of World.\n\nAlso accidentally telling the truth, Even Fox\u2019s Brian Kilmeade Slammed The NRA Lobbyist Who Skipped Obama\u2019s Town Hall On Gun Violence.\n\nWho else told the truth this week?\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly: \u201cOn The Right,\n\nMany Despise The President\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly Confronts GOP\u2019s Portrayal\n\nOf Immigrants: \u201cPoor People\n\nSeeking Better Lives Are Not Villains\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly: GOP Should Stand Firm\n\non Immigration But Stop the \u2018Hating\u2019\n\nAnd then The Falafel King spoils it by remarks like this:\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly: \u201cThe Fact Is That\n\nMost Of The Terror Violence In the\n\nWorld Comes Out Of Muslim Precincts\u201d\n\nHowever, for sheer Loofah Lad Laughs, get a load of this:\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly promises to \u2018flee\u2019 to Ireland\n\nif Bernie Sanders becomes president\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly Vows, \u2018I\u2019m Fleeing\u2019\n\nTo Ireland If Bernie Sanders Elected\n\nAs NewsHounds writes:\n\nThis is at least the fourth time we have caught O\u2019Reilly threatening to stomp off with his money rather than pay more taxes. In 2011, he threatened to retire if his income taxes went over 50% and to stop investing \u201cat the level I am now\u201d if his capital gains taxes went over 20%. In 2012, he made a similar threat and said he\u2019d move his money out of the country rather than pay higher taxes. That same month, he had also threatened to stop \u201caggressively putting any money in the market.\u201d After pledging to leave the country rather than live under a Sanders presidency, O\u2019Reilly had the nerve to complain that Sanders won\u2019t come on The O\u2019Reilly Factor any more. \u201cWe made him who he is today,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. America could say the same thing to O\u2019Reilly. Oh, snappity, snap snap.\n\nHowever, the best reaction was a reaction to the Factor blowhard and others as Irish People Watch The Worst of Fox News\n\nNow, that\u2019s comedy!!!\n\nWARMONGERS\u2019 CORNER: Or, hoping to ignite World War Last:\n\n\u2018Merkin \u2018Ceptionalism!\n\nAL CAPONE\u2019S VAULT IS STILL EMPTY:\n\nAndrea Tantaros and Geraldo Rivera\n\nTear Into Each Other About\n\nGerman Refugee Crisis\n\nGeraldo and Tantaros get into\n\nshouting match when she accuses\n\nrefugees of being dangerous\n\nGeraldo Defends Sean Penn:\n\nHe Was \u2018Risking a Lot\u2019\n\nfor El Chapo Interview\n\nAs empty as Geraldo\u2019s head.\n\nFOX BYTES: Fox\u2019s Eric Bolling Calls Sesame Street A \u201cLeft-Wing Communist Diatribe\u201d \u2022 Fox\u2019s Varney Pretends Strongest Jobs Report Of 2015 Is Merely \u201cModest\u201d \u2022 Fox\u2019s Heather Nauert Dishonestly Upbeat About Dismantling Of Kentucky Health Insurance Exchange \u2022 Fox Faux Liberal Admits She Hates Hillary Clinton \u2022 On Fox & Friends: Women\u2019s Issues Interview Just More GOP Partisan Politics \u2022 Fox\u2019s Stuart Varney: Cecile Richards Is A \u201cVillain\u201d And It\u2019s \u201cVillainous\u201d To Fund Planned Parenthood \u2022 Fox\u2019s Wallace Falsely Claims Obama\u2019s Executive Actions On Gun Violence Violate The Constitution \u2022 Fox Host Falsely Claims Obama\u2019s Executive Actions On Gun Violence Threaten The Second Amendment \u2022 Fox News Guest Tells Viewers: Buy All The Lottery Tickets You Can Afford \u2022 On Fox The Blaze\u2019s Dana Loesch Calls Gender Pay Inequality \u201cAn Absolute Myth\u201d\n\nHeadly Westerfield forges Friday Fox Follies from internet flotsam and jetsam when he\u2019s not writing for the Not Now Silly Newsroom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's are so many unintended laughs on the Fox \"News\" Channel that maybe it's not just comedy but meta-comedy because the laugh's on you.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Headly Westerfield", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "There's are so many unintended laughs on the Fox \"News\" Channel that maybe it's not just comedy but meta-comedy because the laugh's on you.", "title": "Friday Fox Follies - Funny Is As Funny Does", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/01/15/friday-fox-follies-funny-funny.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fox-sotu.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-15T21:12:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Media,Friday Fox Follies,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Media", "published_time": "2016-01-15T21:12:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T21:12:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Friday Fox Follies"}, "article_summary": "EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN: The Trump/Kelly feud is back on:Jealous Donald TrumpAttacks Megyn Kelly Again,Says Nobody Wants To Woo HerTrump: \u2018Who the hellwants to woo\u2019 Megyn Kelly?\nSPEAKING OF TOTALLY BIASED MEGYN KELLY: Megyn Kelly Hams Up Outrage That Philly Officials Are \u2018So Focused On Protecting Islam\u2019 In Wake Of Cop Shooting \u2022 Fox\u2019s Kelly On Muslim Immigration: \u201cIs Germany Over As We Know It?\nSo much struck Friday Fox Follies funny this week, starting with the Fox \u201cNews\u201d reaction over President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union.\nHowever, it was preordained that Fox News Hates Obama\u2019s State Of The Union Address, Loves GOP Nikki Haley\u2019s Rebuttal.\nIt started even before the speech as Faux Fox Democrat Caddell Pre-Smears Obama\u2019s State Of The Union."}
