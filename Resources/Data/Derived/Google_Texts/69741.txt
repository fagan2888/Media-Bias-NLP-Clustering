The U.S. economy is at a critical juncture. The Federal Reserve's very easy monetary policy during the past few years has been the root of both good and ill: reduced unemployment on the one hand and increased financial risks on the other. The danger now is that the inevitable rise in interest rates over the next few years could cause substantial losses to banks and investors that, in turn, could weaken the economy's overall performance and lead to another economic downturn. The Federal Reserve's unconventional monetary policy during the past five years—the combination of massive purchases of long-term bonds and its promise to keep short-term rates very low for a very long time—caused a sharp rise in the stock market and in the prices of owner-occupied homes.
