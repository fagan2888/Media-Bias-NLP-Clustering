Medicaid expansion may also drive the trend, as it has largely boosted hospitals' bottom lines, making them more apt to seek traveling nurses to cover staffing gaps.\n\nEven before the recent rise in demand, traveling nurses have long helped hospitals keep pace with seasonal admissions surges, particularly in areas where large numbers of retirees stay during winter months, according to the article. Today, in addition to the traditional Southeastern states, Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Oregon and California also are popular destinations for traveling nurses, Leslie Brown, branch manager of healthcare staffing company Aureus Medical Group, said in a statement.\n\nHigh-demand specialties for traveling nurses include intensive care units, emergency departments, operating rooms, and labor and delivery, Brown said, adding that it's vital that nurses become \"lifelong learners\" in regard to electronic health record systems in order to remain marketable for these jobs.\n\nIn regard to patient safety, research has shown that not only is there no link between use of travel nurses and patient mortality, but also that \"hiring temporary nurses can alleviate shortages that could produce higher patient mortality,\" Linda Aiken, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research, told KHN.\n\nHowever, traveling nurses do have one main drawback--their cost. Though they do help patch up staffing shortages, traveling nurses often make significantly more per hour than their permanent counterparts, which is why Northside Hospital in Atlanta has a \"love-hate\" relationship with them even as it has increased their ranks by 52 percent since last year, human resources manager David Votta told KHN. Yet previous research has indicated that the use of temporary nursing staff can actually save hospitals money, FierceHealthFinance has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the KHN article\n\n- here's the Aureus Medical Group statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTemporary nurses can often cost hospitals less than permanent staff\n\nHospitals reap rewards of Medicaid expansion\n\nSurvey: Nurse understaffing, fatigue threatens patient safety\n\nQualifications of traveling nurses questioned\n\nHospital labor study reveals hidden costs of nurses", "article_metadata": {"description": "Declining unemployment in the U.S. and an uptick in the number of Americans who have health coverage have increased demand for healthcare, which in turn has sparked a surge in employment opportunities for\u00a0traveling nurses,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Declining unemployment in the U.S. and an uptick in the number of Americans who have health coverage have increased demand for healthcare, which in turn has sparked a surge in employment opportunities for\u00a0traveling nurses,\u00a0Kaiser Health News\u00a0reports.", "title": "ACA, better economy spark surge in use of traveling nurses", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/aca-better-economy-spark-surge-use-traveling-nurses/2015-05-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Care Delivery,electronic health records (EHRs),Hospital Staffing,HR & Workforce Management,Northside Hospital,Traveling Nurses", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management"}, "article_summary": "However, traveling nurses do have one main drawback--their cost.\nAn improving U.S. economy and an uptick in the number of Americans who have health coverage have increased demand for healthcare, which in turn has racheted up employment opportunities for traveling nurses, Kaiser Health News reports.\nMedicaid expansion may also drive the trend, as it has largely boosted hospitals' bottom lines, making them more apt to seek traveling nurses to cover staffing gaps.\nYet previous research has indicated that the use of temporary nursing staff can actually save hospitals money, FierceHealthFinance has reported.\nEven before the recent rise in demand, traveling nurses have long helped hospitals keep pace with seasonal admissions surges, particularly in areas where large numbers of retirees stay during winter months, according to the article."}
