What was once a way of acknowledging the Lord\u2019s day became, over time, a way of enabling both hunters and hikers to enjoy the Commonwealth\u2019s numerous forests and parks. Many hikers feel scared of wandering into the wrong place during hunting season. A ban on Sunday hunting gives them the confidence to hit the trails. In recent years, however, hunters have been pushing for an end to the ban. And last week, a bill to do so was approved by the Massachusetts House. When it comes up for a vote in the Senate, however, senators should vote it down. Better to maintain a policy that evenly balances the interests of hunters and hikers who both want to use the same forests.\n\nThe proposed amendment would allow bow and arrow hunting on Sundays during deer season \u2014 the last three months of the year. Supporters contend that accidents are rare, and the vast majority of hunters are respectful of hikers. Similar attempts to allow hunting on Sundays, such as one in Connecticut, have been put forward as a way to help control the deer population; but the Massachusetts deer population is relatively stable. Hunting is allowed in most state forests, and on private land unless the landowner posts no-hunting signs. (Some towns only allow hunting with the express permission of the landowner.)\n\nBut regardless of how unlikely an accident is, the fear of being caught up in one is still enough to keep some people from walking their dogs, or bringing their children, to the woods. It would be unreasonable for the state to disregard their interests, especially when hunting is allowed on the other six days of the week.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.4181108414", "eomportal-id": 533352, "description": "A ban on Sunday hunting gives hikers and families the confidence to explore the woods.", "eomportal-instanceid": 29, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "A ban on Sunday hunting gives hikers and families the confidence to explore the woods.", "title": "Sunday hunting ban still makes sense - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/06/07/sunday-hunting-ban-still-makes-sense/NM3ZhkO5AR0kI9SLwBD9QI/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/06/06/BostonGlobe.com/EditorialOpinion/Advance/Images/01122012_12wedeer7-8152201.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Sunday hunting ban,hunting,forests,woods,Senate", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 19:55:24 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Sunday hunting ban,hunting,forests,woods,Senate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "5d90765e-ec25-11e3-a10e-133bd607fa97"}, "article_summary": "(Some towns only allow hunting with the express permission of the landowner.)\nThe proposed amendment would allow bow and arrow hunting on Sundays during deer season \u2014 the last three months of the year.\nA ban on Sunday hunting gives them the confidence to hit the trails.\nMany hikers feel scared of wandering into the wrong place during hunting season.\nSimilar attempts to allow hunting on Sundays, such as one in Connecticut, have been put forward as a way to help control the deer population; but the Massachusetts deer population is relatively stable."}
