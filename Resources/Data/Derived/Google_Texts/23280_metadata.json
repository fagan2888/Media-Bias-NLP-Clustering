The bill responds with a jingle that he is an \u201cimmigration bill\u201d and that he hopes he can be passed into law someday. Cue the President shoving the bill down the stairs before inviting his buddy, the cigarette smoking \u201cexecutive order,\u201d into the picture. The boy exclaims in bewilderment that what the President is doing is unconstitutional, but the executive order just laughs at the boy\u2019s belief that he still thinks that is how government works.\n\nLet\u2019s check that video out, via YouTube:\n\nBut wait! There\u2019s more!\n\nPJTatler tartly reports that, based on Univision and Telemundo surveys, our first American Emperor\u2019s latest unconstitutional decree is actually opposed by a majority of Latino voters, many of whom have immigrated and/or become U.S. citizens via the standard process.\n\nBy a margin of 56 percent to 40 percent, Hispanic voters oppose allowing illegal immigrants to obtain federal benefits, including Obamacare benefits, \u201cwhile they are going through the legalization process and before the 90% goal is reached.\u201d\n\nThis Executive order is a winner, for sure.\n\nMeanwhile, the nation continues to eagerly await the imminent, assured destruction of Ferguson, Missouri.
