The event is scheduled from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the lower level of the mall at 2200 Hilltop Mall Road.

Curry's appearance comes with little time to spare before the Monday deadline to enroll to receive coverage by Jan. 1.

In preparation for the deadline, Covered California call centers in Concord, Fresno and Rancho Cordova are expanding their hours on Sunday to run between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

Open enrollment in a health care plan ends on March 31, which is the deadline for most uninsured people to enroll in a plan without facing a tax penalty.

Californians interested in enrolling or learning more about the plans they qualify for under the Affordable Care Act may call (800) 300-1506.
