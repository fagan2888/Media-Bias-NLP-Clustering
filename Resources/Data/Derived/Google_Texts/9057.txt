A study from the Office Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Serivces showed that almost $3 billion in Obamacare subsidies to insurance companies cannot be tracked. According to the Washington Free Beacon, they also cannot determine if the amounts were correct, or even if they went to the right individuals.

The report began with this statement:

“CMS’s internal controls did not effectively ensure the accuracy of nearly $2.8 billion in aggregate financial assistance payments made to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act during the first 4 months that these payments were made. We determined that CMS’s internal controls for calculating and authorizing financial assistance payments were not effective.”

They added that despite previous recommendations of how to address these issues, they are still unable to determine if the “new calculation methodology allows for the type of discrepancies” they uncovere,d and that “a significant amount of Federal funds are at risk.”

Subsidies like these may no longer be allowed at all, depending on the results of a long-awaited ruling on King V Burwell, a case heard before the Supreme Court this past March.

At issue is whether Obamacare allows subsidies to states that did not set up state insurance exchanges. The ruling is expected any day.
