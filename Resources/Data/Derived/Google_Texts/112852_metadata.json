My new friend may well have been quoting propaganda directly off the organization\u2019s website. The nonprofit, which was formed in 2010 and is not required to name its donors, wants onlookers to believe it is \u201ca citizens\u2019 movement of Democrats, Republicans and independents dedicated to a new politics of problem solving.\u201d\n\nThe following morning, as my brother, our videographer, was pinning microphones on our lapels, Grayson told me he had heard of the group. He was friendly with some of its Democratic members. One day, in anticipation of her chance to demonstrate her commitment to the group\u2019s professed ideals, one of his colleagues expressed to him her plan to sit on the Republican side of the chamber during the president\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really gonna regret that,\u201d he cautioned her. But the member didn\u2019t listen. \u201cShe regretted it,\u201d he told me. \u201cEvery time anyone among the Republicans stood up and applauded, she sat down. And every time she stood up and applauded no one else did. So much for \u2018No labels.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe power to parse bullshit is an honored prize among truth seekers, and it was this power of Grayson\u2019s that drew me to him when he was attacking House Republicans during the Obamacare clashes of 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty and pride tonight to be able to announce exactly what the Republicans plan to do for health care in America,\u201d the former lawyer said in one of the House\u2019s most memorable performances that year. \u201cIt\u2019s this: Very simply \u2026 don\u2019t get sick. And if you do get sick, die quickly.\u201d\n\nSome of the larger left\u2019s more genteel members take issue with this kind of treatment of those on the right-hand side of the aisle. I asked Grayson about the incompetence of those he targeted. He didn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Congress is incompetent,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that the people in charge here in the House are serving their corporate masters and are doing so quite effectively and are doing it as effectively as they possibly can. They\u2019re doing everything they can to defeat any sort of progress in the country, whether you\u2019re talking about inequality or health care, or whether you\u2019re talking about jobs or education. They\u2019re very good at it, and my hat is off to them, except for the fact that I think of all the suffering that entails in the lives of ordinary people all around America, which they seem to be utterly inured to. They just don\u2019t care. They\u2019re calloused, bigoted tools and they\u2019re acting for the benefit of their corporate patrons who are the real owners of the Republican Party. The fact is that Congress is gridlocked because that\u2019s the way corporate interests want it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nCriticism has followed the congressman\u2019s inflammatory style from the start, but anyone mildly acquainted with the facts knows his assessment corresponds with the truth. Throughout the legislative battles of the early Obama years, the corporate-owned, right-wing media carefully painted the whole of the party to which Grayson belongs as inflexible and constitutionally unwilling to compromise with their more conservative peers. The unfortunate and regrettable fact is that little could be further from the truth. But even if it were true, standing alone, that account ignores the history of the death of congeniality in Congress at large. It was killed by Republicans themselves, by Newt Gingrich in particular during the conservative revival of the 1980s and early \u201990s.\n\nMuch like the successes of the right, it is impossible to deny that Grayson\u2019s tactics have worked, and done so to the clear benefit of the public. After hounding Republicans zealously during his first term, he was named the most effective member of the House by Slate magazine midway through his second term in 2013 for passing more amendments than any of his colleagues\u2014a significant achievement in a chamber dominated by the opposing party. His bills included a corporate death penalty for contractors who broke the law, a prohibition on law enforcement\u2019s purchase of weaponized drones and a 50 percent increase in financial assistance for non-English speakers who are unable to negotiate housing agreements without the help of a translator. These were \u201cnot bills to rename post offices,\u201d he told me, but \u201cimportant amendments that were actually progressive values expressed and embodied.\u201d\n\nIn a city where evil often gets its way through the obfuscation of meaning, the names applied to Grayson\u2019s bills are respectfully straightforward. A student of George Orwell\u2019s writings on the liberating potential of plain speech, Grayson has sponsored the \u201cMedicare You Can Buy Into Act\u201d, the \u201cSeniors Have Eyes, Ears and Teeth Act\u201d and the \u201cWar Is Making You Poor Act.\u201d In response to revelations of domestic spying by the National Security Agency, in January he introduced the \u201cBig Brother Is Not Watching You Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "alan grayson, capitalism, fireband, florida, healthcare, house of representatives, illegal immigrants, inequality, latino americas, orlando, politics of joy, populism, republicans, truthdigger of the week, us congress, wall street", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "If the Democratic Party has an honorable future in America, it lies with firebrands of populism like Alan Grayson.\n - 2014/03/22", "title": "Truthdigger of the Week: Rep.
