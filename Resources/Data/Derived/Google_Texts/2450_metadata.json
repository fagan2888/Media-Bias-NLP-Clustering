The county posted a request for bids Tuesday.\n\nWilliam Scheffel, Centene's chief financial officer, attributed some of the company's 39 percent revenue growth in the second quarter ended in June to the Cook County deal, he said during an investors conference call last week.\n\nCentene officials have not issued a statement about the Cook County deal and could not be reached for comment Thursday or early Friday.\n\nThe Tribune previously reported that the deal with IlliniCare, which began in July 2014, was worth up to $1.8 billion over five years. IlliniCare will continue to serve as the so-called third-party administrator during the search for a replacement.\n\nThe role is also critical for Cook County because the health system has taken on the risk of insuring more of its patients.\n\nThe health system started its own managed care plan in 2012 to enroll patients who gained insurance through the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe health plan, known as CountyCare, provides coverage for more than 170,000 Cook County residents, including traditional Medicare beneficiaries. And for the first time in its history, the health system has to compete for patients.\n\nOne of its competitors is IlliniCare, which runs a managed care plan for Medicaid recipients in Cook, DuPage, Lake, Kane, Kankakee and Will counties.\n\nThe competition became a conflict for the county. The health system \"believes that CountyCare would be best served by a (third-party administrator) that does not operate a competing plan moving forward,\" spokeswoman Alexandra Normington said in a statement.\n\nThe timing of such a big change could be disruptive, as the health system finds itself on solid financial footing for the first time in decades.\n\nThe public system has long been the safety net for the low-income, uninsured population in Cook County, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in uncompensated care every year and becoming a drain for taxpayers.\n\nIn the last fiscal year ended Nov. 30, uncompensated care fell to $340 million, from more than $500 million the year before. Nearly two-thirds of county patients were insured last year, up from 45 percent before Obamacare.\n\nTo keep the momentum going, the health system has to keep a close eye on costs, and that's where a third-party administrator comes in, providing data analysis and risk management services. IlliniCare was the only company to bid on the Medicaid contract in 2013.\n\nCook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin, D-Evanston, said he was not bothered by the abrupt cancellation of IlliniCare's contract.\n\n\"In the long run this is probably good for our system because it will give us a little more control in what is a constantly changing market situation,\" Suffredin said. \"I don't think we're going to lose ground.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Centene shares dip, recover after news of Cook contract loss", "date": "2015-08-07", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Shares of health insurer Centene fell in early trading Friday before rebounding, a day after the Chicago Tribune reported that one of the firm's subsidiaries will lose a Medicaid contract with Cook County valued at up to $1.8 billion over five years.", "title": "Centene shares dip, recover after news of Cook contract loss", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-centene-cook-share-0807-biz-20150807-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55c4f745/turbine/ct-centene-cook-share-0807-biz-20150807", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84164308", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Centene Corporation, IlliniCare Health, CountyCare, provides", "news_keywords": "Centene Corporation, IlliniCare Health, CountyCare, provides", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Shares of health insurer Centene fell in early trading Friday before rebounding, a day after the Chicago Tribune reported that one of the firm's subsidiaries will lose a Medicaid contract with Cook County valued at up to $1.8 billion over five years."}, "article_summary": "Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin, D-Evanston, said he was not bothered by the abrupt cancellation of IlliniCare's contract.\nCentene officials have not issued a statement about the Cook County deal and could not be reached for comment Thursday or early Friday.\nThe health plan, known as CountyCare, provides coverage for more than 170,000 Cook County residents, including traditional Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe role is also critical for Cook County because the health system has taken on the risk of insuring more of its patients.\nAnd for the first time in its history, the health system has to compete for patients."}
