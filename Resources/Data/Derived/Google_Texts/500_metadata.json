What do infectious disease specialists wear during an outbreak? Do surgeons really say \u201cStat!\u201d? In a bright office building in Beverly Hills, Kate Langrall Folb and her team at Hollywood, Health, and Society are on call to field queries from the mundane to the obscure. \u201cOperators are standing by,\u201d Folb, the group\u2019s director, often tells TV and movie writers. The organization was established with money from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2001 to provide the entertainment industry with free, accurate health information. Since then, the group has worked with hundreds of television writers as they tell stories about performing complicated surgeries, coping with depression and fighting insurance companies for coverage. They consulted on Walter White\u2019s cancer battle in Breaking Bad and on Max Braverman\u2019s Asperger\u2019s syndrome in Parenthood. They advised writers for Law & Order on an unvaccinated child who infected a classmate and on Disney\u2019s Doc McStuffins on treating her broken toys. And as millions of people gain coverage through the nation\u2019s landmark health law, they are also providing producers with information for storylines about Obamacare.\n\nThe CDC now provides between $300,000 to $500,000 a year in funding, along with other sources. Hollywood, Health, and Society relies on a roster of experts around the nation, even bringing medical professionals into writers\u2019 rooms and taking producers on field trips\u2014including to the county morgue. Recently, the center convened producers, writers, health experts, and patients to discuss the Affordable Care Act. They delved into topics including enrollment problems, obstacles to mental-health treatment and coverage for immigrant families, with the goal of \u201cinspiring and informing\u201d writers, Folb said. Related Story Healthcare in the Time of Grey's Anatomy \u201cThe arrival of Obamacare has meant that the [health] stories get a brand-new dimension,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California, which oversees Hollywood, Health, and Society. The health law has already made an appearance in both English and Spanish-language shows, including Two Broke Girls and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. \u201cIt was so fun to be able to do a story where we could put in the actual word Obamacare,\u201d said Grey\u2019s Anatomy story editor Meg Marinis, who frequently calls the organization with questions. Hollywood, Health, and Society staff members acknowledge the stories on medical dramas can be obscure and unlikely. In the Grey\u2019s Anatomy episode, for instance, a character came to the hospital with lingering stomach pain after getting insurance through the Affordable Care Act. When he arrived, the show\u2019s doctors found an unusual condition: The man had absorbed his own twin at birth. But dramatic scenarios like this also draw viewers, who may pick up some useful information along the way. Television has tremendous reach and impact. In one Kaiser Family Foundation study, for instance, viewers\u2019 knowledge that treatment could lower the risk of HIV transmission from mothers to their unborn children increased dramatically after watching a television show. The study also showed that people\u2019s attitudes changed after the episode\u2014the number of people who thought the pregnant, HIV-positive character was irresponsible decreased.\n\n\u201cEven a short mention can influence how people think about these things,\u201d said Tina Hoff, senior vice president at the foundation, which has long partnered with television and other organizations on health storylines and has previously done research with the USC group. Grey\u2019s Anatomy executive producer Dr. Zoanne Clack, who is on the board of Hollywood, Health & Society, puts it another way. She said she used to see about 30 people during a 12-hour shift as an emergency-room physician, providing a limited window for health education. Through the show, however, she can reach as many as 15 million people a week. Clack said she doesn\u2019t want to bore viewers by preaching, so she tries to put \u201cpublic health education messages into people\u2019s heads without them even knowing it.\u201d For writers and producers, the challenge is to balance dramatic tension against the sometimes complicated or mundane realities of health care. How do you tell a story of a potentially long illness in a short time frame? How do you take a complex subject like insurance and make it understandable and interesting? These questions crop up constantly, said Chasing Life executive producer Patrick Sean Smith. He regularly asks the USC group and other medical sources for guidance on the program, which follows a 24-year-old cancer patient named April Carver. He often follows their recommendations\u2014though not always. For instance, a medical adviser for the show said real-life doctors would have a character like Carver begin treatment immediately after being diagnosed, but Smith decided to push the treatment off because he didn\u2019t want the character stuck in a hospital for the whole show. Smith said he isn\u2019t making a documentary but he also feels a tremendous responsibility to get the information right for viewers, including those who are cancer patients and survivors. \u201cWe want to be as authentic to them as possible,\u201d he said. Hoff sees another benefit to accuracy in plotlines \u2014it can help clear up confusion about the nation\u2019s health law, which research suggests is widely misunderstood. \"It's not brain surgery. It's theatrics. It has to be entertaining or it's not going to air.\" But Levi Russell, spokesman for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, said inserting storylines about the law into TV shows is a little \u201ccreepy.\u201d \u201cIt is pretty difficult to imagine that there is going to be an honest discussion with two different viewpoints represented if it is done by Hollywood writers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not just an issue of entertainment. This is an extremely expensive and complicated piece of legislation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A CDC-funded organization has advised TV shows from Grey&#39;s Anatomy to Law & Order on how to write plots that deal with medical and health-insurance issues.", "author": "Anna Gorman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A CDC-funded organization has advised TV shows from Grey&#39;s Anatomy to Law & Order on how to write plots that deal with medical and health-insurance issues.", "title": "Hollywood's Health Experts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/09/greys/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/hollywoods-health-experts/380539/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Recently, the center convened producers, writers, health experts, and patients to discuss the Affordable Care Act.\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy executive producer Dr. Zoanne Clack, who is on the board of Hollywood, Health & Society, puts it another way.\nThe health law has already made an appearance in both English and Spanish-language shows, including Two Broke Girls and Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\nHoff sees another benefit to accuracy in plotlines \u2014it can help clear up confusion about the nation\u2019s health law, which research suggests is widely misunderstood.\nHollywood, Health, and Society relies on a roster of experts around the nation, even bringing medical professionals into writers\u2019 rooms and taking producers on field trips\u2014including to the county morgue."}
