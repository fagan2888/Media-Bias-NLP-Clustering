CGI Group Inc. has a problem.

No, it’s nothing like the Obamacare website debacle that damaged sentiment for the Montreal-based IT consulting firm. Instead, it’s one that any company would love to have.

With CGI approaching $1-billion in annual free cash flow, investors will likely be pushing to hear more about what all this cash will be used for.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Treiber expects CGI will deliver approximately $200-million in FCF when it reports fourth quarter results in mid-November. He attributes these gains to diminishing integration payments associated with the Logica acquisition and anticipated margin expansion.

That gain would bring CGI’s trailing 12-month FCF to about $700-million, up from $427-million in fiscal 2013. RBC forecasts the company will generate $1.1-billion of FCF in fiscal 2016.

“With higher visibility to cash-flow, we believe investors will want to better understand CGI’s potential uses of cash,” Mr. Teiber told clients. “CGI’s top priorities for cash are: organic investments, share buybacks, de-leveraging and acquisitions; dividends are a lower priority.”

He believes CGI may start to allocate more capital to share buybacks as opposed to debt repayment in the near term, since the former is more accretive and CGI trades below its peers.

Mr. Teiber also pointed to CGI’s US$855-million debt financing in September at attractive rates, the fact that share buybacks have lagged CGI’s 10-year average since the Logica deal, its lower leverage since soon after the deal, and a share price that is below the level of prior repurchases.

Meanwhile, the analyst suggested another acquisition would be a possible material catalyst.

“CGI’s ability to find hidden gems, which are accretive and strategically attractive (like the AMS acquisition in 2004) or extract maximum share price and EPS accretion (like the Logica acquisition in 2012) create the most shareholder value,” he said.
