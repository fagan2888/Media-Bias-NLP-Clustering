Cañon City Police Department is aiming to shop with at least six kids who aren't able to afford gifts for their families.

"We get referrals from the school district about needy families that might not have a Christmas or might have a very, very small Christmas," said CCPD Chief Paul Schultz. "We're hoping to raise about $200 per child. These are kids that often buy gifts not for themselves, but for their family. We encourage them to get a gift for themselves as well."

The department adopted the nationwide program four years ago, he said.

"We think it's our responsibility to help people in the community, and this is a great way to help needy children," Schultz said.

The event will take place at Cañon City businesses on Dec. 12. The department is raising money for the event until Dec. 10.

"The more monies that we raise, the more kids will be helped," he said. "Any amount will be appreciated. One-hundred percent of their donations go to these children."

Checks can be mailed to the department or dropped off.

Checks need to be made payable to: Royal Gorge Youth Initiative, C/O Chief Paul Schultz, Cañon City Police Department, 161 Justice Center Road, Cañon City, CO 81212.

Gift-wrapping items, such as tape, wrapping paper, scissors and ribbon may also be donated. These donations can be dropped off at a bin inside of the police station.

Local merchants are helping to raise money, as well. Individuals who donate at Aaron's, City Auto Plaza, Lindner Chevrolet and McCasland Glass can write his or her name on a badge, which will hang in the business.
