For his selflessness, the U.S. Olympic announced on Monday that he will be the recipient of its annual Jack Kelly Fair Play Award, but for Euser it was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cIt never occurred to me to get another bike,\u201d Euser said Monday. \u201cIt never occurred to me to continue the race.\u201d\n\nThe accident occurred when a race motorcycle blundered into their path. Phinney suffered two compound fractures in his left leg. Euser, who races for the UnitedHealthcare team, walked away from his crash and hustled to Phinney\u2019s side. Phinney races for BMC Racing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember getting off my bike or getting to him, I just remember throwing my bike over a guardrail and diving underneath the guardrail to make sure (Phinney) didn\u2019t move,\u201d said Euser, 30. \u201cIt was all reactionary. Everything that I thought, I didn\u2019t process, I just did. Everyone says, \u2018Oh, it was so nice of you to stop and make that decision.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, it was all reactionary. I\u2019m more proud of that than anything, because that\u2019s how I live my life, to make reactionary decisions like that.\u201d\n\nEuser said at first he thought Phinney\u2019s leg had been cut off by the impact with the guardrail because there was so much blood.\n\n\u201cI hate to get too existential and say I had an out-of-body experience, but I\u2019ve been in his position,\u201d Euser said. \u201cI\u2019ve been hit by cars three different times, I\u2019ve crashed and broken many bones. I know what it\u2019s like to be where he was and know exactly what he wanted in that situation \u2014 it\u2019s comfort and security. That\u2019s probably one of the scariest things an athlete can go through, a traumatic injury like that. To be alone in that scenario is horrifying. He needed somebody there.\u201d\n\nEuser was nominated for the USOC award by Phinney and his parents, former cyclists Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney. He will receive the award Friday night in Chicago at a dinner in conjunction with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Assembly. Amy Van Dyken-Rouen will be the keynote speaker.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Amy Van Dyken,Crash,Lookout Mountain,Lucas Euser,Road Cycling,Taylor Phinney,USOC", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Boulder cyclist Lucas Euser of UnitedHealthcare won the USOC Fair Play Award after stopping to help cyclist Taylor Phinney when he severely crashed in May.", "title": "Lucas Euser of Boulder wins USOC Fair Play Award", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/09/22/local-cyclist-wins-usoc-fair-play-award/26811/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/09/lucas-euser-united-healthcare.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Boulder cyclist Lucas Euser of UnitedHealthcare won the USOC Fair Play Award after stopping to help cyclist Taylor Phinney when he severely crashed in May.", "creator": "@johnmeyer", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/09/22/local-cyclist-wins-usoc-fair-play-award/26811/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/09/lucas-euser-united-healthcare.jpg", "title": "Boulder cyclist Lucas Euser wins USOC Fair Play Award after helping Taylor Phinney in crash", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Boulder cyclist Lucas Euser of UnitedHealthcare won the USOC Fair Play Award after stopping to help cyclist Taylor Phinney when he severely crashed in May."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0597\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt never occurred to me to get another bike,\u201d Euser said Monday.\nHe needed somebody there.\u201dEuser was nominated for the USOC award by Phinney and his parents, former cyclists Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter-Phinney.\nFor his selflessness, the U.S. Olympic announced on Monday that he will be the recipient of its annual Jack Kelly Fair Play Award, but for Euser it was a no-brainer.\nWhen Boulder cyclists Taylor Phinney and Lucas Euser crashed descending Tennessee\u2019s Lookout Mountain at the U.S. Road Cycling Championships last May near Chattanooga, Phinney lay seriously injured underneath a guardrail.\nEuser could have continued in the race \u2014 and maybe gone on to win \u2014 but instead he quit the race and rushed to Phinney\u2019s aid."}
