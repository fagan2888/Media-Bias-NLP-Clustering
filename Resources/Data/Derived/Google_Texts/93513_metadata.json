It\u2019s interesting to see how far we\u2019ve come in the last 12 months. We\u2019re also ready for new adventures so we can tell new stories \u2014 with new language.\n\nCertain words and phrases have become as ubiquitous as brunch or Taylor Swift, and we owe it to ourselves to retire certain slang from our lexicon as we move into a new year. In \u201cLittle Gidding,\u201d T.S. Eliot writes, \u201cFor last year\u2019s words belong to last year\u2019s language / And next year\u2019s words await another voice.\u201d We need more creative methods of expression to properly describe an experience or caption an Instagram, but are bombarded by distractions regarding resolutions for the upcoming year. Why not shake things up by starting with a language revolution?\n\nBelow are some of the most exhausted phrases of 2015 that are in definite need of a modern update. Change is hard, and if you\u2019re reading this while thinking you \u201cliterally cannot,\u201d I\u2019m here to tell you that you absolutely can.\n\n\u201cSquad\u201d: Do we even need slang to describe a group of friends? Yes, squad members share a certain degree of camaraderie, but the term is reminiscent of a middle-school cheerleading group: overeager and just kind of silly.\n\n\u201cLiterally cannot\u201d: Both \u201cliterally\u201d and the phrase \u201ccannot\u201d are absolutely cringeworthy by now. There have been many think pieces on the misuse and evolution of \u201cliterally\u201d to the point where the word sounds like little more than nails on a chalkboard. Congratulations, we\u2019ve killed a word. Throw in any variation of \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d and\u2026 ugh, I actually won\u2019t even go there.\n\n\u201cBasic\u201d: Blah blah blah. This poor word has a formerly benign meaning (adjective; of, relating to, or forming a base), but now serves as a pejorative, albeit an unoriginal one. Referring to something or someone as \u201cbasic\u201d is derivative, unnecessary, and oh so boring.\n\n\u201cOn fleek\u201d: It\u2019s been nearly a year, and I\u2019m still not quite sure what \u201cfleek\u201d is or means. Have I been on it? Have I accidentally stepped/tripped over said fleek? It seems like a variation of \u201con point,\u201d which takes its roots from the French term \u201cen pointe\u201d referring to ballet and has since evolved to mean up to par, or of a certain standard. Whatever \u201cfleek\u201d may be, it\u2019s all Greek to me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's a new year. Your \"squad\" needs new slang.
