Birrell will leave his post Wednesday after spending three days helping Haberle transition.\n\nHaberle said he feels very fortunate to be given the opportunity to work with Monterey Park.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the leadership that comes with working with a great fire department. It is a great city, a great community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting to know the community, getting to know the firefighters, just getting to meet everyone.\u201d\n\nHaberle, who lives in Rancho Cucamonga, began his career in Monrovia in 1992 and has also worked as a firefighter/paramedic, fire inspector/investigator, fire captain and battalion chief. In his new position, he will lead 52 sworn fire personnel and three fire stations. Haberle will also manage an annual budget of more than $11 million.\n\nCity Manager Paul Talbot said a headhunting company gave the city about a dozen potential candidates. Six came in for interviews, and Haberle was selected from a pool of three finalists.\n\n\u201cScott\u2019s a very impressive individual,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cHe\u2019s very well respected in the region. He\u2019s forward thinking about fire services as well as community involvement.\u201d\n\nHaberle will be an at-will employee and will earn an annual salary of $160,000. Birrell earned $177,000 prior to retiring.\n\nAn experienced leader, Haberle has coordinated and managed many special assignments. He has worked as a fire marshal and in the administration of the emergency medical services and operations division. He has also been in charge of a citywide disaster preparedness program that includes the Community Emergency Response Team and an emergency operations center.\n\nTalbot said Haberle and Monterey Park have a similar perspective about the future of fire services. He expects Haberle to continue Monterey Park\u2019s tradition of providing outstanding fire and emergency services while also keeping an eye out for new opportunities in upcoming years, such as regionalization, he said.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of discussions we\u2019ve had here regarding joint services with other communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at our service delivery models for advanced life support and basic life support in the future. He\u2019s well-versed in that and all the changes in the Affordable Care Act and in-home services. Some of his expertise in that area will be very helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Haberle is experienced in fire services, there are differences between Monrovia and Monterey Park. Some 60 percent of Monrovia residents are white, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. About 19 percent of Monterey Park\u2019s residents are white; 67 percent are Asian.\n\n\u201cUltimately fire safety is the same,\u201d he said.\n\nHaberle has a master\u2019s in public administration from the University of La Verne and has completed his Executive Fire Officer designation from the National Fire Academy.\n\nHis swearing-in ceremony will take place at 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Monterey Park City Hall Council Chambers.\n\n>> Correction: The City of Monterey Park changed the time for Haberle\u2019s swearing in ceremony.
