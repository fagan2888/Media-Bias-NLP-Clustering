The 2006 image is of freestyle motocross rider Jim McNeil.\n\nAccording to chain emails and social media posts, the photo proves Officer Darren Wilson was brutally attacked before he shot 18-year-old Michael Brown. People sharing the picture online say it helps confirm that media have failed to report the full truth about what led to racially charged protests and rioting in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nIn fact, the picture was posted in October 2006 on a blog for Etnies, one of McNeil\u2019s sponsors, after a nasty crash that left him with broken bones in his forehead, cheek, nose, jaw and eye socket.\n\n(McNeil, who bears only a passing resemblance to Wilson, died in 2011 outside Texas Motor Speedway of injuries he suffered in an accident while practicing for an exhibition at the Fort Worth track.)\n\nSeveral sites, including Snopes and the Gawker blog AntiViral, also have refuted the claim that the photo is of Officer Wilson.\n\nIn August, CNN reported that a source close to the Ferguson investigation said Wilson did not suffer a bruised or fractured eye socket, as some had said.\n\nWilson was taken to the hospital after the shooting. He had xrays which came back negative. He was treated for a swollen face. #ferguson \u2014 Julian Cummings CNN (@JulianCummings) August 21, 2014\n\nA grand jury is considering evidence in the case to determine whether Wilson should be charged in Brown\u2019s death.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA5L3N1cHBvc2VkLXBob3RvLWV2aWRlbmNlLW9mLWZlcmd1c29uLW9mZmljZXJzLWluanVyaWVzLW1lZGlhLWJpYXMtYS1ob2F4Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
