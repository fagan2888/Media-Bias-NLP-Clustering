SHARE\n\nBy of the\n\nIn the course of asking one of my favorite college basketball game analysts, Dan Dakich, about Buzz Williams leaving Marquette for Virginia Tech, I asked him about Wisconsin taking on Oregon, a team that likes to play at warp speed.\n\nDakich said Saturday in a telephone interview that the Badgers can reach a high score without upping the pace.\n\n\u201cThe way for Wisconsin, in my opinion, to get it in the 80s isn\u2019t necessarily to speed up, it\u2019s just to make shots,\u201d said Dakich, who called a number of Big Ten telecasts this season for ESPN. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily dislike the matchup (for Wisconsin) because Bo\u2019s teams can handle teams that want to score with them because they inherently can lock people up. There are some places where, hey look, they never locked anybody up. They never are going to lock anybody up. I thought against Michigan at Michigan they just locked everybody up.\n\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s a bad matchup,\u201d Dakich said. \u201cPeople are talking about a high-scoring team against Bo Ryan. Promise you, if Wisconsin wins there\u2019s going to be about a five- to seven-minute time frame in the second half where Oregon doesn\u2019t score. Because that\u2019s what Bo\u2019s teams can do, regardless of what their defensive numbers are or aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDakich is among those who think the Badgers will advance to the Final Four.", "article_metadata": {"title": "ESPN analyst Dan Dakich is not buying the argument that Oregon is a bad matchup for Wisconsin", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/251696571.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "<br /><br />In the course of asking one of my favorite college basketball game analysts, Dan Dakich, about Buzz Williams leaving Marquette for Virginia Tech, I asked him about Wisconsin taking on Oregon, a team that likes to play at warp speed.<br />", "title": "ESPN analyst Dan Dakich is not buying the argument that Oregon is a bad matchup for Wisconsin"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "<br /><br />In the course of asking one of my favorite college basketball game analysts, Dan Dakich, about Buzz Williams leaving Marquette for Virginia Tech, I asked him about Wisconsin taking on Oregon, a team that likes to play at warp speed.<br />", "card": "summary", "title": "ESPN analyst Dan Dakich is not buying the argument that Oregon is a bad matchup for Wisconsin"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople say it\u2019s a bad matchup,\u201d Dakich said.\n2014 March Madness, Milwaukee Style Journal Sentinel reporters provide news and notes from the NCAA men's tournament regional at the Bradley Center March 20 and 22, featuring Wisconsin, Michigan, Oregon, BYU, Texas, Arizona State, Wofford and American.\nPromise you, if Wisconsin wins there\u2019s going to be about a five- to seven-minute time frame in the second half where Oregon doesn\u2019t score.\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily dislike the matchup (for Wisconsin) because Bo\u2019s teams can handle teams that want to score with them because they inherently can lock people up.\nDakich said Saturday in a telephone interview that the Badgers can reach a high score without upping the pace."}
