(AP) \u2014 Ruediger Richter barely recognizes himself in the yellowed military photograph hanging in his den \u2014 one of the best-known images of the Vietnam War.\n\nA sinewy GI stands in the middle of the frame, staring into the distance; behind him, another soldier looks down at the body of a comrade, wrapped in a poncho. The photo, enshrined in the National Archives, came to be known as \u201cThe Agony of War.\u201d\n\nRichter is the man at the center, though he does not look the same. Partly, it\u2019s because of age \u2014 he was 25 years old when the photo was taken, and he is now 73, with two grandchildren. Partly, it\u2019s because of war\u2019s ravages \u2014 months after the photo was taken, he was shot in the head, and he spent years coping with anger, alcohol, addiction to pain medications, post-traumatic stress.\n\nBut Richter himself will tell you that he does not resemble the man in the picture because he is no longer the man in the picture.\n\n\u201cI was a killer then,\u201d Richter said on his front porch, the wife who helped save his life by his side, birds chirping in trees rustled by the breeze. \u201cI have made my peace here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOn Aug. 14, 1966, Richter\u2019s job was clearing a landing zone in South Vietnam so helicopters could evacuate the wounded and dead after a mortar attack hit his unit.\n\nWatching the scene unfold from a safe spot, Army paratrooper and photographer Paul Epley ignored an order to stay down to make the photo, which was used in newspapers and magazines worldwide after it was transmitted by The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cClimbing up the rocks, I saw the image coming together. I chased the light and caught it at the decisive moment,\u201d said Epley, now retired and living in the woods of southern Virginia after a career as a commercial photographer and, later, a veterans\u2019 service officer.\n\nIn the photo, Richter looks skyward with his mouth open and his arms raised slightly. Sgt. Daniel E. Spencer Jr. of Bend, Oregon, looks down mournfully at the body of PFC Daryl Raymond Corfman of Sycamore, Ohio; Spencer also was killed in action, in 1968. The scene is shrouded in smoke.\n\nPeople have attached a range of emotions and attributes to the photo through the decades: Richter was praying, he was questioning God, perhaps calling upon angels.\n\nRichter dismisses those interpretations with a profanity. \u201cI was looking at a helicopter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat picture is genius because you see the smoke behind me,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was a red smoke grenade I threw.\u201d\n\nThe story of how he came to be in that place at that time is an extraordinary one.\n\nBorn in Berlin in February 1941, when Hitler\u2019s Nazi troops already had been marauding across Europe for years, Richter\u2019s earliest memories are of bodies outside bombed-out bunkers and bright flares dropped by Allied bombers.\n\n\u201cWe called them Christmas trees. They were beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could hear the sirens going off all over Berlin.\u201d\n\nRichter said when the war ended in 1945 and the Allies sliced the city into sectors, he was fortunate enough to live in the American district, where GIs were a soft touch for a young German boy begging for food. With few options in Berlin, Richter said, he joined the German merchant marine at age 14. That three-year stint ended when his ship docked in Calais, France, where he and other sailors were arrested after a bar fight.\n\n\u201cThey put us in a dungeon with water dropping down, just like in a movie. There was just a little window with bars,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter three days in lockup, a judge gave the penniless Richter a choice: Stay in prison or join the French Foreign Legion, which was battling rebels in French-controlled North Africa. He was too young to join legally at age 17, Richter said, so he was given a new name \u2014 Horst Timm \u2014 and allowed to enlist.\n\nRichter does not know how many men he killed with the Legion, or how many night-long marches he made through Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. But after five years, he left the Legion and regained his true name. An aunt and uncle living in Columbus suggested he come to America to restart his life, so he did in 1964.\n\nRichter grew bored with his job constructing helicopter landing pads, so he enlisted in the Army in 1965. According to his military file obtained from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, he shipped out to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and landed in Vietnam in June 1966 with the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry, 173rd Airborne Brigade.\n\nRichter became an aide to Col. Michael \u201cIron Mike\u201d Healy, he said, and Healy \u2014 who went on to play a major role as a commander in Vietnam \u2014 was just outside the frame when Epley snapped the shutter.\n\nThe moment captured, Richter kept going. He transferred to a reconnaissance unit. The war finally came to an end for him on March 25, 1967, when a bullet hit him on the left side of his face.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A life of trouble, a moment of immortality", "author": "Jay Reeves and Randy Herschaft", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A life of trouble, a moment of immortality", "title": "A life of trouble, a moment of immortality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/21/a_life_of_trouble_a_moment_of_immortality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/the-agony-of-war.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A life of trouble, a moment of immortality", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/the-agony-of-war.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "A life of trouble, a moment of immortality", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "A life of trouble, a moment of immortality", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cfd\"", "article_summary": "In the photo, Richter looks skyward with his mouth open and his arms raised slightly.\nRichter does not know how many men he killed with the Legion, or how many night-long marches he made through Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria.\nAn aunt and uncle living in Columbus suggested he come to America to restart his life, so he did in 1964.\n\u201cI was a killer then,\u201d Richter said on his front porch, the wife who helped save his life by his side, birds chirping in trees rustled by the breeze.\nBut Richter himself will tell you that he does not resemble the man in the picture because he is no longer the man in the picture."}
