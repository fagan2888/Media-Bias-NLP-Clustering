There has been a loud outcry from Covered California policy holders that they can\u2019t find doctors and hospitals in the narrow insurance networks that will treat them, but the exchange\u2019s pool of medical practitioners, and the level of care, is considered to be far superior to Medi-Cal.\n\nPeople have been known to inflate their incomes a tad to avoid Medi-Cal. But judging from the complaints Bazar has heard, people who don\u2019t qualify for Medi-Cal are being dumped by their insurance companies anyway.\n\nInsurance agent Evette Tsang, who reported that three clients with incomes above the Medi-Cal threshold were bumped, said, \u201cMy biggest problem is we don\u2019t know what income standard they\u2019re using.\u201d\n\nCovered California acknowledges it is manually reviewing income-level claims by enrollees last year and is redirecting some to Medi-Cal. But Bazar could not find out how many have been shifted. People are not being questioned or warned before being reevaluated and moved. And not everyone is actually moved.\n\nSome are suddenly cut loose with no insurance. And for those who claim they make too much money to be on Medi-Cal, they run the risk of illegally participating in the program or being stranded in a no-man\u2019s land with no coverage.\n\nDepartment of Managed Health Care (DMHC) spokesman Rodger Butler said the agency received 131 complaints about cancellations as of August 1. He said a Covered California enrollee cannot legally be cut loose by his insurance company without 30 days notice.\n\nDana Howard at Covered California told the Associated Press that some people were being shifted to Medi-Cal because the federal government updated its poverty level and some borderline consumers dipped beneath the line.\n\nAssemblyman Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) said his Committee on Health would hold hearings September 23 into the cancellations and shifts.\n\n\u2013Ken Broder\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nIncome Checks Throw Californians Off Health Plans (by Judy Lin, Associated Press)\n\nAsk Emily: Does Covered California Really Have You Covered?
