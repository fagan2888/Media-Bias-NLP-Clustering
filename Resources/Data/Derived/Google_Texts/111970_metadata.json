LARRY DOWNING / Reuters\n\n\"At that time, Secretary Sebelius told the President that she felt confident in the trajectory for enrollment and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and that she believed that once open enrollment ended it would be the right time to transition the Department to new leadership.\"\n\nSebelius hung tough through the entire battle first to get the law written and passed, and then through challenges that went all the way to the Supreme Court. The administration had to push the law through Congress without a single Republican vote, setting it up for a vicious battle that made every step of its implementation a nail-biter.\n\nEven as HHS officials worked nights and weekends to get the final rules into place, the administration was fighting opponents who threw up legal arguments that brought the law's constitutionality into question. And when the Supreme Court finally upheld the law on the last day possible of June 2012, it left Sebelius's HHS just a few months to put its crowning glory \u2014 the health insurance exchanges \u2014 into operation.\n\nSebelius, a former governor of Kansas and before that the state's insurance commissioner, was the face of the project. And behind the scenes, she was popular with insurance companies whose cooperation was vital for the law's success. They felt she understood their needs.\n\nBut members of Congress howled for her resignation after the online website HealthCare.gov fell apart on its debut and as revelations of mismanagement emerged at hearing after hearing. Sebelius held firm and Obama expressed confidence in her leadership.\n\nSebelius, 65, was nominated as HHS Secretary in February 2009 after a scandal over taxes forced former senator Tom Daschle, Obama's first choice, to step aside.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has resigned after seeing through the rocky rollout of President Obama's health reform law.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/sebelius-face-obamacare-snubbed-obama-n77411", "type": "article", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_15/316781/ss-140410-sebelius-jms-2007_cecef83e096bddb0743830d850cb7dcb.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has resigned after seeing through the rocky rollout of President Obama's health reform law."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has resigned after seeing through the rocky rollout of President Obama's health reform law.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_15/316781/ss-140410-sebelius-jms-2007_cecef83e096bddb0743830d850cb7dcb.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Sebelius: Face of Obamacare, but Snubbed by Obama - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-11", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/sebelius-face-obamacare-snubbed-obama-n77411", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Maggie-Fox/262695730411456"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care,Health news,Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96a7\"", "article_summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the icy and determined face of Obamacare from the beginning.\n\"Secretary Sebelius notified the President in early March of her decision,\" a White House official said in a statement.\nSebelius, a former governor of Kansas and before that the state's insurance commissioner, was the face of the project.\nSebelius, 65, was nominated as HHS Secretary in February 2009 after a scandal over taxes forced former senator Tom Daschle, Obama's first choice, to step aside.\nU.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius answers a question while she testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on April 10, 2014."}
