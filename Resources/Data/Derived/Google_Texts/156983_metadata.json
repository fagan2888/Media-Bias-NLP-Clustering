Not so much in the US.\n\nThe tournament, which began yesterday, will largely air on cable; streaming matches online also requires a television subscription. But there are a few options for so-called cord cutters who don\u2019t pay for TV but still want to watch the World Cup.\n\nWhy the US Is Different\n\nDisney paid about $100 million to broadcast the 2010 and 2014 tournaments in the US. It will show this year\u2019s World Cup on three of its popular channels: 43 matches on ESPN, 11 on ESPN2, and 10 on ABC. (Here is the schedule.)\n\nOnly the matches on ABC can be seen for free, and that has to be done the old-fashioned way: with an antenna. They can\u2019t be streamed online without paying for access. Disney is increasingly protective of its channels, including the once-free broadcast network ABC, as it charges cable companies more and more to carry them. Cable companies don\u2019t want that programming to be freely available online.\n\nThe situation is quite different in other countries. Many require that the home nation\u2019s matches are aired on free TV. (All three of the US team\u2019s group matches, by contrast, are on ESPN.) And in Europe, the rights to broadcast the World Cup were purchased by a continent-wide coalition of networks that are generally available for free on television and the internet. Britons, for instance, can watch the entire tournament on the BBC and ITV. Germans will get the whole thing on ARD and ZDF.\n\nThe Univision Strategy\n\nBut all is not lost for American cord cutters, as long as they don\u2019t insist on watching the games in English. Univision owns the Spanish-language broadcasting rights, and will stream all of the matches\u2014until the quarterfinals\u2014without requiring a pay-TV subscription. The network is also available for free over-the-air in most parts of the country, which would cover the later rounds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How and where to watch the games for free", "author": "Zachary M.
