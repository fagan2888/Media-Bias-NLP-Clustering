Providers\u2019 views are generally positive regarding the impact of health information technology on quality of care, but they are more divided on the increased use of medical homes and accountable care organizations. Overall, providers are more negative about the increased reliance on quality metrics to assess their performance and about financial penalties. Many physicians expressed frustration with the speed and administrative burden of Medicaid and Medicare payments. An earlier brief focused on providers\u2019 experiences under the ACA\u2019s coverage expansions and their opinions about the law.\u201d\n\nAt a very high level, primary care physicians are more skeptical than are allied health professionals (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) regarding the value of value-based reimbursement in promoting improved care quality and efficiency in healthcare; but among those PCPs who are under some level of value-based payment, perceptions are more positive.\n\nAs the brief noted, \u201cAbout two-thirds of primary care physicians (64 percent) reported they are paid either by capitation (i.e., prepayments for a set of services for a defined number of patients) or salary (i.e., predetermined income for an entire panel of patients) or through a combination of capitation, salary, and fee-for-service. Nearly nine of 10 nurse practitioners and physician assistants (87 percent) reported receiving payment through mechanisms that are not exclusively fee-for-service. Nevertheless, about a third of primary care physicians (34 percent) are still paid exclusively on a fee-for-service basis. More than half (55 percent) of physicians and about a third (34 percent) of nurse practitioners and physician assistants said their practice receives incentives or payments based on measures of quality of care, patients\u2019 experiences, or efficiency of providing care. About one-third of nurse practitioners and physician assistants were unsure whether they had received such incentives.\u201d\n\nAnd what of clinicians\u2019 attitudes? As the brief noted, \u201cThe survey asked primary care providers what effect, if any, they think these new models are having on providers\u2019 ability to provide high-quality care to patients. Health information technology received the most positive ratings, with half (50%) of physicians and nearly two-thirds (64%) of nurse practitioners and physician assistants saying it has made a positive impact.\u201d\n\nMelinda Abrams, vice president, delivery system reform, at The Commonwealth Fund, says, \u201cOur results show that primary care providers are experiencing the pay-for-value movement, which began before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, but was certainly accelerated by it. Our results show that only a third are still paid fee-for-service (34 percent), while 55 percent are experiencing some incentives related to quality or efficiently.\u201d\n\n\n\nMelinda Abrams\n\nAs to why a strong plurality of primary care physicians have negative perceptions of value-based outcomes measures\u2019 potential to improve care quality and efficiency, Abrams says, \u201cTo be honest, we don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t like the quality measures; we only know there\u2019s a fair bit of dissatisfaction with the quality measures. When we asked physicians whether they thought the increased use of quality measures was impacting their ability to provide high-quality care, 50 percent were negative on that, and only 22 percent were positive. We also asked, are you receive quality incentive-based payments? That reflected the entire group, but even among those receiving incentive payments based on quality, 50 percent felt it was negative, and only 28 percent felt it was positive.\u201d\n\nStill, Abrams agrees that it is interesting that those primary care physicians actually involved in new delivery and payment models were indeed more positive on quality measures. For example, while only 33 percent of primary care physicians surveyed declared themselves positive on the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model, among those working in PCMHs, 43 percent said the model was indeed having a positive effect on their ability to deliver higher-quality, more-efficient care. (Meanwhile, 63 percent of mid-level practitioners agreed that the PCMH model was enhancing their ability to deliver higher-quality care.)", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfbf\"", "article_summary": "Nevertheless, about a third of primary care physicians (34 percent) are still paid exclusively on a fee-for-service basis.\nAs the brief noted, \u201cThe survey asked primary care providers what effect, if any, they think these new models are having on providers\u2019 ability to provide high-quality care to patients.\nNearly nine of 10 nurse practitioners and physician assistants (87 percent) reported receiving payment through mechanisms that are not exclusively fee-for-service.\nAbout one-third of nurse practitioners and physician assistants were unsure whether they had received such incentives.\u201dAnd what of clinicians\u2019 attitudes?\nAs the abstract to the issue brief notes, \u201cA new survey from The Commonwealth Fund and The Kaiser Family Foundation asked primary care providers\u2014physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants\u2014about their experiences with and reactions to recent changes in health care delivery and payment."}
