The following is a list of five top areas of concern for CPAs in 2015:\n\nData Protection\n\nWhile most people think of a privacy data breach as being the result of a hacker attack a high percentage of claims are the result of rogue employees, IT failures and lost or stolen mobile devices such as laptops.\n\nWhile large CPA firms are aware of the danger and increasingly find they are required by clients to provide data protection coverage, small-to-mid-sized firms still tend to think they are immune and fail to realize the devastating cost involved if client files are compromised.\n\n\u201cBreach notification is now the single biggest exposure,\u201d said Christopher Brammer, vice president at Aon Affinity\u2019s Professional Firms Division. \u201cIf you\u2019re preparing taxes all over the country, do you know the breach notification laws for all 50 states? Do you have a breach response team in place and are you ready to engage them? That\u2019s a component of a good network risk policy. If not, you\u2019ll be hiring one last minute and will pay a premium to comply with the law.\u201d\n\nMergers\n\nPrior to 2008, large regional CPA firms were accustomed to double-digit growth. When the recession hit and business slowed, merger and acquisition activity increased dramatically. When two firms merge, it\u2019s one of the single highest exposure events that a firm will face.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of issues that firms may not consider until it\u2019s too late,\u201d said Alvin Fennell, vice president of underwriting at Aon Affinity\u2019s Professional Firms Division. \u201cYou need to do extensive due diligence when looking at the firm you\u2019re acquiring. You need to ask the hard questions. What is their claim history and peer review history? Are you buying any \u2018land mines about to explode?\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the aging of the profession, a related, emerging issue of merger and acquisition is succession planning. Whether it\u2019s a first-generation firm transitioning to the next generation or they\u2019re acquired by a larger firm, engaging your insurance broker early in the process is a critical step to mitigating potential exposures.\n\nFraud\n\nEmployee theft can occur at any firm, including CPA firms, but it can be doubly catastrophic when it occurs at one of the CPA firm\u2019s clients.\n\n\u201cThe exposure to the accounting firm is; you\u2019re my auditor, why didn\u2019t you catch it?\u201d said Brammer. \u201cIt\u2019s not the accountant\u2019s charge to detect fraud; however, they consistently have the finger pointed at them as the person to blame. It continues to be among the most severe losses we see.\u201d\n\nFirms may be a target when they are small, but have increased exposure as they grow.\n\n\u201cHas the CPA firm taken a hard look at their quality controls?\u201d said Brammer. \u201cAre they engaging anyone to take a look at their risk management? Has their approach to risk grown with their organic firm growth? Often times it is a claim that triggers a risk assessment.\u201d\n\nEngagement Documentation\n\nAn engagement letter outlining the scope of accounting services to be provided, signed by the client, reviewed and updated every year, is a CPA firm\u2019s first line of defense against professional liability claims.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when CPAs didn\u2019t use engagement letters,\u201d said Brammer. \u201cThose days are long gone. Now an engagement letter might be five pages long. Will that prevent a client from suing you? No. But it is the single best tool at the disposal of your defense counsel when there is a claim.\u201d\n\nWhere firms may get into trouble is with \u2018engagement creep.\u2019 The firm may have started out preparing taxes, but is then requested to conduct an audit or provide wealth management advice. Before long the CPA is a client\u2019s advisor on a multitude of services, all of which need to be documented.\n\nA new issue that may escape documentation is the Affordable Care Act. As CPAs are hired to provide tax advice regarding the ACA, if a CPA is working outside of the scope of their expertise, they should refer the client to a specialist or document where their responsibility begins and ends.\n\nWealth Transfer\n\nWith the baby boomer generation approaching retirement age, CPAs are increasingly hired to assist clients in transferring their estates. Professional liability issues can arise when a CPA is called in to act as a financial advisor, trustee or executor for the client\u2014not the beneficiary.\n\n\u201cThe beneficiaries may each have their own attorney,\u201d said Fennell. \u201cThe first thing on their mind is: there\u2019s a million dollars, could there have been more? That million dollars could have been $1.2 million if this and that had happened. That\u2019s $200,000 and we want it. Now the beneficiaries are suing the CPA.\u201d\n\nDocumentation and involving the right parties, such as an attorney, is the CPA\u2019s key to defense. When the experts begin reviewing the documentation, they will get a sense of the quality of the CPA\u2019s work. Good documentation can set the tone of a mediation and eliminate nuisance claims.\n\n--------------------\n\nKenneth J.
