BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) – Three people pleaded guilty to drug, money laundering and gun charges. Anthony Avery, Spiwe Barnes and Linda Johnson all pleaded guilty in connection to drug distribution between early 2010 and June 2011.

Avery and Barnes would receive cocaine from a source in Ohio, and Johnson would bring it to Buffalo, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Prosecutors said Avery and Barnes later received cocaine from Tyree Bishop, in Detroit, Michigan. When Bishop was arrested, police seized a handgun and $5,000 cash. He has been convicted and sentenced to 96 months in prison.

Avery and Barnes pleaded guilty to a conspiracy drug distribution charge. Johnson pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.
