He had a high fever and severe pain in his genitals. During his first day in the Emergency Room and subsequent six days in the hospital, Rumble alleges that he was subject to numerous forms of mistreatment because of his gender identity, including:\n\nDespite indicating to nurses that he identified as a man, Rumble received a hospital bracelet identifying his sex as \u201cfemale.\u201d\n\nRumble then waited several hours \u2014 still in extreme pain \u2014 before receiving any attention or treatment.\n\nWhen Dr. Randall Steinman eventually examined Rumble, he asked him disparaging questions about the gender of his sexual partners and the nature of those encounters, aggressively communicating that he didn\u2019t know how to diagnose him because of his use of hormone therapy.\n\nSteinman then conducted what Rumble described as an \u201cassaultive exam,\u201d during which he repeatedly jabbed at the patient\u2019s inflamed genitals, refusing to stop even after a crying Rumble demand that he stop twice. Only Rumble\u2019s mother\u2019s intervention stopped the painful assault.\n\nSteinman then left the room, indicating that he could not provide them with any information about Rumble\u2019s condition because his mother had stopped the \u201cexam,\u201d and Rumble proceeded to wait several more hours before being admitted to the hospital.\n\nAnother doctor who treated Rumble, Dr. Stephen Obaid, examined his genital area while wearing gloves, then wiped the gloves on the examination bed\u2019s blanket before proceeding to examine Rumble\u2019s eyes and mouth using the same gloves. Rumble \u201clater developed sores on his face in the places that Dr. Obaid had touched.\u201d\n\nAt various times during his stay, nurses inexplicably examined Rumble\u2019s genitals, whispered about him, and behaved unfriendly toward him.\n\nWhen Rumble received his bill, it indicated that he owed the full amount because, \u201cTHE DIAGNOSIS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PATIENT\u2019S GENDER,\u201d despite the fact, as the Court noted, \u201chis ultimate diagnoses were conditions that can, and do, affect people of any sex or gender.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson, an Obama appointee, concluded that Rumble had provided significant evidence to substantiate a case against the hospital under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which protects against sex discrimination in health care. She similarly allowed Rumble\u2019s charges under the Minnesota Human Rights Act to proceed. This ruling, however, simply rejected the hospital\u2019s request to dismiss the case, meaning that it will still proceed toward discovery and an eventual final outcome.\n\nNelson described Dr. Steinman\u2019s treatment as \u201cobjectively offensive,\u201d particularly his refusal to stop a painful genital exam. \u201cA reasonable person, seeking treatment from an emergency room doctor at a hospital, would expect that the doctor would respect the patient\u2019s wishes to stop a painful exam,\u201d she wrote. It is plausible, she concluded, that this mistreatment was because of Rumble\u2019s gender identity and did not constitute \u201crandom poor treatment that anyone might have received.\u201d The bill\u2019s reference to his gender \u201cinconsistency\u201d further bolsters Rumble\u2019s claim that he experienced discrimination because he is transgender.\n\nThe same \u201cobjectively offensive\u201d standard applies to the misgendering Rumble experienced from hospital staff, as well as the delays and refusals of treatment. It is plausible, Nelson concluded, that these were more than \u201cperceived slights,\u201d but a likely indication that he was treated poorly because of his protected class.\n\nHarper Jean Tobin, Policy Director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, described the case as one that \u201cillustrates the need for transgender people to stand up for their rights in health care settings.\u201d Noting that she\u2019d recently been hospitalized herself, Tobin offered that \u201cthe fear of mistreatment in medical settings is constant\u201d for trans people, but they need to know that \u201cthere\u2019s something you can do\u201d thanks to the law\u2019s new protections.\n\nNCTE points out that according to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 19 percent of trans people have been refused medical care because of their gender identity, 28 percent have been subjected to harassment in medical settings, and 50 percent have had to teach their medical provides about transgender care.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In a preliminary ruling, a federal court in Minnesota found that a transgender man's discrimination suit against the hospital that mistreated him can proceed.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In a preliminary ruling, a federal court in Minnesota found that a transgender man's discrimination suit against the hospital that mistreated him can proceed.", "title": "Court Rules That Transgender Patient Tortured By Doctors Is Protected Under Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/03/21/3637254/obamacare-transgender-protections/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fairview-Southdale-Hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a preliminary ruling, a federal court in Minnesota found that a transgender man's discrimination suit against the hospital that mistreated him can proceed.", "creator": "@ZackFord", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fairview-Southdale-Hospital-321x214.jpg", "title": "Court Rules That Transgender Patient Tortured By Doctors Is Protected Under Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fairview-Southdale-Hospital.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fairview-Southdale-Hospital.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T13:20:44+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zackford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5be\"", "article_summary": "LGBT Court Rules That Transgender Patient Tortured By Doctors Is Protected Under Obamacare CREDIT: Fairview Southdale HospitalThis week, a federal court in Minnesota issued a preliminary ruling in a case concluding that discrimination against an individual because of his gender identity is prohibited under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\nIn June of 2013, Jakob Tiarnan Rumble, a transgender man, sought treatment at Fairview Southdale Hospital, just outside of Minneapolis.\nThe same \u201cobjectively offensive\u201d standard applies to the misgendering Rumble experienced from hospital staff, as well as the delays and refusals of treatment.\nNelson described Dr. Steinman\u2019s treatment as \u201cobjectively offensive,\u201d particularly his refusal to stop a painful genital exam.\nNCTE points out that according to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 19 percent of trans people have been refused medical care because of their gender identity, 28 percent have been subjected to harassment in medical settings, and 50 percent have had to teach their medical provides about transgender care."}
