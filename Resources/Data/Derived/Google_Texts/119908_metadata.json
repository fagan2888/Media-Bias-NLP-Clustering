There couldn\u2019t be a sharper image of the Bill of Rights rollback we are experiencing in the U.S. borderlands in the post-9/11 era.\n\nTumbling out of that purse came Gutierrez\u2019s life: photos of her kids, business cards, credit cards, and other papers, all now open to the official scrutiny of the Department of Homeland Security. There were also photographs of her husband, Jose Gutierrez Guzman, whom CBP agents beat so badly in 2011 that he suffered permanent brain damage. The supervisory agent, whose name badge on his blue uniform read \u201cGomez,\u201d now began to trample on her life, quite literally, with his black boots.\n\n\u201cPlease stop stepping on the pictures,\u201d Shena asked him.\n\nA U.S. citizen, unlike her husband, she had been returning from a 48-hour vigil against Border Patrol violence in Mexico and was wearing a shirt that said \u201cStop Border Patrol Brutality\u201d when she was aggressively questioned and cuffed at the CBP\u2019s \u201cport of entry\u201d in Nogales on that hot day in May. She had no doubt that Gomez was stepping all over the contents of her purse in response to her shirt, the evidence of her activism.\n\nPerhaps what bothered Gomez was the photo silkscreened onto that shirt \u2014 of her husband during his hospitalization. It showed the aftermath of a beating he received from CBP agents. His head had a partially caved-in look because doctors had removed part of his skull. Over his chest and arms were bruises from Tasering. One tooth was out of place, and he had two black eyes. Although you couldn\u2019t see them in the photo, two heavily armed Homeland Security agents were then guarding his hospital door to prevent the father of two, formerly a sound technician and the lead singer of a popular band in Los Angeles, from escaping \u2014 even in his comatose state.\n\nJose Gutierrez Guzman\u2019s has become an ever more common story in an American age of mass expulsions. Although he had grown up in the United States (without papers), he was born in Mexico. After receiving a letter requesting his appearance, he went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Los Angeles and was promptly arrested and deported. Customs and Border Protection agents later caught him crossing the border in San Luis, Arizona, near Yuma, in an attempt to reunite with his wife and children.\n\n\u201cStop\u2026 stepping\u2026 on\u2026 the\u2026 pictures,\u201d Shena insisted.\n\nAs she tells the story, Agent Gomez looked at her shirt for a second, then looked up at her and said, \u201cYou have that mentality about us. You think we go around abusing.\u201d His tone remained faux-friendly, but his boots didn\u2019t \u2014 and neither did those cuffs another CBP agent had put on her. Forcing her hands behind her back, they cut uncomfortably into her wrists. They would leave deep red circular marks.\n\nOn display was a post-9/11 world in which the usual rights meant to protect Americans from unreasonable search and seizure and unwanted, as well as unwarranted, interrogation were up for grabs.\n\nWhile such constitutionally questionable intrusions into people\u2019s privacy have been increasing at border crossings in the post-9/11 years, this type of hardline border policing has also moved inland. In other words, the sort of intrusions that once would have qualified as unconstitutional have moved in startling numbers into the interior of the country.\n\nImagine the once thin borderline of the American past as an ever-thickening band, now extending 100 miles inland around the United States \u2014 along the 2,000-mile southern border, the 4,000-mile northern border, and both coasts \u2014 and you will be able to visualize how vast the CBP\u2019s jurisdiction has become. This \u201cborder\u201d region now covers places where two-thirds of the U.S. population (197.4 million people) live. The ACLU has come to call it a \u201cconstitution-free zone.\u201d The \u201cborder\u201d has by now devoured the full states of Maine and Florida and much of Michigan.\n\nIn these vast domains, Homeland Security authorities can institute roving patrols with broad, extra-constitutional powers backed by national security, immigration enforcement, and drug interdiction mandates. There, the Border Patrol can set up traffic checkpoints and fly surveillance drones overhead with high-powered cameras and radar that can track your movements. Within 25 miles of the international boundary, CBP agents can enter a person\u2019s private property without a warrant. In these areas, the Homeland Security state is anything but abstract. On any given day, it can stand between you and the grocery store.\n\n\u201cBorder Patrol checkpoints and roving patrols are the physical world equivalent of the National Security Agency,\u201d says attorney James Lyall of ACLU Arizona puts it. \u201cThey involve a massive dragnet and stopping and monitoring of innocent Americans without any suspicion of wrongdoing by increasingly abusive and unaccountable federal government agents.\u201d\n\nBefore she was so unceremoniously stopped and held, Shena Gutierrez shared the story of her husband at that 48-hour vigil. It was another story of the kind of pervasive abuse reported by people in the 100-mile zone. There were no cameras that night to record how 11 agents \u201csubdued\u201d Jose Gutierrez Guzman, as the CBP put it in its official report on the incident. Its claim: that Jose \u201cstruck his head on the ground,\u201d a way perhaps of accounting for the hospital\u2019s eventual diagnosis of \u201cblunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nConsidering the extent of Jose\u2019s injuries, that CBP report is questionable indeed. Many Border Patrol agents now use the term \u201ctonk\u201d \u2014 the sound a flashlight supposedly makes when it bangs against someone\u2019s head \u2014 as their way of describing border-crossers. Jose was also repeatedly \u201cshot\u201d with an \u201celectronic control device,\u201d aka a Taser. He was so badly beaten that, more than three years later, he still suffers seizures.\n\n\u201cStop stepping on my pictures!\u201d Gutierrez insisted again. But much like the CBP\u2019s official complaint process, the words were ignored. The only thing Gomez eventually spat out was, \u201cAre you going to get difficult?\u201d\n\nWhen Shena Gutierrez offered me a play-by-play account of her long day, including her five-hour detainment at the border, her voice ran a gamut of emotions from desperation to defiance. Perhaps these are the signature emotions of what State Department whistleblower Peter Van Buren has dubbed the \u201cPost-Constitutional Era.\u201d We now live in a time when, as he writes, \u201cthe government might as well have taken scissors to the original copy of the Constitution stored in the National Archives, then crumpled up the Fourth Amendment and tossed it in the garbage can.\u201d The prototype for this new era, with all the potential for abuse it gives the authorities, can be found in that 100-mile zone.\n\nA Standing Army\n\nThe zone first came into existence thanks to a series of laws passed by Congress in the 1940s and 1950s at a time when the Border Patrol was just an afterthought with a miniscule budget and only 1,100 agents. Today, Customs and Border Protection has more than 60,000 employees and is by far the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country. According to author and constitutional attorney John Whitehead, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created in 2002, is efficiently and ruthlessly building \u201ca standing army on American soil.\u201d\n\nLong ago, President James Madison warned that \u201ca standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.\u201d With its 240,000 employees and $61 billion budget, the DHS, Whitehead points out, is militarizing police units, stockpiling ammunition, spying on activists, and building detention centers, among many other things. CBP is the uniformed and most visible component of this \u201cstanding army.\u201d It practically has its own air force and navy, an Office of Air and Marine equipped with 280 sea vessels, 250 aircraft, and 1,200 agents.\n\nOn the border, never before have there been so many miles of walls and barriers, or such an array of sophisticated cameras capable of operating at night as well as in the daylight. Motion sensors, radar systems, and cameras mounted on towers, as well as those drones, all feed their information into operational control rooms throughout the borderlands. There, agents can surveil activity over large stretches of territory on sophisticated (and expensive) video walls. This expanding border enforcement regime is now moving into the 100-mile zone.\n\nSuch technological capability also involves the warehousing of staggering amounts of personal information in the digital databases that have ushered in the Post-Constitutional Era. \u201cWhat does all this mean in terms of the Fourth Amendment?\u201d Van Buren asks. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: the technological and human factors that constrained the gathering and processing of data in the past are fast disappearing.\u201d\n\nThe border, in the post 9/11 years, has also become a place where military manufacturers, eyeing a market in an \u201cunprecedented boom period,\u201d are repurposing their wartime technologies for the Homeland Security mission. This \u201cbring the battlefield to the border\u201d posture has created an unprecedented enforcement, incarceration, and expulsion machine aimed at the foreign-born (or often simply foreign-looking). The sweep is reminiscent of the operation that forced Japanese (a majority of them citizens) into internment camps during World War II, but on a scale never before seen in this country. With it, unsurprisingly, has come a wave of complaints about physical and verbal abuse by Homeland Security agents, as well as tales of inadequate food and medical attention to undocumented immigrants in short-term detention.\n\nThe result is a permanent, low-intensity state of exception that makes the expanding borderlands a ripe place to experiment with tearing apart the Constitution, a place where not just undocumented border-crossers, but millions of borderland residents have become the targets of continual surveillance. If you don\u2019t see the Border Patrol\u2019s ever-expanding forces in places like New York City (although CBP agents are certainly present at its airports and seaports), you can see them pulling people over these days in plenty of other spots in that Constitution-free zone where they hadn\u2019t previously had a presence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In post-Constitutional America, the militarization of border control is a terrifying new reality", "title": "\u201cBring the battlefield to the border\u201d: How America\u2019s immigration wars were poisoned by the military-industrial complex", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In post-Constitutional America, the militarization of border control is a terrifying new reality", "title": "\u201cBring the battlefield to the border\u201d: How America\u2019s immigration wars were poisoned by the military-industrial complex", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/bring_the_battlefield_to_the_border_how_americas_immigration_wars_were_poisoned_by_the_military_industrial_complex/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/joe_arpaio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In post-Constitutional America, the militarization of border control is a terrifying new reality", "title": "\u201cBring the battlefield to the border\u201d: How America\u2019s immigration wars were poisoned by the military-industrial complex", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/joe_arpaio.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Todd Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Border Security, Immigration, Mexican border, Military-industrial complex, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2323\"", "article_summary": "Many Border Patrol agents now use the term \u201ctonk\u201d \u2014 the sound a flashlight supposedly makes when it bangs against someone\u2019s head \u2014 as their way of describing border-crossers.\nThere, the Border Patrol can set up traffic checkpoints and fly surveillance drones overhead with high-powered cameras and radar that can track your movements.\nWithin 25 miles of the international boundary, CBP agents can enter a person\u2019s private property without a warrant.\nIt showed the aftermath of a beating he received from CBP agents.\nIn these vast domains, Homeland Security authorities can institute roving patrols with broad, extra-constitutional powers backed by national security, immigration enforcement, and drug interdiction mandates."}
