The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is releasing a new ad Monday in New Hampshire targeting former Sen. Scott P. Brown on Medicare.

Brown faces Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in a race rated Tilts Democrat by the Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.

The DSCC's ad, provided first to Roll Call, hits Brown for his vote in 2011 for a budget that would have made cuts to Medicare and Social Security. "New Hampshire seniors rely on Medicare," says a narrator in the ad. "When Scott Brown represented Massachusetts, he voted to cut Medicare and Social Security, while giving tax breaks to millionaires and oil companies."

"Scott Brown is no friend to New Hampshire," says a woman named Ronnie Werner, a senior citizen who describes herself as a "longtime Rye resident."

The ad will run statewide and is part of the DSCC's multi-million dollar television campaign in the Granite State, according to a committee aide.
