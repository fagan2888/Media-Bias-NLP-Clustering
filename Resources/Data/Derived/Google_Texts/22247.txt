GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Freshman Antonio Callaway’s 63-yard touchdown reception with 1:26 remaining gave Florida an 11th consecutive win against Southeastern Conference rival Tennessee, 28-27 on Saturday.

Callaway ran a deep curl on a fourth-and-14 play, caught the pass from Will Grier, turned outside and beat three defenders to the end zone. Fellow receiver Demarcus Robinson threw a key block down the field that allowed Callaway to score.

The Gators (4-0, 2-0 SEC) started celebrating wildly. The Volunteers (2-2, 0-1) were stunned.

Still, Tennessee had one final chance. Josh Dobbs, who led the Vols in passing, rushing and receiving, moved them into field-goal range. But Aaron Medley missed twice from 55 yards, once just after Florida coach Jim McElwain called timeout and then again — this time just barely.

His second kick missed the right upright by less than a foot.

And Florida extended the streak to its longest in series history.
