Fifty years later, pundits, enemies, and even fellow Democrats criticize Barack Obama for not being more of an arm-twisting, hard-nosed partisan like Johnson. (According to a recent New Yorker profile of Obama, Caro even felt it necessary to explain to the president at a White House dinner that his book \u201cwasn\u2019t an unspoken attack on you.\u201d) But on what many consider his most famous piece of legislation, Johnson was at best a supporting player. The question is, does that indict Johnson, or does it point to something more fundamental about how we judge our political leaders\u2014and how American politics actually works?\n\nOne reason Johnson gets credit for the bill\u2019s success is his legendary ability to wheedle and threaten and beg to get what he wanted, the so-called Johnson treatment. But in the case of the Civil Rights bill, Johnson\u2019s strong-arm tactics misfired. When he took office in November 1963, the bill was stuck in the House Rules Committee, which approves legislation before it goes to the floor and which was run by the arch-segregationist Howard Smith of Virginia. Johnson demanded that the Democrats issue a discharge petition, in which a majority of House members can force the committee to release a bill. But the petition was a lost cause, and, in the end, quiet bipartisan negotiations, not Oval Office big-footing, got the bill out of Smith\u2019s clutches.\n\nThe president was equally out of touch with the Senate. During the run-up to the filibuster, he demanded that Mike Mansfield, Johnson\u2019s successor as majority leader, \u201cget out the cots\u201d\u2014that is, force the Senate into 24-hour sessions as a way of wearing down the senescent Southern Democrats. But Mansfield, a quiet, pipe-smoking ex-Marine, respectful of Senate tradition and deferential to each senator\u2019s independence, did all he could to keep the president at a remove from his chamber. When a visiting group of rabbis urged Mansfield to follow the president\u2019s advice, the majority leader replied bluntly: \u201cWhen Johnson was majority leader, he ran things the way he wanted them. Now I am majority leader and will run things the way I want them.\u201d The cots did not come out.\n\nBelievers in Johnson as the bill\u2019s primary mover often point to marching orders he handed down to Humphrey during the filibuster. After Humphrey went on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on March 8, 1964, to praise Everett Dirksen, the Senate minority leader who held the key to dozens of fence-sitting votes, Johnson gave him a congratulatory call. \u201cBoy, that was right,\u201d he said, and he encouraged the senator to do more of the same. \u201cYou drink with Dirksen! You talk to Dirksen! You listen to Dirksen!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a great quote. But it\u2019s cheerleading, not strategizing. And if getting close to Dirksen was a new idea for Johnson, he was the last of the bill\u2019s supporters to discover it: John F. Kennedy and his staff began courting Dirksen before they even introduced the bill in June 1963.\n\nEven Humphrey, a Johnson partisan, conceded in a memo written shortly after the filibuster ended that the president did not play much of a role on the bill: \u201cWe did give him regular reports on the progress of civil rights over at the Tuesday morning breakfasts. But the president was not put on the spot. He was not enlisted in the battle particularly. I understand he did contact some of the senators, but not at our insistence.\u201d\n\nThe impact of that senatorial outreach was minimal. Johnson won over just one vote for cloture: Carl Hayden of Arizona. And Hayden, who was pro-civil-rights but supported filibustering on principle, merely agreed to absent himself during the cloture vote. Johnson failed to swing a single Southern Democrat, despite the fact that several, including J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and Al Gore Sr. of Tennessee, were considered possible converts.\n\nPerceptive journalists picked up on this. \u201cAs majority leader, the president was all muscle and scant conversation. In the present impasse, the criticism is freely heard that the reverse is true,\u201d wrote the columnist Doris Fleeson in The Washington Star on April 22, 1964.\n\nNot that Johnson didn\u2019t try. On April 10, he called West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, who caucused with the Southern Democrats against civil rights. \u201cYou\u2019re with me! You\u2019ve got to be with me,\u201d he implored.\n\nBut Byrd was unmoved: \u201cNo, my convictions are against the bill.\u201d Johnson tried a different tack. It was, after all, an election year. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be rougher if I don\u2019t pass that bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it won\u2019t either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it will. Are y\u2019all going to beat it?\u201d the president asked, referring to the Southern Democrats.\n\n\u201cI hope to hell we beat it,\u201d Byrd said.\n\nSoon after, Johnson hung up in dismay.\n\nJohnson did make two considerable contributions to the bill\u2019s success. In The Passage of Power, Caro documents at length how the president labored successfully to get Senator Harry Byrd, the Finance Committee chairman, to release the administration\u2019s $11.5 billion tax-cut bill in time to clear the Senate before the filibuster. As Caro argues (and Johnson believed), had Byrd kept the tax cut back, the Southerners could possibly have used it as a hostage to force a compromise on the Civil Rights bill.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s most important contribution was symbolic. His speeches, from the first time he addressed a joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963, are filled with demands that Congress pass a strong Civil Rights bill. It took courage, in an election year, to put the full weight of the presidency behind such a controversial measure. Johnson was also hedging his bets, though. When asked at a press conference five months later whether the bill was moving fast enough, he said, \u201cThat is a matter for the Senate to determine.\u201d Even as he supported the bill, Johnson didn\u2019t want to catch the blame if Humphrey and his team failed.\n\nThe fact is, no single person made the bill happen. And while this lesson is particularly true for the Civil Rights Act, it is also true for the history of American lawmaking in general. When we talk about landmark actions by the federal government, we tend to let the respective president take the credit (or blame). We recall that it was Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves, even though dozens of congressmen wrote and supported the laws that pushed him to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. The Affordable Care Act is labeled \u201cObamacare\u201d by its detractors and supporters, even though Obama consciously let Congress take the lead on crafting the bill.\n\nBut reducing a law\u2019s history to the actions of a single person obscures the complexities and compromises that define it and its lessons for future lawmakers. This year we will hear a lot about the Civil Rights Act as one of Johnson\u2019s signature accomplishments. If we leave it at that, we will miss much of what the bill\u2019s story has to tell us\u2014about how to achieve bipartisan cooperation, about the role of social activism in policy-making, and about the limits of the executive branch when it comes to crafting landmark legislation.\n\nOn the evening of June 19, 1964, a few hours after the Senate voted to pass the Civil Rights Act, Humphrey strode out onto the eastern steps of the Capitol, where he found several hundred civil rights well-wishers. \u201cFreedom!\u201d they shouted. \u201cYou gave us justice, senator.\u201d Humphrey beamed. President Johnson was nowhere in sight.\n\nClay Risen is an editor at The New York Times and the author of the forthcoming The Bill of the Century: The Epic Battle for the Civil Rights Act.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "He wasn\u2019t the arm-twisting, indomitable genius of Robert Caro\u2019s imagination", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "This Civil Rights Act is turning 50.
