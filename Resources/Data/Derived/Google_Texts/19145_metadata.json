I wanted to make sure it was really natural for the kids and intuitive.\"\n\nShe said Dewey's system, created largely for researchers, separates books on the same topic by genre. So a book on the history of football is in a different section than a fiction novel about football.\n\nBut students, she said, are used to searching for football books on a site like Amazon and getting a list of 25 books across genres.\n\nHer system organizes the library's 15,000 books by subject instead of genre, with color coded labels to denote if a book is fiction, a biography, an autobiography, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's much better for kids who don't like to read and casual library users, who don't know all the titles and author names,\" she said.\n\nShe said students have shared positive feedback, and she is seeing results.\n\nShe's doubled the number of checkouts in the past four years, to 9,797 last school year. The library also logged 65,000 student visits last school year \u2014 up from 23,000 visits 10 years ago.\n\n\"I'm appealing to all the students , not just the high end users,\" she said.\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29146016/monarch-librarian-develops-bookstore-classification-system-easier-browsing", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29146016:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-21T10:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Monarch High librarian  Beatrice Gerrish wanted to organize her books using a bookstore model. \nBut  she couldn't find a classification system she liked for a school library, so she decided to create her own.", "title": "Monarch librarian develops bookstore classification system for easier browsing", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29146016/monarch-librarian-develops-bookstore-classification-system-easier-browsing", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1120/20151120__22DCAMONw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1120/20151120__22DCAMONw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-11-20T17:55:27-0700", "endDate": "2025-11-20T17:51:36-0700", "description": "Monarch High librarian  Beatrice Gerrish wanted to organize her books using a bookstore model. \nBut  she couldn't find a classification system she liked for a school library, so she decided to create her own.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-11-20T17:54:46-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-21T10:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Monarch librarian develops bookstore classification system for easier browsing", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_29146016/monarch-librarian-develops-bookstore-classification-system-easier-browsing", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Monarch High librarian  Beatrice Gerrish wanted to organize her books using a bookstore model. \nBut  she couldn't find a classification system she liked for a school library, so she decided to create her own.", "title": "Monarch librarian develops bookstore classification system for easier browsing"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1120/20151120__22DCAMONw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "But she couldn't find a classification system she liked for a school library, so she decided to create her own.\nAdvertisement\"It's much better for kids who don't like to read and casual library users, who don't know all the titles and author names,\" she said.\nThe library also logged 65,000 student visits last school year \u2014 up from 23,000 visits 10 years ago.\nNatural and intuitive for kidsRelated Stories School libraries in Boulder County changing for 21st centuryMonarch High librarian Beatrice Gerrish wanted to organize her books using a bookstore model.\nShe said Dewey's system, created largely for researchers, separates books on the same topic by genre."}
