The good news is the \u201cSunshine Act,\u201d part of the Affordable Care Act, has been implemented and many drug company web sites now list the payouts\u2013including to \u201cgrassroots\u201d groups that are actually Pharma fronts like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).\n\nThe bad news is that editors and publishers sill cooperate with pulling the wool over the public\u2019 eyes when it comes to conflicts of interest. Here are some ways that transparency about pharma payouts is blocked, even though it greatly affects the drugs that doctors recommend and prescribe.\n\n1) Omnibus disclosure\n\nAll of a study\u2019s authors are listed together with all the drug companies for whom they have consulted, in one undecipherable block of solid type. Who goes with whom? You\u2019ll never know\u2013but the author with no drug company links sure isn\u2019t happy about the shared guilt!\n\n2) Initials\n\n\u201cR.L.T. has consulted for Merck\u201d is set in 8-point type at the end of the article. Will readers return to the first page of the study, five pages back, to decode the initials? When several authors also have first names that begin with R?\n\n3) Disclosures You Have To Work For\n\nConflicts of interest of Continuing Medication Education faculty in online articles are often tucked away in a pull-down menu. Like drug ads that make you scroll for safety information, the COIs are there but you can\u2019t see them all at once and they disappear quickly.\n\n4) One Disclosure is Enough\n\nWhen a previous article is cited in journal letters sections, author disclosures are often said to \u201cbe found with the original article.\u201d Surely you have that issue, published four months ago, on your desk right now!\n\n5) Protective Coloring\n\nDisclosures of drug company links are embedded between government grants and charitable foundations as if they are the same thing. Not too many government agencies and charities are marketing drugs for patients.\n\n6) Paying Customers Only\n\nThere are 20 million citations of medical literature in the U.S. National Library of Medicine web site. Most contain authors\u2019 institutions and emails to be helpful. Where are the disclosures? Behind a paywall.
