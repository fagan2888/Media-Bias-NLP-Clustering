When it comes to Medicare \u2014 the government\u2019s health insurance program primarily for Americans 65 and older \u2014 there are financial incentives and risks to do either.\n\nPatients, by and large, can\u2019t tell the difference. The doctors, the nurses and the care are largely the same whether they\u2019re admitted or under observation status. But that designation has major payment implications if their next stop is at a skilled nursing facility.\n\nAdvocates for those facilities say they are increasingly seeing patients who need their services but don\u2019t have coverage for them under current Medicare rules.\n\nA Medicare denial leads to thousands in out-of-pocket costs that must be borne by the patient or the facility.\n\nKaren Vidrickson, executive director of Eaglecrest Retirement Community in Salina and Kansas\u2019 liaison to the National Center for Assisted Living, said facilities across the state and the nation are struggling to serve those patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all affected by this,\u201d Vidrickson said.\n\nTish Hollingsworth, vice president of reimbursement for the Kansas Hospital Association, said hospitals are between a rock and a hard place in the intricate world of Medicare regulations. If they don\u2019t admit patients, they face lower reimbursements for services and more out-of-pocket costs. But if they do admit a patient and a Medicare auditor later determines it was unnecessary, they could lose their reimbursement for that patient\u2019s stay.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t win, because the doctor can\u2019t make the decision, and he\u2019s the one leading the care,\u201d Hollingsworth said.\n\nState and federal legislation has been introduced to help resolve the issue, but lawmakers at both levels have been slow to act.\n\nRochelle Archuleta, senior associate director of policy for the American Hospital Association, said the problem is well-known on Capitol Hill, but lawmakers have a lot on their plates and there\u2019s no consensus yet around any single course of action.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s agreement this is an important issue,\u201d Archuleta said. \u201cBut there\u2019s not agreement on how to proceed.\u201d\n\nLong-building problem\n\nThe conflict over observational stays and the three-day rule has been building for some time.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act instituted a penalty for hospital readmissions within 30 days, which provided an incentive for hospitals to avoid admitting some patients.\n\nBut a 2013 study led by Keith Lind, a senior policy advisor with the AARP Public Policy Institute, found that the use of observational stays increased well before the ACA was proposed.\n\nLind\u2019s study looked at data from 2001 to 2009. During that time, hospitals\u2019 use of observation services for Medicare patients doubled and the duration of observation stays also grew at a high rate. Observation stays of more than 48 hours, for example, increased by 250 percent.\n\nIn a phone interview, Lind said there were several possible reasons for the increase, including 2006 changes to Medicare payment policies and the advent of the audits that cost some hospitals their inpatient reimbursements.\n\n\u201cThose audits were scrutinizing one-day inpatient stays and had a lot of hospitals getting denials of their inpatient stays,\u201d Lind said. \u201c(So) they were shifting to observation stays.\u201d\n\nLind\u2019s report said that the \u201cmagnitude\u201d of the observation stay increase raises concerns that hospitals are using long observation stays as a substitute for inpatient admissions rather than for a legitimate clinical purpose.\n\nOfficials with the American Hospital Association say that\u2019s not the case and point to an analysis published in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAffecting more patients\n\nWhatever the reason for the increased use of observation services, it\u2019s making the three-day rule a concern for more patients.\n\nWhen the rule was first imposed in 1965, Lind said the average Medicare hospital stay was 13 days.\n\n\u201cSo three days didn\u2019t sound like a lot back then,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the way care is delivered has changed and the Medicare regulations have not kept up. The average stay now, Lind said, is five days.\n\nHospitals are discharging patients more quickly, leaving less in-hospital recovery time. That\u2019s good for preventing hospital-acquired infections, but it often means that Medicare patients who live alone or with an equally frail spouse are in need of inpatient rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility before they safely can go home.\n\nIf they haven\u2019t received three days of inpatient hospitalization, that rehabilitation is not covered under Medicare.\n\nLinda Carroll, a social worker at Plaza West Care Center in Topeka, said it\u2019s a growing problem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all kinds of stories,\u201d she said.\n\nCarroll said she has seen Medicare patients who have been in the hospital for observation stays of up to seven days. Stays of three days or more are increasingly common.\n\nShe said they come in batches but average about one a month, and those Medicare patients face thousands of dollars in surprise out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nCarroll, who has been on the job for 35 years, said it\u2019s more of a problem now than ever.\n\n\u201cMuch more so,\u201d she said. \u201cWe rarely saw it for the first 15 or 20 years.\u201d\n\nIf residents absolutely cannot pay out of pocket, Carroll said the facility will help them file a claim with Medicaid, which provides coverage for some low-income seniors. But that claim takes more than a month to process, she said. In the meantime, the skilled nursing facility provides care at a \u201chigh risk\u201d of having none of it compensated if the Medicaid claim is denied.\n\nVidrickson, of the Salina retirement community, said as soon as she knows a resident who has been hospitalized may need skilled nursing care after discharge, she\u2019s on the phone with the hospital\u2019s social workers, trying to get them admitted for inpatient care.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for us to help them out,\u201d Vidrickson said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for the people who take care of them every day to help them out, and we have to play the game.\u201d\n\nWithout a change in the rules, the game is likely to continue.\n\nWhile the ACA did not cause the increase in observation stays, the Center for Advancing Health, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit research group, warned that the law\u2019s 30-day readmission penalties are likely to perpetuate it .\n\nLind said that\u2019s a logical consequence.\n\n\u201cCertainly it creates an incentive to shift people to observation,\u201d he said.\n\nLegislative proposals\n\nStakeholders are trying to address the problem legislatively.\n\nLeadingAge Kansas, a group that advocates on behalf of nonprofits that provide services to seniors, introduced a bill this year in the Kansas Legislature to require hospitals to inform patients orally and in writing within 24 hours if they\u2019ve been placed under observation.\n\nThe purpose of House Bill 2226 was to prevent the sticker shock for patients who thought they were admitted to the hospital but then discover they\u2019re responsible for their own rehabilitation costs.\n\nThe bill, introduced in early February, never had a hearing.\n\nThe state\u2019s hospitals were not on board with the mandate, and some in the skilled nursing community said it did not go far enough.\n\n\u201cI think it needs to be immediate,\u201d Vidrickson said. \u201cYou need immediate notification if you\u2019re going to be designated observation or if you\u2019re going to be admitted, because there are decisions that need to be made.\u201d\n\nHollingsworth said she believes most Kansas hospitals already strive to keep patients informed on whether they\u2019ve been admitted, and requiring them to do so won\u2019t solve the Medicare reimbursement problems.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going fix the issue,\u201d Hollingsworth said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to fix the issue is a payment reform that will allow these observation days to count toward that three-day stay.\u201d\n\nHospitals support federal regulations to relax the three-day stay rule, and their position has new backing from the nonpartisan panel that advises Congress on Medicare matters, known as the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC.\n\nEarlier this month MedPAC recommended that up to two observation days should count toward the three-day rule.\n\nArchuleta, the policy expert from the American Hospital Association, said several federal bills have been introduced seeking to change the rule or scrap it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of activity around this,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Archuleta is unsure about the prognosis for the pending bills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky issue because changing how observation stays are treated can be very expensive,\u201d she said, adding that the three-day rule was repealed once in 1988 but reinstated the following year.\n\n\u2018A national issue\u2019\n\nMore Medicare-eligible skilled nursing care would mean additional Medicare costs, but Lind said the increase is a lot higher on paper than in practical terms.\n\nHis research found that in the majority of cases, Medicare already is mistakenly approving payments for inpatient rehabilitation care because of lax enforcement of the three-day rule.\n\nLind estimates that counting observation days toward the three-day stay requirement would add about $5 million per year to the cost of Medicare, which currently runs to about $500 billion annually.\n\nBut Congress faces political pressure to curb Medicare costs, and Lind said an inspector general\u2019s report that corroborated his numbers on the lack of enforcement of the three-day rule recommended tightening enforcement to recoup those improper reimbursements.\n\n\u201cThey called for Medicare to recover the money, but in fact it\u2019s not happening and it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d Lind said. \u201cPut it this way: It seems like it would be easier to just fix the problem than to put a lot more people under a significant financial burden.\u201d\n\nAARP and other groups that represent seniors are supporting legislation like H.R. 1571, introduced last month, which would count all outpatient observation days toward the three-day requirement.\n\nVidrickson said she\u2019s going to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to talk with the Kansas congressional delegation about problems with the current requirement.\n\nShe said she spoke with U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts and U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp last summer and the two Kansas Republicans were attentive.\n\n\u201cThey understand the urgency,\u201d Vidrickson said. \u201cI felt comfortable speaking with them on this and appreciated their time and the response to that.\u201d\n\nArchuleta said lawmakers in other states likely are hearing similar appeals.\n\n\u201cThat is a national issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly become a very prominent issue.\u201d\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in Kansas are part of an ongoing national conflict over \u201cobservational stays\u201d that can leave the facilities and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/observational-hospital-stays-leave-medicare-patients-big-bills", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201504/hospital_bed_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in Kansas are part of an ongoing national conflict over \u201cobservational stays\u201d that can leave the facilities and", "title": "\u2018Observational\u2019 Hospital Stays Leave Medicare Patients With Big Bills"}, "story_id": 399413495, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Andy Marso", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "\u2018Observational\u2019 Hospital Stays Leave Medicare Patients With Big Bills"}, "nid": 71748, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "keywords": "Medicare, hospitals, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 2070, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0638\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThose audits were scrutinizing one-day inpatient stays and had a lot of hospitals getting denials of their inpatient stays,\u201d Lind said.\nCarroll said she has seen Medicare patients who have been in the hospital for observation stays of up to seven days.\nDuring that time, hospitals\u2019 use of observation services for Medicare patients doubled and the duration of observation stays also grew at a high rate.\nShe said they come in batches but average about one a month, and those Medicare patients face thousands of dollars in surprise out-of-pocket expenses.\nHospitals and skilled nursing facilities in Kansas are part of an ongoing national conflict over \u201cobservational stays\u201d that can leave the facilities and Medicare patients on the hook for uncovered rehabilitation costs after they leave the hospital."}
