Who files qui tam lawsuits?

Many are filed by current or former employees of the companies they sue. Suits can involve any industry, but most are in the health-care industry. In 2010, a former employee at GlaxoSmithKline PLC received about $96 million of the federal share of $750 million that the drug maker agreed to pay the government to settle allegations it sold substandard drugs. The company denied the allegations but pleaded guilty to a related criminal charge. (Glaxo declines to comment beyond what it said in 2010, when it said it regretted that a now-closed plant didnâ€™t meet quality standards.) A smaller percentage of qui tam suits are filed by outsiders, such as doctors or pharmacists who interact with the companies.
