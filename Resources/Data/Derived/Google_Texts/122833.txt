Bill Maher went after Ben Carson’s offbeat religion Seventh-day Adventism on his “Real Time” segment “New Rules” Friday night. But it wasn’t just the Seventh-day Adventist that were a target, it was all Christianity sects that deviate from the mainstream with curious beliefs.

The history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church extends to pastor William Miller who said Jesus would return on October 22, 1844. “Spoiler alert,” Maher said. “He didn’t, which you’d think would have made the followers go, ‘Well, I guess that was a bunch of bullshit.’ It’s like believing in the Wizard of Oz, after Toto pulls back the curtain.”

Maher went on to explain that the “return” wasn’t the only distinctive deviation, the church also is “obsessed with the world ending.” In fact, believers in the Seventh-day Adventists church refer to the world not ending in 1844 as “The Great Disappointment.”

“They’re disappointed that the world still exists,” Maher said. “I don’t have to agree with a politician on everything. We can disagree on abortion, entitlements, paid sick leave, the earned income tax credit, but the earth staying is kind of a deal breaker for me … Politicians love to talk about fundamental differences. This is as fundamental as it gets, folks.”

Maher went on to talk about Texas republican Representative Lamar Smith who is a Christian Scientist that believes faith should take precedence over science. Christian Scientists are typically at odds with the government because they refuse to vaccinate their children and deny medician or any treatment in the event of illness. “He wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with prayer,” Maher said.
