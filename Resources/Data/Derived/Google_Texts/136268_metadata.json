Doug Holder in the Florida House.\n\nOne ad by a group calling itself Seniors for Affordable Care rips Venice doctor Julio Gonzalez as \u201cdangerously liberal\u201d and alleging he supports death panels \u201cworse than those in Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe other ad from the Better Florida Fund Corp. calls Venice attorney Richard DeNapoli a \u201cCharlie Crist Republican\u201d \u201cwho once worked for Bill Clinton.\u201d\n\nBoth DeNapoli and Gonzalez call the ads targeting them unfair, saying they are misrepresentations.\n\nThe two are running to represent House District 74, which includes most of south Sarasota County, including all of Venice and North Port.\n\nThe Seniors for Affordable Care ad seizes on a book Gonzalez wrote in 2009 in which he calls for the creation of health index scores for patients who need medical care.\n\n\u201cOnce the patient reaches that health index score, government and insurance funding designed to cure major illnesses such as cancer should be discontinued,\u201d Gonzalez wrote in \u201cHealth Care Reform \u2014 The Truth.\u201d \u201cFor the sake of the patient, his loved ones and our economy, efforts should be redirected from curative to supportive.\u201d\n\nGonzalez said he was not proposing a \u201cdeath panel,\u201d a term conservatives used in critizing health care reform. He said he was only pointing out the problem that patients now can be put through prolonged, painful treatments when there is not chance of medicine helping them.\n\nWho is funding the ads against Gonzalez is a mystery. Seniors for Affordable Care was created in August 2013 by Melbourne resident Carmela Falcone, according to the Florida Division of Elections. But the committee reports having raised no money or spending any money as of July 4.\n\nThe committee was created on Aug. 21, 2013, sixteen days after DeNapoli filed to run for the state Legislature.\n\nFalcone has previously been part of other political committees that included Anthony Pedicini, who is a campaign consultant for DeNapoli.\n\nDeNapoli is playing his own defense on the ads from the Better Florida Fund Corp., which started airing on Friday.\n\nDeNapoli said the ad saying he worked for Bill Clinton is misleading. He said when he was 19 years old he was an unpaid intern for the White House General Counsel\u2019s Office. On a past r\u00e9sum\u00e9, DeNapoli said the 1996 post was a \u201cnon-partisan\u201d position.\n\nDeNapoli said the ad also is misleading because it says he is a \u201cCharlie Crist Republican.\u201d He said he donated to Crist in October 2009 when Crist was still a Republican running for the U.S. Senate. That donation was about a month after Gonzalez also donated to Crist for his failed U.S. Senate campaign against eventual winner Marco Rubio.\n\nDeNapoli said after Crist left the Republican Party in the spring of 2010, he stopped supporting Crist and backed Rubio.\n\n\u201cLike many other Sarasota County Republicans, including my opponent, I supported the Republican Governor at the time until he betrayed us,\u201d DeNapoli said.\n\nAs he has done in past forums and debate, DeNapoli blasted Gonzalez for having given $500 to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, in 2008. Gonzalez said he gave the donation in a bid to help persuade Wasserman Schultz on health care issues, but it failed.\n\nState campaign records show the The Better Florida Fund Corp., which is running the ad against DeNapoli, was created in February and has received almost all of its $1.2 million in funding from the Florida Medical Association. The phone number for the Better Florida Fund Corp is also the same as the Florida Medical Association\u2019s headquarters in Tallahassee.\n\nThe latest attacks in the race follow past charges that DeNapoli is a carpetbagger because he moved to Sarasota County in 2013, and DeNapoli alleging someone has been peeping through his living room windows trying to dig up dirt on him.\n\nDeNapoli and Gonzalez face each other in another campaign forum on Tuesday. Both are scheduled to speak to the Nokomis Area Civic Association at 7 p.m. at the Nokomis Community Center, 234 Nippino Trail, Nokomis.\n\nCheck out the ads here:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/d74mugs.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "\u201cDeath panels\u201d and ties to former President Bill Clinton have become issues in what has become one of the state\u2019s most bitter Florida legislative races.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde92b\"", "article_summary": "The phone number for the Better Florida Fund Corp is also the same as the Florida Medical Association\u2019s headquarters in Tallahassee.\nDeNapoli is playing his own defense on the ads from the Better Florida Fund Corp., which started airing on Friday.\nGonzalez said he gave the donation in a bid to help persuade Wasserman Schultz on health care issues, but it failed.\nThe two are running to represent House District 74, which includes most of south Sarasota County, including all of Venice and North Port.\nDeNapoli said after Crist left the Republican Party in the spring of 2010, he stopped supporting Crist and backed Rubio."}
