Nance’s group is constantly on the lookout for anything that screams indoctrination, though it lost its most recent battle against the potential National Women's History Museum. “What we really came to understand was that this was really representing a real jaundiced view of history,” Nance told Whispers at the time, explaining the opposition. Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in an overwhelming majority, passed a bill that would look into the creation of such a museum in Washington. Nance said she would only support legislation that provided safeguards to ensure there's equal representation of conservatives in the museum's corridors. “This can’t be a shrine to feminism on the National Mall,” she said.

Nance connected the two issues by saying that the one upside of the museum is that it could employ “jobless feminists” who had pursued women’s studies. “But back to the point,” she said. “Well done USC Upstate! Women’s studies majors may in fact more clearly understand their ‘rights’ and whether they are actually being violated after a thorough reading of the Constitution.”
