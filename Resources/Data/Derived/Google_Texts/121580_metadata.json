Mike Coffman and his Democratic challenger, Andrew Romanoff, clashed over immigration, campaign finance and the budget on Thursday, in the first debate in one of the most competitive, expensive and closely watched House contests in the nation.\n\nColorado\u2019s 6th Congressional District is evenly divided between Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters, and both parties and their supporters are pouring funds into the battle between three-term incumbent Coffman and Romanoff, a former Colorado House speaker.\n\nOn Thursday morning before a standing-room-only crowd, Coffman portrayed himself as a leader willing to cut waste in the military budget and take bold steps for the country\u2019s good. Romanoff fashioned himself as a nonpartisan, solutions-oriented candidate appalled by Washington gridlock.\n\nAt one point Romanoff, who refuses to accept contributions from political action committees, asked Coffman to agree to a deal refusing all \u201cspecial interest\u201d money in the race. Coffman, who comes from a military family and is the only congressman to fight in both the Gulf and Iraq Wars, declined.\n\nImmigration has been a flashpoint in the district, which Democrats redrew after the 2010 election to move Coffman from terrain formerly represented by immigration firebrand Tom Tancredo to an area that is 20 percent Hispanic. Coffman began studying Spanish and announced his support for letting people brought into the country illegally as children earn citizenship through military service. On Thursday, the congressman called for a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach on immigration that begins with securing the border, but he said he opposed \u201ca special path to citizenship for adults who knowingly broke the law.\u201d\n\nRomanoff responded that Coffman\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t \u201ca substitute for the comprehensive immigration reform this nation so desperately needs.\u201d He reiterated his support for the bipartisan Senate bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million people living here illegally and bolster border security. Coffman opposed the Senate bill, which died in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nRomanoff\u2019s first television commercial calls for a balanced budget amendment, but Coffman and the debate moderator challenged him to name specific cuts that would erase the deficit. Instead, Romanoff spoke of growing the economy and breaking what he described as a special-interest stranglehold on Washington. As an example, he called for letting the federal government negotiate bulk discounts on pharmaceuticals, an effort the industry has repeatedly squelched and one that he said could save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nCoffman said he opted out of the congressional health plan and bought his insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange, which was significantly worse. \u201cIf every member of congress did what I did, Obamacare would not be standing today,\u201d he said, earning cheers and boos when he called for repealing the law.\n\nRomanoff replied: \u201cIt\u2019d be a good idea to fix the law rather than repeal it and replace it with nothing but empty phrases.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates largely agreed on foreign policy. Coffman said the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a mistake and criticized the Bush administration\u2019s handling of Afghanistan as well. \u201cWe want to be idealistic on foreign policy and believe everything is black and white, and often it\u2019s in shades of grey,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cWe need a much more realistic American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nRomanoff agreed and repeatedly praised Coffman\u2019s military service. But he made clear he saw the incumbent as part of the problem in Washington. \u201cIf we elect the same crowd that is running congress today, nothing is going to change,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Campaign 2014 Stories\n\nRep.
