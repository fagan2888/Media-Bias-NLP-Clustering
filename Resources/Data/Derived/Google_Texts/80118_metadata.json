(WAVY) \u2014 At the age of 54, the once vibrant Ruth Furnace, engaging, fun, full of life, now lives in the clutches of ALS.\n\nAs if the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, wasn\u2019t enough, Ruth\u2019s medical conditions also include: Hypothyroidism and diabetes; she has a tracheostomy, is on a ventilator, is bowel/bladder incontinent, is bed bound, unable to speak, has had multiple emergency room visits in last year, and is on oxygen.\n\nThe ALS began three years ago in Ruth\u2019s pinky finger.\n\nPhotos: Man faces uphill battle with wife\u2019s care\n\nHer only communication now is by blinking words using the Tobii eye gazer. It is a slow and tedious process, and only her eyes let you know she\u2019s there, thinking, but trapped, and so is her husband Chris. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m a prisoner in my home. When I come home I cannot leave to go anywhere. I am trapped in the home unless there is someone who can relieve me.\u201d\n\nChris is Ruth\u2019s primary caregiver, and admits he\u2019s not qualified to serve Ruth\u2019s complex medical conditions and needs, nor is family friend Dayle Alligood, who watches Ruth while Chris is working. \u201cI love my wife, and I will do this for her, as she would do the same for me.\u201d\n\nThe desired outcome for the Furnace Family is to get full-time home care, but the rules or conditions set by the insurance company are denying that.\n\nChris says he has the coverage he needs to bring in full-time, skilled help to take care of Ruth. He has Home Health Care coverage through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois which includes Private Duty Nurse, and he has a Skilled Nursing Care clause. \u201cI mean we all pay a lot for insurance, and we expect something for it. They should be able to tell me what they can do, but they have done nothing.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to navigate the insurance maze to get the benefits he thinks he deserves, Chris contacted 10 on Your Side.\n\nWhen asked if she is frustrated by her current situation, Ruth nodded yes.\n\n10 On Your Side started working the phones, reaching out to Chris\u2019s insurance Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, emailing, getting reviews of the Furnace case, looking at their policy, some of it head scratch confusing.\n\nMary Ann Schultz, who is a Sr. Manager for Media Relations Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, replied to 10 On Your Side\u2019s requests for an explanation, in an email. It simply stated:\n\n\u201cMrs. Furnace does not meet the medical criteria for private duty nursing per her plan benefit.\u201d\n\nNot so says Scott Golden, an ALS advocate for the ALS Association DC/MD/VA. \u201cA doctor could validate there is skilled coordinated care necessary, and go through their reasons and that is covered under their policy.\u201d\n\nIn denying service, Blue Cross writes the reason is Ruth is \u201cwithout any clinical likelihood of improvement of condition.\u201d\n\nGolden response to this was, \u201cThey are not giving you the benefit you deserve, and therefore you can\u2019t get the other benefit which is the Medicaid benefit that you are entitled to. That is really a Catch 22.\u201d\n\nAs bad luck would have it, Ruth Furnace was admitted to the intensive care unit at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital last Tuesday, with a urinary tract infection. Eight days later, she remains hospitalized.\n\nChris blames Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, \u201cIt could have been avoided because the problem she has would have been seen by a skilled nurse.\u201d\n\nAfter 10 On Your Side started this investigation, Blue Cross Blue Shield had a change of heart and approved ten more Skilled Nursing Visits.\n\nGolden said, \u201cUpon further review I think the insurance company with some persuasion will actually cover what they are supposed to, but they won\u2019t make it easy for anybody.\u201d\n\nHowever, Blue Cross Blue Shield goes further, and has promised to the Furnaces, \u201cSkilled nursing visits are approved until there is approval of a Private Duty Nurse.\u201d\n\nChris adds, \u201cI want to thank you very much that you have gone to the extent to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nIn the big picture of the ALS community Scott Golden thinks stories like these are important to connect the dots for people like the Furnaces. \u201cUnfortunately, this is typical. I am glad you have taken the interest to give the ALS community a voice. Hopefully, someone will listen and there will be progress in this area.\u201d\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nInformation on insurance for individuals with ALS\n\nThe ALS Association\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, policies legally have to provide uniform coverage. Scott Golden provided these tips for families battling coverage for ALS:\n\nAlways get your outline of benefits. Make sure you have an advocate to help. Groups like the ALS Association, insurance brokers, HR specialists at your company and any passionate person who knows insurance and wants to help. Just because the insurance company says No at first, does not mean they will say No later. If a denial does not make sense it probably does not make sense. Don\u2019t quit. The insurance companies expect you will. Patience is a virtue-things do not happen quickly in insurance, but things happen\u2026.Hang in there. Don\u2019t be ignorant about your benefits; this is very important.\n\nFor ALS patients, review the benefits that will be most important and know what standards are to get things paid. Get your providers on board before seeking care so you are ready for the battle.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Hampton Roads Virginia and Northeastern North Carolina News, Weather, Traffic and Sports", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488237027", "og": {"site_name": "WAVY-TV", "description": "A Norfolk man says he has insurance coverage for his wife who has ALS but can\u2019t get the benefits he needs.", "title": "An insurance Catch 22: Family fights for ALS benefits", "url": "http://wavy.com/2015/02/05/an-insurance-catch-22-a-fight-for-als-benefits/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwavy.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/91b7626fc1684287bf925cf19a203db1.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Norfolk man says he has insurance coverage for his wife who has ALS but can\u2019t get the benefits he needs.", "title": "An insurance Catch 22: Family fights for ALS benefits", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwavy.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/91b7626fc1684287bf925cf19a203db1.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WAVY_News", "site": "wavy_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Hampton Roads, VA Local News, Weather, Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wavy", "fb": {"pages": 46472432035}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wavy.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/03a48a44367fdf73a3aab6bf39b901c9?s=16", "application-name": "WAVY-TV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wavytv10", "published_time": "2015-02-05T12:07:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T04:20:55+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "2CoPRGeMIaPfiwY_gCqAl9743bQYuq-0QVkHsIreAV4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A Norfolk man says he has insurance coverage for his wife who has ALS but can't get the benefits he needs."}, "article_summary": "Manager for Media Relations Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, replied to 10 On Your Side\u2019s requests for an explanation, in an email.\nHe has Home Health Care coverage through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois which includes Private Duty Nurse, and he has a Skilled Nursing Care clause.\nChris blames Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, \u201cIt could have been avoided because the problem she has would have been seen by a skilled nurse.\u201dAfter 10 On Your Side started this investigation, Blue Cross Blue Shield had a change of heart and approved ten more Skilled Nursing Visits.\nGroups like the ALS Association, insurance brokers, HR specialists at your company and any passionate person who knows insurance and wants to help.\nRuth FurnaceNORFOLK, Va.
