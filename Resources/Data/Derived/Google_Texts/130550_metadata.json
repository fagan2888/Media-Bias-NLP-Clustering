As healthcare trends toward a value-based reimbursement system, clinical integration is more important than ever, Quinn told the publication. There has long been conflict between CFOs and chief medical officers, but some providers form partnerships to cover more ground between the two positions, FierceHealthFinance previously reported.\n\nAbility to communicate without using financial jargon: Because a modern CFO must share more information with frontline staff, they must put the provider's challenges in terms a non-CFO can understand, according to Anderson. For example, at Virginia Mason, management training focuses on identifying and reducing waste, improving care quality and patient safety, and increasing efficiency, she said. \"I think a good CFO needs to encourage those kinds of experiences to create more skills and depth in the finance team,\" Anderson told Becker's.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow hospitals benefit from CFO/CMO partnerships\n\nCFOs, technology play big role in patient engagement\n\n5 concerns that should keep hospital CFOs up at night\n\nMany CFOs at struggling hospitals expect to lose their jobs", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the post-Affordable Care Act healthcare landscape shifts,\u00a0the job of chief financial officers becomes more complex, and effective CFOs must have a few key traits,\u00a0according to\u00a0Becker's Hospital Review.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthFinance", "description": "As the post-Affordable Care Act healthcare landscape shifts,\u00a0the job of chief financial officers becomes more complex, and effective CFOs must have a few key traits,\u00a0according to\u00a0Becker's Hospital Review.", "title": "3 essential qualities for CFOs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthfinance.com/story/3-essential-qualities-cfos/2014-12-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthfinance.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Chief Financial Officers,Communication Problems,Hospital Leadership,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0ac\"", "article_summary": "\"I think a good CFO needs to encourage those kinds of experiences to create more skills and depth in the finance team,\" Anderson told Becker's.\nEffective partnerships with other leaders: To fine-tune working relationships with the rest of the C-suite, it's vital that CFOs can work with people, Anderson told Becker's.\nAs healthcare trends toward a value-based reimbursement system, clinical integration is more important than ever, Quinn told the publication.\n\"[W]hat's really important is to understand clinical programs and operations and what the frontline care team is doing,\" she said.\nAs the post-Affordable Care Act healthcare landscape shifts, the job of chief financial officers becomes more complex, and effective CFOs must have a few key traits, according to Becker's Hospital Review."}
