But it\u2019s easy to find locals who say a focus on eating uncooked fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds balances their weight, boosts their energy and wellbeing, and alleviates symptoms from health issues like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and inflammatory pain.\n\nThe raw diet contends cooking decreases nutrition and enzymes. Preparation techniques include sprouting, dehydrating, marinating, and fermentation. It\u2019s possible to include nonvegetarian foods, such as sashimi and raw cheese.\n\nJim White, a registered dietician and spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, says more research is needed to support raw diet claims.\n\n\u201cEven though people may say they feel better and the diet improves their health, if not followed correctly or modified it can lead to shortages in Calcium, Vitamin D, and B-12, to name a few,\u201d he says \u2014 adding that any time people consume raw foods such as unpasteurized milk, they put themselves at risk of foodborne illness.\n\nIonie Bergs, owner of Ionie ~ Healing Center & Raw Food Caf\u00e9 in Sarasota, was vegan vegetarian when she read \u201cRainbow Green Live-Food Cuisine\u201d by Gabriel Cousens, M.D., 10 years ago. She has eaten vegan raw food ever since.\n\n\u201cLive food gives life,\u201d Bergs says. \u201cThat just made sense to me.\u201d She experienced \u201ca wonderful rejuvenation. My energy level skyrocketed. My skin got clearer. Areas where I had lost enamel on my teeth remineralized.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Bergs\u2019 older sister, Rachel, was dying in England of lung cancer. Bergs stayed with Rachel the last six weeks of her life, preparing raw foods for her. She believes the diet relieved her sister\u2019s pain and coughing.\n\nBergs opened the caf\u00e9 in June 2012, with an organic vegan menu free of dairy, gluten and GMOs (genetically modified organisms).\n\n\u201cWe try to do things that people wouldn\u2019t want to do at home,\u201d Bergs says. \u201cIf it was just a salad, anybody could do that.\u201d\n\nSarasota physician Dan Watts has The Renewal Point integrative medicine practice. He was diagnosed 12 years ago with lymphoma cancer. He selected a nontraditional regime that included making his diet 60 to 80 percent raw food.\n\n\u201cI was able to have it go into remission,\u201d he said. He believes changing his diet helped. \u201cYou want to make an environment where cancer does not want to grow,\u201d says Watts, whose training includes a master\u2019s in nutrition and metabolic medicine. His intake now is 40 percent raw organic fruits and vegetables, and he tries to stick with organic meats and wild fish. \u201cI\u2019m 69, and I feel better than I did 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nTestimonials abound Gina Iovine of Sarasota, a saleswoman for Armour Tight Concrete of Bradenton, credits a raw diet and hot yoga with decreasing the daily insulin shots she takes for Type 1 diabetes from five to two or three. She is a pescaterian \u2014 fish and produce \u2014 about 90 percent on raw foods, and stays away from sugar and GMOs.\n\nIovine changed her diet 2\u00bd years ago after seeing the effect of putting her dog, now 14, on organic raw meat.\n\n\u201cI watched the clock turn back,\u201d Iovine says. \u201cShe jumped in the car. She wanted to play.\u201d\n\nIovine read \u201cRaw Food and Hot Yoga\u201d by Tonya Zavasta and started patronizing Ionie\u2019s caf\u00e9 and buying organic produce.\n\nIovine said she regained mobility in a frozen shoulder and lost 15 pounds. She also says she\u2019s noticed wiry gray hair growing in smooth and brown.\n\nTony Souza of Sarasota, a Realtor with Premiere Sotheby\u2019s International and former president of the Downtown Alliance, said in the three months since he started a raw vegan lifestyle he dropped 30 pounds and his blood pressure decreased so much his doctor cut Souza\u2019s medication in half.\n\n\u201cWhen I was eating the wrong food I\u2019d get heartburn sometimes, and I haven\u2019t had heartburn in three months,\u201d Souza says. When he can\u2019t get raw cuisine, he stays vegetarian. He doesn\u2019t feel deprived by the raw diet: \u201cI\u2019m not hungry whatsoever.\u201d\n\nJenna Norwood of Sarasota was a selfdescribed \u201cjunk-food vegetarian\u201d who ate processed carbs and few fruits and vegetables. In 2005, she started the raw diet and recorded the first three weeks in a documentary, \u201cSupercharge Me!\u201d\n\nNorwood says she lost weight, and experienced healing of chronic Achilles tendon pain from an old running injury and of a sprained thumb for which immobilizing surgery had been recommended.\n\nShe changed careers from public relations to motivational speaker, health advocate, life coach and raw food chef. She\u2019s cut back on speaking for now to work with cancer patients through a physician.\n\nTen years out, she says her diet is all vegan and mostly raw. She\u2019s seen a growth in awareness of the raw food movement, she says: \u201cI\u2019m completely committed to spreading the word about it, all over the world.\u201d\n\nNorwood says Sarasota is leading the way. More restaurants have raw vegetarian cuisine available. Organic produce is accessible through Whole Foods and farmers markets. Raw Sarasota, a Meetup group founded by Norwood, has more than 1,0000 members who meet for potlucks and classes.\n\nShe knows people who were into raw food in the 1970s, when it was introduced into the United States.\n\n\u201cThe problem was the food wasn\u2019t tasty,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd since then we\u2019ve had some fantastic chefs who have come along.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people in the movement ferment their own sauerkraut and prepare other recipes, she says, but in general once someone transitions into raw food they\u2019re more satisfied with simplicity and search less for gourmet dishes.\n\n\u201cThe average person would probably just eat raw fruit and salad, and go out to restaurants,\u201d she says.\n\nRaw food resources\n\nIonie Raw Food Caf\u00e9: 1241 Fruitville Road, Sarasota, ionie.com\n\nBeauty of Sprouts restaurant: 1472 Fruitville Road, Sarasota, beautyofsprouts.net\n\nRaw Sarasota group: meetup.com/rawsarasota\n\nTips, recipes and videos: jennanorwood.com;", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/09/HFRAW29_10500359.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b48\"", "article_summary": "Raw food resourcesIonie Raw Food Caf\u00e9: 1241 Fruitville Road, Sarasota, ionie.comBeauty of Sprouts restaurant: 1472 Fruitville Road, Sarasota, beautyofsprouts.netRaw Sarasota group: meetup.com/rawsarasotaTips, recipes and videos: jennanorwood.com;\nThe raw diet contends cooking decreases nutrition and enzymes.\nShe knows people who were into raw food in the 1970s, when it was introduced into the United States.\nRaw Sarasota, a Meetup group founded by Norwood, has more than 1,0000 members who meet for potlucks and classes.\nShe has eaten vegan raw food ever since."}
