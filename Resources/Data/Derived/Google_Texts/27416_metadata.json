This year, things are a little harder.\n\n\"You're worried a bit about losing dollars but with this, at least, we're happy that there's still money coming in to catch up and hopefully smooth things over a little bit,\" said Heather Crom, a Riverdale Shores resident.\n\nConstruction along Estero Boulevard during the season has made traffic a nightmare for some. Others working on the beach said water discharges from Lake Okeechobee are a bigger problem.\n\n\"The discharges this time around are epic in the sense that it's happening right in the middle of season itself where usually it's a summertime issue,\" said John Heim, with the Doghouse Restaurant.\n\nPeople have recently been worried about water quality issues resulting in a lack of tourism on Fort Myers Beach, but this weekend, the shrimp festival has reversed that trend.\n\nThe Matanzas Pass Bridge was closed for two hours Saturday morning because of the parade and a 5K. With the major vein onto the island cut off, it kept tourists on the island longer.\n\n\"Oh, I would say over a thousand people are down here for sure today without question,\" Heim said.\n\nIt was a large concentration of people ready to spend money in a place that thrives on tourism.\n\n\"They'll definitely get a lot more money today. We were worried with the waters coming in, we were worried that it was going to slow down because we're not gonna have the tourism,\" Crom said.\n\nThe festival continues Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with more than 100 vendors - and of course, locally-harvested shrimp.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The 58th Annual Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Festival got off to a big start Saturday.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/31455377/fort-myers-beach-shrimp-festival-brings-thousands-to-island", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The 58th Annual Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Festival got off to a big start Saturday.", "title": "Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Festival brings big business"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/10087802_G.jpg", "description": "The 58th Annual Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Festival got off to a big start Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Festival brings big business"}, "wnreadableurl": "fort-myers-beach-shrimp-festival-brings-thousands-to-island", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/03/12", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "owner": "WZVN", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08"}, "article_summary": "The 58th Annual Fort Myers Beach Shrimp Festival got off to a big start Saturday.\n\"They'll definitely get a lot more money today.\nPeople have recently been worried about water quality issues resulting in a lack of tourism on Fort Myers Beach, but this weekend, the shrimp festival has reversed that trend.\nThe event that Pete McCagg helped found has grown into a two-mile parade and festival that draws thousands over the weekend.\nThe festival continues Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with more than 100 vendors - and of course, locally-harvested shrimp."}
