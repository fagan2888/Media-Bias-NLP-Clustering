Bevin has since said he would scale back Kentucky\u2019s involvement in Medicaid, which has added some 400,000 Kentuckians to its rolls since Gov. Steve Beshear decided to expand the program under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nConway also attacked Bevin\u2019s previous statements on early childhood education. During a GOP primary debate on KET earlier this year, Bevin said the federal Head Start program \u201cserves no purpose\u201d beyond the third grade.\n\nDuring the debate Sunday, which was held at Eastern Kentucky University and hosted by the Kentucky League of Women Voters, Bevin suggested that he favored other early education programs, including Success by 6, which was created by the United Way.\n\nConway proposed guaranteeing \u201cearly learning experiences\u201d for three- and four-year-olds in families up earning to 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nBoth men said that budget constraints would limit the state\u2019s ability to invest in early childhood education.\n\nThe candidates differed sharply on medical marijuana, with Conway coming down against it, saying that the medical community doesn\u2019t support it.\n\n\u201cIf we passed a law for medical marijuana, it would be easier to get on our streets,\u201d Conway said.\n\nBevin supports legalizing medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cI think it should be prescribed like any other prescription drug, I think it should be regulated in the very same fashion,\u201d Bevin said.\n\nConway touted his record as attorney general, saying he\u2019s put $300 million into state coffers through settlements and successful lawsuits. Bevin accused Conway of \u201csuing the very companies that we say we want to get to come to this state.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want a businessperson who\u2019s actually created jobs or a liberal attorney who is shaking people down and thinks he\u2019s going to lead this state forward?\u201d Bevin said.\n\nAfter the debate, Bevin quarreled with reporters, initially refusing to take questions from Lexington Herald-Leader political writer Sam Youngman.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve made this clear that I\u2019m not taking questions from certain people,\u201d Bevin said. He did not provide a reason.\n\nBevin eventually relented, answering a question about his running mate Jenean Hampton\u2019s comment last week that early childhood education was a \u201cnon-issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not speak for her, nor does she speak for me,\u201d Bevin said.\n\nIndependent candidate Drew Curtis was not invited to the debate because he did not meet the 10 percent polling requirement.\n\nThe event was the third televised gubernatorial debate of the election season. The candidates square off again on KET Monday evening.
