Frankly, I think it's the tip of the iceberg,\" Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, told Reuters after Stempfley's testimony.\n\n\"That's the first public testimony we've had on this and we'll certainly follow up,\" McCaul added.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials declined to provide further details on cybersecurity incidents related to HealthCare.gov. One department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said after the hearing that the incidents were not considered significant.\n\nThe official also said the DHS cybersecurity office has not received any report of a successful attack on HealthCare.gov.\n\nDuring the hearing, Stempfley told lawmakers that \"we are aware of one open-source action attempting to perpetrate a denial of service attack against the HealthCare.gov site that has been unsuccessful.\"\n\nAlthough some lawmakers on the panel took Stempfley's words to indicate an acknowledgement of an attempted cyberattack on the site, department officials later said Stempfley was not referring to any actual attempted cyberattack but to an unsuccessful software tool created to enable such an attack.\n\nStempfley did not comment after the hearing.\n\nSecurity researchers last week reported that hacker activists were distributing a software tool through social media sites that was designed to attack the site by performing requests to pull up several pages on HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe developers of the software - dubbed \"Destroy Obama Care!\" - said in remarks annotated in the tool that its purpose was to overload and crash the system, according to a screenshot posted by security researchers with Arbor Networks.\n\nThe Arbor Networks researchers said that the tool was unlikely to succeed in taking down the site because of weaknesses in its design.\n\nStempfley said the HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the lead health agency managing the rollout of the site, had not sent a specific request for help, so federal cyber officials have not provided any technical assistance yet.\n\nHenry Chao, deputy chief information officer for CMS, said at another hearing on Wednesday that the information technology system behind the website employs \"stringent privacy and security controls to safeguard consumer data.\"\n\nObama has promised Americans that the website will work for most people by the end of the month - a critical deadline for those who need to sign up for insurance benefits that would start on January 1.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Will
