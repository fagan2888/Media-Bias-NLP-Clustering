On “Fox & Friends” Monday, co-host Steve Doocy was speaking to Florida Representative Daniel Webster — the first person to announce publicly their intention to run to replace outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner — when he made a curious statement about the outgoing Speaker’s politics vis-a-vis those of Fox News.

Doocy began by noting that most insiders believe California Representative Kevin McCarthy will be the next Speaker — though somehow neither noted that if a novelist included an incoming House Speaker named “McCarthy” in their next political thriller, they’d be told, rightly, that they’re being far too obvious. He explained that in his interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Boehner warned of “absolutely unrealistic…false prophets spreading noise about how much can be done.”

“This plan never had a chance,” speaking of a failed attempt to defund Obamacare that led to a government shutdown in 2013. “But over the course of the August recess in 2013 and the course of September, a lot of my Republican colleagues who knew it was a fool’s errand, they were getting a lot of pressure at home to do this. And so we got groups here in town, members, the House and Senate here in town who whipped people into a frenzy believing they could accomplish things that they know, they know are never going to happen.”
