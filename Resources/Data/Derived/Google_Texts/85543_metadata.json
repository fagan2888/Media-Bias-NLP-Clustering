I celebrate every day that I\u2019m alive,\u201d Jamie Justice, executive director for NAMI Utah told the cheering crowd. She also acknowledged that she lives with a mental illness, a secret she kept for many years. \u201cIn the moments when I feel despair, I look into my baby boy\u2019s eyes and I\u2019m so grateful that I did not take my life.\u201d\n\nJustice praised the audience for their own daily victories.\n\n\u201cI look at all of you and I\u2019ve got so much hope. All of you are warriors in your own right,\u201d Justice said. \u201cYou wake up every day and keep fighting and you keep going. And you keep proving to everybody in the world . . . that you are champions and will go forward every single day living the life you want to live, a life of hope and a life of recovery.\n\nSeveral lawmakers who are sponsoring bills to benefit this community in recovery spoke Tuesday about their efforts to fund mental health and addiction treatment programs and to stem the tide of opiate and suicide deaths.\n\nRELATED: Addiction recovery group to rally for overdose awareness\n\nRep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy is sponsoring HB308, which will establish a needle exchange program that reduces harm to drug users and also provides an opportunity to interface with people who can introduce them to treatment opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me a year ago that a white Mormon would be sponsoring a needle exchange bill I would have said you were crazy,\u201d Eliason said. But his landmark legislation cleared the Utah House 72-0 and now awaits action in the Senate.\n\nRep. Paul Ray, R-Clinton told the crowd how far such legislation had progressed over the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about mental illness, we didn\u2019t talk about substance abuse,\u201d Ray said. \u201cAnd its because of everything you guys have done, we brought it to the forefront. We\u2019re able to . . . work on it and try to fix it.\u201d\n\nSen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, is sponsoring SB77, a bill that would allow full Medicaid expansion under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nDavis pointed to a sign in the crowd that said \u201cWe\u2019re worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes you are, everybody is worth having access to quality health care that they need,\u201d Davis said.\n\nLas Vegas residents Stephon Lofton and Jared Barker found themselves in recovery programs in Salt Lake City. They participated in Tuesday\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cTreatment is going well,\u201d Lofton said of his five months at Odyssey House, acknowledging that he got caught up in methamphetamine use and wasn\u2019t going to stop on his own. \u201cSo drug court sent me to Utah to get me out of my environment.\u201d\n\nJosie Shaffer, a recovering heroin addict from Minnesota, said she\u2019d been in Salt Lake City for two weeks but sober for 93 days.\n\n\u201cThis program has definitely saved my life. I want to live a clean and sober life,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nThe Rally for Recovery was hosted by USARA (Utah Support Advocates for Recovery Awareness) and NAMI-Utah (National Alliance on Mental Illness-Utah).The rotunda event was preceded by the Walk to Remember outside the Capitol to commemorate lives lost to addiction and mental illness.\n\nContact reporter Cathy McKitrick at 801-625-4214 or cmckitrick@standard.net.
