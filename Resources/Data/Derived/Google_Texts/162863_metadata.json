That is when Owens, now 59, learned she was suffering from untreated diabetes. A social worker here, she\u2019d lost her health insurance after switching to part-time work in 2009. Private insurance was unaffordable. So, like millions of other uninsured across the country, Owens pinned her hopes on the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in March 2010.\n\nBut as the health care law\u2019s third annual enrollment period gears up to open on Nov. 1, Owens remains uninsured, with little realistic hope of gaining coverage. Complications from her chronic diabetes have left her too weak to return to full time employment. In many states, her part-time earnings would qualify her for coverage under Medicaid. But Mississippi, like the rest of the Deep South, has declined to accept federal funds to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program, a core initiative of the Affordable Care Act as it was originally envisioned.\n\nMore than 8.5 million U.S. citizens and legal residents have gained health coverage since 2013, when the federal insurance exchanges first opened. But, as Congressional Republicans continue to battle the law, officials in 19 states have refused to expand Medicaid, citing the requirement for states to shoulder 10 percent of the additional costs.\n\nIn Mississippi, where Medicaid eligibility rules are among the most restrictive in the country, expansion would extend insurance coverage to an estimated 139,000 low-income residents. Many, like Owens, are the working poor. Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, has been adamant in opposing expansion, saying there would be \u201cvery little incentive\u201d for people to seek work under the new eligibility rules.\n\n\u201cThere is no one who doesn\u2019t have health care in America,\u201d he said in a 2013 interview with Kaiser Health News. \u201cNo one. Now, they may end up going to the emergency room. [But] there are better ways to deal with people that need health care than this massive new program.\u201d\n\nOwens, desperate for treatment, visits a rural clinic with sliding scale fees, often turning to friends and family for help making the payments. She has no primary physician, and doctors at the clinic have yet to diagnose the underlying reason for her dramatic weight loss \u2014 over 130 pounds since her collapse five years ago.\n\nThough she\u2019s a lifelong Mississippian, Owens is considering a move to Michigan, a Medicaid-expansion state where her sister lives, simply to get access to insurance coverage. \u201cMy health is declining rapidly,\u201d she said. As a former social worker, Owens knows what services are available and how to navigate them. \u201cBut there\u2019s no resource to connect me to here, because I\u2019m in a state where the governor doesn\u2019t want to do this, for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nState legislators from Mississippi\u2019s Delta region, which leans Democratic, have struggled to convince the state\u2019s Republican leaders, who control both houses of the legislature, to move forward with the expansion. Their hopes now rest on the upcoming governor\u2019s election on Nov. 3, which will pit Bryant against Democratic candidate Robert Gray, a truck driver who himself does not have health insurance. Gray has promised to expand Medicaid if elected. He is considered the long shot.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat shocks me is that Mississippi is known as the Hospitality State, yet we\u2019re not being hospitable to each other,\u201d state Rep. John Hines, a Democrat from the Delta, recently told me in his office at the state Capitol in Jackson, where the Confederate flag still flies as part of the Mississippi state flag. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a racial thing,\u201d said Hines, who is Black. \u201cBut I can\u2019t understand why a state would do this to its own people.\u201d\n\nWorried Life Blues\n\nThe Delta is not, technically, a river delta, but a floodplain between the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers, worn down over millennia by the regular floods of the Mississippi. The rich farmland is worked primarily by large-scale agribusiness, and poverty rates in the Delta are among the highest in the country.\n\nLife expectancy in Mississippi is the lowest in the nation, and health outcomes are abysmal. For instance, the state has one of the highest rates of diabetes in the nation, and leg amputations \u2014 a gruesome outcome of advanced diabetes \u2014 are 70 percent more frequent in Mississippi than the national average.\n\nWhitney Carter, 23, grew up in the Delta, and studies journalism at Delta State University, where she also works part-time in the university bookstore. Like Gloria Owens, Carter falls into the Medicaid gap \u2014 not eligible for Medicaid, but too poor to qualify for federal subsidies toward private insurance, which kick in for those making at least $11,490 a year.\n\nCarter, who also suffers from diabetes, said that she routinely skips her doses of Metformin, a diabetes drug, to stretch the medication out. When we met in the DSU Student Union, she pointed out her visibly swollen ankles, a common symptom of diabetes and sometimes an early sign of kidney failure.\n\nWhitney Carter, the journalism student who could not treat her diabetes, expressed frustration that a full-time student with a part-time job could not get adequate health care in the world\u2019s richest nation. \u2018Whose shoulders does that fall on?\u2019 said Carter, who is Black.\n\nAs a child, Carter had Medicaid through the children\u2019s insurance provision, but aged out when she turned 19. \u201cA lot of people may look down on it, but it really helped me,\u201d she said of Medicaid. \u201cNow I\u2019m in my last year of college, trying to do something with my life. It would be nice if I could do that.\u201d\n\nI Don\u2019t Want Your Money\n\nThe federal government pays roughly $11 billion a year to compensate hospitals for unpaid emergency room bills. One of the goals of the Affordable Care Act was to shift that spending toward health insurance, by extending Medicaid eligibility to those making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, and subsidizing private insurance for those making more than 100 percent. Proponents of the law hope to bring overall public costs down by promoting routine access to preventative health care.\n\nThough the federal government has promised to foot at least 90 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion, the program is jointly administered by the states. In 2012, a Supreme Court ruling gave states the option to turn down federal funds to expand Medicaid eligibility. State governors and legislators who were politically opposed to the Affordable Care Act found they had a potent weapon to fight it.\n\nThough Republican governors in Ohio, Arizona, and elsewhere have agreed to accept federal expansion funds, 19 states, all with Republican governors or Republican-controlled legislatures , continue to opt out. More than 3 million people across the country fall into the resulting gap in coverage: they make too much to qualify for Medicaid in their state, and not enough to qualify for federal insurance subsidies. Of those in the Medicaid gap, nine out of 10 live in the South. They are disproportionately Black.\n\n\u201cWe have had tremendous resistance from the Republican leadership\u201d to Medicaid expansion, said Mississippi State Sen. Derrick Simmons, a Democrat from the Delta city of Greenville. \u201cYou started to get resistance before people even fully understood the provisions. That suggests it wasn\u2019t about the actual law, it was about other things: race, and who\u2019s currently in the White House.\u201d\n\nStandin\u2019 at the Crossroads\n\nIn August, Mississippi voters shocked the state\u2019s political establishment by nominating Robert Gray, a political unknown, as the state\u2019s Democratic candidate for governor. Gray has made Medicaid expansion a key issue of his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna expand it,\u201d he said in a recent phone interview. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how the economy works. It\u2019s like a tree \u2014 you\u2019ve gotta give water to the roots. If you don\u2019t, it starts dying from the top down.\u201d\n\nLife in the Mississippi Delta In the 18 counties that comprise the Delta, the average per capita income is $16,095. The state, which is home to nearly 3 million people, has a poverty rate of 22.7 percent. The U.S. poverty rate is 15.4 percent.\n\nIt would be an understatement to call Gray a dark-horse candidate. When his mother went to vote in Mississippi\u2019s state primary elections on Aug. 4, she was amused that one of the three nominees for governor had the same name as her son. She voted for him without realizing that she was actually voting for her own child.\n\nGray, a 46-year-old freight truck driver and former firefighter, had done no campaigning. He beat his opponents, both women who are active in state politics, by double-digit margins.\n\nThis unlikely candidate may be Mississippi\u2019s lone, quixotic hope for Medicaid expansion in the foreseeable future. Gray, who is self-employed, has long gone without health insurance over cost concerns. Though he isn\u2019t certain, he thinks his annual income after expenses would put him \u201cpretty close\u201d to falling in the Medicaid coverage gap.\n\nGray, the son of a Black mother and a White father, hopes to appeal across racial lines by emphasizing the economic benefits of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cMoney is money. It\u2019s not a Black and White issue anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nYou Live Your Life, And I\u2019ll Live Mine\n\nBryant, Mississippi\u2019s current governor, contends that expanding Medicaid would remove a significant incentive to seek work. He also sees expansion as unnecessary from a health care perspective.\n\nThe crux of Bryant\u2019s opposition has centered on costs, though. Mississippi currently spends 13 percent of its tax revenue on Medicaid, less than the national average of 17 percent. But state officials argue that expansion would squeeze out other services. \u201cWe can\u2019t fund the Medicaid population we currently have without two things \u2014 raising taxes or making tremendous cuts, draconian cuts, in education, transportation, public safety and job creation,\u201d Bryant has said.\n\nMedicaid expansion would cost Mississippi\u2019s state government $1.1 billion over the next decade, and would bring in an additional federal contribution of $12.8 billion, according to an analysis from the Urban Institute, an independent research group.\n\nMississippi has long prided itself on fiscal conservatism and balanced budgets. But historically, state leaders haven\u2019t seemed to mind accepting federal dollars, which account for more than 40 percent of the state\u2019s annual budget \u2014 a higher share than any other state. Is this debate just about money?\n\nOne of the most vivid encounters I had in Mississippi was in the parking lot of a restaurant in Jackson, across the street from a state health department building. A woman in her mid 60s struck up a conversation with me and the photographer I was traveling with. She was slight, with feathered gray hair and oval, wire-rimmed glasses.\n\nWhen I told her we were reporting on the state\u2019s Medicaid policy, she became animated. \u201cThe Blacks want everything, but who is going to pay for it? How is that fair?\u201d She went on, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to work for nothing.\u201d\n\nHealth care as a human right is basic.\u201d \u2014 Eulah Peterson of the Southern Rural Black Women\u2019s Initiative\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she added. \u201cOne of my best friends is Black.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who asked not to be named, is not alone in her sentiment. In February, Mississippi state Rep. Gene Alday told a local newspaper reporter, \u201cI come from a town where all the Blacks are getting food stamps\u2026. They don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe idea that public assistance programs only benefit non-Whites is a \u201ccommonly held belief,\u201d said James M. Thomas, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Mississippi. But in the U.S., 41 percent of Medicaid recipients are White, while 21 percent are Black. Those ratios are roughly reversed in Mississippi, where Black residents make up 38 percent of the population, about three times the national average.\n\nBryant, in a statement, called the idea that race plays a role in the Medicaid debate \u201creprehensible and utterly without merit.\u201d Yet a poll from April found opposition to Medicaid expansion heavily split along racial lines in Mississippi, with more than twice as much support for expansion among Black residents (88 percent) as among Whites (44 percent).\n\nMany of those most affected hear a familiar dog whistle in the Southern states\u2019 refusal to participate in Medicaid expansion \u2014 racial animus of the kind that has driven the debate over public benefits since the days of the Great Society.\n\nWhitney Carter, the journalism student who could not treat her diabetes, expressed frustration that a full-time student with a part-time job could not get adequate health care in the world\u2019s richest nation. \u201cWhose shoulders does that fall on?\u201d said Carter, who is Black. \u201cI feel like Black people are just tolerated, sometimes. We aren\u2019t accepted, we\u2019re tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Waterfront\n\nIt was a bright Wednesday afternoon, and nothing was biting. Johnny Jenkins sat on an upturned bucket, fishing off the levee that slants sharply from downtown Greenville, a Delta town of 33,000, into Lake Ferguson, an oxbow lake curling off the eastern bank of the Mississippi River.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole different story to what they know in the capital and what\u2019s happening in this world,\u201d said Jenkins, 52. A former truck driver, Jenkins tried for years to get Medicaid coverage, until chronic hip problems forced him out of work. After staying out of work on disability for two years, he automatically became eligible for Medicare. He now has to have a double hip replacement, but at least he has insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s a story I heard several times in the Delta \u2014 people who were forced out of work by untreated health issues gaining insurance coverage only after remaining on disability for two years.\n\nJenkins, who is Black, felt he\u2019d been pushed out of the workforce by Mississippi\u2019s health care policies. \u201cThe state of Mississippi is still back in the Jim Crow days. They can\u2019t put on a hooded sheet anymore, and they can\u2019t burn a cross in your yard, but they can still pencil whip you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can pencil whip you, and there ain\u2019t nothing you can do.\u201d\n\nA New Leaf\n\nAfter the Civil War, a group of freed slaves left the riverfront plantation of Joseph Davis, Jefferson\u2019s older brother, and struck out into the Delta backwoods. The community they founded in 1887, Mound Bayou, remains intentionally and entirely Black.\n\n\u201cWe have a unique experience that many Blacks cannot talk about,\u201d Eulah Peterson, former Mound Bayou alderman and vice mayor, said in an interview at the First Baptist Church, where she\u2019d requested we meet. \u201cI never had to worry about could I go to school here, or I couldn\u2019t go into that church.\u201d\n\nPeterson, 66, is a retired educator with a doctorate in special education administration, and speaks in the even, precise tone of a school principal who knows every excuse in the book. Her father moved to Mound Bayou in 1929, and worked as a printer. Her mother\u2019s father was born into slavery, seven years before the end of the Civil War. \u201cI\u2019m that close to slavery,\u201d she told me calmly.\n\nIn addition to a host of other civic activities that have filled Peterson\u2019s retirement, she is lead human rights commissioner for the Southern Rural Black Women\u2019s Initiative, which advocates on health care and other poverty-related issues.\n\n\u201cHealth care as a human right is basic,\u201d she said. The state\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid to include the working poor, she believes, \u201cis creating a whole group of people who are on a slow death roll.\u201d\n\nMound Bayou has long been a regional hub for health care. The all-Black Taborian Hospital operated here for four decades, before closing in 1983. Today, the Delta Health Center, a rural health clinic founded in the 1960s, sits on the western edge of town. The sliding-scale fee clinic served over 10,000 poor and low-income patients last year. Though most were Black, about 700 were White.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we do it, but we need to flip that switch that makes White people realize that they\u2019re being hurt too\u201d by the failure to expand Medicaid, said Peterson, who like others, knows that cities suffer and long-term costs for everyone soar when health insurance is not an option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just for Blacks. You\u2019re suffering, too.\u201d\n\n___________\n\nKeith Griffith is a freelance journalist in New York City. His work has appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Reader and Business Insider.
