Boston Medical Center And Tufts Medical Center End Merger Talks

Boston Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center announced Wednesday that they are ending merger talks.

The two nonprofit hospitals, which had been in talks since last year, said in a statement that both sides “determined that at this time it is best for our medical centers to remain separate.”

Here’s the full statement from BMC President Kate Walsh and Tufts President Michael Wagner:

Over the last several months, Tufts Medical Center and Boston Medical Center have carefully considered how we might combine our two organizations. We have had thoughtful conversations and considered different options for tackling the complex task of integrating two vital, but different, academic medical centers. After much consideration, we have determined that at this time it is best for our medical centers to remain separate. We conclude these discussions with great respect for each organization’s mission and remain open to future opportunities for collaboration as neighboring institutions.

When news broke about the possible merger back in December, Health Policy Commission Chairman Stuart Altman told WBUR’s Martha Bebinger that at first glance the merger could have been a good thing for the state.

“Both of these hospitals are high quality and lower cost,” Altman said in December. “To the extent their merger would bring efficiencies and savings, the Massachusetts health care system would benefit.”
