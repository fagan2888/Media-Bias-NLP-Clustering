GREG LYNCH / STAFF\n\nBy Hannah Poturalski\n\nStaff Writer\n\nMillions more Americans are gaining dental coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but the health care law isn\u2019t doing enough to improve reimbursement rates for the care, according to the dental community.\n\nApproximately 8.7 million children \u2014 and only about 800,000 adults \u2014 could gain extensive dental coverage through the ACA by 2018, according to the American Dental Association.\n\nThe health care law requires dental coverage be an essential health benefit for children; but insurers don\u2019t have to offer adult dental coverage, according to Healthcare.gov.\n\nA barrier to access dental care is the lack of private dental offices that accept Medicaid or limit the number of Medicaid patients due to a low reimbursement rate of 37 percent of marketplace fees, officials said.\n\nDr. Steven Moore, a West Chester dentist, said his office does not accept Medicaid because the reimbursement rate doesn\u2019t even cover his expenses.\n\n\u201cPeople providing the care need to make a living,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe\u2019ll treat everyone, but we can\u2019t lose money treating patients.\u201d\n\nMoore said he wouldn\u2019t be able to accept Medicaid and still be able to provide his employees a competitive wage, benefits, paid vacation, and pay the utility and insurance bills for his business.\n\nShortage of care\n\nButler County has two areas \u2014 Middletown and East Hamilton \u2014 designated as dental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\nMelanie Amato, spokeswoman for Ohio Department of Health, said Butler County\u2019s two shortage areas have a low-income designation, meaning there aren\u2019t enough dental providers serving the low-income population.\n\n\u201cOften, this segment of the population receives Medicaid or is uninsured and can\u2019t afford to pay full fees for dental care,\u201d Amato said. \u201cPrivate practice dental offices very rarely offer sliding fee payments.\u201d\n\nThe American Dental Association has said there\u2019s \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that reforming Medicaid and increasing reimbursement rates to market levels would increase access to dental care.\n\nAbout 71 percent of Ohioans visited a dentist in the past year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnd in Butler County, 12 percent of children under age 18 have never visited a dentist, according to ODH.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an afterthought for a lot of people,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOral health contributes greatly to overall health and total body health.\u201d\n\nMoore said his practice, Lakota Dental Group, most commonly treats periodontal (gum) disease, which causes loss of teeth and bad breath; tooth decay in the form of cavities; and in more severe cases abscesses from untreated cavities.\n\nMoore said an abscess happens when the tooth decay gets into the nerve of the tooth and surrounding tissue. In the most serious cases, an abscess can cause death.\n\nEmergency department visits\n\nEmergency departments across Ohio treat patients daily for dental complaints, officials said. That dental care was at a cost of $188.5 million for 2010 and the first half of 2011, according to the latest figures from ODH.\n\n\u201cPain is the biggest thing that brings people into the ER,\u201d said Dr. Marcus Romanello, medical director of the emergency department at Fort Hamilton Hospital.\n\nIn 2011, over 84,000 Ohioans \u2014 those with public insurance or no insurance \u2014 visited an emergency room for a dental problem.\n\nIn Butler County, about 2,000 residents visit an emergency room for a dental problem each year, according to the nonprofit Universal Health Care Action Network Ohio.\n\nTina Gregory, director of emergency trauma services at Atrium Medical Center, said their emergency department treats people daily for dental problems, including jaw and tooth pain, broken teeth and abscesses that cause \u201cvery acute and intense\u201d pain.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason is dental care is expensive and not a lot of people have dental insurance,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cEven if you do, you can\u2019t always get in right away.\u201d\n\nHospital officials said while they can treat a patient\u2019s pain or give antibiotics for an infection, they are unable to treat the cause of the problem due to not staffing dentists.\n\nBoth the Hamilton and Middletown hospitals will refer patients, especially those low income, to an eight-bed dental clinic in Middletown, operated by Primary Health Solutions since 2011.\n\nThe clinic accepts Medicaid and is on track to hit 10,000 dental visits next year, said Ken Mitchell, director of operations at Primary Health.\n\nMitchell said the nonprofit agency last summer also introduced Mission Dental, a mobile dental clinic that travels around Butler County.\n\nThe mobile unit \u2014 complete with two treatment beds, X-ray and radiology technology, and electronic medical records \u2014 operates two days a week in Hamilton, and the remaining days are split between the Talawanda and Fairfield school districts.\n\nStarting in January, the mobile clinic will also spend one day a week traveling to Hamilton\u2019s public schools to screen and treat students in all grades Pre-K to 12, said Tracy Heinecke, head nurse for the district.\n\nThe mobile clinic \u2014 which bills all types of insurance and helps low-income families \u2014 has the capacity to see 20 students per day.\n\n\u201cFifty to sixty percent of the kids we\u2019ve seen in the schools need care,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cSome have abscesses and we\u2019ll work with the school to get care within 24 hours.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Millions more Americans are gaining dental coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but the health care law isn\u2019t doing enough to improve reimbursement rates for the care, according to the dental community.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/financial-hurdles-remain-for-dental-care/nh7Q5/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/11/14/b6/64/111414-dental-care2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Millions more Americans are gaining dental coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but the health care law isn\u2019t doing enough to improve reimbursement rates for the care, according to the dental community.", "title": "Financial hurdles remain for dental care"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalnews", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/11/14/e1/4f/111414-dental-care1.jpg", "description": "Millions more Americans are gaining dental coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but the health care law isn&rsquo;t doing enough to improve reimbursement rates for the care, according to the dental community.", "card": "summary", "title": "Financial hurdles remain for dental care"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/financial-hurdles-remain-for-dental-care/nh7Q5/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2693377/news/news/financial-hurdles-remain-for-dental-care/nh7Q5/", "keywords": "HJNhptop,HJNhomepage,Butler County", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "Butler County, HJNhptop, HJNhomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd727\"", "article_summary": "Mitchell said the nonprofit agency last summer also introduced Mission Dental, a mobile dental clinic that travels around Butler County.\n\u201cPart of the reason is dental care is expensive and not a lot of people have dental insurance,\u201d Gregory said.\nGREG LYNCH / STAFFBy Hannah PoturalskiStaff WriterMillions more Americans are gaining dental coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but the health care law isn\u2019t doing enough to improve reimbursement rates for the care, according to the dental community.\nThe health care law requires dental coverage be an essential health benefit for children;
