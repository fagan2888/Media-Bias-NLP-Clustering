As of today you\u2019re no longer working for Uncle Sam.\n\nWell, not literally, but it took the average Ohioan until April 14 to earn enough money to pay all his or her taxes for the year.\n\nEach year, the Tax Foundation calculates the Tax Freedom Day for the nation and each state.\n\nUsing information from the U.S. Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and various estimates of state and local taxes, the foundation adds up the total tax obligations of the nation and each state. Researchers then compare this against total income and come up with a percentage they apply to a calendar.\n\nLast year, Ohio\u2019s Tax Freedom Day was April 12, so you\u2019ve actually had to work two more days this year to reach this same point.\n\nBut it\u2019s still better than the nation as whole.\n\nNational Tax Freedom Day is April 21, which is three days later than in 2013. That\u2019s when Americans have earned enough to cover the $3 trillion in federal taxes and $1.5 trillion in state taxes, for a total tax bill of $4.5 trillion.\n\nIf the federal deficit were included in the calculations, Tax Freedom Day wouldn\u2019t be until May 6.\n\nConnecticut and New Jersey won\u2019t hit their Tax Freedom Day until May 9. But you\u2019d save weeks of pay by living in Louisiana, which celebrated its day on March 30, the earliest in the nation.\n\nOhio is in the middle of the pack, having the 28th earliest date. That\u2019s better than the 22nd ranking last year and neighbors Indiana on April 16, Michigan on April 17 and Pennsylvania on April 21.\n\nIf you moved just across the Ohio River in Kentucky, you would gain a week of pay; their Tax Freedom Day was April 8. West Virginia hit their day on April 10.\n\nSo congrats Ohio \u2014 from here on out, the money you earn is your own \u2014 and that\u2019s a reason to celebrate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Congratulations Ohio, it's your Tax Freedom Day - the day you've earned enough money to pay all your taxes for the year.", "title": "Congrats, Ohio - today is your Tax Freedom Day - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/Ohio-Tax-Freedom-Day-2014-Map-section.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/138559/ohio-tax-freedom-day/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Federal taxes,Ohio,state taxes,Tax Freedom Day,Taxes", "published_time": "2014-04-14T08:41:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Congratulations Ohio, it's your Tax Freedom Day - the day you've earned enough money to pay all your taxes for the year.", "title": "Congrats, Ohio - today is your Tax Freedom Day - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/Ohio-Tax-Freedom-Day-2014-Map-section.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Congratulations Ohio, it's your Tax Freedom Day - the day you've earned enough money to pay all your taxes for the year."}, "article_summary": "Each year, the Tax Foundation calculates the Tax Freedom Day for the nation and each state.\nIf the federal deficit were included in the calculations, Tax Freedom Day wouldn\u2019t be until May 6.\nNational Tax Freedom Day is April 21, which is three days later than in 2013.\nLast year, Ohio\u2019s Tax Freedom Day was April 12, so you\u2019ve actually had to work two more days this year to reach this same point.\nConnecticut and New Jersey won\u2019t hit their Tax Freedom Day until May 9."}
