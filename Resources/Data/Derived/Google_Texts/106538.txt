Three people, including a pregnant woman and a teenage girl, were badly injured after an out of control car slammed into a verandah they were standing on in north west Sydney.

A 25-year-old woman who is four months pregnant, a 14-year-old girl and a 48-year-old woman were taken to hospital after the car ploughed into the house in Windsor Downs about 3.50pm on Saturday.

Police said the car was travelling along Canoona Avenue when it lost control at a corner and crashed into the verandah where a number of people were gathered.

The pregnant woman suffered serious head and leg injuries and was airlifted to Westmead Hospital by Careflight.

Emergency services remain at the scene and police investigations are continuing.
