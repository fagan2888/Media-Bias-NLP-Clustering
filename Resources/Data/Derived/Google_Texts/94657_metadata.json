Billions and billions of dollars are being poured into the pockets of global warming alarmists, because they perform such a valuable service: they help to persuade voters that governments should be given greater control over the world\u2019s economies. What\u2019s a few billion dollars when trillions are at stake?\n\nWe have written mostly about the corruption of Greens in America, where Al Gore has become a standing joke. But the Daily Mail has performed the valuable service of exposing the corruption that is rampant among British environmentalists; specifically, global warming alarmists:\n\nThe Mail on Sunday today reveals the extraordinary web of political and financial interests creating dozens of eco-millionaires from green levies on household energy bills. A three-month investigation shows that some of the most outspoken campaigners who demand that consumers pay the colossal price of shifting to renewable energy are also getting rich from their efforts.\n\nOne is tempted to ask why anyone should be surprised by this, but of course, many people had no idea that the environmental movement is a cesspool of corruption.\n\nEnquiries by this newspaper have revealed: * Four of the nine-person Climate Change Committee, the official watchdog that dictates green energy policy, are, or were until very recently, being paid by firms that benefit from committee decisions. * A new breed of lucrative green investment funds, which were set up to expand windfarm energy, are in practice a means of taking green levies paid by hard-pressed consumers and handing them to City investors and financiers. * \u00a33.8 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money funds the new Green Investment Bank, set up by the Department of Business and Skills. One of its biggest deals involved energy giant SSE selling windfarms to one of the new green funds, Greencoat Wind. The Green Investment Bank\u2019s chairman, Lord Smith of Kelvin, is also chairman of SSE. The bank says it \u2018provided expertise\u2019 to enable BIS to take a \u00a350 million stake in Greencoat, which helped fund the SSE sale. * The same bank\u2019s chief executive, Shaun Kingsbury, is one of the UK\u2019s highest-paid public sector employees. His \u00a3325,000 salary is more than twice the Prime Minister\u2019s. * Firms lobbying for renewables can virtually guarantee access to key Government policy-makers, because they are staffed by former very senior officials \u2013 a striking example of Whitehall\u2019s \u2018revolving door\u2019. * Among the most astonishing features exposed by our investigation is the way in which vehement advocates for radical policies designed to curb global warming are making huge sums of money from their work. Here are some of the key figures among the new breed of fat-cat Ecocrats\u2026\n\nThe paper goes on to name names. It is all worth reading, but I want to highlight just one point:\n\n[Ian Marchant] left to become chairman of Infinis \u2013 now the country\u2019s third-largest renewable generator, with 7.3 per cent of the market. He received a \u201csigning-on fee\u201d of \u00a3322,000 worth of shares. Last month, Infinis shares were floated, raising \u00a3780 million. Its offer brochure claimed that it was an unusually safe investment \u2013 simply because of the levies on renewables paid by consumers and imposed by Government diktat. The brochure said that more than half of Infinis revenue is derived directly from renewable subsidies, describing the green levies added to customers\u2019 bills as \u201cstable, inflation-linked revenue streams backed by legislation incentivising renewable power\u201d.\n\nOf course cronyism is \u201cunusually safe.\u201d If you have to actually compete by producing energy at the lowest price, all kinds of things can go wrong. But if you can get in with the government, so that legislation requires everyone to pay extra for your product whether they want to or not, your investment is \u201cunusually safe.\u201d This is what cronyism\u2013a polite word for corruption\u2013is all about. It is the principal purpose of the modern environmental movement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "We have written many times about the corruption of the global warming movement.
