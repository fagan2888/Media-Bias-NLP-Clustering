Trump, Senate Republicans think ACA will drag Hillary Clinton down

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Republicans in the Senate agreed at a private meeting last week that the Affordable Care Act will be a major campaign issue for Hillary Clinton, according to The Hill.

Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told The Hill the law has devastated the Democratic Party and forecasted that next year's premium increases will be a major campaign issue.

Sen. Barrasso pointed to the 13 Senate seats, 11 governorships and 69 House seats Republicans have gained since the passage of the ACA as evidence that the law's shortcomings are helping conservatives foster support, according to the report.

Mr. Trump, who faces significant opposition from within his own party, was able to find common ground with Republicans over the ACA at last week's meeting, according to the report. At the meeting, he predicted the government may try to postpone enrollment until after the election to hide premium increases on the ACA exchanges, according to the report.

Experts told The Hill they believe Mr. Trump's predictions are unlikely since many insurers have already publicized premium hikes and postponing enrollment would require additional rule-making. Democrats defended premium increases, saying they will be offset with increased subsidies, according to the report.
