He definitely proved why he should be one of the top ones picked, going against I think the best defensive end in our league he did a great job,\u201d running back Jaylen Walton said.\n\nOle Miss rushed for 230 yards on 52 carries, and Walton finished just three yards shy of a hundred with 97 yards on 22 carries.\n\nTunsil was periodically pulled out to rest. Garrett was impressive \u2013 he had three tackles and a tipped-ball interception in the first half and once drew a holding call against Tunsil \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t blowing up Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly every play.\n\nHaving Tunsil back also allowed Fahn Cooper to move back to his natural position at right tackle.\n\nA healthier Justin Bell was able to play much of the game at center, something the Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze and his staff experimented with in camp prior to an injury to guard Rod Taylor.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the most talented we\u2019ve seen at defensive end, and Laremy gives you a much better chance to win that every snap. And Fahn\u2019s much more comfortable at right. He\u2019s different animal,\u201d Freeze said.\n\nThe Rebels rushed for 141 yards in the first half alone.\n\nThe offensive line moves Freeze talked about during the week \u2013 Bell at center and Javon Patterson at guard \u2013 didn\u2019t come about until late in the first quarter.\n\nWhen they did the Rebels seemed to get better push in the middle, and a 29-yard run by Walton was the key play on a 79-yard drive.\n\nKelly passed 7 yards to tight end Evan Engram for a 7-0 lead with 2:33 left in the first.\n\nTexas A&M began the night allowing 195.2 yards per game on the ground, 12th in the SEC and No. 97 nationally.\n\nAfter a mistake-filled finish to the first half Ole Miss negated A&M\u2019s 43-yard field goal with one of its own when Gary Wunderlich hit from 22 on the last play of the second quarter.\n\nThe Rebels led 16-3 at halftime but missed a massive play when a chop block penalty against Ben Still and Akeem Judd took a touchdown pass to Quincy Adeboyejo off the board.\n\nWunderlich had previously hit from 41 and 30 yards.\n\nWhile Walton led the way, the Rebels showed balance in the run game with 68 yards on 13 carries from Akeem Judd and 42 yards on eight carries from Jordan Wilkins.\n\n\u201cLaremy\u2019s so great in the pass game people don\u2019t realize how great he is at run-blocking,\u201d Engram said. \u201cHe\u2019s so physical, so strong and so fast. It made a huge difference.\u201d\n\nparrish.alford@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @parrishalford", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Parrish Alford Daily Journal OXFORD \u2013 Laremy Tunsil was back, and what a difference he made.
