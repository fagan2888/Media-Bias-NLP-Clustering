An 18-year-old man has been charged in a suburban Kansas City shooting that left two men dead.

The Kansas City Star reports that Marquise Stokes, of Kansas City, Kansas, was arrested Saturday. He's charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of 18-year-old Velik Henderson of Overland Park. Henderson was killed June 30 along with 19-year-old Trevon Anderson of Kansas City, Kansas.

The homicides occurred on the same Overland Park block where a woman was killed and her 11-year-old daughter was wounded six days later. The slain woman has been identified as 36-year-old Quaushey Harris.

Another man was charged earlier this month with first-degree murder in the double homicide.

He and Stokes are both jailed on $2 million bond. It's not immediately clear if Stokes has an attorney.

Police say an 18-year-old man sought in double homicide in Kansas has been located.

Overland Park police said in a news release that the man was found Saturday in the Kansas City area. The release didn't refer to the man as a suspect, and he faces no charges. Police say detectives will attempt to speak to him about the June 30 killings of 18-year-old Velik Henderson of Overland Park and 19-year-old Trevon Anderson of Kansas City, Kansas.
