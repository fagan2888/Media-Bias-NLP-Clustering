Burwell, challenging the federal government\u2019s authority to pay tax subsidies to those who purchased their healthcare through the federal healthcare.gov exchange.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe Affordable Care Act legislation only made provision for payment through exchanges established by the states, and Scalia argued that only Congress, not the executive branch, could change the law to allow money from the Treasury to be spent in a different fashion.\n\nGoing after the reasoning of the majority opinion, the justice wrote, \u201cThe Court claims that the Act must equate federal and state establishment of Exchanges when it defines a qualified individual as someone who (among other things) lives in the \u2018State that established the Exchange.\u2019 Otherwise, the Court says, there would be no qualified individuals on federal Exchanges\u2026Pure applesauce.\u201d\n\nWhy people are leaving broccoli, fortune cookies and applesauce at a Supreme Court memorial to Justice Scalia https://t.co/cyiiRytC4F Advertisement \u2013 story continues below \u2014 Independent Journal (@INJO) February 19, 2016\n\nThe broccoli reference also relates to Obamacare, but stems (no pun intended) from the original case challenging the constitutionality of the law in 2012. Scalia pressed an Obama administration attorney during oral arguments wondering if the federal government can force Americans to buy health insurance (even if they do not want it), then where would the limits of such an newly found authority end.\n\n\u201cCould you define the market \u2014 everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food, therefore, everybody is in the market; therefore, you can make people buy broccoli,\u201d the justice wondered.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFinally, Scalia likened the majority\u2019s existential reasoning in last summer\u2019s Obergefell v. Hodges , a 5-4 decision redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, similar to the intellectual rigor one might find inside a fortune cookie.\n\n\u201cIf, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \u2018The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\u2019 I would hide my head in a bag,\u201d the originalist wrote in his dissent. Scalia pointed out that if the court was going to use its own \u201creasoned judgment\u201d to create rights out of whole cloth, the justices are no longer acting as judges, but lawmakers.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\u201d\n\nh/t: Independent Journal", "article_metadata": {"description": "Their meanings can be found in renowned dissents.", "author": "Randy DeSoto", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Their meanings can be found in renowned dissents.", "title": "People Are Leaving These Strange Items At Scalia's Memorial - There's A BIG Reason For It", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scalia-broccoli.jpg", "height": 662}, "updated_time": "2016-02-20T07:45:09-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/people-are-leaving-these-strange-items-at-scalias-memorial-theres-a-big-reason-for-it/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Their meanings can be found in renowned dissents.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scalia-broccoli.jpg", "title": "People Are Leaving These Strange Items At Scalia's Memorial - There's A BIG Reason For It", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-19T16:39:51-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2016-02-19T16:39:51-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-20T07:45:09-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "scalia memorial, applesauce, broccoli, fortune cookies, antonin scalia, supreme court, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "These items are in tribute to some of the metaphors the late justice chose to make legal points in some of his most recent, renowned dissenting opinions.\nHe concluded, \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\u201dh/t: Independent Journal\nAdvertisement - story continues belowPeople may wonder why jars of applesauce, heads of broccoli, and fortune cookies have been left amidst bouquets of flowers Friday in a makeshift memorial to Justice Antonin Scalia in front of the Supreme Court.\nScalia pointed out that if the court was going to use its own \u201creasoned judgment\u201d to create rights out of whole cloth, the justices are no longer acting as judges, but lawmakers.\nThe applesauce reference came from his dissent in last year\u2019s King v.
