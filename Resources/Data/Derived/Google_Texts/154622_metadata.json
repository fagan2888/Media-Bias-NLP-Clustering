According to a new study, the way you lie makes all the difference in how well you remember it.\n\nResearchers at Louisiana State University examined the ways in which the brain worked to fabricate and recall two different kinds of lies: false descriptions and false denials. While false denials require little cognitive power to deny an actual even from happening, false descriptions involve much more, including intricate details, how confident they appear to the listener, and how plausible their lie seems.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to lie to you about something that didn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m going to have to keep a lot of different constraints in mind,\u201d Sean Lane, associate professor at the university and author of the study, said in a statement. \u201cAs the constructive process lays down records of our details and descriptions, it also lays down information about the process of construction.\u201d\n\nThe effort it takes to construct a lie uses up more brainpower than when someone wants to deny something. Lane discovered this after asking participants to look at pictures and objects, and to either lie or tell the truth about them by describing them or by denying they had seen them. Forty-eight hours later, participants were tested on their memory of the lies. Those who had told lies about seeing them were more likely to remember the lies than those who denied ever seeing the object.\n\nThe researchers believe these results can help with forensic interrogation techniques, which use rapid-fire questions to spot contradictions, most often a result of false denials. Still, the researchers also found a possible problem that innocent suspects might come across. Those who are telling the truth in their denials may end up believing that they actually saw what they\u2019re denying. Called the \u201cillusory truth effect,\u201d people who constantly deny something they truthfully didn\u2019t see may end up believing they did because of how familiar it becomes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re telling the truth, they\u2019re denying, but later this thing seems familiar,\u201d Lane said. \u201cThey\u2019re confusing the familiarity of the repetition [with the truth], not realizing that those repeated denials are what makes it seem familiar 48 hours later.\u201d\n\nSource: Vieira K, Lane S.
