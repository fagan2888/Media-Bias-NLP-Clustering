To demonstrate her support for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature piece of healthcare legislation, \u201cVampire Diaries\u201d actress Nina Dobrev got topless, posting a photo to Instagram of herself with a sign that says \u201c#getcovered,\u201d a reference to the newly opened Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nDobrev tweeted: \u201cIm Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered ,Because w/o it, youre naked.\u201d\n\nAlthough Dobrev was the only celebrity to go topless, she was joined by several other actors/actresses who fully support the president\u2019s healthcare law, including Rosario Dawson, Connie Britton, Kerry Washington and Kate Bosworth. They all made homemade #getcovered signs to demonstrate their support for Obamacare. Us Weekly reports that Dobrev\u2019s topless picture garnered 94,000 likes for the grassroots campaign.\n\nDobrev\u2019s campaign may have worked too well. When the Health Insurance Marketplace launched online, traffic surges and glitches plagued the site, making it difficult for people to sign up and search for quality healthcare plans.\n\nFor other weird celebrity endorsements, check out actor Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s \u201cWake the F**K Up\u201d campaign video.\n\nDid Dobrev get her message across? Do you support Obamacare? Have you used the Health Insurance Marketplace online?
