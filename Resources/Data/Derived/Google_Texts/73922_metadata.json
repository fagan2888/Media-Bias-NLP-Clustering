However, according to data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, former soldiers with mental illnesses continue to wait too long for mental health evaluations and counseling.\n\nIn 2013, the V.A. did not reach its goal of providing mental health appointments to patients within 14 days. According to V.A. data, an estimated one-third of new mental health patients had to wait longer than 14 days, for treatment in categories like psychiatry, psychology, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse. Wait times varied depending on location; veterans in Houston, Texas, for example, had to wait an average of 28 days to receive mental health services. An inspector general report released this year concluded that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) also \"needs to improve efforts to reach out to patients who do not report to scheduled [mental health] appointments, document contact attempts, and consider expanding the use of telemental health services for post-discharge evaluations.\"\n\nLast year, the Department of Veterans Affairs released a report that confirmed a similar situation. In 2012, it still took longer than 14 days for veterans to get mental health evaluations. The V.A. had claimed that it was meeting its 14-day requirement 95 percent of the time, but an inspector general review found that the system did not actually measure how long the patient waited to receive a mental health evaluation. Rather, it measured how long it took for the V.A. to conduct the evaluation. About 49 percent, or 370,000 patients evaluated in 2011 received their full evaluation within 14 days. The remaining half of patients had to wait an average of 50 days to receive their evaluation.\n\n\u201cGetting our veterans timely mental health care can quite frankly often be the difference between life and death,\u201d Senator Patty Murray told the New York Times in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s the critical period, not unlike the \u2018golden hour\u2019 immediately after a traumatic physical injury. Yet this [2012] report clearly shows that the V.A. is failing to meet their own mandates for timeliness. Clearly, the V.A. scheduling system needs a major overhaul.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the V.A. department claimed that one of the reasons for the long waits was the lack of mental health clinicians. Veteran demand for mental health treatment has grown in recent years, as the number of veterans with mental illnesses has risen from 900,000 in 2006 to 1.2 million in 2010, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Though the V.A. department expanded the number of psychiatrists, psychologists, and nurses on staff by some 50 percent from 2005 to 2010, it still cannot keep up with mental health demand.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that even after the hiring of 1,600 new mental health staff, certain V.A. facilities remain unable to \u2026 treat veterans in a timely manner,\u201d Sen. Bernard Sanders (Dem., Vermont) told USA Today. \u201cConsequences of leaving mental health conditions untreated can be dire. Such failures cannot continues.\u201d\n\nAlthough the V.A. has trouble meeting its 14-day goal, it does say that it has a 96 percent success rate of seeing patients in a timely manner. Veterans who need immediate mental health attention, especially those who are suicidal, can call a crisis hotline or go to a V.A. emergency room.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "veterans mental health, department of veterans affairs, mental illness, ptsd", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Veterans with mental health issues continue to face long wait times to get proper evaluations and counseling.", "title": "Veterans With Mental Illnesses Wait Longer Than Expected For Mental Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/veterans-mental-illnesses-wait-longer-expected-mental-health-care-262048", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/05/veterans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Veterans with mental health issues continue to face long wait times to get proper evaluations and counseling.", "title": "Veterans With Mental Illnesses Wait Longer Than Expected For Mental Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/veterans-mental-illnesses-wait-longer-expected-mental-health-care-262048", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/05/veterans.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/05/veterans.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-05T17:46:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-05T17:46:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Veterans with mental health issues continue to face long wait times to get proper evaluations and counseling."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddfc\"", "article_summary": "However, according to data from the Department of Veterans Affairs, former soldiers with mental illnesses continue to wait too long for mental health evaluations and counseling.\nU.S. veterans are in dire need of mental health treatment, especially in light of the reported 22 veteran suicides per day.\nIn 2012, it still took longer than 14 days for veterans to get mental health evaluations.\nWait times varied depending on location; veterans in Houston, Texas, for example, had to wait an average of 28 days to receive mental health services.\nVeterans who need immediate mental health attention, especially those who are suicidal, can call a crisis hotline or go to a V.A."}
