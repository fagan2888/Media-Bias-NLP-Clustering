Along with the support of 270 guests, sponsors and volunteers, ACS exceeded its goals and raised over $213,000 for the fight against cancer, and the funding of groundbreaking cancer research.\n\n\u201cThe Champions of Hope Gala is the premier annual event for the American Cancer Society\u2019s Colorado Chapter, helping raise money for cancer research with a significant portion funding local research projects,\u201d said LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty broker Andrew Wasson. \u201cI am proud to be a part of LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and truly appreciate that the brokerage takes such an active role in local charities that have such a positive impact in our community.\u201d\n\nSince 1946, the American Cancer Society has invested $4.3 billion in cancer research, funding more than 47 Nobel Prize winning researchers and performing a key role in confirming that cigarette smoke is linked to lung cancer. In addition to these findings, the American Cancer Society has had a hand in almost all major cancer advancements to date.\n\nToday, U.S. cancer death rates are down 22 percent (more than 1.5 million lives saved), 49 percent of the nation is covered by a comprehensive smoke-free law, and 4.6 million women in need have been helped since 1991 through national early detection programs supported by the American Cancer Society.\n\n\u201cWe celebrated life on October 24th, 2015, while helping cancer patients thrive in their fight,\u201d said Cile Fisher, development manager of the American Cancer Society. \u201cLIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s continued support of the American Cancer Society and its lifesaving mission makes a difference every day.\u201d\n\nFor information, contact LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty broker, Andrew Wasson, at 303-957-7689.
