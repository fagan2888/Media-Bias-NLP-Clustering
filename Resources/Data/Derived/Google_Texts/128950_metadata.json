Bush, and his 90-year-old mother to try to jumpstart his campaign.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Compliment Trump Gave the Pope After Being Slammed on Immigration\n\nDespite some occasional bravado, Bush often reveals his insecurity about the course of the campaign. \u201cI hope that you believe that it\u2019s possible for us to do this,\u201d Bush told voters in Rock Hill, S.C., this week as he wrapped up another town hall meeting, according to The New York Times. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think the end is near.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Bush, the end of his once promising bid for the GOP presidential nomination is near. Although his joint appearance with his brother early this week gave Bush\u2019s campaign a much-needed jolt \u2013 the Bush family is still revered by many in the state -- he reportedly was sorely disappointed that Republican Gov. Nikki Haley endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over him in the South Carolina primary.\n\nWhile Haley and many other South Carolina Republicans were offended by Trump\u2019s relentless harangues against George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, Trump\u2019s strategy once again put Jeb Bush on the defensive in trying to reconcile his foreign policy views with those of his brother and father.\n\nThe final days of the South Carolina GOP primary have devolved into an ugly catfight, with Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas exchanging barbs arguing who is the bigger liar, while Cruz and Rubio scrap over which candidate is tougher on immigration reform and national security. Unless Bush can find a way to navigate this political demolition derby and finish third or a very strong fourth, his remaining days in the campaign will be numbered.\n\nRelated: Trump and Cruz Strike a New Low In Presidential Politics\n\nA new Clemson University Palmetto Poll released on Friday shows Trump continuing to lead the GOP field with 28 percent, followed by Cruz at 19 percent and Rubio at 15 percent. Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are lumped together in the second tier: Bush had 10 percent and Kasich 9 percent.\n\nDavid Woodard, the Clemson political scientist who supervised the poll, said in an interview that the race is very fluid, and that Rubio is surging and could well elbow Cruz aside for second place. Clearly, the Florida senator is being helped by the backing of Haley and Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Beyond that, Kasich \u2013 who finished second to Trump in New Hampshire \u2013 is showing surprising strength in South Carolina, where he was not expected to perform well because of his more moderate views.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Bush finished fifth, behind Kasich, which means that\u2019s curtains for him,\u201d Woodard said.\n\n\u201cI think if somebody surges \u2013 let\u2019s just say Rubio surges up and gets second \u2013 then I think that\u2019s the news story that comes out of South Carolina,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think if Kasich \u2013 who is doing much better than I thought in this state \u2013 if he beats Bush, I think that\u2019s really significant. I mean, Jeb Bush brought his brother over here, and it just didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Could Trump\u2019s Attacks on George W. Bush Backfire in South Carolina?\n\nDuring a Republican town hall in South Carolina broadcast Thursday evening by CNN, host Anderson Cooper asked Bush how he can convince voters in the state that he still has momentum and a path forward. \u201cWell, I do have momentum if you look at the polls and you look at the crowd sizes of our town hall meetings,\u201d Bush responded. \u201cAnd the enthusiasm that exists.\u201d\n\nCooper persisted in asking Bush what it was like to campaign against Trump and other aggressive candidates when he is renowned for his more laid back, introverted personality. Bush insisted that it is a \u201cpretty good thing to be\u201d an introvert when running for president \u201cwhen you\u2019ve been written off over and over and over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, that just makes me more motivated, more energized,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve overcome my introversion which makes me I think better \u2013 better than an extrovert.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump enjoys telling audiences, former F", "title": "South Carolina May be Do-or-Die for Jeb Bush\u2019s Presidential Aspirations", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/19/South-Carolina-May-be-Do-or-Die-Jeb-Bush-s-Presidential-Aspirations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02192016_Jeb_Bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/19/South-Carolina-May-be-Do-or-Die-Jeb-Bush-s-Presidential-Aspirations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02192016_Jeb_Bush.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump enjoys telling audiences, former F", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Clearly, the Florida senator is being helped by the backing of Haley and Republican South Carolina Sen.
