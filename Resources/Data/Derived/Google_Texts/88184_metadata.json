First thoughts to play the lead: Richard Dreyfuss, Paul Giamatti, Jonah Hill, or even Fred Armisen, who emphasized the bluster in his Frank impersonation on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The actor\u2019s range would need to include the impatience of a brainy and pragmatic politician as well as the pathos of a socially awkward and lonely man.\n\nOne reason \u201cCompared to What: The Improbable Journey of Barney Frank\u201d invites thoughts of a scripted treatment is that, however you feel about Frank\u2019s many political passions, which have included financial reform and gay rights, he is a character. He\u2019s the kind of dogged, oddball, gruff, and ultimately lovable achiever around whom TV series (\u201cHouse\u201d) and movies (\u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d) are built. We see Frank at different ages in the film, which premieres at 9 p.m., plowing through marbled hallways in iterations of his black-rimmed glasses, both determined and endearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clinchers: Early in his career, Frank used a campaign poster that read, \u201cNeatness Isn\u2019t Everything,\u201d and he once lived in a basement apartment with plastic trash bags on the windows. Take that, \u201cColumbo.\u201d\n\nAnother reason the documentary suggests scripted treatment: The story has a neat heroic arc, as Frank, after decades of feeling lonely and fighting tirelessly for the public good, finally finds a happy private life. Some of the best material in \u201cCompared to What,\u201d which is directed by Sheila Canavan and Michael Chandler, looks at Frank in his latter days in the House and after his retirement. We see him in a comfortable, low-key relationship with Jim Ready, and we see footage from their 2012 wedding, the first gay nuptials by a sitting member of Congress. The service, which appears to have been as lacking in fussiness as the couple, was officiated by then-Governor Deval Patrick, who had Frank and Ready pledge to love each other \u201con MSNBC or on Fox\u201d and \u201cin Congress or in retirement.\u201d It\u2019s a sweet denouement.\n\nNaturally, the movie has hagiographic leanings. This is a portrait of an accomplished man at the end of his career, and it looks back with admiration. I\u2019m not sure there is any other reason for Canavan and Chandler to have made \u201cCompared to What,\u201d and I\u2019m not sure viewers are expecting anything other than a survey of Frank\u2019s efforts and achievements, told with intelligence and an affectionate nod to Frank\u2019s entertainment value. We see clips of a feisty Frank going up against special prosecutor Kenneth Starr as he fought against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and of course we see one of Frank\u2019s most memorable moments, at a town hall meeting in Dartmouth, when a woman called Obamacare \u201ca Nazi policy.\u201d Frank\u2019s response, which went viral: \u201cMa\u2019am, trying to have a conversation with you would be like arguing with a dining room table.\u201d\n\nMany of the stories will be familiar to longtime followers of Frank and Massachusetts politics. One of the best has Frank telling then-Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill, in 1986, that a forthcoming book by conservative former US representative Robert Bauman was going to identify Frank as a gay man. He was going to come out, Frank told O\u2019Neill, which would make him the second openly gay member \u2014 but not necessarily the second gay member \u2014 after Gerry Studds, also of Massachusetts. An amusing interaction ensued, with O\u2019Neill finally making reference to the fact that Frank had decided to \u201ccome out of the room.\u201d (In some urban areas, it must be said, rooms are indeed the size of closets.) Among all of the film\u2019s archival footage, there is a clip of O\u2019Neill calling Frank \u201ca man of thought, concern, and care.\u201d\n\nThe film touches on the Stephen Gobie scandal, as it ought to. Two years after Frank had come out, Gobie alleged that Frank had knowingly allowed him to run a prostitution ring out of his home. A charge against Frank began, led by Republican Representative Larry Craig (whose own career fell apart in 2007 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in an airport men\u2019s room). But after a report from the House Ethics Committee, the House voted 408-18 to reprimand but not expel or censure Frank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe filmmakers emphasize Frank\u2019s adult life, but there are a few notes about his childhood in New Jersey and the way the murder of Emmett Till in 1955 Mississippi mobilized him politically. There are also a few illuminating interviews with Frank\u2019s roommates from his Harvard years, with one admitting he had a crush on Frank. Those interviews attest to the consistency of Frank\u2019s irascible, practical, suffer-no-fools personality.\n\nIt is Frank, though, who summarizes himself best of all in the film: \u201cPatience, in my judgment, is not a virtue.\u201d\n\nTELEVISION REVIEW\n\nCOMPARED TO WHAT: The Improbable Journey of Barney Frank\n\nOn Showtime, Friday, 9-10:30 p.m.\n\nWatch the trailer for \u201cCompared to What\u201d:", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.849612406", "eomportal-id": 69440, "description": "A Showtime documentary is a survey of Frank\u2019s efforts and achievements, told with intelligence and an affectionate nod to Frank\u2019s entertainment value", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "A Showtime documentary is a survey of Frank\u2019s efforts and achievements, told with intelligence and an affectionate nod to Frank\u2019s entertainment value", "title": "Documentary shows Barney Frank, in all his rumpled glory - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2015/10/22/documentary-celebrates-career-barney-frank/lp6z4mq6JHYLqkB2uSi06H/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/20/BostonGlobe.com/Arts/Images/Copy%20of%20BarneyFrank_UN_11.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "COMPARED TO WHAT: THE IMPROBABLE JOURNEY OF BARNEY FRANK,showtime,barney frank,jim ready,tip o'neill,television review,latest lifestyle, Barney Frank, Richard  Dreyfuss, Paul  Giamatti", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 03:42:16 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "COMPARED TO WHAT: THE IMPROBABLE JOURNEY OF BARNEY FRANK,showtime,barney frank,jim ready,tip o'neill,television review,latest lifestyle, Barney Frank, Richard  Dreyfuss, Paul  Giamatti, Jonah  Hill, Fred  Armisen, Michael  Chandler, Deval L  Patrick, Kenneth W  Starr, Bill  Clinton, Gerry  Studds, Larry E  Craig, Emmett  Till,Showtime, Senate,House of Representatives, MSNBC, House Committee on Ethics, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "3a519382-78b8-11e5-8e2c-69c6a04b840d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05e4\"", "article_summary": "Watching Friday night\u2019s Showtime documentary about Barney Frank, the rumpled, blustery, and witty former congressman from Massachusetts, it\u2019s extremely tempting to cast a scripted version of his life story.\nHe was going to come out, Frank told O\u2019Neill, which would make him the second openly gay member \u2014 but not necessarily the second gay member \u2014 after Gerry Studds, also of Massachusetts.\nTwo years after Frank had come out, Gobie alleged that Frank had knowingly allowed him to run a prostitution ring out of his home.\nBut after a report from the House Ethics Committee, the House voted 408-18 to reprimand but not expel or censure Frank.\nThere are also a few illuminating interviews with Frank\u2019s roommates from his Harvard years, with one admitting he had a crush on Frank."}
