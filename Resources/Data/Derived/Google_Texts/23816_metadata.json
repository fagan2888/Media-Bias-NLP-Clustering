This year\u2019s farm bill cuts nearly $9 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u2014hitting 850,000 households with reduced benefits\u2014while providing tens of billions in subsidies to a small group of wealthy farmers and agricultural conglomerates.\n\nIf this is wasteful in normal economic times, then it\u2019s indefensible in the present moment, given the hundreds of thousands of families who rely on food stamps to feed their families and make ends meet.\n\nYes, the average benefit cut amounts to \u201cjust\u201d $90, but for a low-income family of four, that\u2019s a huge reduction in spending power. And when you combine that with the failure to extend emergency unemployment benefits, which affects many of the same households, what you have is a group of people who\u2014for no reason at all\u2014have been pushed from desperation into destitution.\n\nBut these awful, counterproductive measures are almost par for the course when it comes to bipartisan policymaking. The last three years of deficit reduction, for instance, were achieved with bipartisan policies (like sequestration) that reduced the deficit at the cost of a slower economy and higher unemployment.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s noteworthy that calls for bipartisanship are often connected to calls for debt reduction or \u201cgrand bargains.\u201d These \u201cdifficult choices\u201d wouldn\u2019t be possible without bipartisan cooperation, which provides cover to politicians who want to cut retirement benefits and reduce spending on social services. It\u2019s a way for parties to muddy the water for voters, who have a harder time holding the right lawmakers responsible\u2014if everyone is responsible for a bad idea, then in effect, no one is.\n\nSay what you will about the Affordable Care Act, but its method of passage\u2014a party line vote by Democrats\u2014was helpful to voters. If you didn\u2019t like Obamacare, then you knew who to vote against, and if you liked it, you knew who to support. By contrast, if you want to register your opposition to the farm bill, who do you vote against? The Republicans who pushed the cuts to food stamps, or the Democrats who agreed to them?\n\nMore broadly, it\u2019s more than clear that\u2014at this juncture in American politics\u2014the only way to accomplish anything productive is through partisan action. If you want to see policy movement in 2016 or beyond, you should for one party or the other to win full control of government. No, it won\u2019t be \u201cbipartisan,\u201d but what Congress does is more important than how it does it.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402051630, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "The farm bill is just the latest piece of bipartisan legislation that hurts far more than it helps.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Bipartisanship is Ruining America", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bipartisanship is Ruining America\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/05/bipartisanship-is-ruining-america.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/bipartisanship-is-ruining-america/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46387262.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/bipartisanship-is-ruining-america\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-05T16:30:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-05T16:30:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/bipartisanship-is-ruining-america", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The farm bill is just the latest piece of bipartisan legislation that hurts far more than it helps.", "title": "Bipartisanship is Ruining America", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/05/bipartisanship-is-ruining-america.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/bipartisanship-is-ruining-america/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1391617881076.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97b4\"", "article_summary": "Whatever else its virtues\u2014and there are few\u2014the farm bill, passed yesterday by the Senate after a drawn out fight in the House, is a good illustration of what\u2019s wrong with our national fetish for bipartisanship.\nThe farm bill is just the latest piece of bipartisan legislation that hurts far more than it helps.\nBy contrast, if you want to register your opposition to the farm bill, who do you vote against?\nThis year\u2019s farm bill cuts nearly $9 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u2014hitting 850,000 households with reduced benefits\u2014while providing tens of billions in subsidies to a small group of wealthy farmers and agricultural conglomerates.\nYes, the average benefit cut amounts to \u201cjust\u201d $90, but for a low-income family of four, that\u2019s a huge reduction in spending power."}
