People laugh when they hear the comedian is raising eight kids, five of which foster children. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I was a foster parent,\u201d he says. \u201cI just thought I was babysitting for a long time.\u201d For the most part, Roberts is playing nanny. He and his wife Jessica have seen 24 children come through their home on a temporary basis in 22 years. \u201cThat\u2019s where I get most of my material: Really living everyday life in a chaotic household. It keeps me busy; keeps me sharp.\u201d\n\nKnown as Jonny R., or the Ojibwe Outlaw, the 39-year-old is entering his seventh year in comedy. Roberts travels more than 200 miles from the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota to perform at open mics in Sioux Falls and Minneapolis. He once flew to California to compete in a Native comedy competition at The Laugh Factory and do an open mic at the famed Comedy Store. He also has a dedicated YouTube show in his name, and many well-known Native entertainers have been guests.\n\nWith five performances booked in 2016, he\u2019s an established up-and-comer. But as Roberts has found, doing comedy doesn\u2019t pay the bills \u2014 yet. Jonny R. would love to get into a wellness or conference comedy circuit. \u201cThat\u2019s the next stage: To inspire youth on the other [reservations] to show them there\u2019s more to life than your surroundings.\u201d\n\nVideo of The Ojibwe Outlaw - Live at the Sanford Center\n\nBut what exactly would be appealing about having a comedian dubbed an \u2018outlaw\u2019 on a trip to help teach children about wellness? \u201cI struggled with alcohol growing up,\u201d Jonny R. says. He earned his nickname after being kicked out of The Red Lake Ojibwe\u2019s Seven Clans Casino following his first-ever comedy show, where he opened for Tatanka Means and Vaughn Eagle Bear. He brought a bottle of hard liquor onto the dry reservation and \u201chad a little too much fun,\u201d he says. He was banned from the casino for six months, but they enjoyed his work so much they invited him to perform again just three days after the ban was lifted. \u201cI\u2019m addicted to comedy now [instead],\u201d he says.\n\nHe also began recording his comedy show, titled, \u201cThe Jonny R. Show,\u201d broadcast on YouTube. He gained experience in video and audio by following the Battle River drum group one powwow season. A few years later, he gathered the courage to take on his first open mic session. \u201cI was terrible,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I got that rush.\u201d\n\nVideo of Ojibwemowin Lesson\n\nPerforming on stage was a feeling Roberts dreamed about since hiding in his home, sneaking a peek at his stepdad\u2019s VHS comedy tapes. Eddie Murphy\u2019s \u201cDelirious,\u201d was a favorite. Roberts also recalls being influenced by a Native comedian who used a puppet at a show in Red Lake.\n\nHe took a plunge in attending the Red Nation Film Festival, where he made a comedy competition\u2019s final cut while performing at The Laugh Factory. In the 12 days he spent in California, he and other comedians were chauffeured around town by well-known Native comic J.R. Redwater, and he got onstage at The Comedy Store. Unprepared but tapping into content from his family life, Jonny R. had one of his best shows, he says.\n\nWith nearly seven years of entertaining audiences on stage, Johnny R. says Native casinos are giving him and many other comedians the opportunity to show they can be as funny as the better-known comics on the circuit. \u201cThey\u2019re making it all possible,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need more exposure. There are a lot of talented people out there.\u201d\n\nCheck out Jonny R's website here: https://thejonnyr.wordpress.com Follow him on Twitter - @TheJonnyR\n\nFollow Cary Rosenbaum on Twitter - @CaryRosenbaum", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nine Kids?
