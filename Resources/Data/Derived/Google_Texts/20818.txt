What Anthem's 4Q15 Results Suggest about the Future of Healthcare PART 2 OF 7

Anthem’s Commercial and Specialty Enrollments Rose by 0.31 Million in 2015

Anthem’s Commercial and Specialty division in 4Q15

Anthem’s (ANTM) Commercial and Specialty business earned revenues worth $37.6 billion in 2015, which represents a YoY (year-over-year) decline of 4.2%. The division’s revenues came in at $9.4 billion in 4Q15, which represents a YoY drop of about 3.3%.

Notably, the company added approximately 0.31 million new commercial enrollments in 2015. (Anthem’s commercial and specialty business is further differentiated into national, local group, specialty, and individual businesses. To know more about Anthem’s commercial business, please refer to Market Realist’s “Anthem Enjoys Steady Commercial Business.”)

The above graph shows that Anthem’s commercial enrollments rose by about 1.1 %, from 29.4 million in 4Q14 to 29.7 million in 4Q15. This growth is attributed to increases in enrollments in the national and local group markets by 328,000 and 104,000, respectively.

Anthem’s commercial membership growth, however, was negatively affected by a decrease of 118,000 members from the company’s individual business segment. Peers including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET), and Cigna Corporation (CI) are also witnessing declines in their ACA (Affordable Care Act) compliant individual and small-group exchange business.

Anthem’s national membership in 4Q15 and fiscal 2015

In 2015, Anthem’s total national membership accounted for 43% of the company’s total commercial enrollments and 33.1% of Anthem’s total membership. The company’s total national membership increased by 2.6%, from 12.4 million in 4Q14 to 12.7 million in 4Q15. National membership is further categorized into national accounts and BlueCard members.

Anthem’s commercial enrollments

Anthem’s national account membership rose by 2.8% YoY, from approximately 7.1 million in 4Q14 to about 7.4 million in 4Q15, mainly due to several large contracts such as that with Bank of America Corporation, which included contracts won by the company in 2015. Anthem’s local group business also witnessed a rise in total enrollments of about 0.7%, from 15.1 million in 4Q14 to 15.2 million in 4Q15.

Individual business enrollments declined by 6.6%, from 1.8 million in 4Q14 to 1.7 million in 4Q15. In 2015, Anthem added about 84,000 members through its public exchange offerings and concluded the year with approximately 791,000 individual exchange enrollments. The company’s small group business, however, suffered a loss of about 100,000 enrollments in 4Q15.

Why are Anthem’s revenues down?

Despite the rise in total commercial enrollments, Anthem’s revenues have suffered. This is on account of the increasing number of employer-sponsored members who continue to shift from fully insured to administrative services only or self-insured plans. Additionally, the company also failed to meet revenue targets in its public and private exchange businesses in 4Q15. (To learn more about fully insured and self-insured enrollments, please refer Market Realist’s “Shift to Self-Insurance Plans Affects Health Insurance Stocks.”)

Investors can invest in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) and thereby reduce the excessive company-specific risks of investing directly in Anthem. Anthem accounts for about 1.4% of XLV’s total holdings.
