Catching a game at San Francisco\u2019s Levi\u2019s Stadium costs fans more than at any other stadium in the country, according to the Fan Cost Index compiled by Team Marketing Report.\n\nThe index includes the cost of four average-price tickets, two cheapest draft beers, four cheapest soft drinks, four cheapest hot dogs, parking for one car, two programs and two least expensive adult caps. In San Francisco, that amounts to $640.\n\nThe $1.2 billion Levi\u2019s Stadium opened last fall and seats 68,500 fans. The stadium will host the Super Bowl this February.\n\nSlideshow: The NFL's 10 Most Expensive Stadiums for Fans\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys\u2019 home field, AT&T Stadium, ranks as the second-most expensive place to catch a game. The rest of the top five most expensive teams to see at home are the New York Giants ($629.62), the New England Patriots ($624.70) and the Chicago Bears ($601.20).\n\nThe average cost for a family of four to see a game at any NFL stadium is $480.89, including food, drink, parking, programs and caps. That represents a 0.5 percent increase over last year.\n\nPart of the reason NFL teams can charge so much is that there are so few games. Professional football teams play just once a week and have a relatively short season compared to basketball or baseball.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the cheapest teams to see play at home are the Jacksonville Jaguars ($347.60), the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ($373.76) and the Buffalo Bills ($391.04).\n\nClick Here to See the Most Expensive NFL Stadiums for Fans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "They may have a losing season so far, but the San Francisco 49ers are winning in anoth", "title": "Where It Costs the Most to Watch an NFL Football Game", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/01/Where-It-Costs-Most-Watch-NFL-Football-Game", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/nfl_stadiums_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/01/Where-It-Costs-Most-Watch-NFL-Football-Game", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/nfl_stadiums_3.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "They may have a losing season so far, but the San Francisco 49ers are winning in anoth", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Part of the reason NFL teams can charge so much is that there are so few games.\nClick Here to See the Most Expensive NFL Stadiums for Fans.\nThe average cost for a family of four to see a game at any NFL stadium is $480.89, including food, drink, parking, programs and caps.\nCatching a game at San Francisco\u2019s Levi\u2019s Stadium costs fans more than at any other stadium in the country, according to the Fan Cost Index compiled by Team Marketing Report.\nSlideshow: The NFL's 10 Most Expensive Stadiums for FansThe Dallas Cowboys\u2019 home field, AT&T Stadium, ranks as the second-most expensive place to catch a game."}
