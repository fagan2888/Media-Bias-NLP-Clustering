Burwell. The case is a challenge by faith-based nonprofits, including a group of Catholic nuns, to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut among the hundreds demonstrating outside the court were activists from Compassion & Choices. The right-to-die advocacy group made headlines in 2015 with its support for Brittany Maynard, who chose physician-assisted dying at age 29 rather than let a brain tumor slowly kill her. The organization led efforts for the passage of the End of Life Option Act that takes effect in California this summer.\n\nRELATED STORY: 2 young women, 2 polar views on contraception case\n\nAttorneys for Compassion & Choices, which submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the contraception case, said Wednesday that if the religious groups win on blocking contraception coverage, the ruling could easily apply to decisions about care at the end of life.\n\nThe contraception mandate case is argued by plaintiffs as a substantial burden on their religious freedom. Houses of worship are already exempt from the mandate, which requires employers to have insurance plans for employees that offer birth control free of co-payments. But faith-based institutions such as hospitals, schools, charities and nursing homes are not exempt.\n\nThe Obama administration created a workaround for groups with religious objections to contraception. They could \u201copt out\u201d of directly providing insurance that covers contraception merely by signing a letter stating their objections. The government would then orchestrate the coverage with the insurers.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, who operate homes for the elderly, and six other plaintiffs objected. They argued that to sign such a letter \u2014 or face severe fines for noncompliance \u2014 would be to \u201copt in\u201d to facilitating sin. On Wednesday, more than one justice described this as a government \u201chijack\u201d of insurance plans.\n\nRELATED STORY: Supreme Court deeply divided over religious freedom, reproductive rights\n\nFaith-based health care providers may say they are free to apply the same argument to patients at the end of life, said Kevin Diaz, Compassion & Choices national director of legal advocacy, and Jon Eisenberg, who co-authored the brief. The providers would be empowered to tear up a patient\u2019s end-of-life care directives if those clash with the religious doctrine of the provider. They would also be able to refuse to transfer the patient to a hospital that will comply with his or her wishes.\n\nCurrently, 47 states require providers to cooperate with a transfer request. But Eisenberg said Wednesday afternoon, after observing the arguments at the high court, that signing a transfer could be seen as equivalent to signing the \u201copt-out\u201d letter for contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cIt is an alarmingly short step,\u201d attorneys for Compassion & Choices wrote, for faith-based providers to sidestep federal regulations requiring that a patient\u2019s wishes are honored, leaving them helpless.\n\nRELATED STORY: California governor signs right-to-die bill sought by Brittany Maynard\n\nThe likelihood of this is not inconsiderable. The Catholic Health Association includes more than 600 hospitals and 1,400 long-term care and other health facilities in all 50 states, making it the \u201clargest group of nonprofit health care providers in the nation.\u201d\n\nThey follow ethical directives written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. These not only forbid contraceptive care and abortion. They also view artificial food and hydration not as an option for the patient or family to decide, but as religiously obligated care, including for patients in \u201cin chronic and presumably irreversible conditions.\u201d\n\nBased on the Zubik v. Burwell arguments Wednesday, Eisenberg and Diaz predicted the four conservatives remaining since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the four liberals would deadlock.\n\nThis might leave in place lower court decisions \u2014 chiefly favorable to the government position. Or the court may set the case aside for rehearing when Scalia\u2019s vacancy has been filled.\n\n(Cathy Lynn Grossman is a senior national reporter for RNS)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, News, Brittany Maynard, Catholic, Catholic Health Association, Compassion & Choices, end of life, Little Sisters of the Poor, Supreme Court", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(RNS) If the religious groups win on blocking contraception coverage, some attorneys argue the ruling could easily apply to decisions about care at the end of life.", "title": "Contraception case could limit decisions about dying", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/24/181461-contraception-dying-zubik-burwell-supreme-court/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/thumbRNS-CONTRACEPTION-DYING032416.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CLGrossman"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/24/181461-contraception-dying-zubik-burwell-supreme-court/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/24/181461-contraception-dying-zubik-burwell-supreme-court/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(RNS) If the religious groups win on blocking contraception coverage, some attorneys argue the ruling could easily apply to decisions about care at the end of life."}, "article_summary": "The case is a challenge by faith-based nonprofits, including a group of Catholic nuns, to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\nThe contraception mandate case is argued by plaintiffs as a substantial burden on their religious freedom.\nBut among the hundreds demonstrating outside the court were activists from Compassion & Choices.\nRELATED STORY: 2 young women, 2 polar views on contraception caseAttorneys for Compassion & Choices, which submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the contraception case, said Wednesday that if the religious groups win on blocking contraception coverage, the ruling could easily apply to decisions about care at the end of life.\nThey could \u201copt out\u201d of directly providing insurance that covers contraception merely by signing a letter stating their objections."}
