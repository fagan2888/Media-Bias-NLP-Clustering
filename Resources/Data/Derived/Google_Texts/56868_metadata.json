He was released from a San Francisco jail in April under a city law barring the jail\u2019s deputies from informing U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement of his release, despite the agency\u2019s previous notification request.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., slammed the so-called \u201csanctuary city\u201d for stunting communication among local, state and federal law enforcement.\n\n\u201cA simple notification to ICE could have prevented Kate Steinle\u2019s death,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced legislation in his opening remarks that would pull federal funding from sanctuary cities and counties that refuse to work with federal immigration officials.\n\n\u201cEnforcing the immigration laws of the United States is not a voluntary or trivial matter,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cReal lives are at stake. Things cannot continue this way.\u201d\n\nThe bill would also impose a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence along with a fine for immigrants who attempt to return to the U.S. after a previous deportation. The provision was named \u201cKate\u2019s Law\u201d in Steinle\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cWe feel that if Kate\u2019s Law saves one daughter, one son, a mother or a father, Kate\u2019s death won\u2019t be in vain,\u201d Steinle said.\n\nLaura Wilkerson, another witness, whose 18-year-old son Josh was beaten, strangled and burned to death by one of his classmates who was in the U.S. illegally, provided scathing testimony in a moving plea for reform.\n\nShe read pieces of her son\u2019s autopsy, describing the braided rope tied around his neck, the multiple fractures in his face and nasal cavity, his crushed throat and voice box, among other horrific injuries the medical examiner deemed the result of \u201ctorture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was our family\u2019s 9/11 terrorist attack by a foreign invader,\u201d she said.\n\nThe room was silent, broken only through muffled cries and soft whispers of condolence.\n\n\u201cThis government continues to fail, or even recognize, that we have an issue,\u201d Wilkerson continued, saying sanctuary cities \u201cinvite\u201d undocumented immigrants into the U.S.\n\n\u201cYour silence speaks volumes,\u201d she said to the senators. \u201cI don\u2019t want sympathy; I want you to do something. Just throw your hat into the ring for Americans. Quit sitting silent because it\u2019s going to help you get a vote.\u201d\n\nDuring the second half of the hearing, ICE Director Sarah Salda\u00f1a noted the agency\u2019s 3-week-old Priority Enforcement Program aimed at spurring cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement regarding release notification requests.\n\nShe pushed senators to allow the program to fully take effect before implementing laws mandating compliance.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that I don\u2019t have to hit somebody over the head with a federal hammer and work with these state and local jurisdictions, who have their own specific problems to address,\u201d she said during tense questioning from Republican senators.\n\nJim Steinle will return to Capitol Hill later this week to testify before the House in a similar hearing regarding the impact of sanctuary cities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The father of Kathryn Steinle, the woman fatally shot earlier this month by an illegal immigrant, made a powerful appeal before Congress Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The father of Kathryn Steinle, the woman fatally shot earlier this month by an illegal immigrant, made a powerful appeal before Congress Tuesday.", "title": "Steinle\u2019s Father: Sanctuary Cities Caused Daughter's Death", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/steinle.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-22T12:10:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gN5A5C"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The father of Kathryn Steinle, the woman fatally shot earlier this month by an illegal immigrant, made a powerful appeal before Congress Tuesday.", "title": "Steinle\u2019s Father: Sanctuary Cities Caused Daughter's Death", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/steinle.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-07-21T20:25:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T12:10:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kate Steinle, Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Grassley, Laura Wilkerson, Kate\u2019s Law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf77\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
