A man was taken into custody after a short standoff at a Colorado Springs hotel Thanksgiving morning.

Police tell 11 News they located a suspect wanted out of Denver at the Drury Inn on Interquest Parkway around 11 a.m. The suspect allegedly refused to leave his room after learning officers were at the hotel and barricaded himself inside.

The suspect eventually went into custody peacefully after speaking with police over the phone for about 30 minutes. Police called the incident a "verbal standoff" and said no weapons were ever involved. There was no threat to guests at the hotel.

Police identified the suspect as 38-year-old Michael Carnahan.
