Attorney Steve Jett joined the firm on April 1, and will be located primarily in the Chattanooga office.\n\nMr. Jett also joins his son, Austin Jett, who is an Employee Benefits advisor with the firm.\n\nAs health care reform continues to develop, employers are finding that they have to meet an ever-increasing compliance and regulatory burden under the law, including increased documentation, tracking, and reporting to the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\n\u201cUnder PPACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), employers today have more benefits compliance responsibility than they did in the past, and can expect the load, and the enforcement, to increase even more in the future,\u201d said RBA president Russ Blakely.\n\nMr. Jett, who practiced with Chambliss, Bahner, and Stophel for 40 years, was recently named 2015 Best Lawyers in America \u201cChattanooga Health Care Law Lawyer of the Year\u201d. His primary responsibilities at RBA include consulting with RBA clients on their benefits plans, as well as their compliance requirements and processes.\n\n\u201cEmployers are always looking to control costs while providing the best benefits possible to their employees,\u201d said Brent Wick, Employee Benefits advisor at RBA. \u201cBut now with Healthcare Reform, they have to think a lot more about keeping the tires between the lines of the law. We just want to be sure that all clients will be prepared should the IRS and DOL come knocking for a benefits plan audit.\u201d\n\nAt the Chambliss Law Firm, Jett\u2019s practice focused on corporate and transactional work, with an emphasis on the healthcare, software, and manufacturing industries. His healthcare practice focused on representing care providers in regulatory and business matters.\n\nFor more information, contact Kathy Petty at kathy@rbabenefits.com or 423 266-8306.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/4/21/298688/Russ-Blakely-And-Associates-Hires.aspx", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-04-21T13:12:15.5386387Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-21T13:16:05.9216426Z"}, "image": "http://www.chattanoogan.com/photos/2015/4/article.298688.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Russ Blakely And Associates Hires In-House Health Care Compliance Attorney"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe40e8\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday, April 21, 2015Russ Blakely and Associates (RBA), an area employee benefits consulting firm, has hired a compliance officer to join its staff of benefits advisory professionals.\nMr. Jett also joins his son, Austin Jett, who is an Employee Benefits advisor with the firm.\n\u201cEmployers are always looking to control costs while providing the best benefits possible to their employees,\u201d said Brent Wick, Employee Benefits advisor at RBA.\nMr. Jett, who practiced with Chambliss, Bahner, and Stophel for 40 years, was recently named 2015 Best Lawyers in America \u201cChattanooga Health Care Law Lawyer of the Year\u201d.\nAttorney Steve Jett joined the firm on April 1, and will be located primarily in the Chattanooga office."}
