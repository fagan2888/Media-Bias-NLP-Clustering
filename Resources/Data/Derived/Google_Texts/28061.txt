MILWAUKEE (WITI) -- Thanksgiving is a time for food, fun and family. To help ensure everyone has a fruitful holiday, Milwaukee Health Services is helping feed people who may otherwise go without food for the holiday.

It was a gloomy Saturday morning, but the Thanksgiving giveaway at Martin Luther King Jr. Heritage Health Center surely brightened people's spirits.

"I can come down here get some food and have a nice Thanksgiving," said Dorothy Blackshire, picking up a meal.

Groups were ushered throughout, snagging items for their feast. Milwaukee Health Services Inc. hosted the 4th annual Thanksgiving Dinner Giveaway.

"I believe in service and I believe in the community," said volunteer, Marcel Clarke.

It's that attitude that helped fill spirits and bellies.

"We unloaded over 800 turkeys, chickens, and other goodies and desires for the packets," said Clarke.

Nearly 400 people were served.

"I think it shows that there is a need in this community for this type of activity to occur. It also tells the story there is a lot of opportunities for folks here to get services," said Chief Operations Operator with Milwaukee Health Services, Kenneth Waller.

While some jumped on the opportunity for a health screening, others took advantage of chatting up Milwaukee Bucks guard, Jerryd Bayless, who was helping dole out the food.

"For the people who aren't as fortunate, you got to give back," said Bayless.

Recipients were thankful and overjoyed.

"This here was a help to everybody, some people don't have food and it's really a help," said Blackshire.

The annual giveaway was made possible with the help of volunteers and donations -- including the Bayless Foundation, the 34 Way To Assist Foundation, Molina Healthcare, Feeding America and Walmart.
