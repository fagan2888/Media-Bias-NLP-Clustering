I am suggesting that such involvement is more a civil right afforded to us as Americans than a biblical one; and that we should understand it as so. In other words political victories should not be publicly construed as spiritual, or necessarily moral, in a non-theocratic republic. The continued blurring of this line is not leading to more people being saved, but less; not to more people being attracted to our message but repelled by it; not to more people coming into the church but avoiding it altogether.5\n\nEvangelicals, therefore, should not so much view the SCOTUS decision as a spiritual victory but a civil one, and understanding the difference avoid enmeshing Christ in politics. Anything less suggests to an unbelieving world that God takes sides, or is otherwise opposed to those not with us on one issue or another. Rather than demonstrating humility in the public square, too many among us are championing political positions as if they've been written in biblical stone. In so doing we marginalize those with thoughts or opinions different from our own, even those with whom we will one day share an eternal home. No wonder those for whom Christ also died, those made also in His image, those whom yet He loves, hold such an unfavorable view of Christians and the Church, while yet speaking well of Jesus. The gap between us and them thus widens to the detriment of the Gospel.\n\nIn seeking to boldly and publicly stand for Christ, then, Evangelicals should exercise greater wisdom going forward. Before speaking, writing, or tweeting, we should take into account a general populace that increasingly views us as irrelevant, out of touch, bigoted, mean-spirited, separatists, segregationists, and in one way or another determined to impose our beliefs on them through legislation and the courts. It perceives us as reluctant to listen graciously, to speak humbly, or to love as we've been loved\u2026 unconditionally, mercifully, gracefully. With this in mind, we should choose our words, means, and methods, carefully to avoid further entrenchment of these perceptions and, rather, to overcome them.\n\nIn short, we should remember that the mission of the Church is best fulfilled not through political reform but spiritual reform: not through legislation but transformation; not through coercion but through conversion, in seeing others come to know Him as we do.\n\n__________________________\n\n1 - http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hobby-lobby-wins-contraceptive-ruling-supreme-court/story?id=24364311\n\n2 \u2013 Ibid.\n\n3 \u2013 As cited by Thomas Kidd, \"Steven Miller in The Age of Evangelicalism: America's Born-Again Years doesn't work very hard to define it; he says only (in a parenthetical aside) that evangelicalism is \"the label commonly given to the public expression of born-again Christianity.\" See http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2014/07/the-evangelicals-who-are-not-evangelicals/#ixzz370mOZUe6 as viewed July 8, 2014\n\n4 \u2013 Concerning American Evangelicals Thomas Kidd writes, \"The fourth group \u2013 and the one that presents the most critical problem, given the public's impression of evangelicals described by Steven Miller \u2013 are those for whom American politics and patriotism are the center of Christianity, at least as communicated in public.
