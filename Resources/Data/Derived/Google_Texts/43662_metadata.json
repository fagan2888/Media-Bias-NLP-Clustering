They include police officers, police supervisors and firefighters.\n\nAbout 550 nonrepresented employees will experience the same increase in premiums.\n\nUnder the new contract, family coverage will increase by $30 a month next year and will go up an additional $33 a month in 2015.\n\nHorvath said the plan is managed by the self-funded insurance committee, which is run by eight equal voting members representing the public safety unions and the nonrepresented employees. Horvath is chairman and one of the voting members.\n\nThe public safety unions ratified the contract before it came before the council.\n\nHorvath said the city has been contributing $847 a month to the internal services fund, which is used to run the self-funded medical plan, for each employee since 2008, but the fund has been using reserves.\n\nUnder the new contract, the city will contribute $875 a month for each employee. That amounts to about $2 million extra for calendar years 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn turn, the employee contributions will increase by $1 million during that time. Employees, who previously paid 6 percent of their premiums, will pay 15 percent.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s sharing the cost of the increases, and that\u2019s what you do in a partnership,\u201d said Norm \u201cDoc\u201d Halliday, president of the Henderson Police Officers Association and a member of the self-funded insurance committee.\n\nThe union represents about 330 police and corrections officers.\n\nDan Pentkowski, president of the Henderson firefighters union, called the new contract \u201can absolute win-win.\u201d\n\nEveryone is paying more, he acknowledged, \u201cbut we\u2019re doing that in a very fair, a very prudent way.\u201d\n\nPentkowski also sits on the self-fund insurance committee. His union has about 190 members.\n\nThe 700 city employees represented by the Teamsters union get health benefits from a separate self-funded plan.\n\nHenderson, Nevada\u2019s second-largest city, has about 1,750 full-time employees and a population of more than 270,000.\n\nGOLF CLUB MANAGEMENT CHANGING?\n\nWildhorse Golf Club, Henderson\u2019s municipal golf course, may soon be under new management.\n\nThe City Council authorized staff to enter into contract negotiations with Par 4 Golf Management, despite a protest from Wright Golf Management, which has managed the course since 2005.\n\n\u201cWe were dissatisfied with a number of provisions in the current contract,\u201d City Manager Jacob Snow said.\n\nIn June, the city chose to put the contract out to bid. After receiving six proposals, city staff recommended the selection of Par 4.\n\nSnow said Par 4 manages other golf clubs in Southern Nevada, including the Badlands Golf Club in Las Vegas and the Primm Valley Golf Club, and has access to a network of customers.\n\nINTENT TO AUCTION LAND APPROVED\n\nAlso Tuesday, the City Council unanimously adopted a resolution expressing intent to sell about 16 acres at public auction for a minimum price of $3.4 million.\n\nThe property is at the southeast corner of Aurora Drive and Buckhorn Street, near South Gibson Road and West Horizon Ridge Parkway.\n\nPardee Homes has expressed an interest in buying the land.\n\nContact reporter Carri Geer Thevenot at cgeer@reviewjournal.com or 702-384-8710.
