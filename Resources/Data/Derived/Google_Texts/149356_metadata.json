It\u2019s hard to believe this is America. The mainstream media no longer prints the truth, they just print whatever lies make Obama look best.\n\nAre we living in a Banana Republic, where the media covers-up for a tin pot dictator named Barack Obama?\n\nThe economy is a disastrous mess. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from the headlines released by the liberal media. For instance, take the jobs report that came out last Friday. This could be the biggest case of fraud and misrepresentation since\u2026ObamaCare.\n\nLet\u2019s pick Friday\u2019s jobs report apart, piece by piece.\n\nRecovery? Good jobs report? Folks, this is a slow motion disaster.\n\nFirst, the headlines in most every newspaper in the country reported the \u201cgreat news\u201d of 223,000 jobs created. No one mentioned that this number was below expectations and therefore a disappointment.\n\nNo one mentioned that the stock market went up in response to this BAD news, because Wall Street analysts now expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at zero (in response to such bad news). In other words bad news is great news on Wall Street. Instead the liberal media simply reported that the stock market went up, leaving average Americans to think it was in response to good news about jobs.\n\nSecond, while the headlines screamed about 223,000 new jobs created, they never mentioned that last month\u2019s jobs figure was revised downward by over 30 percent. Yes, I said THIRTY PERCENT from 126,000 new jobs to 85,000.\n\nIf the mainstream media was doing its job, they\u2019d ask why anyone should believe this month\u2019s figure? Why should we not assume a 30% downward revision next month? If so 220,000 jobs would be revised down to only 160,000 -- a disastrous disappointment.\n\nThe third lie is the mother of all fraud. How did the government arrive at that figure of 223,000 new jobs created? It was composed of 252,000 full-time jobs LOST and 437,000 part-time jobs gained.\n\nDid you know that? Of course not. Because the liberal media never reported it. Tell me what\u2019s good news about 252,000 full-time jobs being eliminated, while they are replaced by 440,000 horrible low-wage part-time jobs (the kind that cannot feed a traditional family without food stamps)?\n\nBy the way, those 252,000 full-time jobs lost were the biggest drop in full-time jobs in a year. How is this reported as \u201cgood news?\u201d How is this reported as proof of a \u201crecovery?\u201d Why aren't they reporting the prospects of getting a full-time job have declined dramatically from one year ago?\n\nAlso why is there no investigation by the mainstream media about why the United States of America is so quickly transforming into a low-wage, part-time economy? Because the media is afraid of the obvious answer: ObamaCare.\n\nI\u2019ve seen no headlines reporting on the results of Federal Reserve Bank surveys in Philadelphia, New York and Atlanta all finding that in response to ObamaCare, few if any full-time jobs are being created, part-time jobs are the norm, and higher costs for health insurance are being passed onto employees.\n\nThere it is. Two mysteries are solved at once. This is why we see only part-time jobs being created and why consumer spending is weak despite lower gas prices. ObamaCare is wrecking the economy. Says who? The Fed. Whom did they ask? The only people whose opinions really matter -- employers.\n\nLastly, how can the media justify touting 223,000 jobs created, without mentioning that in the same month we hit a record low for Americans NOT in the labor force? Believe it or not, 93,194,000 of our fellow citizens of working age are not working. That\u2019s the record for the most ever number of Americans not working.\n\nYou mean this statistic isn\u2019t significant enough to mention? Yes, unemployment is going down. The reason is clear -- people are dropping out of the workforce and either living on welfare, food stamps, disability, or if they\u2019re lucky enough to be older, they\u2019re going straight to Social Security and Medicare (meaning they'll never work again).\n\nNo country can survive this kind of entitlement burden. Under Obama a majority of the country is surviving on a government check of some kind.\n\nRecovery? Good jobs report? Folks this is a slow motion disaster. But the mainstream media refuses to tell the truth.\n\nIn the private sector there's a word for that. It's called fraud.\n\n\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a Capitalist Evangelist, serial entrepreneur, conservative national media commentator, and proud champion of the middle class.
