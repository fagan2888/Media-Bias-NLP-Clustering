Think \"House\" meets \"The Gangs of New York.\"\n\nIn an unusual feat, the entire series is directed by one filmmaker, Oscar-winner Steven Soderbergh, and was created by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler.\n\nWhile \"The Knick\" hasn't yet penetrated the cultural conversation the way some other small-screen dramas have, it is notable for its stomach-churning surgical scenes, painstaking recreation of turn-of-the-century New York and perhaps most of all for Soderbergh's kinetic filmmaking style.

Members of the cast, including lead Jon Hamm, even visited the White House during the show's farewell tour in March.\n\nThen there's HBO's hit fantasy epic \"Game of Thrones.\" In an interview for GQ, Obama told Bill Simmons he is an avid fan of the violent series though, like many other viewers, he has trouble keeping track of the names of the many characters in the sprawling ensemble. Asked which character he most identifies with, Obama said he related to \"the dwarf...what's his name?\" (pssst, Mr. President, it's Tyrion Lannister).\n\n'Game of Thrones' Season 6 teaser Watch the teaser for \"Game of Thrones\" Season 6.
