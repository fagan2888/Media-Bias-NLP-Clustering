While the hospital has experienced an increase in revenue from Arkansans that now have health insurance, it also has experienced a mountain of red tape relating to auditing protocols, which Peterson said is costing the hospital millions.

John Boozman and Sen. Tom Cotton, and the aides of U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford.\n\n\"What I asked for basically, or what the AHA asked for in relief, is there are so many complex auditing processes and that we need to streamline those,\" Peterson explained Wednesday, referring to RAC, also known as \"recovery audit contractors.\"\n\nPeterson: 'Simplify the rules'\n\nPeterson says RAC is contracted with the federal government to \"supposedly\" stop fraud and abuse. While it sounds good in theory for hospitals like BRMC, he believes that isn't entirely the case.\n\n\u201cOn average, $500 per patient is what I'm spending just to be able to say, 'Yes, you can be admitted to the hospital.' ... Tell me, how are you supposed to operate?\u201d Ron Peterson, BRMC president and CEO\n\n\"When they have taken it down to the degree that they have taken it to, it's kind of ridiculous,\" Peterson said. \"First of all, you have to realize the auditing contractors get paid a percentage of what they recover, so we're asking for that to be changed, for them to be paid in a different manner than what they are currently being paid.\"\n\nPeterson also is calling on the federal government to \"simplify the rules.\"\n\n\"I don't want to break the law. I don't want to go to jail. I don't want this hospital to have to pay back millions of dollars because we did something wrong,\" he said. \"That's not my intent, so why can't you make it simple enough for somebody who has the intent to follow the law?\"\n\nIn one example Peterson gave, imagine someone coming into the hospital and a doctor says they need inpatient care. A nurse reviews the chart to confirm that the patient meets criteria. The hospital then uses a software program to run the information and once again confirm that the patient in question meets inpatient criteria.\n\nAt that point, Peterson explained \"just to double check it,\" the hospital sends the information to an outside company that has hired physicians to review charts and again confirm the individual meets inpatient criteria.\n\nMore than $12 million in chart review penalties has been requested by recovery audit contractors from BRMC, money that the hospital then has to prove it doesn\u2019t owe.

(Photo: Kevin Pieper/The Baxter Bulletin)\n\n\"Tell me, how are you supposed to operate?\"\n\nBRMC hit with penalties\n\nAccording to Peterson, RAC has requested more than $12 million in chart review penalties from BRMC, which is money the hospital then has had to prove it doesn't owe. After at least two years, BRMC estimates it has worked that $12 million down to $4 million. But it doesn't stop, he says.\n\n\"Every 60 days, we're getting a new RAC letter and we're going through the process again,\" Peterson said. \"I'm up there saying we need to change this law, we have to change something, because it's going to put us out of business.\n\n\"One of the major threats to this hospital is RAC. Is that what you want?\"\n\nMeetings with Congress members\n\n\u201cWe can't lose the expansion because it's tied in so much, and I guess I believe that the ACA will be here for at least the next two years.\u201d Ron Peterson\n\nIn meetings with Boozman, Cotton and Crawford's aides, Peterson said overall he felt the trip to D.C. was a positive experience. He noted that Boozman and Crawford have previously visited BRMC.\n\n\"I heard from all three parties that they believe hospitals have had enough cuts. Hospitals went out on a limb, in my opinion, with the ACA,\" he said, noting decreases in Medicare payments partially for Medicaid expansion, also known in Arkansas as the \"private option.\"\n\n\"We can't lose the expansion because it's tied in so much, and I guess I believe that the ACA will be here for at least the next two years,\" Peterson said. \"That $9 million that I talk about on average that we lose in reimbursement, it's actually $12 million we projected, and $3 million we're going to get from the 'private option' expansion to get us to the $9 million net.\"\n\nThe $9 million represents a decrease in Medicare payments due to ACA.\n\nAs reported by The Bulletin in a May 2014 story, BRMC is extremely vulnerable to Medicare reductions. Because of the demographic of the region the hospital serves, Medicare reimbursements represent nearly 70 percent of its income, which is among the highest figures in the country.\n\nBuy Photo Baxter Regional Medical Center President and CEO Ron Peterson says the hospital is in \u201cfinancially uncharted waters\u201d due to the Affordable Care Act. (Photo: Kevin Pieper/The Baxter Bulletin)\n\nBRMC 'financially stable' \u2014 for now\n\nWith decreased payments and increased regulation, such as RAC, is the hospital profitable?\n\nIt's not an easy question for Peterson to answer, but he says the hospital is \"financially stable\" \u2014 for now. It can't take any more cuts, he said, and the hospital's goals are to remain \"comprehensive, independent and community-driven.\"\n\n\"We're trying to maneuver ourselves in this ever-changing environment and yet try to preserve some of the good things that are here, and while we're doing that, I want to make sure the people realize we're not losing focus on patient care,\" Peterson said. \"As a matter of fact, you can come in here and get as good of care as anywhere else in the nation because we're probably setting the bar on at least patient safety with processes and procedures that are in place.\"\n\n\"If I was going to ask for help from the community, I would ask them to do exactly what I did when I went to Washington \u2014 that is make sure that our senators and congressman know that enough is enough,\" Peterson added. \"We've had enough cuts to payments, to hospitals. We need to stop the cuts, we need to stop the bleeding and need relief in that bureaucracy.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/news/local/2015/05/13/brmc-went-washington/27272865/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "BRMC and 11 other Arkansas hospitals have recently visited Washington D.C. to call on the federal government for \"relief, reform and resources\" in response to some major cuts the Affordable Care Act has had on the hospital.", "og": {"site_name": "The Baxter Bulletin", "description": "BRMC and 11 other Arkansas hospitals have recently visited Washington D.C. to call on the federal government for \"relief, reform and resources\" in response to some major cuts the Affordable Care Act has had on the hospital.", "title": "Obamacare: BRMC takes fight to D.C.", "url": "http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/news/local/2015/05/13/brmc-went-washington/27272865/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/baxterbulletin.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BRMC and 11 other Arkansas hospitals have recently visited Washington D.C. to call on the federal government for \"relief, reform and resources\" in response to some major cuts the Affordable Care Act has had on the hospital.", "creator": "@BBNewsroom", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d6c0d9f63a35c797ae77c82c088bc1c10edee45b/c=718-0-2565-1847&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/13/MountainHome/B9317326161Z.1_20150513200735_000_G3HAPD7GL.1-0.jpg", "title": "Why Baxter Regional went to Washington", "site": "@BBNewsroom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=875264530", "fb": {"app_id": 183082181717378}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "baxter bulletin, mountain home, brmc, baxter regional, aca, affordable, care, obamacare, act, ron peterson, rac, washington, Medicare, Medicaid, private option"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Ron Peterson, left, BRMC president and CEO, talks Wednesday about his recent visit to Washington D.C. with Baxter Regional Hospital Foundation President Barney Larry.\nBaxter Regional Medical Center CEO says relief needed from red tape, financial distress created by Affordable Care ActBuy Photo Ron Peterson, Baxter Regional Medical Center president and CEO, talks Wednesday about his recent visit to Washington D.C., where he met with Arkansas\u2019 congressional delegation to express concerns about some aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\nBuy Photo Baxter Regional Medical Center President and CEO Ron Peterson says the hospital is in \u201cfinancially uncharted waters\u201d due to the Affordable Care Act.\n...
