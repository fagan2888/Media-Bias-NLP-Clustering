Centerbridge Swims Away with Pool Product Maker Kik

The private equity-backed target spent $300M on Chemturas consumer products business in 2014

Centerbridge Partners has closed the acquisition of household and personal products-maker Kik Custom Products. The business was sold by CI Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm.

Toronto-based Kik makes household, personal care, pool and spa lines, including bleach, polishes, surface cleaners, sanitizers and algaecides. Terms of the deal werent disclosed.

Under CI Capital, Kik acquired Chemtura Corp.s (NYSE: CHMT) consumer products business for $300 million in January 2014. Back in 2011, Kik picked up Chem-Lab Products Inc., which brought it into the pool-products business.

New York-based Centerbridge plans to keep growing the company organically and through add-on acquisitions. For the private equity firm, the deal comes one day after it announced plans to back Heartland Food Products Group once the business completes the acquisition of Splenda from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Back in June, Centerbridge agreed to sell transportation business Kenan Advantage Group Inc. to Omers Private Equity.

CI generally makes equity investments between $25 million and $100 million per transaction. The firm focuses on business services, distribution, health care services, government services and defense and light manufacturing businesses.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (NYSE: MS) and Rothschild acted as Kiks financial advisers for the deal, and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP provided legal advice. Barclays (NYSE: BCS) advised Centerbridge, and Barclays and BMO Capital markets provided debt financing for the debt. Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP was Centerbridges legal counsel.
