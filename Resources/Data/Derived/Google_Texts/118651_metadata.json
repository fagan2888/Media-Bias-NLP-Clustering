It\u2019s duplicitous, secretive, destructive and legacy-driven, and he\u2019s going to have to go full community organizer to get it passed.\n\nThis deal was born in hell. It is the culmination of Obama\u2019s dangerously flawed philosophy that you enhance national security through appeasement. If we can secure a deal with Satan\u2019s stepchild, after all, we can remake the globe into the peaceful utopia progressives romantically envision.\n\nNever mind that this terrorist theocracy, by its own admission, is immune to rehabilitation. \u201cDeath to America, death to Israel.\u201d Even in the midst of negotiations with the Obama regime, the mullahs didn\u2019t bother to pretend they had goodwill toward us.\n\nIt was as though Iran\u2019s leaders were trying to validate the deal\u2019s opponents, demonstrating their contempt for America and Israel, showing their intention to continue sponsoring global terrorism, and signaling their unwillingness to submit to legitimate inspections.\n\nThroughout, the Obama regime\u2019s denial of Iran\u2019s malevolence grew in direct proportion to Iran\u2019s confessions. Obama\u2019s essential message to us was: \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the Iranians; they will comply with the terms of the agreement despite insisting they won\u2019t. We must close this deal and make it easier for them to get nukes because they will respond favorably to our magnanimity.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s problem is that you can only fool part of the people part of the time. His propaganda machine doesn\u2019t always succeed, as some facts are too stubborn to ignore. Whether there are limits to the Democratic Party\u2019s loyalty to party over country, on the other hand, is another matter. It may approve this deal despite its undeniable flaws and the public\u2019s opposition.\n\nYes, polls show that just as with Obamacare, Obama has been unable to fool the majority of Americans into believing that this deal is good for America. A Quinnipiac University poll shows that 57 percent of Americans oppose it, whereas only 28 percent support it. By similar majorities, Americans disapprove of the way Obama is handling the situation in Iran and believe that the deal makes the world less safe.\n\nDon\u2019t assume this gives Obama a second\u2019s pause; it simply inspires him to push harder. But he is growing desperate. Bloomberg reports that \u201cadministration officials are increasingly finding themselves on the defensive against criticism from Republicans and some Democrats, as well as vehement opposition from Israel, according to three officials, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal political deliberations.\u201d\n\nSo Obama has launched an intense lobbying effort of congressional Democrats. As with the 2012 presidential election, he knows he can\u2019t win GOP support, so he has shucked any pretense of bipartisanship and turned to the far left for support. And like a seasoned community organizer, he is isolating and demonizing his opponents and distorting facts that damage his cause.\n\nAs such, Obama is arguing that opposition to his deal is coming from the same groups that led us to war in Iraq, by which he is not so subtly implying Jewish groups. It\u2019s not enough for him to slander Israel\u2019s leaders; he must target Jewish supporters in America, as well, playing to the worst of the old stereotypes.\n\nMeanwhile, Nobel Prize seeker John Kerry is telling us that Iran\u2019s supreme leader wasn\u2019t serious when he called for \u201cdeath to America.\u201d Secretary of State Kerry assured the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he has \u201cno specific knowledge of a plan by Iran to actually destroy us.\u201d Swell.\n\nThe Obama administration wants us to believe it instead of Iran concerning Iran\u2019s intentions. Not to worry, because Obama claims he\u2019s tougher than Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s pursuing a \u201cdon\u2019t trust but verify\u201d strategy with Iran. Yet the specifics of the deal scream otherwise. Not only are \u201canytime, anywhere\u201d site inspections absent from the deal but also the United States has a subordinate role in the inspections process.\n\nThe deal results in the likely acceleration of Iran\u2019s acquisition of nuclear weapons, and it frees up billions to Iran, which can and will use the funds to sponsor global terrorism.\n\nJust as with Obamacare, everything about this deal is wrong and the American people oppose it, which is why Obama will become more militant and deceitful in trying to cram it down our throats.\n\nHave we learned nothing from the Obamacare nightmare, especially about Obama\u2019s character and designs?\n\nNow is not the time to mince words about the evils we face; now is not the time to pull our punches in deference to the false gods of bipartisanship and compromise \u2014 which only one party (the GOP) honors, in any event.\n\nSome reasons for optimism exist. For example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is said to be wavering.\n\nPerhaps our side can take a page from Obama\u2019s playbook and pull out all the stops in opposing this deal. The stakes are too high to sit this one out.\n\nJust as with Obamacare, we can\u2019t rely on America\u2019s waning rule of law to save us from this unconstitutional and reckless monstrosity.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "President Obama's sordid Iran nuke deal is looking more and more like the foreign policy version of Obamacare.
