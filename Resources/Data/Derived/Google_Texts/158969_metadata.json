The CBO estimated that 13 million people should be in the market in 2015.\n\n2:34 p.m.: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that the Congressional Budget Office estimated 2014 enrollment at 7 million. The budget office reduced that estimate this year to 6 million.\n\n------------\n\nAnd the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the effects of federal legislation, has estimated that 13 million people should be in the market in 2015, the marketplaces' second year.\n\nBut speaking to reporters Wednesday, Burwell suggested that number may not be the right target. \u201cOne of things we are doing right now is applying analytics to how should we think about that goal,\u201d she said.\n\nShe declined to say when a new target might be announced, saying the administration is consulting with insurance industry officials and market analysts to gauge the performance of a new market like that created by the health law.\n\nThis year, the law allowed Americans who don\u2019t get health benefits at work to shop among plans on new state-based marketplaces created by the law. Those making less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $94,000 for a family of four, qualify for subsidies.\n\nTotal enrollment in the marketplaces, though an imprecise metric, has been watched closely as sustained growth is considered vital to reducing the number of uninsured and keeping premiums in check by getting healthier Americans into the market.\n\nBy most measures, the first year of the marketplaces has been a success, with enrollment surpassing the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 2014 estimate of 6 million and new insurers joining the marketplaces for 2015.\n\nBut technological issues continue to plague the enrollment system. And as the second enrollment period nears on Nov. 15, supporters of the law are growing increasingly anxious about whether the Obama administration and its allies will be able to sign up nearly twice as many people for 2015.\n\nBurwell said Wednesday that the administration is more concerned about getting coverage to the remaining uninsured Americans, either through marketplace plans or other options.\n\n\u201cWe think that the most important number to move is the number of uninsured,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a healthy employer-based system in this country. We want that used. We have Medicaid expansion, and we have the marketplace.\u201d\n\nSurveys suggest that 8 million to 10 million uninsured people have gained coverage this year since the marketplaces opened and Medicaid was expanded in many states under the health law.\n\nThat leaves more than 30 million people still without health insurance.\n\nFor more coverage of the federal healthcare law, follow @noamlevey", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "White House reassessing Obamacare enrollment goal for 2015", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The Obama administration, which is scrambling to prepare a new push to enroll Americans in health coverage under the federal health law, is reassessing how many more people will sign up, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said Wednesday.", "title": "White House reassessing Obamacare enrollment goal for 2015", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-obamacare-enrollment-reassessment-20140924-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-542320a2/turbine/la-na-nn-obamacare-enrollment-reassessment-20140924", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, enrollment, reassessment", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81477082", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-24", "Description": "The Obama administration, which is scrambling to prepare a new push to enroll Americans in health coverage under the federal health law, is reassessing how many more people will sign up, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said Wednesday.
