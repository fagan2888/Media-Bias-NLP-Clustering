So far, 100 customers with a total $200 million in assets at Personal Capital\u2014about one-quarter of the firm\u2019s total $760 million under management\u2014have signed up.\n\nAdvisers are expanding mobile services.

Unlike a typical brokerage, most of Personal Capital\u2019s interaction with clients is online, through mobile apps, videoconference or by phone.\n\nPersonal Capital\u2019s new private-client unit charges 0.79% annually on the first $3 million invested with it and the fee scale falls to 0.49% of assets annually for accounts over $10 million. Traditional brokers often charge 1% of assets annually, though they also scale the fees down for larger accounts.\n\nPersonal Capital\u2019s typical client is in his or her early 50s, with finances that have grown complex. \u201cWe see the do-it-yourselfers graduating\u201d to using the online adviser, Mr. Shah said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Personal Capital's new service is taking direct aim at the wealth-management divisions of the biggest U.S. brokerages.", "title": "Online Adviser\u2019s New Target: Investors With $1 Million or More", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/09/04/online-advisers-new-target-investors-with-1-million-or-more/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJpersfinance", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article.headline": "Online Adviser\u2019s New Target: Investors With $1 Million or More", "description": "Personal Capital's new service is taking direct aim at the wealth-management divisions of the biggest U.S. brokerages.", "article_section": "Personal Finance", "author": "Liz Moyer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Total Return Blog", "page.subsection": "Total Return", "article.summary": "Personal Capital's new service is taking direct aim at the wealth-management divisions of the biggest U.S. brokerages.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-09-04T16:23:34-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/09/04/online-advisers-new-target-investors-with-1-million-or-more/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-TOTALB-2132", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Personal Finance", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Personal Capital's new service is taking direct aim at the wealth-management divisions of the biggest U.S. brokerages.", "title": "Online Adviser\u2019s New Target: Investors With $1 Million or More", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/09/04/online-advisers-new-target-investors-with-1-million-or-more/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Total Return", "article.id": "BL-TOTALB-2132", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-04T16:24:49-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0e8\"", "article_summary": "Unlike a typical brokerage, most of Personal Capital\u2019s interaction with clients is online, through mobile apps, videoconference or by phone.\nPersonal Capital\u2019s typical client is in his or her early 50s, with finances that have grown complex.\nNow one of those online firms, sometimes dubbed \u201crobo advisers,\u201d is edging into the business of providing wealth-management services to people with $1 million or more.\nAdvisers are expanding mobile services.\nPersonal Capital\u2019s new private-client unit charges 0.79% annually on the first $3 million invested with it and the fee scale falls to 0.49% of assets annually for accounts over $10 million."}
