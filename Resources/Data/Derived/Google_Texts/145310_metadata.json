(Celeste Katz/New York Daily News)\n\nLong waits to get a municipal ID aren't limited to the city's 11 application centers.\n\nIt took close to an hour on hold with 311 to get an appointment to register for a municipal ID Thursday morning.\n\nAnd when an operator did finally pick up, the earliest appointment available at Grand Army Plaza to sign up in person for the city\u2019s new card -- intended to help the city\u2019s homeless and undocumented immigrants gain a government-issued ID -- was February 19, 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is very overwhelming,\u201d the operator said, apologizing for the long wait time when she finally picked up after 54 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our best and handling it the best we can. The information is new, it's different.\u201d\n\nA surge of New Yorkers eager for a municipal ID card flooded application centers when the program debuted Monday, and the city has appeared unprepared for the overwhelming interest.\n\nIn response to the high levels of demand the city has been unable to accommodate, City Hall announced Tuesday it would switch to an appointment-based system.\n\nBut the Website to schedule appointments on Wednesday was not working, prohibiting New Yorkers from scheduling appointments online and backing up the city's non-emergency help desk.\n\nWe're going to fix the website situation,\u201d Mayor de Blasio said Wednesday, denying any comparison to the Obamacare site. \u201cThis was a high demand dynamic. That's a good thing. But we're going to fix that situation. That's going to be back up and running soon.\u201d\n\nFor now, immigrant groups said they're willing to wait and let the city work out the kinks.\n\n\"Rather than frustration, what we've witnessed is persistence, even in the face of some of the hiccups experienced,\" said Betsy Plum, director of special projects for the New York Immigration Coalition. \"People want to wait in line, they'll wait with 311, they'll be excited for that appointment. What were seeing is not only is the demand real, people need this. I have full trust they will find more enrollment sites, New York is commited to this program. We'll wait.\"\n\nUPDATE: As of noon Thursday, there have been 4,854 enrollments in the ID NYC program, a city spokeswoman said. Another 6,856 had called 311 Thursday to schedule an appointment, and a total of 20,025 New Yorkers had made appointments to get an ID since Tuesday night.\n\nCity officials said they had moved quickly to cut down the wait times.\n\n\u201cWe have deployed full resources to resolve any issues and have dramatically reduced the wait times on 311 calls,\u201d said Joe Morrisroe, executive director of NYC311. \u201cThis has helped increase our efficiency to book IDNYC appointments across the board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2079386.1421344269!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/idnyc.jpg", "description": "ID NYC appointments unavailable through January, 311 backed up with hour-long waits to schedule appointment", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "ID NYC appointments unavailable through January, 311 backed up with hour-long waits to schedule appointment", "title": "ID NYC appointments booked through January, 311 backed up", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/id-nyc-appointments-booked-january-311-backed-blog-entry-1.2079385", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2079386.1421344269!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/idnyc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ID NYC appointments unavailable through January, 311 backed up with hour-long waits to schedule appointment", "title": "ID NYC appointments booked through January, 311 backed up", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/id-nyc-appointments-booked-january-311-backed-blog-entry-1.2079385", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2079386.1421344269!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/idnyc.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-15T12:34:17-0500", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.title": "ID NYC appointments booked through January, 311 backed up", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "nydn_section": "dailypolitics", "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "ID NYC appointments unavailable through January, 311 backed up with hour-long waits to schedule appointment", "viewport": "width=1070, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "UPDATE: As of noon Thursday, there have been 4,854 enrollments in the ID NYC program, a city spokeswoman said.\nIt took close to an hour on hold with 311 to get an appointment to register for a municipal ID Thursday morning.\nceleste katz/new york daily news Annie Karni 311 call about ID cards wait time.\nAnother 6,856 had called 311 Thursday to schedule an appointment, and a total of 20,025 New Yorkers had made appointments to get an ID since Tuesday night.\n(Celeste Katz/New York Daily News)Long waits to get a municipal ID aren't limited to the city's 11 application centers."}
