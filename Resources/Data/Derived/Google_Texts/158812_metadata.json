The group has already endorsed his primary challenger, Katrina Pierson.\n\nThe grassroots group could also have its eye on the Senate\u2019s top GOP leader. Kibbe indicated the group is looking closely at backing Matt Bevin, Sen. Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill MORE\u2019s (Ky.) primary challenger, and argued McConnell would be weaker than Bevin in the general election against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D).\n\nMcConnell is deeply unpopular in his home state, and repeated polls have shown him running within single digits of \u2014 or even behind \u2014 his Democratic challenger. Conservatives read those numbers as evidence the senator won\u2019t be able to defeat Lundergan Grimes in a general election fight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to me that, if Mitch McConnell wins the primary, he\u2019s highly vulnerable in the general, and if you\u2019re worried about saving that seat, you may need to reconsider your premises about who can win,\u201d Kibbe said.\n\nKibbe also said his group expects to topple Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.); FreedomWorks and other conservative groups have rallied behind state Sen. Chris McDaniel. He also suggested Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), facing four primary challengers, could be vulnerable in a runoff and indicated the group might wait for such a scenario to engage in the race.\n\nFreedomWorks has built a reputation since its 2004 inception for backing conservative insurgents in Republican primaries, much to the chagrin and skeptical eye of many in the GOP establishment. Kibbe said the group is still surveying its supporters on the ground in many races before making final picks.\n\nBut Brian Walsh, a GOP strategist and former spokesman at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the group\u2019s record made it \u201chard to take [its] predictions seriously,\u201d adding it is \u201cunfortunate\u201d FreedomWorks hasn\u2019t learned any lessons from the last election cycle, when weak candidates who made it through primaries with conservative support cost the party winnable seats.\n\nAnd he echoed criticism made by other establishment Republicans that FreedomWorks and other conservative groups are engaged in primary fights for profit rather than the benefit of the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the purity-for-profit business model is tempting and lucrative, but it does nothing to seriously advance conservative principles and hold the Democrats accountable,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThey should follow the lead of more serious conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity and focus on the Democrats instead of attacking Republicans to raise money so they can cover their exorbitant salaries and Las Vegas hotel bills.\u201d\n\nBut one surprising place FreedomWorks doesn\u2019t see a compelling candidate yet is in Georgia, where Kibbe said the group doesn\u2019t have a favorite in an eight-way Republican primary. That race is pitting three Georgia congressmen \u2014 Reps. Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston \u2014 against each other and a handful of local activists, business leaders and politicians, including former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. The fight has developed into a race to the right, with each candidate jockeying for a more conservative position than the next; both Broun and Gingrey are favorites of conservative groups.\n\nBut Kibbe said a confluence of issues \u2014 namely ObamaCare, the sluggish economy and revelations the Internal Revenue Service inappropriately targeted applications for tax-exempt status from partisan groups for extra scrutiny \u2014 have created a ripe environment to make races competitive for conservatives this cycle.\n\n\u201cHealthcare, No. 1; the economy, No. 2; IRS abuses, No. 3, are the perfect storm \u2014 at the margins. So this is an off-year election, and in the primaries, and particularly these red-state Senate fights, where the Democrats currently hold the seats, those are the issues,\u201d he said.\n\nKibbe was adamant conservatives could win campaigns running on ObamaCare, touting new polling the group conducted late last year as evidence the law is toxic for Democrats and voters have largely moved past the shutdown that was seen as so harmful to conservatives.\n\nThe polling, however, has inspired somewhat of a shift for the group \u2014 it revealed voters want an alternative to the healthcare law, a finding that has inspired FreedomWorks to launch an effort to crowdsource its own healthcare reform plan.\n\n\u201cIf the leadership patches up a plan, which I think they might have a hard time doing, I don\u2019t think it has the credibility that a grassroots plan would,\u201d he said of the effort.\n\nThe shift reflects a growing realization within the GOP that the party can\u2019t run merely against ObamaCare \u2014 it needs to also offer voters an alternative.\n\nBut FreedomWorks and other conservative groups are facing a fight they haven\u2019t had to contend with before: a pushback from business groups, who now say they\u2019re more likely to engage in primaries to defend establishment candidates against conservative challenges.\n\nConservative groups have been criticized by establishment Republicans, most recently Speaker John Boehner (Ohio), for pushing policy they say is counterproductive for the party.\n\nKibbe said Boehner\u2019s criticism, which came in December when FreedomWorks and a number of other conservative groups opposed a developing budget deal, could hurt his claim to the Speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was smart for his Speakership, and I wonder if he\u2019s not interviewing for his next job. It strikes me that that was the actions of a short-timer,\u201d he said.\n\nKibbe said the engagement of some of those establishment actors in primaries could ultimately hurt their preferred candidates.\n\n\u201cI actually think that their endorsement, Karl Rove\u2019s endorsement, in a primary is probably a liability for candidates, and that in the new politics, where grassroots organization and GOTV [get out the vote] trumps television ads and big-dollar contributions, I think we win that fight,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, reports the group was struggling financially last year raise questions about its ability to remain competitive in races this cycle. Kibbe insisted such reports were overblown and said the group\u2019s end-of-year fundraising report will \u201cbe comparable to where we were in 2011,\u201d when it brought in about $10 million.\n\nThe group has endorsed only two Senate candidates, McDaniel and Shane Osborn, who is running for Nebraska\u2019s open Senate seat; and seven House candidates, including Sessions\u2019s primary challenger.\n\nKibbe said he\u2019s confident of an upset there.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a shocker,\u201d he said of Sessions. \u201cHe is a creature of Washington, and he\u2019s been there a really long time, and he\u2019s used to not running a campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd he was confident in the group\u2019s bet on McDaniel as well.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s highly vulnerable. I think we\u2019re going to win that primary,\u201d Kibbe said of Cochran.\n\nIn South Carolina, Kibbe suggested the group would hold its fire until a runoff. State Sen. Lee Bright, businessman Richard Cash, attorney Bill Connor, and businesswoman and libertarian activist Nancy Mace are all challenging Graham in the primary. If no candidate takes a majority of the vote, the race will head to a runoff.\n\n\u2014This piece was updated at 8:24 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe signaled an openness to backing the senator's primary challenger.", "description": "FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe signaled an openness to backing the senator's primary challenger.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe signaled an openness to backing the senator's primary challenger.", "title": "Kibbe: Grassroots trumps big money in \u2018new politics\u2019", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/195553-freedomworks-mcconnell-cant-win-general-election", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/mcconnellmitch_010714gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-15T20:30:03-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/195553-freedomworks-mcconnell-cant-win-general-election", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe signaled an openness to backing the senator's primary challenger.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kibbe: Grassroots trumps big money in \u2018new politics\u2019"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-15T20:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/195553-freedomworks-mcconnell-cant-win-general-election", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-15T20:25-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jessica Taylor", "author": "Alexandra Jaffe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Kentucky, FreedomWorks, Rand Paul, Tea Party movement,Mitch McConnell, Matt Kibbe, Matt Bevin,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T20:25:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T20:30:03-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Kibbe: Grassroots trumps big money in \u2018new politics\u2019"}, "article_summary": "Conservative groups have been criticized by establishment Republicans, most recently Speaker John Boehner (Ohio), for pushing policy they say is counterproductive for the party.\nI think we\u2019re going to win that primary,\u201d Kibbe said of Cochran.\n); FreedomWorks and other conservative groups have rallied behind state Sen.
