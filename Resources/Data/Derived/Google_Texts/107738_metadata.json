They note that \u201cvery little has been reported in the literature on gum-chewing as a potential trigger [for headaches]: one report pertains a single case attributed to excessive gum-chewing, whereas another study described three adults whose headaches were considered to be associated with the sweetener aspartame present in the gum.\u201d\n\nCalvin from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes used to read a special interest magazine about gum called Chewing, which, according to the Calvin and Hobbes Wiki , contained articles on cultivating a \"mandibular fitness regime,\" for a stronger jaw. As an avid chewer, perhaps Calvin was right to be concerned about his jaw\u2019s resilience\u2014 a recent study from Tel Aviv University, published in Pediatric Neurology shows an association between \u201cexcessive gum-chewing\u201d and chronic headaches in adolescents.\n\nSo, to test the theory, they recruited 30 adolescents with chronic headaches who said they chewed gum daily. The participants were divided into categories based on how much time they spent chewing every day: up to one hour, one to three hours, three to six hours, or more than six hours per day. (Who is chewing gum more than six hours per day?? That\u2019s actually chewing gum like it\u2019s your job.)\n\nIt certainly seems possible that chewing more than you need to just to pulverize and swallow your food could cause jaw strain that leads to a headache.\n\nThen this cross-section of Chewing\u2019s target audience was asked to quit, cold turkey, for a month, and report any changes in their symptoms. They didn\u2019t use any other therapies for their headaches during this time.\n\nEighty-seven percent of the patients reported significant improvement, and of the 20 who agreed to go back to chewing gum afterward, all 20 immediately saw their symptoms come back.\n\nThis is a small study, and we\u2019d need more research to adequately test this hypothesis, but it has potential. Despite the previous study mentioned above, the researchers here didn\u2019t think the aspartame in the gum was associated with the headaches\u2014after all, aspartame is in a lot of soft drinks, which the kids weren\u2019t abstaining from during their chewing fast.\n\nInstead, they posit that the kids\u2019 excessive chewing habit put an extra burden on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the hinge joint of the jaw. And headaches have been linked to dysfunctional TMJs by previous research. So it certainly seems possible that chewing more than you need to just to pulverize and swallow your food could cause jaw strain that leads to a headache. At least enough that if you\u2019re smacking on some Double Bubble and feel a throbbing in your temples come on, you might want to try spitting it out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Giving up gum reduced symptoms for most teens in a recent small study.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Giving up gum reduced symptoms for most teens in a recent small study.", "title": "How Chewing Gum Can Cause Headaches", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/2987806447_605b565470_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-chewing-gum-can-cause-headaches/282569/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s actually chewing gum like it\u2019s your job.)\nEighty-seven percent of the patients reported significant improvement, and of the 20 who agreed to go back to chewing gum afterward, all 20 immediately saw their symptoms come back.\n(Who is chewing gum more than six hours per day??\nSo, to test the theory, they recruited 30 adolescents with chronic headaches who said they chewed gum daily.\nInstead, they posit that the kids\u2019 excessive chewing habit put an extra burden on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the hinge joint of the jaw."}
