During his first summer as Marquette head basketball coach, Steve Wojciechowski offered a scholarship to 6-foot-6, 180-pound forward Sam Hauser from Stevens Point.

That was nearly 10 months ago.

On Sunday, Hauser made his official visit to Marquette and accepted Wojciechowski's offer, committing to become part of the Golden Eagles 2016 recruiting class. Hauser announced his decision on Twitter.

Proud to say I am committing to Marquette University! Can't wait to be be a Golden Eagle and be apart of the MUBB family! — Sam Hauser (@Big_Smooth10) May 17, 2015

Hauser led Stevens Point High School to the WIAA Division 1 state championship this year. He scored 25 points, including all 16 for the Panthers in the first quarter, in the 67-51 victory over Germantown that ended the Warhawks' bid at becoming the first team to win four straight Division 1 titles.

As a junior this past season, Hauser averaged 17.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game while shooting a state-high 52% from three-point range during the regular season. He joined Neenah's Matt Heldt — a Marquette signee — De Pere's Brevin Pritzl and Stevens Point teammate Trevor Anderson as unanimous Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association first team all-state selections.

Hauser had nine other scholarship offers, including schools such as Virginia, Creighton, Iowa State, Green Bay and Northern Iowa, but was not offered by Wisconsin.
