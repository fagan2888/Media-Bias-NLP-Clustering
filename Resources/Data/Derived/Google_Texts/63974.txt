There may be no individual more interested to see how different the Nuggets will be after five months of moves than general manager Tim Connelly.

The Nuggets have been significantly remodeled in a number of areas — from an all-new coaching staff and the return of executive Pete D’Alessandro, to drafting lottery pick Emmanuel Mudiay and trading Ty Lawson, to a locker room full of players who are focused on the business at hand more than anything else.

So, what does it all mean?

That’s what training camp will answer for the Nuggets when the regular season starts Oct. 29.

“It’s certainly exciting,” Connelly said. “I think what’s neat is we’ve had a full gym for nearly a month, and it’s all guys who have been here voluntarily. It’s fun to see coach (Michael) Malone start to develop his philosophy with our guys and them getting a sense of him and his staff. And it’s certainly fun to see a lot of young guys who are going to get the opportunity to sink or swim. I think overall it’s just a real positive vibe, and I think there a sense of the unknown that, quite frankly, is exciting.”

The Nuggets open camp with 14 guaranteed contracts — one under the maximum number allowed by the NBA. The preseason figures to be heavy on establishing the foundation of work Malone demands of his players.

“I just like the fact that we have a fully committed locker room,” Connelly said. “I like the fact that we have a bunch of guys here that don’t just care about the team but care about the city. They’ve chosen to be here despite being coveted by other markets that might be painted bigger markets. We really have an all-in mentality. It’s evident when you walk in the gym. I know we have a group of guys that are really about the right things. It’ll be fun to see how that manifests itself when training camp begins.”
