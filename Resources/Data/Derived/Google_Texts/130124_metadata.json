And Colorado has chosen machine.\n\nTake a good look at the Class 5A brackets for boys and girls basketball. They are to be the last of their kind. Big-school postseason outlays in the future will be untouched by human hands.\n\nThe seeding committees for hoops have been deemed obsolete.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d said Bob Ottewill, former commissioner of the Colorado High School Activities Association and a regular member of the boys committee who donated his time to seed the field.\n\n\u201cWe had a dedicated group of people,\u201dsaid Rick Hergenreder, a retired teacher in Jefferson County who has been a part of the girls\u2019 side for all 13 years.\n\nBut they will be replaced by a formula punched into a computer. So instead of people named Bob and Rick, we will have RPI, an acronym for ratio percentage index, which will take one quarter of a team\u2019s record, add one half of its opponents\u2019 winning percentage and bring in one quarter of your opponents\u2019 winning percentage \u2026 or something like that.\n\nDon\u2019t know about you, but this switch alarms me for several reasons.\n\nFor one, the RPI, which will be used in team sports, including baseball this spring, is simply a flavor of the month. Look at local history. The NFL instituted a wild-card system. So did Colorado preps. The NCAA started using a seeding committee. So did Colorado preps. And the RPI took hold in college ranks. Sadly, so it will in Colorado preps. Betcha it will change again.\n\nFor another, officials conveniently will be able to hide behind RPI numbers once the first sets of playoff teams are set. Look at the numbers, they\u2019ll say, as opposed to taking responsibility.\n\nBut where the RPI will really leave a void is in asking and answering questions the seeding committee has been doing since its inception.\n\nFor example, the seeding committee can tell us if the Overland boys team has an inside game. The RPI can\u2019t.\n\nThe seeding committee isn\u2019t afraid to say athleticism doesn\u2019t bother the Eaglecrest boys team. The RPI won\u2019t.\n\nThe seeding committee knows whether the Highlands Ranch girls team\u2019s press will be a big bother to opponents. The RPI doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe seeding committee can give a sense about the upstart Greeley West boys team and whether it\u2019s for real. The RPI offers little clue.\n\nThe seeding committee, because its members have seen dozens of games, knows whether the Broomfield girls can run a delay game and whether the Grandview girls can convert free throws. The RPI provides no such indications.\n\nAnd the seeding committee can convey and take into account any team\u2019s problems, depth, injuries and coaching ability. The RPI? Nothing on the subjects.\n\nIn addition to driving thousands of miles, Ottewill also has learned in his years as a committee member that \u201cif a system doesn\u2019t weigh the end of the season more heavily than the beginning, that\u2019s a flaw.\u201d\n\nThe RPI doesn\u2019t.\n\nHergenreder insists he has heard from many of the coaches \u201cwho wish you guys were still there with your boots on the ground at the games. It\u2019s more important than numbers in a computer.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t always agree with the seeding committee, but I respected it because there was personal interest and pride.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to RPI, why don\u2019t we just get a Madden program, have local computer programmers provide team entries and watch all of it on our smartphones?\n\nSadly, the neurotic approach to Colorado prep playoffs lives.\n\nNeil H.
