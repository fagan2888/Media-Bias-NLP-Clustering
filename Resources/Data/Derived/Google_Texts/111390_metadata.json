Bernie Sanders have spent much of their time touring Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states with Democratic contests. But they\u2019ve also spent a considerable amount of time in Nevada and talking about Nevada-centric issues, including federal lands, immigration and the ongoing controversy over the future of solar in the state.\n\nSo which candidate better aligns with your views? To recap, here\u2019s where Clinton and Sanders stand on some of the most pressing issues facing Nevada and the nation, as well as a review of where you can see the candidates in the next couple of days and how to caucus.\n\nOn the economy\n\nThe most pressing issue for Nevadans headed into the caucuses is the economy, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll. Likely caucus goers are split on who would best handle that issue, with 48 percent saying Clinton would handle it better and 47 percent saying Sanders.\n\nSanders has proposed a 2.2 percent income-based tax on most households to help pay for his single-payer health care plan, in addition to progressive taxes on income in excess of $250,000. He also would implement a 6.2 percent employer tax, which some experts have projected would likely be passed on to workers.\n\nClinton proposes tax increases on the wealthy and corporations to pay for her programs, including a 4 percent surtax on income over $5 million.\n\nSanders also plans to increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2020, while Clinton supports a $12 an hour minimum wage.\n\nOn health care\n\nHealth care has been one of the biggest issues on which Clinton and Sanders have clashed in recent weeks.\n\nClinton is in favor of defending the Affordable Care Act while expanding coverage in certain areas. Sanders is in favor of replacing existing health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, with a broader, single-payer system that covers everybody.\n\nClinton says it would be infeasible to push Sanders' plan through a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n\u201cMy opponent wants us to start all over again, throw us into a contentious national debate,\u201d she said at a rally in Henderson on Saturday.\n\nBut many have called Clinton's criticism unfair, since a single-payer system could replace existing government health care programs all in one bill.\n\nSanders, at a rally Sunday in Las Vegas, praised the Affordable Care Act but emphasized the millions of Americans were still without health care insurance. \u201cI do believe health care is a right,\" Sanders said, \"not a privilege.\"\n\nOn immigration\n\nAlmost half of all undocumented immigrants in Clark County qualify for deportation relief under the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which both candidates support but which are now before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition to supporting comprehensive immigration reform, each candidate also has released detailed plans for handling immigration.\n\nClinton said she would end family detention and close private detention centers as well as defend the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which provide deportation relief for those covered by the Dream Act, as well as parents of Americans and other lawful residents. She has also said she would focus on deporting individuals who pose a threat to public safety.\n\n\u201cI strongly favor comprehensive reform with a path to citizenship, and that's what I would stand up for and fight for as president,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with the Sun in January.\n\nBoth candidates agree that immigrants should be able to receive coverage under the Affordable Care Act regardless of their immigration status.\n\nIn addition to supporting the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration, Sanders would allow all undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for at least five years to stay in the country without fear of being deported. Sanders also wants to end family detention and private detention centers and advocate for legislation that contains a road map to citizenship.\n\n\u201cHow many fields or factories are there where people without legal status are used up and thrown away?\u201d he said during a June appearance in Las Vegas. \u201cWe cannot continue to run an economy where millions are made so vulnerable because of their undocumented status. We have to ask ourselves who benefits from this exploitation.\u201d\n\nOn federal lands in Nevada\n\nBoth candidates support keeping Nevada\u2019s public lands \u2014 which comprise more than 80 percent of land in the state \u2014 in the hands of the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf all of the sudden tomorrow the federal government were to say to all the states where they own land, from the East Coast to the West Coast and Alaska, 'OK, you take care of it,' your state and local taxes would skyrocket, because trying to take care of this and manage it is a big, big proposition,\u201d Clinton said at a rally in Elko, according to the Elko Daily Free Press.\n\nSanders also has called for ending what he called \u201csweetheart mining concessions.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic lands should be managed for the benefit and enjoyment of all Americans, and not just the oil and gas, mining, and timber companies that have had disproportionate influence in management decisions on federal lands,\u201d Sanders told the Reno Gazette-Journal.\n\nOn the solar controversy in Nevada\n\nSanders has been focusing on Nevada's solar energy situation on recent trips to the state and even met with a group of laid-off solar workers over the weekend in Reno.\n\n\"It is beyond my comprehension what your Public Utility Commission did in Nevada. We should be expanding solar,\" he said at a Las Vegas rally on Sunday. \"If we invest properly in solar, we can lead the world in combating climate change.\"\n\nOn multiple occasions, Sanders has called the PUC's decision in December to increase bills for solar customers \u201cabsurd.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Sun, Clinton didn\u2019t directly condemn the commission, instead saying people shouldn\u2019t be penalized for investing in solar.\n\n\u201cI don't know all of the public utility rules in Nevada, but certainly people who acted in good faith should be given the benefit of that moving forward,\u201d Clinton said.\u201d I don't think any change in rules should penalize people who were permitted and encouraged to do what folks have done.\u201d\n\nAt her rallies, instead of going after the commission, Clinton has stressed the importance of job creation, particularly in such sectors as renewable energy. She also came out in favor of an amendment introduced into the Senate last week that would regulate rate changes for utility customers who get credits for generating excess electricity.\n\nOn online gaming\n\nBoth candidates have cited significant concerns about online gaming. In October, Nevada regulators banned daily fantasy sports sites.\n\n\u201cI do not think it would be appropriate for the federal government to legalize online gaming at a time when many states are clearly against it,\u201d Sanders told the Reno Gazette-Journal.\n\nThe candidates agree that if states are willing to take charge of regulating daily fantasy sports, the operations could generate extra revenue to fund or expand state government services. But they also urge caution in making sure that gaming is regulated to serve the best interests of residents and users.\n\nOn Yucca Mountain as a nuclear repository\n\nClinton and Sanders agree that Yucca Mountain should not be considered as a repository for nuclear waste.\n\nDuring her 2008 campaign for president, Clinton said Yucca Mountain would be \u201coff the table forever.\u201d She reiterated those views in a January interview with the Sun. \u201cYucca should be off the table because I think there are enough questions about its suitability as a site, and there is also such organized opposition to its use that it doesn't really make sense,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nInstead, she said there should be a \u201ccontinuing science-based effort\u201d to decide what to do with nuclear waste, adding that she was willing to talk with experts and community members about what the best solution should be.\n\nSanders pointed to questions over Yucca\u2019s geological stability as a reason for opposing the site. \"My own view at this point is that Yucca Mountain is not a good depository for nuclear waste,\u201d Sanders said in a December interview with KNPR.\n\nHe added that he was not a \u201cgreat fan\u201d of expanding nuclear power in general without having a clear plan of where nuclear waste should be stored. \u201cSo we have got to figure out how we get rid of nuclear waste and we have to figure out how we do it in a way that is safe,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nOn legalizing marijuana\n\nIn November, Nevadans will have a chance to join Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Alaska by voting to legalize marijuana. Both Clinton and Sanders support reclassifying marijuana \u2014 currently a Schedule I drug \u2014 at the federal level.\n\nClinton has said she would continue Obama's enforcement guidelines to allow states to determine their course of action in regulating marijuana, calling for more research into plant's medicinal uses.\n\n\u201cI think the states should be the laboratories of democracy on this,\u201d she told the Reno Gazette- Journal.\n\nSanders agreed, telling the paper that states should have \u201cthe ability to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana without interference from the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWhere you can see the candidates\n\nClinton and Sanders both will appear Thursday evening at a town hall meeting in Las Vegas. The town hall, sponsored by the state Democratic Party, is not open to members of the general public, but will be aired live on MSNBC in English and Telemundo in Spanish. Telemundo\u2019s Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart and Chuck Todd of NBC and MSNBC will host the event.\n\nAlso Thursday, Sanders will attend the Clark County Democratic Party\u2019s caucus kickoff dinner at the Tropicana. Tickets to the dinner are $125 and can be purchased online or at the door.\n\nClinton will attend two pre-caucus rallies, one at the Laborers International Union at 8:30 p.m. Thursday and another at the Clark County Government Center amphitheater at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Former President Bill Clinton and the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, will attend the second event.\n\nHillary Clinton also will attend a caucus day rally with her husband at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Caesars Palace.\n\nSanders will attend a town meeting at the Elko High School Old Gymnasium at 8 a.m. Friday. He will also attend a rally at the Sparks Nugget at 1 p.m. Friday, followed by a 4 p.m. rally at Henderson Pavillon. As of Wednesday afternoon, his campaign had not announced any caucus day events.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nHow to caucus\n\nCheck online at nvdems.com/caucus to find your caucus location. Show up at your caucus site at 11 a.m. Saturday. The caucus will start at 11:30 a.m., and you must be in line by noon to participate.\n\nAfter arriving at your caucus site, you will either sign in or register to vote if you are not a registered Democrat.
