They insisted that all 50 tons of supplies \u201creached friendly forces\u201d in Al-Hasakah province Sunday night.\n\nThis new alliance of Kurdish militia and Arab rebel groups were told by US officials they would also be supplied fresh weapons for an upcoming assault on ISIS in Raqqa. A spokesman for the Raqqa Revolutionaries Front, Abu Muazz, said, \u201cWe met the Americans and this has been approved and we have been told these new arms \u2026 are on their way.\u201d\n\nReuters was informed by a US military official that the Syrian Arab Coalition would push down towards Raqqa, keeping east of the Euphrates river.\n\nStaying east of the Euphrates is meant to ease the concerns of Turkey who does not want to see an expansion of Kurdish influence in the region.\n\nOf course, airdropping weapons to \u201cmoderate\u201d forces hasn\u2019t worked out for the US as of late. This avenue was already taken in Iraq where US weapons went missing last year. On Monday, the Pentagon acknowledged that Iraqi forces could have discovered a trove of US weapons and TOW II anti-tank missiles formerly in the possession of ISIS.\n\nIn Syria, Saudi Arabia and the United States provided the Free Syrian Army with TOW II anti-tank missiles. Unfortunately, these landed in the hands of ISIS in December of last year and on multiple occasions over the summer when they defeated the FSA in multiple battles. Al Qaeda has also benefited from US weapons, capturing some in March that were intended for the FSA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The US airdrops weapons to a new \"moderate\" coalition in Syria.
