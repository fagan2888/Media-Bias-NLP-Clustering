Marijuana must be legal in Washington because the folks at the Commerce Department have to be smoking a lot of it.

Commerce announced on Thursday that the nation’s third-quarter gross domestic product expanded by just a 1.5 percent annual rate.

That’s pathetic growth that won’t allow the US to create enough jobs for the number of people entering the workforce. It’s also less than half the second quarter’s growth.

But how Commerce got to that 1.5 percent number is truly amazing.

Of the 1.5 percent, 0.45 of a percentage point came from increased health care spending. In other words, mandatory ObamaCare payments caused about one-third of the third-quarter GDP growth.

Without that forced spending, GDP growth would have been just 1 percent annualized.

But that ain’t all.

Increases in durable-goods spending contributed 0.48 of a percentage point to that 1.5 percent GDP number. Without that increase — on products like cars, refrigerators and planes, which are long-lasting — annualized third-quarter GDP would have been just 1.02 percent.

Here’s the bizarre part: Sales of durable goods have been in a free fall.

The Census Bureau, part of Commerce, reported earlier this week that durable goods sales in September fell 1.2 percent, after a 3 percent decline in August.

The only other month in the third quarter is July. And durable goods sales rose 2 percent in that month.

But how does an increase of 2 percent (in July), a decline of 3 percent (in August) and a drop of 1.2 percent in September add up to durable goods contributing 0.48 of a percentage point to the third-quarter GDP?

I sent an inquiry to Commerce and hope it will shed light on this mystery.

And, remember, the GDP is one of the important figures the Federal Reserve will have to consider when it decides to raise rates. I hope Janet Yellen lights up a joint at the next meeting — it’s the only way these numbers will make sense.
