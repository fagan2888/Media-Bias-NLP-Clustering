Yum.\u201d\n\nThe sweet treat was one of myriad firsts during the Denver girl\u2019s introduction to the National Western.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d said mom Jessica Gilbert. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\nThe family was looking forward to making memories and checking out the rodeo.\n\nIsaiah Beck, 6, is more of a stock show pro.\n\nThe Arvada boy has spent most of his young existence longing for the cowboy life.\n\nIsaiah woke up extra early on Saturday, said dad Steven Beck, and donned full cowboy attire.\n\n\u201cMy favorite thing about the stock show is just about everything,\u201d Isaiah said.\n\nBeck has been hauling his son to the National Western for the past four years, so they could enjoy the food, the festivities and the family time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a tradition for us,\u201d Beck said, as the pair waited for the rodeo to begin in the Denver Coliseum.\n\nIn another arena, some polished and preened heifers before their hopeful handlers showed off to a panel of judges.\n\nSara Eeg of Greenbush, Minn., was snapping photos of her daughter Marin who was showing a red angus heifer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty new at it,\u201d Eeg said. \u201cI\u2019m probably more nervous than she is.\u201d\n\nMarin, who got her start in 4H, took first in her class and was named the grand champion in her division.\n\nAfter the show, the Eeg family was looking forward to exploring what the rest of the stock show had to offer.\n\nNearby, crowds of children flocked inside a white tent to watch a llama, donkey, miniature horse, baby goat and pig do tricks and eat treats.\n\n\u201cI liked when the little goat figured out a way to climb up on the donkey,\u201d said A.J. Gibson, 7. \u201cThat\u2019s why the stock show is cool. There are so many animals, and it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@ denverpost.com or @ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "First-timers eager to experience National Western Stock Show Saturday", "title": "First-timers eager to experience National Western Stock Show Saturday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/first-timers-eager-to-experience-national-western-stock-show-saturday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109_025854_stock-show-jan-8-2015.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160109_025854_stock-show-jan-8-2015.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T14:10:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:27:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "National Western Stock Show"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe54c5\"", "article_summary": "Yum.\u201dThe sweet treat was one of myriad firsts during the Denver girl\u2019s introduction to the National Western.\nAfter the show, the Eeg family was looking forward to exploring what the rest of the stock show had to offer.\nWhether a first-timer or a seasoned pro, most patrons saddling up to work and play on the opening day of the National Western Stock Show, Rodeo & Horse Show showed up with bells and boots on.\nBeck has been hauling his son to the National Western for the past four years, so they could enjoy the food, the festivities and the family time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a tradition for us,\u201d Beck said, as the pair waited for the rodeo to begin in the Denver Coliseum."}
