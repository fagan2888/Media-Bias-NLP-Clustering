That\u2019s the average length of time, according to the California Healthcare Foundation, that emergency room patients in this state must wait before being admitted to a hospital as an inpatient.\n\nOne of the promised benefits of the Affordable Care Act was that it would reduce such agonizingly long emergency room waits by expanding the federal-state Medicaid program \u2013 known in this state as MediCal \u2013 and providing the low-income uninsured access to primary care.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t turned out that way. A recent survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians suggests that President Obama\u2019s health care \u201creform\u201d actually has had a deleterious effect on the nation\u2019s emergency rooms.\n\nIndeed, nearly half of emergency physicians surveyed by ACEP reported a rise in ER visits since Jan. 1, when expanded Medicaid coverage under Obamacare took effect. More ER visits mean more crowded waiting rooms.\n\nDefenders of the Affordable Care Act suggest it is \u201ca work in progress,\u201d as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, described the law last month. They are persuaded that Obamacare\u2019s unintended consequences will be corrected, including, presumably, increasingly crowded emergency rooms.\n\nHowever, nearly nine of 10 surveyed emergency physicians expect emergency visits to further increase over the next three years. And more than three-quarters told ACEP that they fret their ERs are inadequately prepared for significant increases.\n\n\u201cMany physicians do not accept Medicaid patients,\u201d explained Dr. Alex Rosenau, ACEP president, \u201cbecause Medicaid pays so low.\u201d So, he said, \u201c[w]hen people can\u2019t get appointments with physicians, they will seek care in emergency departments.\u201d\n\nStates like California that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare saw the biggest increases in the volume of Medicaid emergency patients, according to ACEP. That\u2019s the last thing California needed, with the lowest number of emergency rooms per capita of all the states.\n\nDr. Rosenau\u2019s group urges Congress to hold hearings to address the unintended consequences Obamacare has had on the nation\u2019s emergency rooms. We\u2019d certainly like to hear how Rep. Pelosi would ease overcrowding and shorten wait times.\n\nContact the writer:", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Editorial: Obamacare boosts ER patients, wait times   | emergency, medicaid, physicians, rooms, obamacare, care, patients, acep, visits, california", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Five hours, 26 minutes.
