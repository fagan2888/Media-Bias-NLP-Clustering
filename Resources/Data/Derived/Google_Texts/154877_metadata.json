But some revenues can be exempt from those limits if they are used for a specific purpose and get less then 10 percent of their revenues from tax dollars. Most universities, for example, are considered standalone enterprises, something TABOR allows, and aren\u2019t subject to its revenue limits.\n\nThe proposal to take the provider fee out from under TABOR would work just like that. It would make the Hospital Provider Fee Fund its own enterprise, which would have the effect of taking that money \u2014 about $535 million last year, and $688 million this year \u2014 out from under the TABOR revenue cap, freeing up an equal amount of money to be used for other services, such as transportation and education.\n\nBut lowering that amount also would cut into any TABOR refunds, which are projected to be about $352 million by the 2017-18 fiscal year.\n\nSource: Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing and the Colorado Hospital Association", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - The Hospital Provider Fee was created by an act of the Colorado Legislature in 2009 to help provide health care to those who can\u2019t", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - The Hospital Provider Fee was created by an act of the Colorado Legislature in 2009 to help provide health care to those who can\u2019t", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/explaining-the-hospital-provider-fee-proposal/", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-02T02:32:43-0600", "DC.creator": "Staff", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "keywords": "Grand Junction Colorado breaking news photography business events sports high school real estate", "DC.date.created": "2015-10-04T05:34:00-0600", "DC.subject": "Grand Junction Colorado breaking news photography business events sports high school real estate", "DC.date.modified": "2015-10-06T11:40:00-0600", "DC.title": "Explaining the Hospital Provider Fee proposal  |  GJSentinel.com"}, "article_summary": "Explaining the Hospital Provider Fee proposalQUICKREAD INSIDE \u25a0 Evolution of the state\u2019s current tax constraints, 7A \u25a0 Explaining the Hospital Provider Fee proposal, 7A \u25a0 TABOR plans for years of taxpayer refunds, 7A \u25a0 See where the money goes, where the money comes from, 8AThe Hospital Provider Fee was created by an act of the Colorado Legislature in 2009 to help provide health care to those who can\u2019t afford their own medical coverage and were not already qualified for Medicaid.\nThe proposal to take the provider fee out from under TABOR would work just like that.\nSource: Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing and the Colorado Hospital Association\nSince it was enacted, more than 300,000 Coloradans who couldn\u2019t afford health care now have coverage either through Medicaid or the state\u2019s Child Health Plan Plus.\nThe Legislature uses the fee to maximize how much it gets from the federal government to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act."}
