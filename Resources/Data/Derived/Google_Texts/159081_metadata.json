Connecticut's exchange reached its target goal for enrollments in private plans four months before the close of open enrollment, and was among the top seven states in the nation when it came to signing up residents believed to be eligible for the insurance.\n\nThis success prompted Counihan to offer up the state's expertise and its technology to other states for a fee.\n\nConnecticut's success also drew the attention of the Obama administration, which several months ago announced plans to appoint, for the first time, a dedicated CEO for HealthCare.gov.

Those states are Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire and West Virginia.\n\n\"There are a number of states that ... want to run their own exchange, but who for a variety of reasons couldn't get their act together in the first year,\" Levitt said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Nearly 20 percent of all U.S. states are eyeing the possibility of adopting technology from Connecticut's lauded health insurance marketplace.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Counihan, nine states, adopt technology, mulling, levitt", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Nearly 20 percent of all U.S. states are eyeing the possibility of adopting technology from Connecticut's lauded health insurance marketplace.", "title": "Nine states mulling Connecticut's Obamcare fix", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/27/nine-states-considering-connecticuts-obamacare-fix.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/26/101948152-172823585.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly 20 percent of all U.S. states are eyeing the possibility of adopting technology from Connecticut's lauded health insurance marketplace.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/27/nine-states-considering-connecticuts-obamacare-fix.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/26/101948152-172823585.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Nine states considering Connecticut's Obamacare fix", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Obamacare, Obamacare, Health Care, US: News, Politics, Street Signs, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-08-27T16:39:05-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T16:39:41-0400", "tag": "Street Signs"}, "pageNodeId": 101951669, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b73\"", "article_summary": "This success prompted Counihan to offer up the state's expertise and its technology to other states for a fee.\n\"Nine states have contacted Connecticut's exchange about implementing its technology,\" it read.\nCounihan, at that same time, told CNBC that his exchange was in talks with four more states about them using Connecticut's model.\nObamacare contractor subpoenaedMaryland, whose own exchange had been a disaster, in April said it would use Connecticut's software for enrollment for the 2015 season.\nThe first CEO of Obamacare Kevin Counihan discusses his new job to run Healthcare.gov, and what he learned from the private sector."}
