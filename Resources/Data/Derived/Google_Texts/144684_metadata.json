Denver boasted entertainment value, a must-watch every time Peyton Manning took a shotgun snap and aim at the record book.\n\nThe Broncos coasted into the playoffs and exited on the fumes of anger. The disappointment, most notably a Super Bowl ear-boxing by the Seattle Seahawks, stung. The embarrassment of last season\u2019s final game \u2014 a home loss to the Indianapolis Colts \u2014 inspired change.\n\nThe Broncos enter the final quarter of this season on the defensive. The rope-a-dope is over. Denver now squares off and delights in punching opponents in the face.\n\n\u201cWe are the best,\u201d strong safety T.J. Ward said. \u201cI said it in August because I believed it. If we didn\u2019t believe it, it wouldn\u2019t be a reality now.\u201d\n\nWith everything within grasp \u2014 another AFC West crown, homefield advantage throughout the playoffs \u2014 the Broncos\u2019 defense ranks near the top in every meaningful category. In 24 years as a coordinator, Wade Phillips has guided 11 top-10 defenses in yards allowed and eight in points allowed. He has never had a unit finish first in both categories.\n\nThat could change this season. The Broncos rank second in points yielded per game at 17.5. No team allows fewer yards than Denver\u2019s 284.7.\n\nLast season, the Broncos stopped the run better than any time in franchise history. Yet, a missing ingredient sabotaged the defense. The Broncos couldn\u2019t turn opponents over with any regularity. Denver recovered seven fumbles, compared with a league-best 12 this season. They sit two takeaways shy of last season\u2019s 25 and, with four games remaining, have already matched the 41 sacks.\n\nWhat makes this swarming 3-4 defense unique goes beyond statistics. The players believe they can win on their own. They want the outcome in their hands, defined by stops not talk.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be great, you can\u2019t be good, if you don\u2019t produce turnovers,\u201d said defensive end DeMarcus Ware, who returns Sunday after a four-game injury absence. \u201cThe mentality is different. And the comfort level in this scheme. Sometimes you think, \u2018I can\u2019t do this or that.\u2019 This year, there\u2019s nothing we don\u2019t think we can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nEach week, Phillips introduces statistical benchmarks for the game. The message? If you win these battles, the team triumphs. That\u2019s all that matters to Phillips. He calls statistics indicators of consistency.\n\n\u201cThey are important,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut can you play well enough when it matters most?\u201d\n\nThis season\u2019s defense allows third-down conversions at a 33 percent clip, fourth-best overall. Denver has five games with at least three takeways and is 5-0 when delivering a defensive touchdown.\n\n\u201cI have never been on a defense that not only can score, but thinks it\u2019s going to score. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \u201cEvery possession, we believe we can create a turnover. It\u2019s totally different than last year. You can see that in how we play.\u201d\n\nTrust was lacking last season in crucial times. With new faces sprinkled throughout, it took months for the defense to coalesce. Yet, in the biggest game \u2014 against the Colts \u2014 production and fire vanished. Only safety Darian Stewart joined the starting lineup this season. The nip and tuck feels like a face-lift. Cornerback Aqib Talib explained.\n\n\u201cWe hold each other accountable. It sounds simple, but it is unusual in the pros,\u201d Talib said. \u201cIf I am sleeping in a meeting for a second, I expect Chris (Harris) to tell me to wake the (bleep) up. A lot of teams don\u2019t do that. We hold each other accountable in meetings, practice, to know everything. No excuses.\u201d\n\nThe ownership started organically, making it authentic. It started in minicamps, bled over into training camp. Players learned not only their role, but also the role of their teammates.\n\n\u201cWhen we see something out of order, it\u2019s really easy to fix it,\u201d said outside linebacker Von Miller.\n\nPhillips\u2019 arrival fit perfectly for a defense that wanted to shed its robotic nature, wanted to attack and ask questions later.\n\nRing of Fame linebacker Tom Jackson, a charter member of the Orange Crush 1977 defense, sees it with every breathtaking play.\n\n\u201cThey have a couple of natural ingredients \u2014 great speed, athleticism \u2014 and they have great want-to,\u201d Jackson said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s a mind-set, where you believe that you need to win the game. If you have it as a constant mind-set, which I believe that they do, the attitude on the field takes care of itself. And anyone watching them can see the effort and swarming the football. For years I\u2019ve watched, and the defense has kind of been the supporting cast for an offense that put up, with Peyton, 30-plus points a game. And so you begin to think that you\u2019re going to get that all the time and you\u2019re just not thinking in terms of winning the game. You\u2019re the supporting cast. I think that this defense now thinks it\u2019s in the starring role and that it\u2019s their responsibility.\u201d\n\nPhillips devises schemes that empower players. The Broncos are built, in many ways, back to front. Talib and Harris excel in man coverage. Harris has not allowed a touchdown since 2013. Talib is a shutdown corner. And Stewart has changed the safety dynamic, pairing with Ward, who could return next week from an ankle injury, giving the Broncos two thumpers.\n\nDenver ranks first in passing yards allowed per game (195.6) and hasn\u2019t permitted a 300-yard game.\n\nThe Broncos spent the week before the San Diego game focusing on red-zone defense to lock down tight end Antonio Gates, and the Chargers never ran a single play inside the Broncos\u2019 20-yard line.\n\n\u201cWe have been in that conversation as the league\u2019s best for a while,\u201d defensive end Antonio Smith said. \u201cWe fell off a couple of weeks and messed up our numbers. For a minute, our numbers were so far past anybody that we had to have a couple of bad games for teams to even catch up. Winning is always the No. 1 goal. But when we are on the field, we are thinking about one thing: dominating.\u201d\n\nThe truth, revealing itself for weeks, became clear when Brock Osweiler took over at Chicago. If the Broncos don\u2019t turn the ball over and win the field-position game, they are difficult to beat. Opponents own 14 drives of 10-plus plays against the Broncos and have scored only two touchdowns on those possessions.\n\nThere will never be another Orange Crush. This season\u2019s defense can go down among the franchise\u2019s elite \u2014 \u201cWe have to ball in the playoffs to be remembered,\u201d Harris says \u2014 and carve out its own historical niche.\n\n\u201cWe tried to do it last year, to be the best in the league. We didn\u2019t accomplish it, obviously,\u201d Ware said. \u201cIt\u2019s there for us. We want it. It\u2019s time to go get it.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
