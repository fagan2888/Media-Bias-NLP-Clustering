In response, Republicans called for switching to the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov website, while DFLers called for dumping MNsure\u2019s outside board and making the exchange more of a traditional state agency.\n\nLynn Blewett, a University of Minnesota health policy professor who is chair of the subcommittee, said the numbers presented Friday didn\u2019t tally the cost of making MNsure\u2019s IT system fully functional. So, the analysis doesn\u2019t point to any clear answer, Blewett said, about whether the state should stay the course, switch to HealthCare.gov or adopt the hybrid approach.\n\n\u201cPeople want to know can we fix MNsure \u2026 in a reasonable amount of time, at a reasonable cost?\u201d she said following the meeting in St. Paul.\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange two years ago to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. MNsure was plagued by a balky website and overwhelmed call center in its first year of operations, but has seen subsequent improvements.\n\nFor health insurers who sell policies through it, MNsure\u2019s IT system is harder to work with than the system at HealthCare.gov, said Dannette Coleman, a senior vice president with Minnetonka-based Medica and member of the subcommittee.\n\nThe troubles for health insurers translate into problems for consumers, too, Coleman said.\n\nMedica sells policies to individuals through MNsure, as well as through HealthCare.gov to shoppers in Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cThe technology is much simpler with the [federal exchange],\u201d Coleman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked about what is the cost of switching, but what additional investment are you still having to make?\u201d\n\nThe DHS analysis assumed the earliest the state could move to HealthCare.gov is 2018, since a one-year advance notice is required.\n\nThe switch would involve just the portion of MNsure that individuals and families use to purchase private coverage; the portion for enrolling in public health insurance programs would still be operated by the state.\n\nThe analysis assumed that by using the federal exchange, the state would lose federal funding for continued improvements to the public program part of MNsure, said Chuck Johnson, the DHS deputy commissioner.\n\nMoving to a state-supported marketplace would cost more than a move to HealthCare.gov, Johnson said, because Minnesota would need to cover about $1.7 million for certain consumer assistance and plan management responsibilities.\n\nSen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, asked whether moving to HealthCare.gov might free-up IT resources so the state could make quicker fixes to the portion of MNsure for public programs. County workers continue to struggle with using MNsure for people near or below the poverty line who qualify for Medical Assistance.\n\nJohnson said it\u2019s not clear if there would be an advantage, because moving to HealthCare.gov would require the state to invest IT resources in making a connection with the new system.\n\nAnother wrinkle, he said, is that it\u2019s still not clear when HealthCare.gov might be able to accommodate people who qualify for MinnesotaCare, which provides coverage for the working poor. HealthCare.gov directs people at those income levels into the market for private insurance policies, Johnson said.\n\nSen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, said \u201cit would be a real gamble, at best,\u201d to think HealthCare.gov would be ready by 2018 to work with the MinnesotaCare program.\n\nThe subcommittee has not yet developed a recommendation on the future of MNsure. When it does, the matter goes to the full task force, which is scheduled to make a recommendation to the Legislature by Jan. 15.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s meeting, Benson said she thought HealthCare.gov was looking like a less attractive option, although she said more information is needed to fully evaluate it.\n\n\u201cHowever, I would like to consider the third option,\u201d Benson added, \u201cof having a private stand-alone entity\u201d handle the private insurance portion of MNsure.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Switching from MNsure to the federal government&rsquo;s health insurance exchange would cost the state an extra $5.", "title": "Switch to federal insurance exchange would cost Minnesota an extra $5.1 million, panel is told", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/switch-to-federal-insurance-exchange-would-cost-minnesota-an-extra-5-1-million-panel-is-told/360643831/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Switching from MNsure to the federal government&rsquo;s health insurance exchange would cost the state an extra $5.", "title": "Switch to federal insurance exchange would cost Minnesota an extra $5.1 million, panel is told", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/switch-to-federal-insurance-exchange-would-cost-minnesota-an-extra-5-1-million-panel-is-told/360643831/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Switching from MNsure to the federal government&rsquo;s health insurance exchange would cost the state an extra $5."}, "article_summary": "Switching from MNsure to the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange would cost the state an extra $5.1 million over a one-year period, according to an analysis presented Friday.\n\u201cThe technology is much simpler with the [federal exchange],\u201d Coleman said.\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange two years ago to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\n\u201cHowever, I would like to consider the third option,\u201d Benson added, \u201cof having a private stand-alone entity\u201d handle the private insurance portion of MNsure.\nHealthCare.gov directs people at those income levels into the market for private insurance policies, Johnson said."}
