So it's worth looking into your options.\n\nAs you might have heard, one thing will remain the same: For the third year in a row, Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles will not rise. But for some people, any premium at all amounts to money they'd rather not spend. That's the attraction behind for-profit insurers' Medicare Advantage plans \u2014 which you can opt for instead of traditional Medicare Parts B and D.\n\nThe reason there's often no charge for these plans is that instead of paying for your out-of-hospital medical expenses and prescription drugs directly, the government gives a chunk of money to the Medicare Advantage plan to cover your care. Any part of that chunk they don't spend on you, they get to keep.\n\nSo if you have no money to spare for the premium, and you don't think you'll need a full array of medical services, this could be a good deal. Taggart Smith, who leads a Medicare counseling program in Sarasota, says this description doesn't apply to many beneficiaries.\n\n\"Really, unless people are really poor and in excellent health, we always recommend original Medicare with the Medigap plan\" instead of Medicare Advantage, she says.\n\nSmith is the Sarasota leader for SHINE \u2014 Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders \u2014 offered through the state Department of Elder Affairs. SHINE counselors are trained and sponsored by the government to give free, unbiased information.\n\n\"Counselors are volunteers, not insurance agents, nor do we recommend insurance companies to beneficiaries,\" Smith emphasizes. \"We empower people to make their own decisions about health care insurance coverage.\"\n\nOne advantage of sitting down with SHINE counselors is that they have special access on the Medicare help line, without having to wait. But Smith says the key to calling from home is to pick the right time.\n\n\"It's a 24/7 service,\" she says, \"but people tend to think it's a 9-to-5 operation and that's when everybody calls. If you try calling late at night, the Medicare representatives get downright chatty.\"\n\nHere are SHINE open enrollment events in the area:\n\nSarasota County:\n\n10 a.m.-3 p.m. Oct. 17, Senior Friendship Center, 1888 Brother Geenan Way, Sarasota\n\n10 a.m.-3 p.m. Oct. 22, Sarasota Memorial east campus, 5880 Rand Blvd., Sarasota\n\n10 a.m.-3 p.m. Oct. 23, North Port Library, 13800 S.
