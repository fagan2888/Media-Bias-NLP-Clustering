Even so, this remains an issue that must be resolved at the state level.\n\nState lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to change the 2005 law blamed for creating an overly litigious environment around construction defects claims and thus resulting in a dearth of new, affordable condos or townhomes.\n\nIn the past, this had been a fight between attorneys and builders. Increasingly, Front Range cities have joined the battle out of concern over the lack of condos being built.\n\nThe most recent figures show condos represented only 4.6 percent of the total new home starts in metro Denver, compared to 26 percent in 2008.\n\nCondominiums are an important piece of the housing picture \u2014 often affordable homes that appeal to first-time home-buyers and empty-nesters. Cities hope to add more condos around transit stops instead of apartments, believing that giving people a sense of ownership will encourage more stable, lasting communities.\n\nThis year, Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, D-Westminster, sponsored legislation to push more condo construction disputes into arbitration and lower insurance premiums. But the bills failed over concerns of weakening consumer protection.\n\nNo one wants homeowners saddled with poorly constructed condos without redress. But the current law is skewed in favor of litigation as the way to resolve the conflicts.\n\nLakewood took the right approach, and the state should consider similar legislation.\n\nState law as it exists now allows a majority of a homeowners association board \u2014 not homeowners themselves \u2014 to approve litigation against a builder. The problem is, once a lawsuit is filed, homeowners often have trouble selling or refinancing units.\n\nLakewood\u2019s ordinance gives developers and builders a \u201cright to repair\u201d before facing litigation and requires condominium boards to get consent from a majority of homeowners before filing suit.\n\nIt is yet to be seen whether construction will now flourish in Lakewood or even whether the city\u2019s home rule status legally allows it to override state law.\n\nYet, the Lakewood\u2019s ordinance comes at the right time.\n\nMillennials are flocking to Denver, interest rates are low and the area\u2019s economy is doing better than other cities.\n\nPeople want to buy condos but there is no supply. The state legislature needs to follow Lakewood\u2019s lead.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "State must fix rules on Colorado condo construction", "title": "State must fix rules on Colorado condo construction", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/24/state-must-fix-rules-on-colorado-condo-construction/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141024__20141027_Z00_OP27E_CONSTRUCTIONDEFECTSp1-1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141024__20141027_Z00_OP27E_CONSTRUCTIONDEFECTSp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-24T18:36:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T00:15:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12c5\"", "article_summary": "State law as it exists now allows a majority of a homeowners association board \u2014 not homeowners themselves \u2014 to approve litigation against a builder.\nIt is yet to be seen whether construction will now flourish in Lakewood or even whether the city\u2019s home rule status legally allows it to override state law.\nThis year, Sen.
