He actually believes that states will \u201cdesign and fund creative initiatives\u201d to address inequality.\n\n\u201cWashington continues to rule over the world of anti-poverty policy-making, with beltway bureaucrats picking and choosing rigid nationwide programs and forcing America\u2019s elected state legislatures to watch from the sidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cAs someone who served nine years in the state house, two of them as Speaker, I know how frustrating this is.\u201d\n\n\n\nDo-nothing legislators in states like Mr. Rubio\u2019s Florida feel frustrated precisely because most federal safety-net programs are designed to limit the ability of states to refuse to help their less fortunate residents. As Lyndon Johnson knew from personal experience in 1964, when he began the War on Poverty, states could not be trusted to properly address the poverty in their midst. Or, to put it another way, certain states could be trusted to yell and scream and fight to the end for their right to do as little as possible.\n\nOne of the great achievements of the War on Poverty programs was to extend the safety net to the South, where white legislators saw little reason to spend taxpayer dollars on the basic needs of poor citizens, most of whom were black. Southern lawmakers in Congress fought for the right of governors to veto grants made possible by the Economic Opportunity Act, one of the centerpieces of the War on Poverty, and Southern governors exercised those vetoes repeatedly. But Sargent Shriver, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, overrode those vetoes, bypassing the governors and sending anti-poverty money directly to the local agencies and community groups that could do some good with it.\n\nIf you think those days of recalcitrance are over, take a look at the map of the states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The list of 25 includes every one of the states that seceded from the union, with the exception of Arkansas, which is doing only a partial expansion. (Virginia is likely to accept the expansion after its newly elected Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, takes office later this week.)\n\nBut long before \u201cObamacare\u201d became a curse word among Republicans, most of those same states were already stingy with their spending on Medicaid, which lets states determine who is eligible for the program. The 16 states that restricted Medicaid to those making half or less of the federal poverty line included the usual cast of characters: Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. The most generous states \u2014 giving Medicaid benefits to those at the poverty line or higher \u2014 were clustered in the Northeast and the upper Midwest, along with California.\n\nThat\u2019s undoubtedly fine with Mr. Rubio and other Republicans who see nothing wrong with a country that is a patchwork of generosity and indifference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong for Washington to tell Tallahassee what programs are right for the people of Florida,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cBut it\u2019s particularly wrong for it to say that what\u2019s right for Tallahassee is the same thing that\u2019s right for Topeka and Sacramento and Detroit and Manhattan and every other town, city and state in the country.\u201d\n\nThat battle, though, was fought and lost by Southerners 50 years ago, just as they lost a far bloodier states\u2019 rights battle a century earlier. The country long ago came to the conclusion that economic rights, just like voting rights and criminal rights, had to be uniform. As much as it might frustrate Mr. Rubio, people should not be made to suffer just because they were born in an uncaring state.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140109160552, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Rubio, Marco", "keywords": "Rubio Marco,Poverty,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Rubio Demands States' Right to Ignore the Poor ( 20140109 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "David Firestone", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "David Firestone", "byl": "David Firestone", "twitter": {"description": "The senator\u2019s plan to alleviate poverty is remarkably retrograde.", "creator": "@fstonenyt", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/rubio-demands-states-right-to-ignore-the-poor/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "title": "Rubio Demands States' Right to Ignore the Poor", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002641569, "description": "The senator\u2019s plan to alleviate poverty is remarkably retrograde.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 9, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1389301552, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-09T21:05:52-05:00"}, "utime": 20140109210552, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140109, "pdate": 20140109, "des": "Poverty", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "The senator\u2019s plan to alleviate poverty is remarkably retrograde.", "title": "Rubio Demands States' Right to Ignore the Poor", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/rubio-demands-states-right-to-ignore-the-poor/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/rubio-demands-states-right-to-ignore-the-poor/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Rubio Demands States' Right to Ignore the Poor", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 9, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda751\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s wrong for Washington to tell Tallahassee what programs are right for the people of Florida,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.\nAs Lyndon Johnson knew from personal experience in 1964, when he began the War on Poverty, states could not be trusted to properly address the poverty in their midst.\nAs much as it might frustrate Mr. Rubio, people should not be made to suffer just because they were born in an uncaring state.\nThat\u2019s undoubtedly fine with Mr. Rubio and other Republicans who see nothing wrong with a country that is a patchwork of generosity and indifference.\nThe country long ago came to the conclusion that economic rights, just like voting rights and criminal rights, had to be uniform."}
