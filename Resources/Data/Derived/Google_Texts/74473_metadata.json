(Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nAs the Republican presidential race officially dwindles to only Donald Trump, we say farewell to the only man who was standing in his way, Ted Cruz. (Sorry, John Kasich.)\n\nEven on his last day on the campaign trail, Cruz held steady with his use of random pop culture references and impersonations. Here are a few examples you can find in the video above.\n\n\u201cBack to the Future Part II\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Cruz said the aggressive villain Biff Tannen was based on Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d\n\nHe impersonated several characters from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a Buzzfeed video in June, seemingly trying to connect with younger voters. Most notably, he attempted Mr. Burns\u2019s infamous \u201cexcellent,\u201d complete with hand motions.\n\n\u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d\n\nAfter an impromptu reenactment of Billy Crystal\u2019s \u201cmostly dead\u201d scene in November, Cruz would occasionally do an encore performance when asked.\n\n\u201cStar Wars\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret how much Cruz loves all the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies. He first referenced them during his 2013 Senate filibuster of Obamacare and even did an impression of Yoda ahead of the \u201cForce Awakens\u201d premiere.\n\n\u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d\n\nCruz also mentioned this TV show during his 2013 filibuster, joking that President Obama probably thought a show about a \u201cSouthern, God-fearing family of entrepreneurs who love to hunt\u201d was a \u201chorror film.\u201d This reference eventually paid off for Cruz when members of the \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d family appeared in one of his campaign ads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He even impersonated Yoda.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He even impersonated Yoda.", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s weirdest pop culture references, from \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to \u2018The Simpsons\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/05/04/ted-cruzs-weirdest-pop-culture-references-from-star-wars-to-the-simpsons/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2016/05/tedcruzyoda.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nickidems"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/05/04/ted-cruzs-weirdest-pop-culture-references-from-star-wars-to-the-simpsons/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ted cruz, ted cruz president, donald trump president, princess bride, star wars, back to the future, simpsons", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, ted cruz president, donald trump president, princess bride, star wars, back to the future, simpsons"}, "article_summary": "Even on his last day on the campaign trail, Cruz held steady with his use of random pop culture references and impersonations.\nAs the 2016 campaign bids farewell to Ted Cruz, here's a look back on some of his pop culture references and impressions, which always seemed to surprise the people around him.\n(Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)As the Republican presidential race officially dwindles to only Donald Trump, we say farewell to the only man who was standing in his way, Ted Cruz.\n\u201cStar Wars\u201dIt\u2019s no secret how much Cruz loves all the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies.\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201dHe impersonated several characters from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a Buzzfeed video in June, seemingly trying to connect with younger voters."}
