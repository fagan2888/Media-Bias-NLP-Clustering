Mitch McConnell. Our goal, House counterpart Kevin McCarthy said, is to \u201cmake the government function again.\u201d\n\nSpeaker John Boehner\u2019s abrupt decision to resign exemplifies the extent to which predictable divisions within those majorities have undercut reaching that goal. More important, it reflects a similar split within the larger Republican electorate that could jeopardize the GOP\u2019s chances in 2016 by raising questions about the party\u2019s readiness to govern.\n\nBoehner tired of non-ending efforts to reconcile the traditional conservatives like himself with the tea party activists demanding a more aggressive approach. The activists are quite willing to shut down the federal government to achieve their goals \u2014 this year, to block funds for Planned Parenthood health programs and two years ago to kill Obamacare.\n\nThe extent to which these Capitol Hill divisions reflect the overall GOP was illustrated by the way Republican presidential hopefuls echoed them in reacting to Boehner\u2019s departure. Establishment conservatives praised Boehner and expressed regret. These included former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\n\u201cHe leaves a legacy of unparalleled integrity and steady, mature leadership during difficult times that will be a model for future House speakers and anyone interested in public service,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nBy contrast, the majority of the GOP field hailed the speaker\u2019s departure. These included everyone from poll-leading outsiders like Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina to struggling insurgents such as Sen. Ted Cruz and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nTrump called Boehner\u2019s departure \u201cwonderful,\u201d complaining that the speaker was \u201cnot conservative enough.\u201d Jindal trumped him by exulting, \u201cThat\u2019s one down, 434 more to go before we are done\u201d and tweeting, \u201cIt\u2019s time to fire everybody in Washington, D.C.\u201d Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has sought to straddle the GOP divide, said it underscored his theme that \u201cthe time has come to turn a new page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country.\u201d\n\nTheir comments reflected the extent to which Republicans want officials to stand up for their principles rather than seek compromise. That contrast has increased the influence of those who came to Washington to reduce the role of government \u2014 which they regard as a negative force \u2014 rather than to form positive coalitions toward conservative goals.\n\nIt\u2019s really a rejection of the governing philosophy of the GOP\u2019s most revered modern leader, President Ronald Reagan, who believed, \u201cAn 80 percent friend is not a 20 percent enemy\u201d and was always willing to cut a deal achieving most of his goal.\n\nMore important, all evidence is that an all-or-nothing approach is both impossible to achieve in a politically divided government and likely to prove politically hazardous. If that sort of candidate wins the GOP nomination, it could damage Republican chances next year.\n\nNon-Republican voters favor more bipartisan cooperation, and the political situation awaiting the next president will demand it. Republicans are likely to control the next House, but Democrats will almost certainly have enough strength to prevent a GOP Senate majority from mustering the 60 votes needed to pass a partisan agenda.\n\nSo, the only way the next president can get anything done will be across party lines, something that\u2019s anathema to the GOP tea party wing and its adherents.\n\nTo be fair, the Democratic race mirrors the GOP\u2019s internal party divisions, with more liberal elements backing Bernie Sanders and the centrist establishment supporting Hillary Clinton (and, potentially, Vice President Joe Biden).\n\nBut their contest lacks the nastiness that has marked some Republican rhetoric, and both Clinton and Sanders tout their ability to work across lines, something Republicans other than Kasich rarely mention.\n\n\u201cEverything is going to have to be some sort of compromise,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a prominent House GOP pragmatist, said on Fox News Sunday. While he referred to current battles, his words spoke a reality that far too few Republican presidential combatants have been willing to recognize.\n\nCarl P.
