According to the hospital\u2019s website, it is the region\u2019s only tertiary care center and Level 1 Trauma Center.\n\nBy and large, Stony Brook accepts Medicare and Medicaid along with other commercial plans.\n\nThe problem is not localized to Long Island; Westchester Medical Center, located in Valhalla, New York, is another academic medical center that is not taking any exchange plans for the same reasons.\n\nThe CEO of Stony Brook, Dr. Reuven Pasternak, said that the rates being offered are \u201cbelow Medicare and approaching Medicaid.\u201d\n\nBy and large, Stony Brook accepts Medicare and Medicaid along with other commercial plans according to Gary Bie, the hospital\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nCurrently, the hospital is negotiating rates for six plans on the health exchange. They\u2019ve also been negotiating with insurers of patients who are in need Stony Brooks\u2019 standard of care.\n\nOne of those patients includes Kerry Wozny, 45, of Wading River. Kerry is an expecting mother who has been under the care of Stony Brook for a high-risk pregnancy. While under Stony Brook\u2019s care, she found out that the hospital would not take their New York health plan.\n\nAnother incident occurred last week when patients outside Stony Brook\u2019s cancer center saw a sign that read, \"Stony Brook Medicine and The Stony Brook Cancer Center are not participating providers for the new Obama care health insurance plans. In addition, the new plans do not have any out of network coverage.\"\n\nAnn Marie DiStefano, 57, a tonsil cancer patient from Middle Island, had a similar experience after she learned that Empire\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield would not be accepted at Stony Brook.\n\nStony Brook offered her financial assistance, but instead, she decided to cancel her Empire plan and pay $225 more a month for plan that Stony Brook would accept.\n\nShe explained that Stony Brook was \u201cmore helpful\u201d than many hospitals because they at least offered her an alternative. However, she was dismayed that her Empire plan wouldn\u2019t cove her life-threatening situation.\n\n\u201cThis was the most awful experience ever,\u201d she said.\n\nAt this time, the State Department of Health is not negotiating contracts between providers and health plans.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter @SteveLarson", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5420/Hospital.jpg", "description": "Obamacare plans are reimbursing  less than Medicare and are approaching Medicaid.", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "Obamacare plans are reimbursing  less than Medicare and are approaching Medicaid.", "title": "University hospital shuns Obamacare", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5420", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5420/Hospital.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5420/Hospital.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",NewYork,Stony Brook University,Obamacare,Affordable Care Act, Steve Larson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "description": "Obamacare plans are reimbursing  less than Medicare and are approaching Medicaid."}, "twitter": {"description": "University hospital shuns Obamacare", "card": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5420/Hospital.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8ae\"", "article_summary": "Stony Brook University Hospital is rejecting eight health insurance plans offered in the county from New York\u2019s health insurance exchange because reimbursement rates are too low.\nStony Brook offered her financial assistance, but instead, she decided to cancel her Empire plan and pay $225 more a month for plan that Stony Brook would accept.\nAt this time, the State Department of Health is not negotiating contracts between providers and health plans.\nWhile under Stony Brook\u2019s care, she found out that the hospital would not take their New York health plan.\nAccording to the hospital\u2019s website, it is the region\u2019s only tertiary care center and Level 1 Trauma Center."}
