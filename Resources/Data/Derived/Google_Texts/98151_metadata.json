The mother hadn't known she was actually pregnant with twins. However, she was instructed to take two abortion pills to clear her uterus after the miscarriage of what she (and doctors) thought was one child. A pregnancy test later, doctors found Megan.\n\nPhoto courtesy of LordSpoda/YouTube. LordSpoda/YouTube\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, Megan \u2014 born on February 25 \u2014 weighed just under 6 pounds and became a little sister to Mya, 4, and Noah, 2, after miraculously surviving the twin miscarriage and the abortion. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Hui told the Mirror. \u201cNeither could the doctors. But as happy as I was, I was angry they had missed her on the scans.\u201d\n\nHui was asked to take a pregnancy test, which would reveal whether any harmful clots remained in the womb after taking the abortion pill. It was only after the pregnancy test came back positive that the mother of two was sent to the hospital for a D&C (dilation and curettage) \u2014 a surgical procedure to remove the contents of the uterus. Upon beginning the surgical procedure to remove the dangerous blood clots, doctors found Megan\u2019s heartbeat on a scan \u2014 10 days after her miscarriage.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to believe it, we\u2019ve got a heartbeat,\u201d Hui recalled. \u201cIt was the best feeling ever.\u201d \u201cThey said that with all the blood and clots it must have created shadows so they couldn\u2019t see her. Although the mother of now three was thrilled to have her newborn survive, she was concerned about the doctors\u2019 oversight \u2014 the possible effect her medical abortion could have had on her newborn.\n\nShe was given two abortion pills to prompt her womb to expel the dead fetus to prevent any infection. Patients will take mifepristone \u2014 the abortion pill \u2014 and then receive misoprostol to take home the next day, according to Planned Parenthood of Illinois. A complete abortion will occur within four to 24 hours of using misoprostol in the privacy of their home for most patients.\n\nTypically, medical abortion done this way has a success rate of more than 97 percent. Some of the abortion drugs prescribed to Hui do carry an increased risk of birth defects to any surviving baby. The most common severe birth defects include heart defects, neural tube defects, and Down syndrome.\n\nDespite the medical procedures, Megan is thriving at 18 weeks. \u201cNow Megan is fine, she\u2019s healthy and she is just a big healthy pudding of a baby,\u201d Hui said, the Daily Mail reported. The doctors said it was a blessing. They have never heard of anything like it. Someone had been looking over us.\u201d\n\nMegan\u2019s story is so extraordinary that it has been written up in medical journals. Medical professionals, like Katherine Hales, a spokesman from the Association of Radical Midwives, which campaigns for improved maternity care in the NHS, acknowledges this is an \u201cextraordinary case.\u201d \u201cBut I have never heard of this happening. I can\u2019t think of a medical reason for it to happen \u2013 it is just luck,\u201d Hales said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "megan hui, michelle hui, abortion pill, miracle baby, uterus, birth defects, congenital anomalies, healthy baby", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An 18-week-old baby survived a twin miscarriage and two abortion pills after several scans originally declared her dead.", "title": "Baby Survives Miscarriage And Abortion Pill...
