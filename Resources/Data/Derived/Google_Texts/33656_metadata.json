Here\u2019s the video. The transcript is below:\n\nQ: As you know, the Republicans released their health- care bill this week. And I wanted to get your comment on the bill, and specifically on the CBO analysis that it would cost significantly less than the Democratic plan and that it would lower premiums.\n\nPELOSI: Let me just say this. Anything you need to know about the difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is that the Republicans do not end the health insurance companies\u2019 discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. They let that stand. That\u2019s scandalous, the fact that it exists. I don\u2019t understand why they have not heard the American people, who have said preexisting conditions should not be a source of discrimination.\n\nAnd secondly, the Republican plan ensures about 3 million more people than now, and ours does 36 million people. So that\u2019s a very big difference in that.\n\nWe\u2019re not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we\u2019ll have a side by side to compare. But our bill brings down rates. I don\u2019t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT\u2019s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange. And our bill takes down those costs, even some now, and much less preventing the upward spiral.\n\nSo again, we\u2019re confident about what we set out to do in the bill: middle class affordability, security for our seniors, and accountability to our children.\n\nThe Post asked Pelosi\u2019s office about this and was told that what she meant was that she didn\u2019t personally know Gruber.\n\nThe Post\u2019s coverage thus far of Gruber\u2019s comments has centered only on GOP outrage towards the comments, not the newsworthiness of the comments (which are glaringly obvious). Because left-wing outlets like the Washington Post were as complicit as Gruber in covering up the darkside of ObamaCare (the cancelled policies, the lies, the phony CBO scoring), Gruber\u2019s bursts of honesty are a media scandal as much as they are a political one.\n\nThe House Minority Leader caught in this kind of a whopper \u2014 which was meant to cover-up Gruber\u2019s direct involvement \u2014 makes the story a little less about \u201cGOP outrage.\u201d\n\nAlthough the MSM will continue to do everything in its power to downplay GruberGate, that just got a little more difficult.\n\nNew Media is forcing the issue, and there\u2019s not a damn thing the corrupt former-gatekeepers in the MSM can do about it.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Post: Nancy Pelosi Lied About Not Knowing Jonathan Gruber", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Washington Post: Nancy Pelosi Lied About Not Knowing Jonathan Gruber", "title": "Washington Post: Nancy Pelosi Lied About Not Knowing Jonathan Gruber - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2012/Congress/pelosi-not-funny.JPG", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/11/13/wapo-pelosi-lied-about-not-knowin-grber/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Washington Post: Nancy Pelosi Lied About Not Knowing Jonathan Gruber", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2012/Congress/pelosi-not-funny.JPG", "title": "Washington Post: Nancy Pelosi Lied About Not Knowing Jonathan Gruber - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Nancy Pelosi, Twitter, Washington Post,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "tag": "Washington Post", "published_time": "2014-11-13T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda624\"", "article_summary": "The Post asked Pelosi\u2019s office about this and was told that what she meant was that she didn\u2019t personally know Gruber.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who [Gruber] is,\u201d Pelosi told reporters Thursday.\nThe Post\u2019s coverage thus far of Gruber\u2019s comments has centered only on GOP outrage towards the comments, not the newsworthiness of the comments (which are glaringly obvious).\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t help write our bill.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe only problem with that claim is the Post\u2019s discovery that in November of 2009, Pelosi gushed over Gruber by name.\nI don\u2019t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT\u2019s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange."}
