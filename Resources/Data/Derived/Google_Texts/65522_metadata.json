Then he chatted with them in his office about the border crisis. He told them he wanted to know how Dallas County could help the tens of thousands of Central American children stranded in the U.S. without their parents.\n\nThe request seemed unusual to the White House officials, Jenkins said. And it surprised Dallas County residents when he announced his plans at the Texas Democratic Convention a week later.\n\nBut for Jenkins, the events were nothing new. More than most Texas Democrats, he has been an enthusiastic partner of the Obama administration for years.\n\nIn a state where a politician can make a name for himself by picking a fight with President Barack Obama, Jenkins has chosen another path. He has backed or replicated some of Obama\u2019s most prominent initiatives, on issues such as health care, the minimum wage and the Texas voter ID law.\n\nIt\u2019s a risky strategy for a Texan, even a Democrat, and even in Dallas County, with its strong Democratic majority. The efforts have raised Jenkins\u2019 political profile, but they\u2019ve angered Republicans and could test how truly blue the county has become.\n\nJenkins said he\u2019s aware of the risks, but that he\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for Dallas County.\n\n\u201cWhat I am trying to do is get things done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe relationship between Jenkins and Obama dates to before either was in his current office. In June 2007, Jenkins donated $1,000 to Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign, according to federal election records. Back then, Jenkins was a practicing lawyer. Obama was a freshman U.S. senator and an underdog candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nA mutual friend, former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, asked Jenkins to do some pro bono legal work for the Obama campaign, and Jenkins agreed.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t think he could win ... but I thought it would be fun,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nThree years later, Jenkins was in his first term as the top elected official in Dallas County and decided that he needed the White House\u2019s help. He reached out to the administration after receiving word that the U.S. Postal Service planned to close a mail processing center in Dallas. When the decision was reversed, Jenkins got to make the public announcement.\n\nIn September 2013, the county joined a lawsuit brought by Obama\u2019s Justice Department challenging the Texas voter identification law. Democrats have said the law is likely to discourage voting among several groups that tend to vote Democratic.\n\nJenkins also became one of the leading local advocates for the Affordable Care Act. He and other county employees spread the word about health insurance exchanges and helped residents fill out applications. Meanwhile, he pushed for state legislators to accept funds to expand Medicaid.\n\nHis efforts earned him praise from the president. In a November 2013 speech in Dallas, Obama called Jenkins an \u201coutstanding county judge ... who\u2019s doing a great job on affordable care.\u201d The quote is prominently displayed on Jenkins\u2019 campaign website.\n\nJenkins has joined Obama\u2019s call for a \u201cliving wage.\u201d In January, the Dallas County Commissioners Court eliminated its two lowest pay grades, ensuring that no one on staff would make less than $10 per hour. In March, Jenkins proposed requiring that county contractors also pay workers more than $10 per hour. That was about a month after Obama signed an executive order that essentially did the same at the federal level.\n\nJenkins faced criticism for each of those moves, but none generated as harsh a response as his plan to bring 2,000 child immigrants from the border and house them in shelters in Dallas County. Jenkins has been inundated with angry phone calls, many from out of state.\n\nJenkins said the White House officials with whom he met in his office predicted an outraged reaction. They warned him that the plan could hurt his chances for re-election in the fall.\n\nHis response: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait until the first Wednesday in November.\u201d\n\nThat night, the group joined mayors from across the country at a reception at AT&T Stadium. Jenkins found Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who pledged his support. Then he found one of the White House workers and told him, \u201cWe are ready to go.\u201d\n\nLast week, Obama included Jenkins among the elected officials and religious leaders with whom he met in Dallas to discuss border issues. In photographs of the meeting, Jenkins was seated in a prime position \u2014 at the middle of the table, right across from Obama.\n\nTexas is among the reddest of red states, but things are different in Dallas County. Obama won 57 percent of the Dallas County vote in 2008 and 2012. And Democrats have dominated countywide races for almost a decade.\n\nIn 2010, Jenkins, running against a Republican and a Libertarian, was elected with 49.6 percent of the vote. He\u2019s the favorite in November, seeking re-election against Republican Ron Natinsky, a former Dallas City Council member.\n\nStill, some think it\u2019s an unnecessary political risk to position himself as an Obama ally. Republicans have been quick to point out the alliance.\n\n\u201cHe is totally focused on the federal Obama agenda,\u201d said Mike Cantrell, the lone Republican on the Commissioners Court. \u201cIt is a very radical leftist progressive agenda, and he is propagating it right here in Dallas County at taxpayer expense.\u201d\n\nJenkins\u2019 decisions, Cantrell suggested, might not be driven by consideration of what\u2019s best for Dallas County.\n\n\u201cI think it has more to do with political advancement for the judge than anything,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s been speculation that Jenkins has his eye on a higher office or a federal appointment. But there\u2019s no obvious path for advancement for a Democrat who lives in Highland Park. Texas remains solidly Republican, and Obama\u2019s time in office is nearing its end.\n\nJenkins deflects questions about his political plans, saying he\u2019s focused on doing his job well and pursuing what is right. Sometimes that aligns with Obama; sometimes it doesn\u2019t, he said.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that if you try to do the best at everything, then the body of work will speak for itself,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Matthew Watkins on Twitter at @mwatkinsDMN.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On border issues and others, Clay Jenkins hasn\u2019t shied away from embracing the president\u2019s initiatives.", "og": {"description": "On border issues and others, Clay Jenkins hasn\u2019t shied away from embracing the president\u2019s initiatives.", "title": "At some political risk, Dallas County judge sticks by Obama", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140713-at-some-political-risk-dallas-county-judge-sticks-by-obama.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140713-nmc_14borderjenkins.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/nmc_14borderjenkins.jpg", "height": 447}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-07-14T04:25:36Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-07-14T04:13:57Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"At some political risk, Dallas County judge sticks by Obama\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140713-at-some-political-risk-dallas-county-judge-sticks-by-obama.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140713-nmc_14borderjenkins.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/nmc_14borderjenkins.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1799036\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-14T04:13:57Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"MATTHEW WATKINS\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140713-nmc_14borderjenkins.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/nmc_14borderjenkins.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-14T04:13:57Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt is a very radical leftist progressive agenda, and he is propagating it right here in Dallas County at taxpayer expense.\u201dJenkins\u2019 decisions, Cantrell suggested, might not be driven by consideration of what\u2019s best for Dallas County.\nLast month, during the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Dallas, County Judge Clay Jenkins hosted four White House officials at the County Administration Building.\nIt\u2019s a risky strategy for a Texan, even a Democrat, and even in Dallas County, with its strong Democratic majority.\nAnd it surprised Dallas County residents when he announced his plans at the Texas Democratic Convention a week later.\nHe told them he wanted to know how Dallas County could help the tens of thousands of Central American children stranded in the U.S. without their parents."}
