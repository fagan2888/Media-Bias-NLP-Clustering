This article has been corrected since it first published.\n\n1. Pat Robertson: Voice of reason?\n\nTruly, we must have entered the end times. The day after creationist Ken Ham denied reality for several hours in a \u201cdebate\u201d with Bill Nye about evolution and the age of the earth, Pat Robertson implored Ham to shut-up, because he\u2019s making fundamentalist Christians look stupid. It appears that Pat Robertson has allowed his brain to be corrupted by a little bit of science. Now his head might explode.\n\nThere is just no way the earth could be 6,000 years old as Ham and the Young Earth Creationists hold, Robertson said. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no way that\u2019s possible. . . To say that it all came about in 6,000 years is just nonsense and I think it\u2019s time we come off of that stuff and say this isn\u2019t possible.\u201d He later referred to geological formations, a very sciencey sounding term not found in the Bible, and begged Ham not to \u201cmake a joke of ourselves.\u201d\n\nLest you think the world has gone mad, Robertson still said evolution is wrong.\n\nWhew!\n\nSee more here.\n\n2. Victoria Jackson, insane former SNL-er running for public office.\n\nOh, joy. A sober and thoughtful candidate is running for office in Tennessee. That would be Victoria Jackson, who has run away with the prize of SNL alum who turned out to be the most flat-out bonkers of all SNL alums. And that is a distinction. Other competitors include Dennis Miller, who turned out to be a right-wing a*hole, and Jon Lovitz who loudly scoffed at Obama\u2019s plan to tax the rich, and asked who declared him \u201cking.\u201d\n\nBut Jackson, who first gained fame for reciting poetry upside down on SNL, and has since become a noted Tea Party activist, has now, praise the lord, declared her candidacy for a seat on a county commission in the state to which she fled from liberal New York City. Among her platforms: Islamophobia\u2014well she doesn\u2019t call it that, she merely says all \u201cIslamic Centers are ultimately terrorist training camps;\u201d hating liberals\u2014because they embrace Shariah law and wife beheadings; climate denialism, and a general antipathy towards cities, because . . . umm, they concentrate people, and that saves energy.\n\nToonces the Cat, her former co-star, is said to be on board as campaign manager.\n\n3. Ben Shapiro: Liberalism killed Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nThe terrible disease of addiction and a potentially lethal batch of heroin emerged as the leading theories of what killed actor Philip Seymour Hoffman last weekend.\n\nBut there is something far more insidious going on, as it turns out. And thank goodness conservative thought leader Ben Shapiro shared his deep thoughts on the tragedy, by helpfully pointing the blame where it really belongs. It\u2019s those damn liberals again. They\u2019re killing everybody.\n\n\u201c\u2026his self-inflicted death is yet another hallmark of the broken leftist culture that dominates Hollywood, enabling rather than preventing the loss of some of its greatest talents,\u201d Shapiro wrote in the National Review.\n\nThe math, or the logic, goes something like this. Hoffman was a liberal. He died of a drug overdose. Therefore, liberalism causes drug abuse and death. Liberalism quickly devolves into \u201clibertinism\u201d and a \u201cpenchant for sin,\u201d Shapiro argued. No one in Hollywood has any spirituality, principles or standards.\n\nExcept maybe the scientologists. We\u2019re not sure where they fit in with Shapiro\u2019s cosmology.\n\n4. Michele Bachmann: Stop the tide of immigrants who are not conservative Republicans.\n\nNewsflash: Michele Bachmann is saying some crazy shit again. This time she claimed that the Soviet Union (earth to Michele, the Soviet Union is no more) is stealing our innermost secrets via Obamacare, because \u201cBelarus may have one of the subcontracting contracts to build the Obamacare website,\u201d she said in an interview on KTTH. They may or they may not, but anyway, be worried.\n\nAlso, she has special insight into why immigrants don\u2019t like Republicans. It\u2019s because Republicans love patriotism and the Constitution\u2014and immigrants don\u2019t. So, it has nothing to do with Republicans wanting to, say, build fences along the border with Mexico, patrol with drones, arm border patrol officers to the hilt, say things like immigrants have \u201ccantaloupe calves\u201d because they\u2019re all actually drug mules, or advocate mass detainment and deportations. Nope, Republican racism has nothing to do with it.\n\nAnd speaking of racism, she cited some interesting statistics\u2014and by cited we mean she just said them. \u201cIf you look at Hispanics today, 77 percent respond that they believe in big government and like big government. Fifty-five percent of Asians say they believe in big government, they like big government.\u201d\n\nThey love it. Especially when it detains and deports them without cause and builds huge walls along the border.\n\n5. Richard Cohen lectures Justin Bieber about pot, because it was cool when Richard Cohen smoked it, but not anymore.\n\nWe\u2019re sure we can all agree that columnist Richard Cohen is the arbiter of cool. That\u2019s right, the guy who wrote that the Mayor of New York\u2019s mixed-race family made people throw up is just the heppest of all cats. So when he pronounced both Justin Bieber and the singer\u2019s raging pot habit \u201cuncool\u201d this week, well, the shockwaves in the stoner community were palpable.\n\nTo support this claim, Cohen cited an article in the New York Review of Books by Harvard Medical School\u2019s Jerome Groopman. This is because Richard Cohen is super smart and reads long articles like that. Of course, he also distorts them. Cohen warns against the dreaded \u201ccannabis use disorder\u201d which \u201ccan be particularly pernicious when it comes to young people. It has a big effect on their little brains.\u201d This dreaded disorder is listed in the new fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), so it must be terrible. Other things listed in the DSM-5 include \u201ccaffeine intoxication\u201d (\u201cRestlessness, nervousness, excitement, red face, gastrointestinal upset, muscle twitching, rambling speech, sleeplessness, rapid and irregular heartbeat\u201d) and \u201ccaffeine withdrawal\u201d (\u201cheadache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood and other issues\u201d).\n\nIn other words, the DSM contains a lot of conditions.\n\nNow Richard Cohen admits that he smoked pot as a youth (and somehow avoided \u201ccannabis youth disorder.\u201d) But when Cohen smoked weed, it was different.\n\n\u201cI was of the generation for which it was a rite of passage, apiece with sexual freedom and, much more importantly, civil rights and the anti-war movement. Old fogies warned about pot, J. Edgar Hoover hated it and Richard Nixon made war against \u2014 three good reasons right there to have a toke,\u201d he wrote.
