According to video footage, at least one person was seen being escorted from the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe feel alienated from the Board of Education, we feel alienated from this system,\u201d Omar Abouelkhair told WNBC-TV.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be the majority soon,\u201d warned another.\n\nBut it's not as though the school board was totally unaccommodating--Muslim students would still be allowed to take the day off as an excused religious absence. It's seems that wasn't enough for these students and parents, however.\n\nThe uproar that took place at the local Board of Education meeting comes as a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies shows that based on census data, Muslims are the fastest growing bloc of immigrants in America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things got heated at a recent Board of Education meeting last week in Jersey City after officials decided not to close schools for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha..05/26/2016 3:01:52AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Things got heated at a recent Board of Education meeting last week in Jersey City after officials decided not to close schools for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Muslims Warn NJ School Board: 'We're Going to Be the Majority Soon'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/23/muslims-warn-nj-school-board-were-going-to-be-the-majority-soon-n2056048", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/23/4.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Things got heated at a recent Board of Education meeting last week in Jersey City after officials decided not to close schools for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Muslims Warn NJ School Board: 'We're Going to Be the Majority Soon'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/23/muslims-warn-nj-school-board-were-going-to-be-the-majority-soon-n2056048", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/23/4.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Muslims Warn NJ School Board: 'We're Going to Be the Majority Soon', Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33f1\"", "article_summary": "But it's not as though the school board was totally unaccommodating--Muslim students would still be allowed to take the day off as an excused religious absence.\nThings got heated at a Board of Education meeting last week in Jersey City after officials decided not to close schools for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.\n\u201cWe feel alienated from the Board of Education, we feel alienated from this system,\u201d Omar Abouelkhair told WNBC-TV.\nSome Muslims were so angry over the decision that one official called on security to \u201ctake charge\u201d of the situation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be the majority soon,\u201d warned another."}
