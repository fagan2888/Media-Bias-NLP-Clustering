One can never be too smart, too witty, nor full of too many useless facts. Still, all the effort needed to acquire such abilities is rather tiring. If only we could eat a food that would instantly transform us into geniuses. Well, until scientists develop this magic cuisine, here are a few foods that may help out a bit with your brain\u2019s strength.\n\nIntelligence\n\nNo one ever started their day wishing that they were less smart. Colleges make billions by promising hopeful 18-year-olds that four years at their institutions will make them more intelligent than the rest of the population. Little do they know that similar results could be achieved by simply consuming\u2026dark chocolate? In a study conducted by Northumbria University in England, students performed better on simple math tests after drinking shakes chock full of cocoa, Fox News reported. It\u2019s not that dark chocolate makes you \u201csmarter\u201d but it does help the knowledge you already have shine through a bit better. The flavonol in dark chocolate boosts the circulatory system, increasing the amount of blood that reaches your brain, according to Fox News. This ultimately increases brain functions which would explain why test scores can improve after a quick chocolaty snack.\n\nAlertness\n\nWhen you\u2019re feeling sluggish, you may be tempted to grab a coffee or candy bar for a quick pick me up. Although these foods will give you an instant energy boost, it\u2019s often short lived and the later crash can leave you worse off. Vitamin E filled almonds may offer a more effective alternative. These are the most nutrient filled nuts, according to a 2010 study, Business Insider reported. The vitamin E and magnesium in almonds will keep your brain at top-working capacity without the aforementioned \u201ccrash\u201d afterwards. If nuts aren\u2019t your thing, there\u2019s nothing quite like gold old fashioned protein to give your brain a much needed boost to get you through the day. Protein is able to stimulate orexin neurons, the cells in your brain responsible for keeping you awake. All animal by products such as fish, meats, dairy, and eggs are packed with protein.\n\nFocus\n\nIt happens to the best of us. You get halfway through a perfectly fine work day when suddenly you find you can\u2019t seem to focus on anything for longer than a few minutes. Maybe next time you should put down the coffee and try reaching for a berry snack instead. Studies have shown that blueberries in particular are able to increase \u201cconcentration and memory\u201d for up to five hours. This is due to the large amount of antioxidants they contain. These powerful nutrients are able to stimulate the blood of blood and oxygen to your brain which results in sharper focus, no caffeine needed. The fact that they are able to fight cancer as well doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nMemory\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want better memory? Studies suggest that eating cold water fatty fish, such as salmon not only helps you to improve memory retention, but can also protect you for degenerative mental disease such as dementia. That is because they contain high levels of essential fatty acids called DHA. According to the BBC, tomatoes can help protect memory loss due to free radical damage to cells, you know just in case you needed a reason to have that second serving of pasta.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brain, boosters, foods, can, help, improve, your, intelligence, alertness, focus, and, memory", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "These foods are particularly good at improving brain functions such memory and focus.", "title": "These Foods Can Boost Your Brain Power", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-boosters-foods-can-help-improve-your-intelligence-alertness-focus-and-memory-289182", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/brain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "These foods are particularly good at improving brain functions such memory and focus.", "title": "These Foods Can Boost Your Brain Power", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-boosters-foods-can-help-improve-your-intelligence-alertness-focus-and-memory-289182", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/brain.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/20/brain.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-20T16:31:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-20T16:31:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "These foods are particularly good at improving brain functions such memory and focus."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9fb\"", "article_summary": "MemoryWho doesn\u2019t want better memory?\nWell, until scientists develop this magic cuisine, here are a few foods that may help out a bit with your brain\u2019s strength.\nThe flavonol in dark chocolate boosts the circulatory system, increasing the amount of blood that reaches your brain, according to Fox News.\nThese powerful nutrients are able to stimulate the blood of blood and oxygen to your brain which results in sharper focus, no caffeine needed.\nIt\u2019s not that dark chocolate makes you \u201csmarter\u201d but it does help the knowledge you already have shine through a bit better."}
