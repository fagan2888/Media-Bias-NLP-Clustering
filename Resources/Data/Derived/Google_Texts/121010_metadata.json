He willingly puts his body in harm\u2019s way, absorbing crushing hits. Somehow he shakes it off better than Taylor Swift, returning to drives, returning to highlight films with dives.\n\nSanders goes 5-foot-11, 180-pounds. Like his Lamborghini, he\u2019s built for speed. Yet he remains a sports car with chains on the tires, embracing the slippery roads, the mountainous terrain.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of guys on this team who are tough,\u201d linebacker Von Miller said. \u201cBut Emmanuel, man, he\u2019s a tough guy.\u201d\n\nTrace it to playing high school football in Texas, connect it to his humble and hard working childhood. Whatever the case, when the Broncos\u2019 season was flashing before their eyes on Sunday, Sanders repeatedly delivered big catches.\n\nSanders finished with nine receptions for 125 yards, an accomplishment even more impressive given that he barely practiced last week as went through the league-mandated concussion protocol.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what happened before. I don\u2019t ever go into a game thinking about the negatives or what could possibly go wrong,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOnce I was OK to play, I was going to give my full effort.\u201d\n\nThe significance of Sanders\u2019 performance in the 39-36 victory over the Dolphins lies deeper in the numbers. He turned four third-down receptions into first downs. The damage began in the second quarter. After failing to catch a pass in the first 15 minutes, Sanders hauled in six before halftime.\n\nWith the Broncos trailing 14-3 and needing a sustained march, Sanders converted on third-and-4 with an 18-yard catch. It was the first of two on a touchdown drive that spared 76,987 agitated fans their fingernails for a few more hours.\n\nPHOTOS: Miami Dolphins vs. Denver Broncos at Mile High\n\n\u201cSanders, I ain\u2019t got nothing to say about that dude,\u201d said Dolphins safety Jimmy Wilson, whom Sanders beat multiple times.\n\nFor Sanders, Sundays have become a series of wows.\n\nSanders\u2019 best grab came on the next possession. Denver faced a third-and-20 on its 42-yard line, momentum fizzling after a hands-to-the-face penalty on center Will Mongtomery. Peyton Manning connected with Sanders on a 35-yarder, the receiver making the type of acrobatic play that has defined his first season in Denver on a stop-and-go move.\n\nDid he have to dive?\n\nSanders answered, smirking: \u201cPeyton gave me a hard time on that. It was a big time. I might have been able to run through the catch. I just wanted to secure it. We ended up scoring. It\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nManning doesn\u2019t trust easily. Sanders gained his confidence early in the summer by playing through a calf injury and spending countless hours catching extra passes and working on Denver\u2019s audible language.\n\nIn 11 games with the Broncos, Sanders has eclipsed 100 yards receiving seven times. He didn\u2019t reach the total once in 56 regular-season games with Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThey had an injury there with their other corner, so they were playing different guys, and Emmanuel was running good routes,\u201d Manning said. \u201cAnd he has that deep threat, which is going to allow some of the shorter stuff and crossing routes to be open.\u201d\n\nManning pulled off the impossible, sailing the ball too long for Sanders three times.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hard guy to overthrow, so I take a little bit of pride in that \u2013 it means my arm might be hangin\u2019 in there this late in the season,\u201d Manning said.\n\nBefore the cameras arrived in the lockeroom Sunday night, Sanders slouched back into his chair. Broncos president Joe Ellis made his way through the locker room, personally congratulating the receiver. Sanders thanked him. He then turned and faced reporters, his engaging smile hiding his cold-blooded toughness.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to keep me down,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNot happening.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders becomes first option with big third-down catches", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders becomes first option with big third-down catches", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/23/emmanuel-sanders-becomes-first-option-with-big-third-down-catches/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141123__BN20141124_Z00_BNSP24FBNBROSIDEp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141123__BN20141124_Z00_BNSP24FBNBROSIDEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-23T19:54:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:29:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b63\"", "article_summary": "Whatever the case, when the Broncos\u2019 season was flashing before their eyes on Sunday, Sanders repeatedly delivered big catches.\nIn 11 games with the Broncos, Sanders has eclipsed 100 yards receiving seven times.\nEmmanuel Sanders appears to think he\u2019s bigger than he is.\n\u201cBut Emmanuel, man, he\u2019s a tough guy.\u201dTrace it to playing high school football in Texas, connect it to his humble and hard working childhood.\nI don\u2019t ever go into a game thinking about the negatives or what could possibly go wrong,\u201d Sanders said."}
