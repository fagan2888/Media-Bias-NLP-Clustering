The couple reportedly told prosecutors they were acting in the baby girl\u2019s best interest and said they wanted to place her in a financially stable family who would be able to provide her with an education.\n\n\u201cWe did not give the baby away for money but in order to give it more security,\u201d the couple was quoted as saying.\n\nProsecutors believe Mr. Teng and Ms. Zhang plotted the \u201csinister conspiracy\u201d to profit from the sale of the baby girl. One credit card bill showed that the couple went on an online shopping spree immediately after \u201ctrading\u201d the baby girl. Their purchases included an iPhone and \u201chigh-end\u201d sneakers.\n\nProsectors also allege that the couple tried to cover up Ms. Zhang\u2019s pregnancy in order to hide the crime. They told neighbors she was suffering from a tumor to explain her pregnant belly.\n\nMr. Teng and Ms. Zhang have two older children and allegedly put the baby girl up for adoption before accepting money for her. It is unclear how much they received when the transaction took place.\n\nEarlier this year, a businessman in India tried to buy a stolen baby on Facebook. The man paid 800,000 rupees ($14, 479) for the child, whose grandfather kidnapped him from his mother. Feroz Khan told his daughter her baby was stillborn, and then sold the child to a lab technician. The tech then posted a picture of the baby on Facebook, and businessman Amit Kumar offered to buy it.\n\nThe mother became suspicious when her father gave her some of the money from the sale. Police arrested Feroz Khan, his accomplice, and both of the hospital employees who initially bought the newborn. Amit Kumar also faced charges for purchasing the baby.\n\nKhan sold the baby because he wanted to arrange a second marriage for his daughter, police said. He believed she would not find a new husband if she was raising a child.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unemployed Chinese couple will go on trial in Shanghai for allegedly selling their baby daughter to pay for an online shopping spree, including an iPhone", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "An unemployed Chinese couple will go on trial in Shanghai for allegedly selling their baby daughter to pay for an online shopping spree, including an iPhone", "title": "Chinese Couple Sold Baby Girl For iPhone, Sneakers", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/999651/chinese-couple-sold-baby-girl-for-iphone-sneakers/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Chinese-couple-sells-baby-for-iPhone.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-20T16:34:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-30T11:17:21+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Chinese-couple-sells-baby-for-iPhone.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-10-20T16:34:00+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "chinese couple sells baby for iphone,couple sells baby for iphone,mr. teng and ms. zhang,asia", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Chinese-couple-sells-baby-for-iPhone.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An unemployed Chinese couple will go on trial in Shanghai for allegedly selling their baby daughter to pay for an online shopping spree, including an iPhone"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96bd\"", "article_summary": "Prosecutors believe Mr. Teng and Ms. Zhang plotted the \u201csinister conspiracy\u201d to profit from the sale of the baby girl.\nOne credit card bill showed that the couple went on an online shopping spree immediately after \u201ctrading\u201d the baby girl.\nMr. Teng and Ms. Zhang have two older children and allegedly put the baby girl up for adoption before accepting money for her.\nAn unemployed Chinese couple will go on trial in Shanghai for allegedly selling their baby daughter to pay for an online shopping spree, including an iPhone.\n\u201cWe did not give the baby away for money but in order to give it more security,\u201d the couple was quoted as saying."}
