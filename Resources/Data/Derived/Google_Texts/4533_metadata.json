They\u2019ve been noticeably silent as insurers report huge losses.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that the law that the insurance industry\u2019s shills demonized has been awfully good to insurance-company investors.\u201d That was from a piece in the Huffington Post almost exactly a year ago, after UnitedHealth Group released its Q1 earnings.\n\nThe writer went on to point out that the good news was reported in the pages of IBD, while our editorial page has long been critical of the law. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Wendell Potter concluded, \u201cto see how IBD\u2019s editorial writers spin UnitedHealth\u2019s ObamaCare success.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see how Potter and other ObamaCare fans are spinning the law\u2019s \u201csuccess,\u201d now that insurance companies are showing big, sustained losses and threatening to pull out of the program next year.\n\nThe latest to join the list is Humana, which just reported that profits fell 30% in the last quarter of 2015 and has set aside a reserve for expected losses this year. It\u2019s now saying it \u201ccontinues to evaluate its participation\u201d in the individual insurance market.\n\nA few days earlier, Aetna said it lost up to 4% on its ObamaCare policies in 2015 and said it had \u201cserious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.\u201d\n\nAnd UnitedHealth Group said it expects losses from its ObamaCare enrollees to top $650 million this year and next. \u201cWe cannot sustain these losses,\u201d is how CEO Stephen Hemsley put it.\n\nHumana, as with other insurers, discovered that ObamaCare enrollees were sicker and more expensive to cover than they anticipated. And worse, they\u2019re finding that ObamaCare officials are letting too many people game the system by waiting until after they are sick to enroll for coverage, knowing they can get it guaranteed.\n\nSpiraling premiums, an unstable insurance market, people gaming the system. These were predictions made by ObamaCare\u2019s free market critics, including IBD, who said this is where the law\u2019s mountain of regulations would inevitably lead.\n\nSo, what say you now, ObamaCare fans?", "article_metadata": {"date": "2016-02-11 14:41:32:-08:00", "description": "Health Reform: It wasn\u2019t that long ago when ObamaCare fans were wagging their fingers at critics, saying industry profits proved that the law was working.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Health Reform: It wasn\u2019t that long ago when ObamaCare fans were wagging their fingers at critics, saying industry profits proved that the law was working.
