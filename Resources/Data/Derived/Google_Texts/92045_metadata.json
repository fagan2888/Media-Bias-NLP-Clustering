But many things have changed in the past four years.

We're currently asked to see patients every 15 minutes, regardless of the complexity of their medical issues.\"\n\nThe improvement in the financial condition of the hospital operator would prompt nurses to ask for a bigger share from increased revenue.\n\nNurses at Kaiser's emergency rooms and intensive care units (ICUs) are also arguing that the hospital operator has been skimping on care, discharging patients who should be admitted, and closing cardiology and pediatric divisions.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4f2\"", "article_summary": "The management of the California Nurses Association (CNA) is all set to meet representatives of the Kaiser Hospital in Fremont to bargain on a new four-year contract.\nThe improvement in the financial condition of the hospital operator would prompt nurses to ask for a bigger share from increased revenue.\nKaiser is the operator of the largest hospital system in the Golden State and the eighth largest operator of health system in the entire country.\nNurses at Kaiser's emergency rooms and intensive care units (ICUs) are also arguing that the hospital operator has been skimping on care, discharging patients who should be admitted, and closing cardiology and pediatric divisions.\nFour years back, the union had endorsed the first contract proposed by Kaiser without any objection."}
