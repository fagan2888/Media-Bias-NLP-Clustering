In this next clip from also last year, Mr. Gruber explains how Democrats played with the language of the Obamacare law so that it achieved their goals, by again, fooling the stupid public.\u201d\n\nShe then played a short 5-second clip of Gruber, saying the following, that a part of the Obamacare passed because \u201cthe American people are too stupid to understand the difference.\u201d\n\nKelly didn\u2019t say much about the background of the clip, but the video appears to be from a lecture Gruber gave at Washington University in St. Louis in October of last year, entitled \u201cCost of Health Care.\u201d Indeed, Gruber\u2019s remarks can be heard around the 31-minute mark of the University\u2019s video of the event. (RELATED: Gruber Now Accusing GOP Of Trying To \u2018Confuse People\u2019 About Obamacare)\n\nThe longer video also give the full background of Gruber\u2019s remarks. Gruber was talking about the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d in Obamacare, which increased the tax on high-end insurance packages. The fact that Obamacare would raise taxes was seen as politically toxic. But then-Senator John Kerry came up with the idea of taxing the companies providing the Cadillac plans, rather than taxing Americans directly.\n\nGruber told him that it was the same thing, and he didn\u2019t see why that\u2019s matter. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d responded Kerry. Sure enough, the provision passed, in Gruber\u2019s estimation because \u201cthe American people are too stupid to understand the difference.\u201d\n\nWatch Wash U\u2019s video while you can, considering what the last university to host video of a controversial Gruber lecture tried to do.\n\n[h/t Mediaite]\n\nFollow Alex Griswold on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Griswold", "description": "Another video has emerged of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber calling Americans \"stupid,\" and bragging about how he deceived the public to pass the law.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Yet another video has emerged of MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber calling Americans \"stupid,\" and bragging about how the Affordable Care Act's drafters had to deceive the public i", "title": "Yet Another Video Emerges Of Obamacare Architect Calling Americans \u2018Stupid\u2019 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/11/yet-another-video-emerges-of-obamacare-architect-calling-americans-stupid-video/", "image": {"width": 891, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jonathan-Gruber-e1415761663669.jpg", "height": 384}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'The American people are too stupid to understand the difference'", "title": "Yet Another Video Emerges Of Obamacare Architect Calling Americans \u2018Stupid\u2019 [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/11/yet-another-video-emerges-of-obamacare-architect-calling-americans-stupid-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jonathan-Gruber-e1415761663669.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-11 23:05:35", "sailthru.title": "Yet Another Video Emerges Of Obamacare Architect Calling Americans 'Stupid' [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "obamacare,jonathan gruber,kelly five,megyn kelly,washington university,mediaite,americans,stupid,deceive,video,lecture,john kerry,cadillac tax", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "megyn-kelly,obamacare,alex-griswold", "sailthru.description": "Yet another video has emerged of MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber calling Americans \"stupid,\" and bragging about how the Affordable Care Act's drafters had to deceive the public i", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jonathan-Gruber-e1415761663669.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12cb\"", "article_summary": "(RELATED: Gruber Now Accusing GOP Of Trying To \u2018Confuse People\u2019 About Obamacare)The longer video also give the full background of Gruber\u2019s remarks.\nFox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly was the first to air the video on her program, \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Kelly played the video of Gruber appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cRonan Farrow Daily\u201d apologizing for his earlier remarks.\n4377849Yet another video has emerged of MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber calling Americans \u201cstupid,\u201d and bragging about how the Affordable Care Act\u2019s drafters had to deceive the public in order to pass the law.\n\u201cBut now tonight,\u201d Kelly reported, \u201d more video has surfaced showing this was not the first time Mr. Gruber called the American people stupid in an \u2018off-the-cuff\u2019 remark.\nGruber was talking about the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d in Obamacare, which increased the tax on high-end insurance packages."}
