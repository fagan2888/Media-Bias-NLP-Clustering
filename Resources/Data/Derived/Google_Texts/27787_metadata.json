Democrats tend to be cautious and careful about promising too much, as illustrated most recently by the way Obamacare, which conservatives insisted would be a budget-buster, actually ended up being significantly cheaper than projected.\n\nBut is all that about to change?\n\nOn Wednesday four former Democratic chairmen and chairwomen of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 three who served under Barack Obama, one who served under Bill Clinton \u2014 released a stinging open letter to Bernie Sanders and Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts professor who has been a major source of the Sanders campaign\u2019s numbers. The economists called out the campaign for citing \u201cextreme claims\u201d by Friedman that \u201cexceed even the most grandiose predictions by Republicans\u201d and could \u201cundermine the credibility of the progressive economic agenda.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s harsh. But it\u2019s harsh for a reason.\n\nThe claims the economists are talking about come from Friedman\u2019s analysis of the Sanders economic program. The good news is that this isn\u2019t the campaign\u2019s official assessment; the bad news is that the Friedman analysis has been highly praised by campaign officials.\n\nAnd the analysis is really something. The Republican candidates have been widely and rightly mocked for their escalating claims that they can achieve incredible economic growth, starting with Jeb Bush\u2019s promise to double growth to 4 percent and heading up from there. But Friedman outdoes the GOP by claiming that the Sanders plan would produce 5.3 percent growth a year over the next decade.\n\nEven more telling, I\u2019d argue, is Friedman\u2019s jobs projection, which has the employed share of American adults soaring all the way back to what it was in 2000. That may sound possible \u2014 until you remember that by 2026 more than a quarter of U.S. adults over 20 will be 65 and older, compared with 17 percent in 2000.\n\nSorry, but there\u2019s just no way to justify this stuff. For wonks like me, it is, frankly, horrifying.\n\nStill, these are numbers on a program that Sanders, even if he made it to the White House, would have little chance of enacting. So do they matter?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer is yes, for several reasons.\n\nOne is that, as the economists warn, fuzzy math from the left would make it impossible to effectively criticize conservative voodoo.\n\nBeyond that, this controversy is an indication of a campaign, and perhaps a candidate, not ready for prime time. These claims for the Sanders program aren\u2019t just implausible, they\u2019re embarrassing to anyone remotely familiar with economic history (which says that raising long-run growth is very hard) and changing demography. They should have set alarm bells ringing, but obviously didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd there\u2019s an even larger issue here: Good ideas don\u2019t have to be sold with fairy dust.\n\nSanders is calling for a large expansion of the U.S. social safety net, which is something I would like to see, too. But the problem with such a move is that it would probably create many losers as well as winners \u2014 a substantial number of Americans, mainly in the upper middle class, who would end up paying more in additional taxes than they would gain in enhanced benefits.\n\nBy endorsing outlandish economic claims, the Sanders campaign is basically signaling that it doesn\u2019t believe its program can be sold on the merits, that it has to invoke a growth miracle to minimize the downsides of its vision. It is, in effect, confirming its critics\u2019 worst suspicions.\n\nWhat happens now? In the past, the Sanders campaign has responded to critiques by impugning the motives of the critics. But the authors of the critical letter that came out Wednesday aren\u2019t just important economists, they\u2019re important figures in the progressive movement.\n\nFor example, Alan Krueger is one of the founders of modern research on minimum wages, which shows that moderate increases in the minimum don\u2019t cause major job loss. Christina Romer was a strong advocate for stimulus during her time in the White House, and a major figure in the pushback against austerity in the years that followed.\n\nThe point is that if you dismiss the likes of Krueger or Romer as Hillary shills or compromised members of the \u201cestablishment,\u201d you\u2019re excommunicating most of the policy experts who should be your allies.\n\nSo Sanders really needs to crack down on his campaign\u2019s instinct to lash out. More than that, he needs to dissociate himself from voodoo of the left \u2014 not just because of the political risks, but because getting real is or ought to be a core progressive value.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America\u2019s two big political parties are very different from each other, and one difference involves the willingness to indulge economic fantasies.
