Police are on the lookout for a person who fired off numerous rounds in a strip mall parking lot in Colorado Springs early Sunday morning during what witnesses described as a “large disturbance.”

Authorities say the incident occurred around 1:15 a.m. in the 3600 block of Citadel Drive North.

One bullet was fired into the Hookah Springs Cafe, in which several patrons were present, and other bullets struck three unoccupied vehicles and a vehicle containing two people.

No one was injured, police said.

The suspects left the area in a white sedan, police said.
