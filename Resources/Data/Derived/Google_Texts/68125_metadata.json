In late December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to Opdivo (nivolumab), a new treatment for patients with unresectable (cannot be removed by surgery) or metastatic (advanced) melanoma who no longer respond to other drugs. The analysts are bullish on the drug and look for updates and launch information to be forthcoming. Like other large-cap pharmaceutical companies, Bristol-Myers is often rumored to be looking for an accretive and pipeline filling acquisition.\n\nBristol-Myers investors are paid a 2.45% dividend. Credit Suisse puts a $68 price target on the stock. The consensus target is much lower at $63.41.

Analysts expect that coverage expansion under Affordable Care Act (ACA) will provide a substantial boost to earnings in 2015 and beyond. The company\u2019s large asset base provides geographic diversification and scale advantages. This is one of the stocks that the Credit Suisse team sees as most levered to the states where Medicaid expansion could be the greatest, and more exposed to health care reform than almost any other company in the firm\u2019s coverage universe.\n\nThe Credit Suisse price target of $66 is higher than the consensus price objective of $62.61. The stock closed Thursday at $47.90 a share.\n\nIllumina\n\nThis Credit Suisse top pick in life sciences develops, manufactures and markets life science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function in most parts of the world. The company\u2019s products include sequencing platforms that are based on its SBS technology and designed to meet the various demands of a range of sequencing applications, as well as array platforms consisting of HiScan and iScan systems array scanners, which support the imaging of array-based genetic analysis products.\n\nIllumina is the early leader in a growing genetic sequencing market that some analysts predict could reach $20 billion annually in the near future. Illumina has a dominant 70% market share in the industry and its development of groundbreaking technologies, such as the $1,000 human genome, have been game changing. Illumina\u2019s growth in the early days of the gene sequencing market have the company poised to ride its innovation to years of potential success.\n\nThe Credit Suisse price target for the stock is $230.
