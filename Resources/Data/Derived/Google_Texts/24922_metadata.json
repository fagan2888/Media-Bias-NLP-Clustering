He was so medicated, Herrera said, \u201cwe disintegrated his ability to learn.\u201d\n\nThe Herreras, foster parents to more than 100 children over the past 18 years, first met Anthony when he was 15 months old. He was so neglected and malnourished that he could not sit up or eat solid food.\n\nThey adopted him in 1998, when he was 3, and for the next several years struggled to control behavior so violent and out of control that it took over their lives.\n\nAt his worst, the little boy would scream that he was going to kill his mother, thrash and kick and bite, and throw furniture. Once, at Elitch Gardens amusement park, he flew into a rage because he didn\u2019t win a stuffed animal and jumped on his mother\u2019s back, trying to strangle her and rip off her clothes.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t having a violent tantrum, he was one of the sweetest children in her life, hugging his mother and telling her how much he loved her. Anthony usually didn\u2019t even remember the raging fits once they ended.\n\nThe boy was diagnosed as bipolar at age 5 and put on the antipsychotic Zyprexa, as well as Tenex and Adderall for hyperactivity. At age 8, his doctor added another antipsychotic, Abilify. Each time that the medications were changed, they would calm him down for a few weeks, but then the rages would begin again, often worse than before.\n\nBy the time he was a teen, Anthony was on five medications at once.\n\nHis grandparents told Herrera, \u201cHe looks like a zombie.\u201d\n\n\u201d \u2018Are we masking something because we are medicating him so much?\u2019 \u201d his mother would ask Anthony\u2019s doctors. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know any better. I was doing what the doctor told me to do. The rages were so bad when he was on medication, I couldn\u2019t imagine what they would be like if he wasn\u2019t on medication.\u201d\n\nHerrera said she often cared for foster teens who took antipsychotics and antidepressants in her early years as a foster parent but saw less when she began to specialize in young children with medical issues.\n\nIn 2011, when Anthony was 16, he suffered what looked like a stroke \u2014 drooling and constricted, drawn-up arms \u2014 but was diagnosed as an overdose of Abilify caused by a buildup of drugs in his system that his body had stopped processing. He spent a week at Children\u2019s Hospital in Aurora, where he was diagnosed as autistic with a pervasive developmental disability, plus post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHis mother was told Anthony wasn\u2019t bipolar after all and had been medicated for the wrong issues. He stopped all medication.\n\nAfter years on mind-altering drugs, Anthony had fallen far behind in school. At 16, he had the developmental function of a 9-year-old. He read at a sixth-grade level and wrote like a kindergartner.\n\nThree years off medication, he is now 19 with the functioning ability of a 16-year-old.\n\nAnthony still has rages, but only once or twice a year, and his mother is able to connect with him and tell him to stop, unlike the years when he would disassociate completely during a tantrum.\n\n\u201cI wonder if some of the medication wasn\u2019t inducing the rages,\u201d said Herrera, who doesn\u2019t blame the foster-care system but, rather, the medical and pharmaceutical communities for what she now considers serious overmedication of her son.\n\n\u201cNow, I would want to say to the therapist, \u2018Why do we need so many medications?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cHis brain was so clouded that I don\u2019t think he was able to learn the way he should have been.\u201d\n\nAbout the series\n\nThis investigation by The Denver Post into psychotropic drug use by foster children stems from The Post\u2019s \u201cFailed to Death\u201d series on Colorado\u2019s child-welfare system that ran in 2012.\n\nThe overprescription of powerful psychotropic medication to foster children is a national epidemic \u2014 yet in Colorado, efforts to curb the problem lag some states.\n\nThe Post obtained unpublished state data and reports, interviewed foster families and children, reviewed other states\u2019 efforts and examined promising new therapies.\n\nSunday: Foster kids are prescribed powerful drugs that alter brain function at rates far higher than other children. A growing number of experts say this is not only unnecessary, but harmful.\n\nMonday: Over decades, the pharmaceutical industry pushed aggressively to market psychotropics to children and tap into the lucrative Medicaid system.\n\nTuesday: New therapies to repair developmental delays in children\u2019s brains caused by abuse and neglect are taking hold. Proponents advocate for more therapy and fewer medications.\n\nWednesday: Other states have been more aggressive and more effective than Colorado in establishing policies to reduce prescriptions of psychotropics to foster children.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mother wishes she had restricted flow of prescription drugs to her son", "title": "Mother wishes she had restricted flow of prescription drugs to her son", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/13/mother-wishes-she-had-restricted-flow-of-prescription-drugs-to-her-son/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140413__20140414_A11_cd14ivgfosterkidsj3p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140413__20140414_A11_cd14ivgfosterkidsj3p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-13T20:56:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:11:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f09\"", "article_summary": "Wednesday: Other states have been more aggressive and more effective than Colorado in establishing policies to reduce prescriptions of psychotropics to foster children.\nHis mother was told Anthony wasn\u2019t bipolar after all and had been medicated for the wrong issues.\nThe overprescription of powerful psychotropic medication to foster children is a national epidemic \u2014 yet in Colorado, efforts to curb the problem lag some states.\nThe Post obtained unpublished state data and reports, interviewed foster families and children, reviewed other states\u2019 efforts and examined promising new therapies.\nLooking back, Pam Herrera wishes she had asked more questions and been more forceful with her son\u2019s therapists."}
