Meera has recently admitted that she would still say "yes" if the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan proposed to her for marriage.

Responding to a question about her earlier statements on marrying the cricketer-turned-politician, the Pakistani film actress said her remarks were still valid and she was waiting for Khan to approach her, the Dawn reported.

During one of his rallies previously, the 62-year-old had jokingly said that one of the reasons he wanted his demands to be met urgently in order for him to end the sit-in was so that he could get married.
