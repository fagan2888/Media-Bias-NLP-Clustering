And to many Christians, both speeches seemed to be directly addressed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling BJP party.\n\n\u201cReligion is a force for unity; we cannot make it a cause of conflict,\u201d Mukherjee said in his customary address to the nation on the eve of Republic Day. Mukherjee was quoting Mahatma Gandhi, who is known as \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d of the country that became a republic on Jan. 26, 1950.\n\nIn an apparent endorsement of Mukherjee\u2019s remarks, President Obama said in his concluding Jan. 27 \u201ctown hall\u201d address in New Delhi, \u201cWe remember the wisdom of Gandhi, who said that \u2018the different religions are beautiful flowers in the same garden.\u2019 They are branches of the same majestic tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery person has a right to practice the faith that they choose and to practice no faith at all \u2014 and to do so free of persecution, fear or discrimination,\u201d declared Obama, even though he is not fully supporting religious freedom in the U.S., given the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act..\n\nThe U.S. president even quoted the Indian constitution on religious freedom, reminding more than 1,800 special invitees, including many youth, \u201cYour [constitution] Article 25 says all people are equally entitled to the freedom of conscience and have the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion.\u201d\n\nAsserting that \u201cupholding freedom of religion is the utmost responsibility of the government,\u201d Obama pointed out, \u201cWe see violence and terror perpetuated by those who profess to be standing up for upholding their faith but in fact [are] betraying them.\u201d\n\nCalling for the international community to \u201cguard against any efforts to divide us on sectarian lines or any other thing,\u201d Obama cautioned that \u201cIndia will succeed so long as it is not splintered along lines of religious faith.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Happy Coincidence\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are very happy that the U.S. president has spoken out clearly on the issue of religious freedom,\u201d said Archbishop Albert D\u2019Souza of Agra, secretary general of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI).\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a happy coincidence that both the U.S. and Indian presidents have made these statements when unpleasant things are happening on the religious-freedom front in the country,\u201d Archbishop D\u2019Souza told the Register.\n\n\u201cThe [Indian] president, with his Republic Day message, has made it clear to the government what it should do,\u201d said Archbishop D\u2019Souza. \u201cWe want the prime minister to act before things get worse.\u201d\n\nIn his Republic Day remarks, Mukherjee \u2014 whose presidential office is a largely ceremonial post under the nation\u2019s parliamentary system of government that vests governmental power instead with the prime minister \u2014 stated, \u201cWisdom of India teaches us: Unity is strength; dominance is weakness. \u2026 We have always reposed our trust in faith equality, where every faith is equal before the law.\u201d\n\nFurther, Mukherjee cautioned that \u201cthe violence of the tongue cuts and wounds people's hearts\u201d \u2014 in what appeared to be a reference to recent Hindu nationalist propaganda that has demonized minority Christians and Muslims as \u201cforeign\u201d faiths, while calling for India to be a Hindu nation.\n\nJohn Dayal, an outspoken Catholic activist, told the Register that President Obama\u2019s \u201chard talk\u201d was a \u201cstrong message\u201d to Modi\u2019s government, which, Dayal said, has been \u201ckeeping quiet on the recurring anti-Christian violence and propaganda.\u201d\n\nDayal shared the view of media reports: that Obama has given a \u201cclear message\u201d to the Indian government that \u201cthe world is also watching what\u2019s happening in the country.\u201d\n\nBJP Downplays Obama\u2019s Remarks\n\nHowever, BJP spokespersons and sympathizers tried to downplay Obama\u2019s message, claiming that it was \u201conly global and not India specific.\u201d\n\nAnd Kanwar Sibal, a former Indian foreign secretary, maintained that it was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cunnecessary\u201d on the part of Obama \u201cto quote the constitution to us.\u201d\n\nBut Dayal countered that he would request \u201cconcerned Indians\u201d to ask the Modi government to take the words of the Indian president seriously, in order to uphold religious freedom and harmony in the country amid headlines of reconversions of Christians and attacks on churches.\n\n\u201cThe Church has raised its concerns on these issues several times since the BJP came into power [in May 2014],\u201d Dayal said.\n\n\u201cThe Christians of this country need assurance from the government: that we are protected and secure and safe in our motherland,\u201d said the Catholic Church in a strong statement on Jan. 21, urging the government \u201cto uphold the secular nature of India.\u201d\n\nUnder the Indian constitution, secularism does not mean the exclusion of religion from public life, but \u201cequal respect to all faiths without discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe statement emerged from a key Jan. 20 meeting in New Delhi, attended by the top Church leadership in the country, including four cardinals, which was convened in the wake of a surge in anti-Christian violence and propaganda.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate incidents that happened in the past few months in various parts of our country have hurt the sentiments of the Christian community and have shaken the faith in the secular fabric of our nation,\u201d stated the bishops' conference.\n\n\u201cShocking incidents that have taken place against churches, clergy and laity in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have caused great concern for the Christian community,\u201d the bishops' statement asserted.\n\nWith the nation ruled by the BJP, the statement pointed out, belligerent Hindu fundamentalist groups have been conducting \u201cghar vaspsi\u201d (meaning \u201creconversion ceremonies\u201d), while the government has been facilitating Hindu indoctrination in education and culture.\n\nThe clamor for converting India into a Hindu nation and attacks on churches and Christians in several parts of the country, the Catholic Church warned, portrayed \u201ca negative image of India\u201d immediately ahead of President Obama\u2019s Jan. 25-27 visit.\n\nStrategy of Polarization?\n\nMeanwhile, addressing a Jan. 24 seminar on \u201creligious freedom and challenges\u201d organized by the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council in Kochi in the southern Indian state of Kerala, Cyriac Joseph, a Catholic and retired federal Supreme Court judge, noted that \u201cthe pattern of incidents after the BJP came to power has created an atmosphere of fear and suspicion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis could be a strategy of [Hindu] polarization for political benefits,\u201d Joseph, who is currently a member of the autonomous National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), observed at the end of the seminar.\n\nB. Radhakrishna Menon, a senior BJP leader in Kerala, assured the participants that fundamental religious freedom of minorities will be \u201cprotected\u201d by the BJP government. But several speakers and participants challenged him on whether his assurance could be taken for face value in the context of recent developments in the country and the BJP government\u2019s response.\n\nOn Jan. 20, the NHRC issued a notice to the government and requested an investigation over reported attacks on four churches in the national capital, including the mysterious torching of a big Catholic church in Delhi on Dec. 1.\n\nIn its press release, the human-rights commission stated that \u201cthese frequent attacks on the religious institutions of the minority community, if true, violate the fundamental right to freedom of religion and cause immense harm to the social fabric.\u201d\n\nAnto Akkara writes from Bangalore, India.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the end of his three-day visit, the U.S. president advised India\u2019s Hindu nationalist rulers\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "As the end of his three-day visit, the U.S. president advised India\u2019s Hindu nationalist rulers that \u2018upholding freedom of religion is...", "title": "Indian Christians Encouraged by Obama\u2019s \u2018Hard Talk\u2019 Supporting Religious Liberty", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/indian-christians-encouraged-by-obamas-hard-talk-supporting-religious-liber/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/obama_indian_leaders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/indian-christians-encouraged-by-obamas-hard-talk-supporting-religious-liber/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/obama_indian_leaders.jpg", "description": "As the end of his three-day visit, the U.S. president advised India\u2019s Hindu nationalist rulers that \u2018upholding freedom of religion is...", "card": "summary", "title": "Indian Christians Encouraged by Obama\u2019s \u2018Hard Talk\u2019 Supporting Religious Liberty"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, anto akkara, archbishop albert d'souza, barack obama, bjp, catholic bishops conference of india, christian persecution, hindu nationalism, india", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe50\"", "article_summary": "NEW DELHI \u2014 Christians took comfort this week from some unexpected \u201chard talk\u201d in support of religious freedom delivered by visiting U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\u201cThe [Indian] president, with his Republic Day message, has made it clear to the government what it should do,\u201d said Archbishop D\u2019Souza.\nB.
