He ignores the political, legal and constitutional objections to Obamacare in favor of arguing the government is simply too cumbersome to put out a product that can be compared in speed and efficiency with the likes of Orbitz or Amazon.\n\nThat\u2019s actually the least important problem with Obamacare, but give Klein his say. The cover itself, already generating buzz as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cbrutal,\u201d says it all.\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cadministration wouldn\u2019t just be competent,\u201d Klein writes near the beginning. \u201cIt would be modern. And it would restore America\u2019s faith that the public sector could do big things well.\u201d\n\nMidway through, he offers the liberal intelligentsia a small consolation. \u201cFor all its deficiencies, healthcare.gov isn\u2019t the worst disaster a government has experienced on a major IT project. That distinction belongs to the U.K.\u2019s endeavor to create an electronic medical records system for its National Health Service.\u201d\n\nWhat the UK did about that, Klein writes, is empower the technocrats working on the project to crush their competition in the government bureaucracy, making them powerful enough to overcome entrenched fiefdoms.\n\nKlein wants the Obamacare army to do something similar here.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going to save their project to build an iPod government worthy of public confidence, they must force the rest of the federal bureaucracy to change,\u201d he writes.\n\nThat might be fine from a purely IT point of view, but Klein\u2019s liberalism is showing with his belief that a more efficient Obamacare website will mean a better Obamacare for all.\n\nAn administration that has no qualms about turning the IRS loose on its political opponents or turning Ranger Friendly at the National Park Service into storm troopers locking out World War II vets \u2014 and brags about being proud of it \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be getting more power at its fingertips.\n\nIt\u2019s too efficient already.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A picture is worth 1,000 words.
