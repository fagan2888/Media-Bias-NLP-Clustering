It is about more than political boundaries; it defines nothing less than our living, collective power which is generated as traditions are respectfully developed, sustained, and transformed to confront new conditions. We as Native peoples have been too lax with these words, allowing their power to be misused and even turned against our own relatives.\n\nVine Deloria Jr. popularized the term \u201cTribal Sovereignty\u201d in his 1969 book, Custer Died for Your Sins. Placing the word tribal \u2013 meaning, the people \u2013 before the word sovereignty, he reasoned, \u201ccan be said to consist more of continued cultural integrity than of political powers,\u201d and he emphasized, \u201cto the degree that a tribal nation loses its sense of cultural identity, to that degree it suffers a loss of sovereignty.\u201d Thirty six years later and the term no longer has the same impact as it has lost its \u201cpolitical moorings\u201d said Vine. Sam Deloria, board chairman of the American Indian Law Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, cautioned tribal leaders to take care of how they wielded their delegate authority, lest they begin to act as powerful individuals whose behavior comes to threaten the sovereign people they are sworn to represent. Sovereignty is what allows tribal governments to abuse their power. Tribal governments do this through selective banishment of tribal members, manipulation of tribal employment rights, treating band members as their \u201csubjects\u201d, etc.\n\nA closer examination of Vine Deloria, Jr.\u2019s definition of tribal sovereignty reveals the intent of the term; continued cultural integrity. To the degree that a tribal nation loses its sense of cultural identity equates a loss of sovereignty. Tribal sovereignty was never about the tribal government, in Vine\u2019s definition, it was about the cultural integrity of the people and their ability to hold tribal government accountable for their words and deeds. Viewed through this lens Native Nations must reclaim their culture to achieve cultural sovereignty and ensure the survival of their tribes. But reclaiming our culture isn\u2019t solely the responsibility of our tribal leaders. We must as families, communities and tribal government work on this together. We can do this through practicing our ceremonies, speaking our language and practicing our traditional ways. Cultural sovereignty is something we can give ourselves and is separate from the trust responsibility of the federal government.\n\nIn her 2015 State of the Band Address, Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Chief Executive Melanie Benjamen, focused on the theme of cultural sovereignty.\n\n\u201cCultural Sovereignty is ancient, and predates the arrival of non-Indians. It is a kind of sovereignty that we can only lose if we choose to give it up\u2026Cultural Sovereignty is our inherent right to use our values, traditions, and spirituality to protect our future. It goes much deeper than legal sovereignty, because it\u2019s a decision to be Anishinaabe, to not just protect a way of life, but to practice living Anishinaabe, every day\u2026 In 2015, we still deal with the aftermath of 150 years of attempts to destroy our culture and our identity. Forced assimilation, attempted genocide, relocation and boarding schools might be a thing of the past, but the ghosts of those policies still haunt us today\u2026There are no federal policies forcing our children into boarding schools. There are no laws against us practicing our religion. Our cultural existence cannot be lost, or destroyed, unless we allow it\u2026Upon the advice of spiritual leaders and Elders, I am convinced that we must practice cultural sovereignty all day, every day, if we are to protect the gifts of our future generations.\u201d\n\nThere is a widespread federal attitude that supports our Native Nations sovereignty but only when it is politically advantageous to the colonists. It is disregarded when it is unprofitable. Indigenous people have shown incredible diversity in the face of centuries of federal policy aimed at the extermination of our people and yet our survival is in our own hands. The solution is to develop our cultural resources both our traditional ones and our new ones. Let\u2019s put sovereignty back in the hands of the indigenous community and out of the hands of the government.\n\nDonna Ennis is the Community Center Manager for Fond du Lac Reservation where she is also a respected Tribal Elder.
