But times have changed.\n\nAccording to a 2013 report from Moody\u2019s Investors Service, ambulatory service centers' same-location revenues have been growing in the low- to mid-single digits since 2007, while hospitals have seen same-facility inpatient surgery cases decline 0.22 percent annually.\n\nMost hospitals are adjusting. \u201cMany revenues that used to be generated from an inpatient setting are being diverted to outpatient settings,\u201d said Brad Spielman, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investor Services, and the lead writer of the company\u2019s new report, Building Value: Investments Aimed at New Priorities Create Opportunities for Not-For-Profit Hospitals.\n\nHospitals are investing more in outpatient facilities, from full-scale service centers to urgent care centers to standalone emergency departments, he noted. So intense is the drive to capture outpatient revenue that the strategy is approaching critical-mass status. \u201cCertain hospital-based systems are starting to have more than 50 percent of revenues generated outside of the inpatient setting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trend is accelerating and the scales are starting to tip a bit.\u201d\n\nThe movement is being propelled by many factors. They include consumers who are somewhat more mindful of receiving services at the lowest price point possible, and insurers and government payers focusing on trying to control the cost of healthcare, said Steve Kennedy, managing director at Lancaster Pollard. Healthcare services are also advancing, he noted. \u201c\u2026 there is greater efficiency in being able to treat certain illnesses and complete certain procedures that negate the necessity of having so many inpatient stays as before,\u201d he said.\n\nA new world\n\nHospitals have their work cut out in ensuring that their outpatient service investments succeed. For one thing, there is increased competition from new venues, such as CVS, Walgreens, Target, and other retail giants, that offer retail-based walk-in medical clinics that can treat minor injuries, including burns, which in the past might have sent some patients to the ER, as well as vaccinations, care for common illnesses, checkups and other health services.\n\nThat said, opportunities may be found amid the new competition. If retailers like these \u201ccan deliver healthcare at some point on the low acuity end of the healthcare spectrum more cost effectively than a healthcare system, why wouldn\u2019t the healthcare system reconsider whether or not to provide those same low-acuity services, or even look at partnering or associating with the low-cost provider?\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nSpielman points out that Cleveland Clinic already has a partnership with CVS Minute Clinic, and sees no reason why more such relationships wouldn\u2019t develop.\n\nHe also noted other non-traditional investments that have taken place. These include the 2012 acquisition by Dignity Health (the fifth largest health system in the nation and the largest hospital provider in California) of U.S. Healthworks, an independent operator of occupational medicine and urgent care centers.\n\nAnother challenge to hospitals trying to grow their outpatient services success may be the lack of strong ties to physicians. If hospitals don\u2019t have the right relationships \u2013 either through direct employment of doctors or other close alliances \u2013 they are less likely to find success with outpatient ventures, \u201csimply from the standpoint of just meeting staff levels and having the patient relationship already,\u201d said Spielman.\n\nFor any hospital considering more investment in outpatient services, Kennedy suggests that they explore their financing options carefully. \u201cDoes it make sense for them to be the real estate owner, or to lease that space?\u201d he said. For hospitals that employ physicians, the former option may be the better choice for new building plans. If employed physicians are to reside in the new building, the debt incurred in creating the structure can be tax-exempt, said Kennedy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique characteristic when talking about nonprofit hospital versus general for-profit industries,\u201d he noted. On the other hand, if the hospital\u2019s credit profile is not particularly strong, leasing outpatient site property \u2013 whether physicians are employed or not \u2013 may be the better bet, to avoid taking on additional long-term debt.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/changing-priorities-shift-hospital-focus-outpatient-strategies", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/1014-HFN-RCM-outpatient-Brad_Spielman.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "It wasn't all that long ago that most surgeries, and many medical and diagnostic procedures, required patients to plan for an inpatient hospital stay.
