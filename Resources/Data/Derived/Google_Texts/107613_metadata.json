Most of them speak little to no English.\n\nPatient assistance director Danny Tao says people come here to get free medical consultations and drug prescriptions. But, he says that when patients take those prescriptions to be filled, they don\u2019t understand the instructions on the label.\n\n\u201cThey go pick them up, and we don\u2019t exactly know if they\u2019re taking it or not \u2014 or if they know how to take it,\u201d Tao said.\n\nTao says drug labels at most pharmacies in California are printed only in English. That puts patients in danger of taking of any number or errors \u2014 taking too much medication or not enough, taking it at the wrong time of day, and more. Such mistakes can cause serious harm or even death.\n\nTao says that for the drugs his clinic supplies directly, all have a bilingual label.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be English/Chinese or English/Vietnamese,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time they get home they know exactly how to take the medication, because it\u2019s in their own language.\u201d\n\nThis week California\u2019s Board of Pharmacy will discuss new regulations that would require all pharmacies in California to provide translated labels on prescription drug bottles. Statewide, 44 percent of Californians speak a language other than English at home. New York approved a similar rule last year to make it easier for non-English speakers to take their medications properly and avoid costly mistakes.\n\nBut the board\u2019s executive officer Virginia Herold says the move is very controversial. For starters, there is a concern that requiring translated labels would require larger bottles of pills to fit all the text. But she says patients don\u2019t like larger bottles.\n\n\u201cThey decant the drug out of the large container, put it in a baggie or someplace else,\u201d Herold said. \u201cThere you\u2019ve separated the drug from the container, now the instructions on how to take it have been separated.\u201d\n\nPharmacists don\u2019t like the proposal because they say it opens them to liability if there\u2019s a mistake in the translation. Brian Warren is with the California Pharmacists Association.\n\n\u201cIf the label is translated into Russian and there\u2019s an error, and I\u2019m a pharmacist that does not speak Russian, I cannot verify that that error exists,\u201d Warren said.\n\nAt present, the state\u2019s board of pharmacy includes on its website translations of basic instructions such as \u201ctake one pill at bedtime\u201d in five languages: Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Korean, and Vietnamese.\n\nProponents of translating labels say that concerns about the change are outweighed by the problems patients who speak limited English face under the status quo.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk right now,\u201d said Sarah de Guia, director of government affairs for the California Pan Ethnic Health Network, an advocacy group. \u201cThey can\u2019t understand anything on their label because the label is not in their language.\u201d\n\nDe Guia says the expansion of insurance under the Affordable Care Act places more urgency on the issue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have 1.5 million more limited-English proficient individuals in the health care system now that the ACA has passed.\n\nThe discussions are in the earliest stages, and if new regulations go forward, many details need to be worked out, including how many languages press and who would have responsibility for translation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pharmacists worry about liability if there's an error in the translated drug label.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Resistance to Translating Prescription Drug Labels\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/29\\/resistance-to-translating-prescription-drug-labels\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-29 01:01:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-01 12:18:25\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20378,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/07\\/139551566.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Pharmacists worry about liability if there's an error in the translated drug label.", "title": "Resistance to Translating Prescription Drug Labels", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/29/resistance-to-translating-prescription-drug-labels/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/07/139551566-640x425.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For starters, there is a concern that requiring translated labels would require larger bottles of pills to fit all the text.\nTao says drug labels at most pharmacies in California are printed only in English.\nProponents of translating labels say that concerns about the change are outweighed by the problems patients who speak limited English face under the status quo.\nBut she says patients don\u2019t like larger bottles.\nPatient assistance director Danny Tao says people come here to get free medical consultations and drug prescriptions."}
