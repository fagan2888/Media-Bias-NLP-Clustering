He was also asked about signing former rival Martin Brodeur, an unrestricted free agent who is looking for a job.\n\nRoy\u2019s answers were no on both counts. He said Calvin Pickard and Sami Aittokallio, both 22, should be given a big-league chance like he and Brodeur got their chance in the early days of their star-studded careers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to see that. I don\u2019t think it would be pretty,\u201d Roy said about becoming a player/coach. \u201cWe better have those young guys (play).\u201d\n\nRoy, 49, said the 42-year-old Brodeur or another veteran goalie will not be sought, at least for now, though the Avs\u2019 top two goalies are injured. No. 1 Semyon Varlamov has a groin injury and is out for a week. His backup, Reto Berra, left Thursday\u2019s game at Ottawa early in the first period with a neck injury and is listed as day-to-day.\n\n\u201cIs it something that could change? Everything is possible (but) I\u2019d be very surprised,\u201d Roy said about adding a goalie. \u201cThe injury to Varly is not serious enough for us to panic, and same thing on Reto. \u2026 We want to see our young guys. We have to give them a chance.\u201d\n\nPickard was called up from the Lake Erie Monsters on Thursday, after the Avs decided to put Varlamov on injured reserve when his groin flared up during a morning skate.\n\n\u201cWe were very cautious. If we would have been in the playoffs he would have been playing in Ottawa,\u201d Roy said of Varlamov. \u201cBut it\u2019s early. It\u2019s early, it\u2019s not Game 59 or 60 right now. It\u2019s game No. 5, and I think it\u2019s important for him to be 100 percent every time he plays. And the way Reto was playing there was no reason for us to take any chances with Varly. But losing two goalies on the same day, totally bad luck.\u201d\n\nPickard made his NHL debut 2:46 into Thursday\u2019s game, replacing Berra, who had a collision in the crease with a Senators player. Pickard played well until the third period, and the turnover-prone Avs blew a 3-1 lead and lost 5-3.\n\n\u201cThe big picture is, (Pickard) came in after traveling all day from Cleveland,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt was a tough situation.\u201d\n\nAittokallio was the Monsters\u2019 originally scheduled starter Friday night in Chicago. He got the callup at 3 a.m. Friday and practiced with the Avs on little sleep in the afternoon at the Montreal Canadiens\u2019 practice rink. He realizes he might not dress Saturday if Berra is cleared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to show what I can do and just be here, get the experience,\u201d Aittokallio said. \u201cThese guys help me get better.\u201d\n\nIf Berra is not cleared Saturday, Pickard will start against the Canadiens and Aittokallio will serve as his backup. Varlamov continues to work with trainers on the trip, so the Avs have four goalies in tow \u2014 plus Roy.\n\nRoy, the Hall of Famer, can\u2019t recall seeing two goalies hurt on the same day.\n\n\u201cIn all my years, I don\u2019t remember seeing such a thing,\u201d he said.\n\nTo make room for Aittokallio on the 23-man roster, forward Dennis Everberg was demoted to Lake Erie.s\n\nThe Avs are carrying 12 forwards and eight defensemen along with their three goalies.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patrick Roy to lean on young goalies if Reto Berra can\u2019t play vs. Montreal", "title": "Patrick Roy to lean on young goalies if Reto Berra can\u2019t play vs. Montreal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/17/patrick-roy-to-lean-on-young-goalies-if-reto-berra-cant-play-vs-montreal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141017__Aittokalliop1.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141017__Aittokalliop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-17T08:24:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:31:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Varlamov continues to work with trainers on the trip, so the Avs have four goalies in tow \u2014 plus Roy.\nHis backup, Reto Berra, left Thursday\u2019s game at Ottawa early in the first period with a neck injury and is listed as day-to-day.\nRoy, the Hall of Famer, can\u2019t recall seeing two goalies hurt on the same day.\nIf we would have been in the playoffs he would have been playing in Ottawa,\u201d Roy said of Varlamov.\nI don\u2019t think it would be pretty,\u201d Roy said about becoming a player/coach."}
