Of the other 47 most damaging hurricanes, female-named storms killed an average of 45 people, compared to 23 for the storms named after men, the study found. The disparity was even greater if the male name was very masculine, and the female name very feminine-sounding, the researchers said.\n\nThere\u2019s some trouble with this study \u2013 the sample size is rather small, and storms were named only after women until the 1970s. But it offers some useful guidelines for women as well as men.\n\nLet\u2019s not pretend that names mean nothing. Name your kid \u201cJeeves,\u201d and you might as well buy him a butler\u2019s outfit now. People with two middle names and initials after their names are probably going to be perceived as being more important (even if they are not). And if you give a girl a perfectly good name like Elaine, but then spell it in some ridiculous way (Ilaynh, with a silent \u201ch\u201d), well, then your daughter deserves whatever headaches and verbal abuse she gets once she\u2019s old enough to change the spelling of her name legally and, while she\u2019s at it, disown you as parents. Even pets pose a conundrum. It\u2019s just so hard to discipline a dog or cat who has some cutesy name. \u201cStop that right now, Snowball!\u201d just doesn\u2019t sound all that menacing.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Energy Policy]\n\nSo who knows whether people subconsciously take a hurricane less seriously, or imagine it to be less powerful, if it\u2019s a female storm instead of a male storm? If women can\u2019t stop it, they should use it.\n\nForget about arguing until you\u2019re blue in the face that you should be paid at least what men are paid for doing the same job. Forget about trying to explain that a female U.S. Senator who is unhappy that the CIA was allegedly hacking into her staff\u2019s computers is not being \u201cemotional.\u201d She\u2019s being rightfully indignant over the invasion. And don\u2019t bother pointing out the irony when your male colleague arrives late, noting that he was helping his kid pick out her dress for school, and people think it\u2019s just adorable, but when you leave a half hour early because your child has a 102-degree fever, people roll their eyes and deem you unreliable and destined for the \u201cmommy track.\u201d\n\nNo, women, there\u2019s only one strategic lesson to be learned here, and it comes down to this slogan: Take us seriously, or we\u2019ll kill you.\n\nOf course, that will be meant metaphorically, and if you do indeed die, it will only be because you yourself failed \u2013 refused, really \u2013 to honor our power. So when Hurricane Hillary (Clinton) or Hurricane Marissa (Mayer) or Hurricane Sheryl (Sandberg) or Hurricane Janet (Yellen) or Hurricane Meg (Whitman) or Hurricane Samantha (Power) or any of the other of Forbes\u2019 top 100 most powerful women blow through your neighborhood, you\u2019d better be prepared. It\u2019s not just common sense. It\u2019s your whole future.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Study Says Female-Named Hurricanes Kill More Than Male-Named Ones", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Female-named hurricanes are deadlier than others because people take them less seriously.", "title": "This Is the Story of the Female Hurricane", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/06/03/study-says-female-named-hurricanes-kill-more-than-male-named-ones", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3e/f6c5202066ce932fbd3f09af452fa2/34321FE_DA_121029SandyNASA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Female-named hurricanes are deadlier than others because people take them less seriously.", "card": "summary", "title": "Study Says Female-Named Hurricanes Kill More Than Male-Named Ones"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,sexism,hurricanes,Hurricane Sandy,Hurricane Katrina,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Female-named hurricanes are deadlier than others because people take them less seriously."}, "article_summary": "Of the other 47 most damaging hurricanes, female-named storms killed an average of 45 people, compared to 23 for the storms named after men, the study found.\nThere\u2019s some trouble with this study \u2013 the sample size is rather small, and storms were named only after women until the 1970s.\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Energy Policy]So who knows whether people subconsciously take a hurricane less seriously, or imagine it to be less powerful, if it\u2019s a female storm instead of a male storm?\nThe disparity was even greater if the male name was very masculine, and the female name very feminine-sounding, the researchers said.\nPeople with two middle names and initials after their names are probably going to be perceived as being more important (even if they are not)."}
