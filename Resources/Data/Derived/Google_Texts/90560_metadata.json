As a consequence of the massive buildup of supply that flooded world markets, oil prices slumped by more than half, placing intense pressure on domestic energy producers.\n\nRead MoreThe 30-year old prince who is changing the world\n\nIn the research note released on Saturday, Goldman estimated that the level at which U.S. producers would need to breakeven is somewhere within a range of $45 to $80. On Friday, crude closed below $40 per barrel.\n\nGiven current levels of crude, the crumbling of capital expenditures is a net drag on economic growth, Goldman notes. It added that oil would need to climb back to $70 at least to give energy capital spending a second wind.\n\n\"Adding up, we conclude that the net effect of cheap oil on growth has probably been negative so far, with the capex collapse outweighing the consumption boost,\" analysts wrote.\n\n\"But going forward, the net effect is likely to be neutral at worst under our $30 scenario, but would be moderately positive if oil prices rebound to $50 or $70, reflecting the outsized impact of price changes in this crucial range on energy capex and production,\" it added.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Goldman Sachs explained that the net effects of cheaper crude on growth have been \"negative so far,\" given the impact on oil producers.", "author": "Javier E.
