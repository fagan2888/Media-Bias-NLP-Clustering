And as Anne Arundel County student Joshua Welch is learning, once something goes on it, it\u2019s not easy to get it cleaned up.\n\nBack in the winter of 2013, Welch, then a 7-year-old second grader at Park Elementary School in Baltimore, was suspended for two days after allegedly chewing his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun. At the time, Welch claimed he\u2019d been fashioning it into a mountain, but admitted he knew he was \u201cin big trouble\u201d when the teacher got \u201cpretty mad\u201d when she saw it. His family was informed of the incident, and every student in the class was sent home with a letter informing families that \u201cA student used food to make an inappropriate gesture.\u201d His father said the school claimed Welch had incriminatingly said, \u201cBang! Bang!\u201d while brandishing the treat, and, of course, the NRA swiftly seized upon the publicity of the story to give the child a permanent membership.\n\nNow, a year and a half later, Welch\u2019s family say the kid\u2019s learned his lesson, and that they want the episode struck from his school records. But Bob Mosier of Anne Arundel County Public Schools says that the pastry episode was not an isolated one. \u201cThis has never been about a gun, this has never been about a single incident,\u201d he told the local CBS news Wednesday. \u201cEven Josh, in his own testimony, acknowledges that it\u2019s not about a gun, it\u2019s about his ongoing behavior.\u201d And school board member Teresa Milio Birge, disputing the family attorney\u2019s claim that the child had been unfairly \u201cbranded\u201d by the suspension, told the Baltimore Sun, \u201cNo one would have known about the suspension at all if his father hadn\u2019t gone to the news and this case hadn\u2019t been public. How is the school system branding him, or is it really you and his father that are doing the branding?\u201d The boy, who is now 9 and attends a different school, reportedly has ADHD.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A family fights over an alleged \"gun\" incident", "title": "Why is a pastry on a kid\u2019s permanent record?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A family fights over an alleged \"gun\" incident", "title": "Why is a pastry on a kid\u2019s permanent record?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/04/why_is_a_pastry_on_a_kids_permanent_record/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/joshua_welch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A family fights over an alleged \"gun\" incident", "title": "Why is a pastry on a kid\u2019s permanent record?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/joshua_welch.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Guns, Joshua Welch, NRA, School Violence, schools", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But Bob Mosier of Anne Arundel County Public Schools says that the pastry episode was not an isolated one.\nTopics: Guns, Joshua Welch, NRA, School Violence, schools, Life NewsIn case you\u2019ve ever wondered if the whole \u201cThis is going on your permanent record\u201d threat from your teachers was a real thing, it is.\nAnd as Anne Arundel County student Joshua Welch is learning, once something goes on it, it\u2019s not easy to get it cleaned up.\nNow, a year and a half later, Welch\u2019s family say the kid\u2019s learned his lesson, and that they want the episode struck from his school records.\nBang!\u201d while brandishing the treat, and, of course, the NRA swiftly seized upon the publicity of the story to give the child a permanent membership."}
