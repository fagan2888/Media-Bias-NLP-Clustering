Or deliver it to a fan. Or really not let it out of his grip until the points are confirmed on the scoreboard. After all, some of his teammates were already celebrating his pick six on Thursday in the fourth quarter of the Broncos\u2019 49-27 victory over Baltimore when they realized Trevathan had actually fumbled the ball on the one-yard line.\n\nIt was supposed to be a celebration toss. Instead, it was a fumble, and it cost the Broncos a touchdown and Trevathan the first score of his NFL career.\n\n\u201cMan, it was just a little mistake,\u201d Trevathan said after the game. \u201cI think it was kind of selfish. That\u2019s the type of player I am. I\u2019ll take full responsibility, and I\u2019ll grow from it.\u201d\n\nEven after the big win, Trevathan didn\u2019t make any excuses for fumbling the ball just inches before he stepped into the end zone. It stung, but the fact that it came in a 49-27 Broncos blowout win must have helped.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I knew it was all on me, dropping the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cI really did not mean to do that. I was just so caught up in the moment.\u201d\n\nTrevathan may not have cost his team its opening night win, but he did incur the wrath \u2013 and laughter \u2013 of his fan base and teammates. As he ran off the field after the clock wound to zero, he was the subject of plenty of heckling, including from defensive end Derek Wolfe. No margin of victory was going to erase the sheer carelessness of the play.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019ll be dwelling on the mistake for too long, though, especially when he\u2019s already talking about next time. That\u2019s the right mindset to have, according to teammate Julius Thomas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my fair share of mistakes,\u201d the third-year tight end said. \u201cI know that\u2019s something he\u2019s going to learn from. I had a fumble early in the preseason, and that\u2019s what\u2019s sticking in my head. I\u2019ve been concentrating on ball security. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll do the same. I hope he makes another interception, runs one in and holds onto it that time.\u201d\n\njniesen@denverpost.com\n\n@JoanNiesen", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Broncos,Danny Trevathan,Denver,NFL,Ravens,Thomas,Trevathan,Wolfe", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "It was supposed to be a celebration toss.
