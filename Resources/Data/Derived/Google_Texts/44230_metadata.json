Glib, superficial, and shamelessly black and white in its characterization of the timeless battle between the classes, it was still fairly entertaining at times.\n\n(Bugatti fans, rest assured your favorite automobile maker will go into the spaceship business sometime in the distant future.)\n\nHowever, the film featured a piece of technology that was completely out of place, given the movie's far-flung temporal setting...\n\nThe reason I say out of place is because a device very similar to the one that Damon wore for half of the movie is already in development today (minus a few 22nd century embellishments).\n\n\n\nThat device is the powered exoskeleton, or simply, the exosuit.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this technology, the concept behind its function is simple: It takes the physical abilities of your body and, using electrical motors and/or hydraulic power, multiplies those abilities by orders of magnitude.\n\nI first learned of this startling device several years ago, while watching a Discovery Channel show on the future of battlefield technology.\n\nAs its name implies, the exosuit is worn like a suit. The device allows a man of average physical size and capability to lift 200-pound weights like they were teddy bears, tossing them tirelessly one after another.\n\nThe exoskeleton works on a principal of muscle-actuation. Built into the device are a number of pressure points, which, when triggered by even the slightest contact with flesh, reinforce the movement of the extremity much like the power steering in your car assists the natural rotational motion imparted by your arms and hands to the steering wheel.\n\nOnly the exosuit does so on a multitude of axes...\n\nFor military and industrial purposes, such a device would be invaluable.\n\nInstead of bulky forklifts, a single man wearing one of these devices will be able to handle objects many times his bodyweight with infinitely more control and dexterity.\n\nAs you can see from Raytheon's (RTN-NYSE) XOS 2 powered exoskeleton, pictured below, the resemblance to Matt Damon's rig is striking:\n\nAnd once armor is added, as the same Discovery Channel presentation implied it soon would be, we will start to see an entirely new era in land warfare.\n\nBut let's not get overly excited about the future of battlefield technology just yet, as there is a much brighter side to this story...\n\nAnd that positive side is the plethora of application possibilities in the field of advanced biomechanics.\n\nPatients suffering from various degenerative neurological and muscular disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, as well as victims of spinal trauma will eventually be able to recover their pre-injury/disease functionality \u2014 and perhaps even surpass it by many lengths.\n\nIn fact, we're already seeing this today...\n\nAt the moment, Haifa-based Argo Medical Technologies (which currently markets the first commercially available exosuit, called the Rewalk), Berkeley-based Ekso Bionics, and publicly traded Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE: PH) of Cleveland are three notable front-runners in the development of these systems for the biomedical market.\n\nPictured below is Argo's Rewalk lower-extremity exoskeleton.\n\nThe man wearing it, believe it or not, is paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nAnother user, Claire Lomas, who was left without the use of her legs after an equestrian accident shattered her T6 vertebra, became the Rewalk's most famous customer when she used one to complete the London Marathon in 2012.\n\nThis is not science fiction, dear reader...\n\nThe technology is that life altering.\n\nArgo, Ekso, and Parker Hannifin all focus on the biomedical application of exosuits, but, as one might expect, the military isn't resting on its laurels...\n\nIn addition to Raytheon's evil-looking XOS 2, the Defense Department is helping to fund research and development of similar exoskeletons at UC Berkeley. So a variety of militarized versions are not far off.\n\nAs with any newly introduced and revolutionary technology, widespread commercial acceptance might take time (the Rewalk retails for $62,000 in the United States). However, it will not take nearly as long as the producers of Elysium imply.\n\nWith any luck, in a decade or less, you may see exosuits begin to supplant the wheelchair as a crucial life-improving mechanism for the sick and the injured.\n\nThe future is closer than you think.\n\nTo your wealth,\n\nBrian Hicks\n\nBrian is a founding member and President of Angel Publishing and investment director for the income and dividend newsletter The Wealth Advisory.
