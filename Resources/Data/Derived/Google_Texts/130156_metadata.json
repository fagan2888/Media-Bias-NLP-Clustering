We all cringe when Cameron famously \u201cgoes berserk\u201d and kicks his parents\u2019 Ferrari into the ravine. When I saw the film for the first time, there\u2019s no doubt it made me think about how much trouble I\u2019d be in if my parents\u2019 shiny car had been damaged.\n\nThe film came out in 1986 \u2014 just a few years into the era of the Millennial \u2014 the least likely group to be engaged with insurers, according to a 2014 Gallup Poll. In a survey cited by Property Casualty 360, \u201conly 64 percent of them have car insurance, 10 percent have homeowners insurance and 13 percent have renters insurance.\u201d\n\nWhy? What\u2019s holding Millennials back from protecting themselves? What they don\u2019t know might be hurting them.\n\nAs the 88th Academy Awards approach on Sunday, and the public looks to a new crop of favorite films, I looked to some of the generation\u2019s most beloved films to explain why Millennials shouldn\u2019t ignore their personal insurance needs.\n\nFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off : Auto Insurance \u2014 Though it\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll kick your car off a cliff in a fit of rage like Cameron, it\u2019s more likely you\u2019ll get in a fender bender at some point. If you drive a sedan, truck, motorcycle, SUV, hybrid, pickup truck or even a classic car, auto or motorcycle, insurance can offer you financial protection against physical damage and bodily injury resulting from an accident.\n\nThe Hobbit: Jewelry Insurance \u2014 The wedding industry has built up the importance of the engagement ring in the minds of this generation. The rule of thumb is to spend one to three months salary on the ring, but what happens when the ring owner drops his or her beloved gem down the sink or loses the ring before it\u2019s safely down the aisle? In The Hobbit, Gollum could\u2019ve used insurance when losing the One Ring in the caverns beneath the Misty Mountains. Don\u2019t be like Gollum. Insurance can be purchased as part of your renters or homeowners insurance policy or through a company that specializes in jewelry insurance.\n\nSkyfall: Health Insurance \u2014 Only James Bond has 23 lives, er films. But most of us aren\u2019t unconquerable secret agents. Besides the fact that the Affordable Care Act requires health insurance (or a tax penalty), regular preventative checkups, made affordable through health insurance, can ward off illness and save you from potentially crippling healthcare costs down the line.\n\nHome Alone 2: Renters and Homeowners Insurance \u2014 In Home Alone 2, Kevin McCallister visits his Uncle Ron\u2019s vacant New York townhouse, damaging the home with concrete powder, bird seed, and kerosene. Although Kevin-like behavior is unlikely at your home, common activities such as forgetting to turn off the faucet or blow out a candle can be damaging. We recently had a client come to us after leaving the water running in their apartment. They didn\u2019t have renters insurance, leaving them liable for the damage to their own personal property and apartment as well as the property belonging to their downstairs neighbor.\n\nJaws: Watercraft Insurance \u2014 In a boating community like San Diego, Millennials should at least be aware that watercraft insurance exists. There is debate about when the Millennial generation begins, but some sources define the generation as being born as far back as 1980, making some of them in their mid-30s and definitely old enough to own water toys. Decisions about watercraft insurance can be complex \u2014 are you protected against collisions, fire, theft, vandalism, and 4,500-pound sharks? An insurance agent can walk you through the process.\n\nAccording to Property Casualty 360, Millennials\u2019 desire for immediacy explains why \u201c18-29-year-olds are 50 percent less likely than their parents to purchase (insurance) from local representatives.\u201d The good news is that today\u2019s insurance industry can meet that reluctance with immediate advice and assistance.\n\nMike Fusco, a New Jersey native, began his insurance career in 2002 shortly after relocating to San Diego. Prior to his move, he studied at the University of Maryland, and graduated from the Robert H. Smith School of Business. In 2010 he was named president of San Diego-based Fusco & Orsini Insurance Services. His independent insurance agency offers a wide range of business and personal insurance products.\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
