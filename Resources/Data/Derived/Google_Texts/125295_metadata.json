In a message to Congress, the President admonished the legislative body's effort to overturn the health care law, saying (via The Hill), \"Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs.\"\n\nThe bill sought to override the mandate that required individuals to purchase health insurance and employers to provide coverage for employees. It would have prevented the extension of Medicaid as well as federal subsidies for lower-income Americans purchasing health insurance. Additionally, it would have terminated over $450 million in federal funding to Planned Parenthood, a figure that, according to a report from the Associated Press, accounts for nearly a third of the organization's annual budget.\n\nThough more than 17 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage since Obamacare's inception, congressional Republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal the law (over 50 attempts have been made since the President signed the bill in 2010). This is the first instance in which an attempt to overturn the legislation has passed through both the House and Senate.\n\nCongress expected the President to veto the bill, but Republicans view the measure as a step in the right direction. \"We have now shown that there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Friday. \"Next year, if we're sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law. Obamacare will be gone.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama vetoed a bill on Friday that would both repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2014more commonly known as Obamacare\u2014and defund Planned Parenthood.
