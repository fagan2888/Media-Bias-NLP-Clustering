Per her request, I sent her a list of the elements that her kids (ages seven, five, and three) might find scary: Rampaging snow monster, heroine freezing into solid ice, seemingly noble prince who turns out to be evil. My friend quickly texted back to say that the prince sounded scariest of all. And she was right. In Frozen, our heroine Princess Anna embarks on a quest to bring back her sister, Elsa, who has run away after inadvertently revealing her magical, winter-creating powers. Elsa accidentally strikes Anna with a shard of ice that pierces her heart; Anna believes that a kiss from the charming Prince Hans, whom she thinks is her true love, will save her from death. But just when he should be saving the princess, the male lead reveals himself to be a greedy, throne-usurping would-be killer: Hans leans in, supposedly about to give her that kiss ... then sneers, \u201cOh, Anna, if only there were someone who loved you.\u201d\n\nRelated Story You Can Do Anything: Must Every Kids' Movie Reinforce the Cult of Self-Esteem? Ouch. That moment would have wrecked me if I\u2019d seen it as a child, and the makers of Frozen couldn\u2019t have picked a more surefire way to unsettle its young audience members. It\u2019s not like Disney has never given us heartbreaking moments before. (Bambi\u2019s mother, anyone?) And it\u2019s not that there\u2019s no purpose behind the film\u2019s cruel twist, either: The na\u00efve and lonely Anna has fallen in love with and become engaged to Hans in the course of just one day. As her other love interest, Kristoff, tells her, this is not exactly indicative of good judgment. However, there is something uniquely horrifying about finding out that a person\u2014even a fictional person\u2014who\u2019s won you over is, in fact, rotten to the core. And it\u2019s that much more traumatizing when you\u2019re six or seven years old. Children will, in their lifetimes, necessarily learn that not everyone who looks or seems trustworthy is trustworthy\u2014but Frozen\u2019s big twist is a needlessly upsetting way to teach that lesson. Before the shattering reveal takes place, the audience has already enjoyed more than an hour of Hans\u2019s niceness. He\u2019s kind to people and animals; he saves Anna\u2019s sister, Elsa, from being killed; he even offers free winter cloaks and soup to the poor. \"Not only is Anna fooled by him, but the audience is as well. This makes Hans one of the sneakiest and most sinister Disney villains.\" It seems strange, then, to argue in this context, \u201cDon\u2019t give your heart to someone you don\u2019t know,\u201d when we as an audience get to know Hans better than almost any other Disney prince before him. He isn\u2019t just a handsomely vague presence who dances divinely, like Cinderella\u2019s prince, or a prince who only shows up at the beginning and end of the movie, like Snow White\u2019s prince. Hans even comes across as a nice, normal person when no one\u2019s watching him, gazing with frank and friendly interest after Anna as though he really likes her, rather than obviously seeing her as a stepping-stone to the throne. Hans has personality, and, more importantly, character\u2014or so it appears.\n\nThere are those who point out moments in which Hans signals beforehand that he might not be all he seems. But even Frozen\u2019s biggest fans acknowledge that these are blink-and-you-miss-it moments. They\u2019re so short they really shouldn\u2019t even be called moments. More like nanoseconds. \u201cNot only is Anna fooled by him, but the audience [is] as well,\u201d reads the Frozen Wikia page on Prince Hans. \u201cThis makes Hans one of the sneakiest and most sinister Disney villains.\u201d But Hans\u2019s revelation feels so abrupt that it seems more like a poor writing choice than like a clever concealment of the truth. I\u2019m not saying Frozen is a bad movie; for the most part, it\u2019s actually a pretty good movie. It\u2019s sweet and funny, and shows\u2014through the actions of Anna, Kristoff, Elsa, and others\u2014what real love actually looks like and what it can accomplish. And if it had been a movie made for adults, we might be hailing it as sophisticated and smart for its knowing subversion of classic tropes, and its reminder that \u201cone may smile, and smile, and be a villain.\u201d If it had been a movie made for adults, we might be hailing it as sophisticated and smart for its knowing subversion of classic tropes. But young children, in general, are not that sophisticated. They're more like the viewers of old melodramas, wanting the hero and villain clearly delineated from the start, so they can enthusiastically cheer and boo in the right places. And in real life, there are certain people whom kids are taught to trust and consider \u201cheroes\u201d rather than \u201cvillains\u201d: Mommy, Daddy, family friends, teachers, neighbors, firemen. In real life, of course, there are tragic situations in which a child\u2019s trust is misplaced, and that child has to be protected from those who were supposed to take care of him or her. But isn\u2019t that all the more reason for stories to function as a safe place, where children can find role models and people to trust? As C.S. Lewis put it in his essay \u201cOn Three Ways of Writing for Children,\u201d \u201cSince it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage.\u201d (Lewis, it\u2019s worth pointing out, was arguing against those who took the position that fairy tales are too frightening for children. Were he alive today, though, the existence of Frozen suggests that he might find himself arguing against those who wanted to make them overly frightening.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Disney hit is a good, subversive kids&#39; film\u2014until a needlessly jarring surprise at the end.", "author": "Gina Dalfonzo", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The Disney hit is a good, subversive kids&#39; film\u2014until a needlessly jarring surprise at the end.", "title": "Frozen's Cynical Twist on Prince Charming", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/frozen/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/-em-frozen-em-s-cynical-twist-on-prince-charming/282204/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b11\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNot only is Anna fooled by him, but the audience [is] as well,\u201d reads the Frozen Wikia page on Prince Hans.\nHe isn\u2019t just a handsomely vague presence who dances divinely, like Cinderella\u2019s prince, or a prince who only shows up at the beginning and end of the movie, like Snow White\u2019s prince.\nElsa accidentally strikes Anna with a shard of ice that pierces her heart; Anna believes that a kiss from the charming Prince Hans, whom she thinks is her true love, will save her from death.\nChildren will, in their lifetimes, necessarily learn that not everyone who looks or seems trustworthy is trustworthy\u2014but Frozen\u2019s big twist is a needlessly upsetting way to teach that lesson.\nThere are those who point out moments in which Hans signals beforehand that he might not be all he seems."}
