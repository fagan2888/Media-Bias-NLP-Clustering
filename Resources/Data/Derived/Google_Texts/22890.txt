Sam Graves: sore loser, irrational politician.

Make no mistake: The reason that the federal government is currently shut down is because a minority faction of extremely conservative Republicans believe they can hold the government hostage in order to delay and ultimately repeal a law - the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare - that is literally already a law. That is not the way the U.S. Constitution works. After passing through both houses of Congress, Obamacare was signed into law in 2010. The law was then legally challenged and upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2012. Then a few months later, Obama was re-elected by 5 million votes.

Left with no other play, these radical "Tea Party" Republicans are refusing to pass a spending bill to fund the federal government unless that bill delays the implementation of Obamacare by one year. That demand is basically unprecedented in American politics and completely out of step with the American public's wishes. It's even out of step with a lot of Republicans' wishes.

Who are the House Republicans responsible for this nonsense? What kind of sore loser is also so reckless as to be willing to furlough 800,000 federal employees because a bill he/she didn't like was signed into law? It turns out that some of these irrational politicians are from around here! Maybe you should call them or e-mail them or engage them on social media, and ask them why they're not acting in the best interests of their constituents?
