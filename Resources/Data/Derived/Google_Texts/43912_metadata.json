But in some states, it found rates are soaring.\n\n\"There are specific states with exorbitant increases,\" Gottlieb said. \"Delaware had 100 percent increase, Florida had a 37 percent increase, Pennsylvania 28 percent increase, California had a 53 percent increase in their premiums.\"\n\nRates vary widely, often depending on the state and how highly regulated it was to begin with. Analysts, however, say the main reasons for the higher costs are not medical inflation, but rather the requirements of ObamaCare itself.\n\n\"There are certain regulations and certain requirements that had to be in there. And because of that it's driven up the costs of these benefits,\" said John DiVito of the Flexible Benefit Service Corporation, which represents hundreds of agents.Rate hikes include ten essential health benefits along with more than 20,000 pages or regulations.\n\nThe reported hikes are for the first policies issued under ObamaCare in 2014.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office or CBO issued a report Monday saying the average premium for the silver plan this year will be $3,800, or just over $300 a month, rising to $4,400 in 2016, 15 percent below its earlier estimates in 2009.\n\nThose early, higher estimates make costs now look better \u2013 but that does not include deductibles of as much as $5,000.\n\nBut the estimates are comforting to the White House.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney says, \"It shows that marketplace health care costs have gone down because premium estimates have gone down.\"\n\nThe CBO also projects future premium increases over the next decade.\n\nInsurance companies will soon have to set rates for 2015, and analysts fear reported higher costs now will mean increases next year, as well.\n\n\"They're going to see an announcement that next year's premium's going to be 25 percent or maybe 50 percent higher than what they're now paying,\" says John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis.\n\nJohn Divito of Flexible Benefit Service Corporation said, \"we're reading studies where the rates could be 10 to 30, 40 percent higher. Again, it all depends geographically where these rates are being looked at but definitely an increase in rates.\"\n\nScott Gottlieb, a medical doctor as well as an analyst, added, \"We've seen insurance premiums go up quite a bit over the period in which ObamaCare started to get implemented.\"\n\nInsurance executives say the same thing. Marc Bertolini, CEO of Aetna, recently told an earning conference that he anticipates 2014 spikes of 20 to 50 percent, going as high as 100 percent in some markets.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
