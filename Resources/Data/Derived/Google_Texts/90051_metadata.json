It was an odd combination, but that's why it might work.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama visits students during a spin class while on a tour of the West Side High School earlier this month in New York.\n\nMichelle Obama may be pushing the envelope this time.\n\nTo promote her big issues of smart eating and healthy lifestyles she\u2019s appeared in a wide array of video venues. She\u2019s done pushups on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" and promoted dog-walking for exercise on \"The Puppy Bowl.\" She was on \"The Biggest Loser,\" pushing weight loss. On \"Sesame Street,\" she talked home garden seeds.\n\nNow she\u2019s appearing on \u201cBilly on the Street,\u201d a sort-of game show on the Funny or Die web comedy network. It features, among other things, host Billy Eichner venturing on to the streets of New York to accost passers-by and ask them questions about pop culture. And we do mean \u201caccost\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s lots of yelling. Some show segments have titles that include terms for genitalia. The level of pop culture knowledge displayed is extreme.\n\nRecommended: Michelle Obama: How well do you know the first lady?\n\nIn other words, an adult show. Which is fine. This is not iCarly.\n\nMaybe FLOTUS is taking a lesson from POTUS. In quest of signees for the Affordable Care Act, President Obama has appeared on \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d a fake Funny or Die talk show, as well as granted an interview to YouTube comedian GloZell. Oh, and made a video which included use of a selfie stick. As a result he\u2019s reached a lot of viewers but also drawn criticism from some Republicans who think he\u2019s demeaning the office.\n\nBut here\u2019s the issue: On \u201cBilly,\u201d Mrs. Obama has Big Bird in tow. They\u2019re hawking a new line of \"Sesame Street\"-themed healthy food packaging named \u201ceat brighter.\u201d How does the audience for that intersect with the audience for a show that features the first lady pushing the host down a food aisle in a grocery cart while he recites Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Oscar acceptance speech for \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d?\n\nElena, a \u201cBilly\u201d regular, shows up as a co-contestant. They play a round of a quiz called \u201cAriana Grande or Eating a Carrot?\u201d\n\nSix-year-olds are not watching that. They don\u2019t even understand it. Are their parents? Not sure, but the show gave off a young and single urbanite vibe to us. Maybe Millennials respond to Elmo-brand snap peas.\n\nThat said, we did like the part where Mr. Eichner asked his guest \u201cWho is more deserving of a Kennedy Center honor, Martin Short or a box of corn?\u201d Mrs. Obama answered \u201ca box of corn,\u201d which was wrong, wrong, wrong, according to the host.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a genius, he played Ed Grimley!\u201d yelled Eichner.\n\nAlso there was a funny bit where he apologizes for accidentally touching the first lady, and she says, \u201cThat\u2019s OK, but watch it. You could get shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cA ha ha, fruits and vegetables, this is so much fun! I could die at any moment!\u201d Eichner replies.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s our imagination but that\u2019s a point at which Mrs. Obama looked genuinely amused.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "e25fd7f9806b2ca2a33b948ab287d9b7", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "Michelle Obama appeared on 'Billy on the Street,' a racy online show, with Big Bird to promote healthy lifestyles.
