But political comedian Dean Obeidallah points out at The Daily Beast that the terrorist group/fundamentalist state has become a popular target of entertainers across the Middle East.

It ends with an off-tune dig to the effect that ISIS is more interested in terrorizing Arabs than in tormenting Israelis.\n\nWhich, again, is better than some of the material that Saturday Night Live has inflicted on its audience.\n\nWhatever their quality, the comedic attacks, Obeidallah emphasizes, are a means for people across the region to defy ISIS. For comics in Syria and Iraq, that defiance potentially risks serious consequences, since entertainers face death for poking fun at the group.\n\nRead the whole piece here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Can an army of bloodthirsty theocrats survive a brutal ribbing?
