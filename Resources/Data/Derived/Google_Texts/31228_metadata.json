Johnson was named the best studio host (TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d).\n\nBut Johnson didn\u2019t take home his award.\n\nAfter accepting, he called Taelor and Sydni, the teenage daughters of the late Stuart Scott, to the stage and presented them with the award, telling them and the audience: \u201cStuart deserved this award.\u201d\n\nScott, a longtime ESPN broadcaster, was 49 when he died of cancer in January.\n\nJohnson, a cancer survivor, noted that he and Scott talked regularly about living \u2014 and fighting the disease.\n\nLast week\u2019s coverage shows the audience at the Lincoln Center, filled with emotion, standing and paying tribute to Johnson \u2014 and to Scott.\n\nCritics of Emmy Awards shows often claim that the statues are passed out like grocery store coupons and that winners are forgotten.\n\nBut last week\u2019s ceremony will be remembered because of its genuine emotion. The event produced anything but a deflated evening.\n\nOther winners in major categories:\n\n\u2022 Sports live special \u2014 Super Bowl XLIX, Patriots vs. Seahawks (NBC).\n\n\u2022 Sports series \u2014 NASCAR coverage (Fox).\n\n\u2022 Studio show, weekly \u2014 \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d (ESPN).\n\n\u2022 Studio show, daily \u2014 \u201cMLB Tonight\u201d (MLB Network).\n\n\u2022 Sports news anthology \u2014 \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d (HBO).\n\n\u2022 Sports journalism \u2014 \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d (HBO).\n\n\u2022 Sports documentary series \u2014 \u201c30 for 30\u2033( ESPN) and \u201cAll Access\u201d (Showtime).\n\n\u2022 Live play-by-play \u2014 Mike Emrick (NBC and NBC Sports Network).\n\n\u2022 Live studio analyst \u2014 Harold Rey- nolds (MLB Network).\n\n\u2022 Live action analyst \u2014 Cris Collinsworth (NBC).\n\nSpooky setting. If Rod Serling were alive, he might have created a TV scenario by working in the Coors Field broadcasting booth Wednesday when the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the Rockies 5-1.\n\nSerling, as his numerous fans are aware, created \u201cThe Twilight Zone,\u201d which featured dramas that turned everyday events into weird, macabre settings.\n\nThe Root Sports telecast Wednesday had such ingredients during the rainy conditions at a nearly empty ballpark.\n\nThe cameras roamed the field, the stands and the dugouts providing views of what Serling might have called \u201chumans surviving in an unusual environment \u2014 their twilight zone.\u201d\n\nFight fallout. Veteran broadcaster Jim Lampley joined the chorus of voices expressing disappointment \u2014 even disgust \u2014 about the \u201cFight of the Century\u201d matching Floyd Mayweather Jr. against Manny Pacquiao on May 2. Lampley, as the announcer, had a ringside view.\n\nIn an interview with Rich Eisen on DirecTV last week, Lampley said the event was \u201chighly unfortunate for boxing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel terrible for those fans who spent four figures for a ticket. \u2026 I feel bad for the people who spent nearly $100 on pay-per-view who were never given proper information in advance about what they might be seeing,\u201d Lampley said.\n\nLampley was referencing that Pacquiao, after the fight, announced that he knew beforehand he was suffering from a shoulder injury.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that a rematch would incite anything other than an embarrassing response after what we got the other night,\u201d Lampley added.\n\nHe also noted the fight could turn off relatively new boxing fans making their first journey into the world of pay-per-view TV.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post.
