But let\u2019s not get carried away with either the number or the reasons behind November\u2019s 321,000 gain.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because unquestionably good news about the economy is so rare these days, but economics reporters were falling over themselves to deliver superlatives about the November jobs report.\n\nThey called it \u201ca knockout,\u201d \u201cboom-like numbers\u201d and \u201cthe strongest streak of hiring in several decades,\u201d and said that the report \u201cjumped decisively into \u2018great news\u2019 territory.\u201d Even the White House showed more restraint, simply calling the November numbers \u201cstrong.\u201d\n\nThese reporters would be well served \u2014 as would their readers \u2014 actually to look at the jobs data. They\u2019d discover that a 300,000-plus job gain during an expansion isn\u2019t earth-shattering. In fact, it\u2019s fairly common.\n\nThe expansion during the 1960s, for example, included eight months of 300,000-plus job growth, three months of which topped 400,000.\n\nThe Reagan recovery produced 23 such months \u2014 one saw a million jobs created. Even the so-called \u201cjobless\u201d Bush recovery produced seven 300,000-plus job-growth months. Obama\u2019s recovery has produced all of two such months.\n\nRemember, too, that the previous gains occurred in much smaller labor pools. In the early 1980s, for example, the labor force was 29% smaller than today. Account for the difference, and 300,000 jobs a month in a recovery should be the norm, not a rarity to celebrate.\n\nPlus, let\u2019s not forget that during this allegedly record-setting job growth year, labor force participation actually fell to 62.8% from January\u2019s 63%. It\u2019s still way down from 66% at the peak of the previous expansion.\n\nIn addition, 9.1 million remain unemployed, which is 1.9 million more than there were in November 2007. Meanwhile, don\u2019t praise Obama for this growth.\n\nAfter all, since re-election he\u2019s failed to get any of the things he claimed were vital to strong job growth. He didn\u2019t get his minimum wage hike, a big boost in spending on highways, immigration reform or another extension of long-term jobless benefits.\n\nIf anything, recent job gains are a result of Washington gridlock \u2014 no new taxes or big regulations, no economic tinkering, the government mostly on autopilot and spending virtually flat. Obama even spared most employers the pain of ObamaCare\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nUnfortunately, this reprieve may not last long, even with a GOP Congress. Obama plans to unleash massively expensive environmental regulations soon, the ObamaCare mandate will hit employers, and who knows what other mischief Obama will create under the guise of executive authority?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Economy: Any month with job growth is a good month, and when it tops economists' expectations, even better.
