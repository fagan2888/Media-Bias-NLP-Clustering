Rand Paul\u2019s day on the campaign trail in Iowa, you know he drove through a lot of cornfields and listened to some Metallica. But perhaps the most noteworthy moment came when he paused the music and attacked his Republican\u2014and Democratic opponents\u2014for being war cheerleaders.\n\nHe said:\n\nI think we should talk about politics for a minute. Shouldn\u2019t we at least talk about what idiots we have in the Republican Party running for president who want to have a red line and a no-fly zone in Syria. What a recipe for disaster. But you know what the interesting thing is, Hillary Clinton agrees with all of them. All of them beating their chest to see who is the most likely to get us involved in a war that really, these people have been at war for a thousand years. You think somehow we\u2019re going to solve their problems?\n\nThis is the side of Paul libertarians want to see more of\u2014particularly in the debates. Voters who think it\u2019s a good idea to get involved in the Syrian civil war have plenty of candidates on both sides of the aisle to choose from. On the other hand, voters who are skeptical that further military intervention in the Middle East could possibly be the right course of action have few options. Paul must court them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Candid moment from Paul's livestream", "title": "Rand Paul: \u2018Idiots in the Republican Party\u2019 Want War in Syria and So Does Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/13/rand-paul-idiots-in-the-republican-party", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14447720702151.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Candid moment from Paul's livestream", "title": "Rand Paul: \u2018Idiots in the Republican Party\u2019 Want War in Syria and So Does Hillary Clinton", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14447720702151.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-10-13T21:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5b66\"", "article_summary": "But perhaps the most noteworthy moment came when he paused the music and attacked his Republican\u2014and Democratic opponents\u2014for being war cheerleaders.\nShouldn\u2019t we at least talk about what idiots we have in the Republican Party running for president who want to have a red line and a no-fly zone in Syria.\nBut you know what the interesting thing is, Hillary Clinton agrees with all of them.\nVoters who think it\u2019s a good idea to get involved in the Syrian civil war have plenty of candidates on both sides of the aisle to choose from.\nThis is the side of Paul libertarians want to see more of\u2014particularly in the debates."}
