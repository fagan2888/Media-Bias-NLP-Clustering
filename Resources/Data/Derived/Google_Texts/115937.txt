You’d never know Gov. Christie was campaigning in the heavily Democratic, blue-collar city of Bayonne from the reception he received yesterday.

The governor was serenaded with chants of “Four more years!” during stops at the Big Apple sports bar and San Vito’s restaurant on Broadway.

“He really is for the people,” said Geri Bachanes of Bayonne, a Democrat. “He really is not thinking party-wise, he wants us all to vote for whoever is good for the people.”

Bachanes’ sister, Carol Reasons, a Republican, agreed that Christie is a better choice than Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara Buono, a state senator, in the Nov. 5 election.

“He’ll cross party lines to help the people and to help New Jersey. We love him.”

As expected, Christie urged voters to disregard party affiliations and focus on the best person for the position.

“The message on Nov. 5 is that we want people in public office who are going to care first about getting the job done and then second or third what they’re going to do with their party,” Christie said.

Bozena Linowski, owner of European Day Spa, also on Broadway, said she’s an independent who is voting for the sitting governor.

“He’s a no-nonsense guy who does the right thing for the state, cuts out a lot of corruption and spending money in the wrong way,” said Linowski, whose boyfriend, Hillside Mayor Joseph Menza, also attended the event. “He’s a good fit for the state. I would support (Christie) even if he was a Democrat, just as long as he was the right person for the position.”
