They cite 2011 research that indicates that providing patients with housing improves outcomes and keeps them out of the hospital. Despite this research, there is less of a consensus on what specific strategies create these benefits, leading providers and organizations to test various approaches, they write.\n\nMoses and Davis highlight the results of a collaborative pilot program in San Francisco to house San Francisco Health Plan's (SFHP) costliest homeless Medicaid patients. The program reserved one-third of the 172 units at the Kelly Cullen Community housing development for homeless SFHP beneficiaries with the highest needs and costs. The partners also provided ongoing care management, meeting patients in their homes, following a model similar to the \"homeless navigators\" other California programs used to help indigent patients after discharge and post-discharge respite care centers established in Texas.\n\nOther programs have taken a different approach, incorporating support into local and state budgets, according to the blog post. For example, when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) assembled a team to control Empire State Medicaid costs, the experts identified homelessness as a major cost driver and recommended the state fund housing for high-risk, homeless Medicaid patients. In the last three years, the state has invested more than $260 million in new housing, rental subsidies and housing programs, coordinated across agencies such as the state Office of People with Developmental Disabilities, the AIDS Institute and the Office of Mental Health.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals seek proactive strategies to prevent homeless readmissions\n\nHospital-based clinic helped reduce ED super-user visits\n\nHomelessness has butterfly effect on healthcare fraud\n\n'Homeless navigators' help reduce ER use, readmissions\n\nMedical homes for the homeless can curb ED use\n\nCare coordination helps curb homeless patient readmissions", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals should prioritize housing for homeless patients to prevent inappropriate emergency care and unnecessary readmissions,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Health Affairs\u00a0blog post.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals should prioritize housing for homeless patients to prevent inappropriate emergency care and unnecessary readmissions,\u00a0according to\u00a0a\u00a0Health Affairs\u00a0blog post.", "title": "Housing for homeless patients could cut inappropriate ER use, readmissions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/housing-homeless-patients-could-cut-inappropriate-er-use-readmissions/2015-07-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,Care Delivery,ED overuse,emergency department,ER super-users,homeless navigators,Homeless Patients,housing,Medicaid patients,New York,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,preventable readmissions", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals should prioritize housing for homeless patients to prevent inappropriate emergency care and unnecessary readmissions, according to a Health Affairs blog post.\nAndrew Cuomo (D) assembled a team to control Empire State Medicaid costs, the experts identified homelessness as a major cost driver and recommended the state fund housing for high-risk, homeless Medicaid patients.\nMoses and Davis highlight the results of a collaborative pilot program in San Francisco to house San Francisco Health Plan's (SFHP) costliest homeless Medicaid patients.\nThey cite 2011 research that indicates that providing patients with housing improves outcomes and keeps them out of the hospital.\nThe program reserved one-third of the 172 units at the Kelly Cullen Community housing development for homeless SFHP beneficiaries with the highest needs and costs."}
