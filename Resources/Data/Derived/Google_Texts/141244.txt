Federal regulators' recent crackdown on a snack bar maker’s claims that its granola bars are “healthy” are drawing a backlash from nutritional experts who say the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s policies on dietary fat are outmoded and wrong.The FDA sent the maker of Kind Bars a stern warning to stop using the the word "healthy" on its packaging, the Washington Post reports."The labels of the aforementioned products bear the claim 'Healthy and tasty, convenient and wholesome,' " the warning said. "However, none of your products listed above meet the requirements for use of the nutrient content claim 'healthy.' "Specifically, the FDA was talking about the company's Fruit & Nut Almond & Apricot, Fruit & Nut Almond & Coconut, Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, and Fruit & Nut Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars, which, it said, would be removed from stores if the packaging wasn't changed.The bars, which are essentially mostly nuts and fruit, had too much fat for the FDA's liking.But by targeting the company, the government has provoked a renewed debate over federal dietary standards. Experts say the guidelines recommend cutting back on fat, but consuming high levels of carbs, even though the latest nutrition research shows certain ”healthy” fats – in nuts, salmon, olives, and olive oil, avocadoes, and other foods – are good for you.What’s more, experts say, the low-fat high-carb foods pushed by the federal government are fueling the nation’s growing obesity crisis.Last week, KIND launched a citizen petition, protesting what it argues is an outdated and misleading official policy regarding the use of the word "healthy."FDA guidelines say the claim is only allowed to be used when foods contain 3 grams or less of fat and 1 gram or less of saturated fat (for seafood and meat it's 5 grams of fat and 2 grams of saturated fat). That, Kind points out, precludes several foods widely considered healthy by doctors and nutritionists."The current regulatory approach for food labeling claims limits the ability of food producers to tell consumers that products containing certain ingredients – such as nuts, whole grains, seafood, fruits, and vegetables – are healthy and are recommended as part of a beneficial diet," David Katz, who is the director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University and a senior nutrition advisor to KIND, said in a statement.The government's is also reportedly reconsidering its positon on fats in issuing new Dietary Guidelines due this month.
