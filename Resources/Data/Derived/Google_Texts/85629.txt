Hawaii Congressman Mark Takai slammed the GOP’s latest 10-year budget resolution Tuesday.

“Budgets outline the priorities of the party from which they originate,” Takai said in a statement.

“The Republican budget shows their priorities are increased tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and a lack of caring for our working class families. Their budget shows this by continuing the sequester cap on domestic spending used for investing in our infrastructure and the middle class. More importantly, the proposed GOP budget would end the Medicare guarantee as we know it, which would only place the retirement security of our kupuna at risk.”

Takai also noted the proposed cuts to Pell Grants for students looking to attend college, food stamp grants, the removal of financial regulations imposed after the 2008 crash and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

The House Committee on Budget will mark up budgets later this week, and these will be considered by the full House next week, according to a release from Takai’s office. The House will also consider the Democratic Alternative Budget and various others.
