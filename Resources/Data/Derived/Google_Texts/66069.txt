A McPherson teacher suffered critical injuries in a head-on collision. The accident happened early Friday just north of McPherson.

The McPherson County Sheriff's department said Mija Stockman was on her way to school when a pickup truck went left of the center line and hit Stockman's car head-on.

Stockman, 38, of Lindsborg, was taken to Via Christi St. Francis in critical condition. The truck driver, Jeffrey Davis, of California, was also taken to a Wichita hospital.

Stockman teaches physical education at elementary schools.
