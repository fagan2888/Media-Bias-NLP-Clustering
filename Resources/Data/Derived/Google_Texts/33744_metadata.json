At least seven of the states have increased their cost estimates for 2017, according to an Associated Press analysis of state budget projections, Medicaid enrollments and cost details in the expansion states.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the expansion in New Jersey:\n\nTHE DEAL\n\nMedicaid is a partnership between the federal government and states that provides health insurance for low-income people.\n\nAs part of President Barack Obama\u2019s health insurance overhaul, the U.S. was offering to pay for program\u2019s expansion to cover adults with higher incomes. But starting in 2017, states have to pay a portion of the expansion cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE DECISION\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie went for the expansion back in 2013, though he made clear he did not like the underlying policy.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, I am no fan of the Affordable Care Act. I think it is wrong for New Jersey and for America,\u201d Christie said at the time.\n\nChristie, a Republican who is now seeking his party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination, says he wants to turn Medicaid into a block grant program to states, a move that could reduce its benefits over time.\n\nTHE EXPANSION\n\nMore people have taken advantage of the expanded eligibility for Medicaid than New Jersey expected.\n\nA state-commissioned Rutgers University study had anticipated 234,000 more people on Medicaid. In May, the number of newly eligible people in the program was nearly 383,000.\n\nThe state says it expects the enrollment to continue to grow and that its share of the cost next year will be $162 million.\n\nTHE BENEFIT\n\nAs Christie rolled out his state budget proposal earlier this year, his treasurer praised the expansion, saying it\u2019s been \u201ca blessing for providing appropriate care to our most vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\nIn the budget, the state cut charity aid to hospitals for providing care to uninsured patients to $502 million from $650 million, saying the Medicaid expansion was responsible for about half of the reduction.\n\nThat cut alone would pay for most of the state\u2019s costs next year for the expanded Medicaid program.\n\nOTHER POSSIBLE SAVINGS\n\nRaymond Castro, who studies health policy for the liberal think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, says the Medicaid expansion is good for the state government\u2019s finances in other ways because it\u2019s generating more economic activity and making savings in areas such as the Corrections Department and mental health programs.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Trenton news, NJ news, US news, world news.", "title": "A look at the Medicaid expansion in New Jersey", "og": {"url": "http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20150719/NEWS/150719757", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.trentonian.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TT/20150719/NEWS/150719757/AR/0/AR-150719757.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "920px"}, "type": "article", "title": "A look at the Medicaid expansion in New Jersey"}, "twitter": {"domain": "trentonian.com", "description": "More than a dozen states that opted to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen enrollments surge way beyond projections, raising concerns that the added costs will strain their budgets when federal aid is scaled back starting in two ye", "title": "A look at the Medicaid expansion in New Jersey", "url": "http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20150719/NEWS/150719757", "image": {"src": "http://www.trentonian.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/TT/20150719/NEWS/150719757/AR/0/AR-150719757.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@trentonian", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "/id563339138", "iphone": "/id503293221", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.trentonian"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Trenton news, NJ news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "More than a dozen states that opted to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen enrollments surge way beyond projections, raising concerns that the added costs will strain their budgets when federal aid is scaled back starting in two ye"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd84\"", "article_summary": "At least seven of the states have increased their cost estimates for 2017, according to an Associated Press analysis of state budget projections, Medicaid enrollments and cost details in the expansion states.\nBut starting in 2017, states have to pay a portion of the expansion cost.\nHere\u2019s a look at the expansion in New Jersey:THE DEALMedicaid is a partnership between the federal government and states that provides health insurance for low-income people.\nTHE EXPANSIONMore people have taken advantage of the expanded eligibility for Medicaid than New Jersey expected.\nThat cut alone would pay for most of the state\u2019s costs next year for the expanded Medicaid program."}
