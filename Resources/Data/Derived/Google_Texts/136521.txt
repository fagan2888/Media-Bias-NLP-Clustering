If we’ve learned anything in the past couple years it’s that putting a hashtag in front of something and a “challenge” on the back will result in a bunch of videos on the Internet featuring young people doing stupid things. So now, thanks to the #CondomChallenge, you may notice your news feed blowing up with videos of people dumping water-filled condoms on their friends’ heads to show that they won't break. Now take a second for that to sink in.

In spite of the utter stupidity involved with dumping a condom filled with water on your head, some Twitter users have started using #CondomChallenge to help raise safe sex awareness, because, they reason, if it can fit around the head on a guy’s shoulder then it can most certainly fit around the one below their waist.

So y'all buying condoms for a challenge but won't buy them to stop getting STDs from these hoes? #CondomChallenge __ — 50 Shades of A1 (@JustKingA1) November 22, 2015

At least we can all agree this #CondomChallenge is A LOT better than the #CondomChallenge from 2013.
