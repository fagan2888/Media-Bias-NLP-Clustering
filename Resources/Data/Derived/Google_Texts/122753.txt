Chinese New Year was celebrated in Broomfield on Saturday at Pacific Ocean Marketplace II with a festive presentation including the Tai Kung Ha Holistic Fitness Center Lion Dancers.

Than Tran, who wore the head of the Red Lion, drew attention to what many Denver Broncos fans excited about Sunday's Super Bowl already know -- that, by the Chinese calendar, this is the Year of the Horse.

The lions sprang into their dance outside, after more than 22,000 firecrackers were set off. They then continued the dance going through the store. They also broke open oranges and ended the dance by climbing up to retrieve a head of lettuce at the entrance.

A Happy Buddha performed by Emily Mieritz lead the three Lions through the grocery.

More than 200 people watched the ceremony outside, and customers shopping inside also were able to enjoy the dance, many of them taking photographs, as they did so.
