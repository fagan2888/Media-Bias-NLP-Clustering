France is considering a bill that could lead to an outright ban on \u201csuper skinny models,\u201d and according to French Health Minister Marisol Touraine, the country\u2019s socialist government will likely back the bill proposal.\n\nOn Tuesday, parliament will discuss two of the bill\u2019s amendments. The first amendment would require all models to undergo routine weight checks to prove they are not underweight. Models would have to provide a medical certificate showing their Body Mass Index (BMI) is at least 18 and their weight is equal to 121 pounds for a height of 5.7 feet, Reuters reported.\n\nModeling agencies and fashion companies would also face a fine of up to 75,000 euros ($79,000) or up to six months in jail for hiring an underweight model. The bill\u2019s second amendment proposes a ban on information available to the public that encourages eating disorders which often target younger people. Lawmakers in Italy, Belgium, and Israel have proposed similar bills in an effort to criminalize so-called pro-anorexia websites.\n\nOlivier V\u00e9ran, socialist lawmaker and author of the bill\u2019s amendments, said its place at the forefront of the fashion industry means France has had its fair share of anorexia troubles that, in his opinion, are spread by way of the fashion industry. V\u00e9ran also said there are 30,000 to 40,000 people in France suffering from anorexia, the majority of which are only teenagers.\n\n\u201cIt's intolerable to promote malnutrition and to commercially exploit people who are endangering their own health,\u201d V\u00e9ran told France\u2019s Le Parisien. \u201cA level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced. Websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned. Some of these sites tell pre-teenage girls they should have a gap of 15 centimetres between their thighs, or give tips on how to survive on as little food as possible.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s new bill proposal highlights the death of 28-year-old French model and actress Isabelle Caro. Caro, who became the international face of anorexia after posing nude for an Italian advertising campaign to raise awareness for eating disorders, died back in 2010 after battling the disease since the age of 13.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "france, ban, super, skinny, models, anorexia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "French lawmakers are considering a bill proposal that could effectively ban \"super skinny\" models from the fashion industry.", "title": "Skinny French Models May Soon Be A Thing Of The Past", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/france-considers-banning-super-skinny-models-and-sending-agents-who-hire-them-jail-325972", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/17/france.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "French lawmakers are considering a bill proposal that could effectively ban \"super skinny\" models from the fashion industry.", "title": "Skinny French Models May Soon Be A Thing Of The Past", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/france-considers-banning-super-skinny-models-and-sending-agents-who-hire-them-jail-325972", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/17/france.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/17/france.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-17T11:34:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T11:34:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "French lawmakers are considering a bill proposal that could effectively ban \"super skinny\" models from the fashion industry."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdeb3\"", "article_summary": "The first amendment would require all models to undergo routine weight checks to prove they are not underweight.\nFrance is considering a bill that could lead to an outright ban on \u201csuper skinny models,\u201d and according to French Health Minister Marisol Touraine, the country\u2019s socialist government will likely back the bill proposal.\nV\u00e9ran also said there are 30,000 to 40,000 people in France suffering from anorexia, the majority of which are only teenagers.\nFrance is often considered the apex for anyone in the fashion industry, but pretty soon there could be a minimum weight requirement for any model looking to grace the French catwalk.\n\u201cIt's intolerable to promote malnutrition and to commercially exploit people who are endangering their own health,\u201d V\u00e9ran told France\u2019s Le Parisien."}
