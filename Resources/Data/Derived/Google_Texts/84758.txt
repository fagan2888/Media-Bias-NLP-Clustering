LAKEWOOD — Police have confirmed two officers were shot near the intersection of West Jewell Place and South Kipling Street late Saturday night.

Police responded just before 10 p.m. Saturday, said Steve Davis, Lakewood police spokesman.

A woman, who was not home at the time, called Lakewood police asking to do a welfare check on her husband in the 9700 block of West Jewell Place. “He indicated to her that he was despondent,” Davis said.

When officers arrived, a man came out of the house and started shooting. The man, whom police believe is in his 50s, was hit by gunfire from officers. Davis said he was not aware of any verbal exchange between officers and the man before shots were fired.

One female and one male officer were wounded. Davis said the injuries of the suspect and the officers were not life-threatening. They all were taken to a hospital.

“This whole confrontation took place outside,” Davis said. The bulletproof vests that the officers wore “played a crucial role” in their injuries not being worse, he said. “We’re very grateful our officers weren’t further hurt.”

An investigation will continue through the night, including a SWAT team that plans to search the residence.

More than 20 law enforcement vehicles, including Lakewood police and Jefferson County sheriff’s deputies, were at the scene.

Rianne Mooney, a Lakewood resident, said she heard what she thought was fireworks from her apartment, but the sounds were actually from the shooting. “Pop, pop, pop, that’s not fireworks,” she recalled. “It’s sad. These men and women serve and protect us and put their lives in jeopardy for everyone else. I pray for their families.”
