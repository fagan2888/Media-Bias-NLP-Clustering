The company\u2019s decision to withdraw from a number of states is due to mounting losses in Obamacare markets. Earlier this month, UnitedHealth announced its intent to leave the individual marketplaces for ACA plans in Kentucky and Iowa.\n\nBoth Humana and UnitedHealth are leaving the Colorado exchange. Discontinuance of the plans will affect more than 20,000 people, reports ACASignups.net.\n\nHumana will still offer plans in the Mountain State\u2019s off-exchange small group market for 2017, while UnitedHealthcare will offer individual plans off exchange through its Golden Rule Insurance subsidiary.\n\nWhile these insurers are exiting, the individual market, while not failing, is in flux. Earlier this month, former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Bloomberg Television while Obamacare has extended medical insurance to about 20 million people, the new insurance exchanges are still shaky.\n\nThe \"young invincibles\" are needed to balance out the costs for the high insurance users in the exchange. Yet, as Modern Healthcare's Bob Herman noted, the clutch 18-34 age group only accounted for about 28% of exchange members in 2014, well below the 40% level experts say is needed to stablize the individual rate environment.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nBloomberg : UnitedHealth Quits 27th Obamacare State as Insurer to Exit N.J.\n\nACASignups.net: Colorado: 2017: Humana is out but the future still looks BRIGHT", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/8d/fc/8dfcf01466eb9acdf8be6d154df87090.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law", "category": "News Post", "title": "Insurer exit RU: UnitedHealth to leave NJ, Humana exits CO", "pub_date": "may 20, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-20T21:31:38", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, May 20, 2016, 09:31 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-05-08T21:31:38", "teaser": "<p>The decision to pull out of New Jersey marks the 27th state exchange that UnitedHealth&nbsp;will leave next year.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-05-20", "sailthru.description": "The decision to pull out of New Jersey marks the 27th state exchange that UnitedHealth\u00a0will leave next year.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The decision to pull out of New Jersey marks the 27th state exchange that UnitedHealth\u00a0will leave next year.", "title": "Insurer exit RU: UnitedHealth to leave NJ, Humana exits CO", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/insurer-exit-ru-unitedhealth-to-leave-nj-humana-exits-co/419546/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Tritium-exit-sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/5c/9b/5c9b837ff61a3b8d4c5696625d0b4b42.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingBloomberg : UnitedHealth Quits 27th Obamacare State as Insurer to Exit N.J.ACASignups.net: Colorado: 2017: Humana is out but the future still looks BRIGHT\nWhile these insurers are exiting, the individual market, while not failing, is in flux.\nMeanwhile, Humana announced it won\u2019t participate in Colorado\u2019s public exchange market in 2017.\nDive Brief:UnitedHealthcare is pulling out of New Jersey\u2019s ACA market, the 27th Obamacare exchange it has left, Bloomberg reports.\nEarlier this month, UnitedHealth announced its intent to leave the individual marketplaces for ACA plans in Kentucky and Iowa."}
