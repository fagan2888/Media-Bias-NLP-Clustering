He was denied bond and remains in Cook County Jail.\n\nPolice were alerted of Mr. Woodfin, who is black, after he posted a Dec. 8 Facebook message that said he was \u201cgoing to kill cops and innocent white kids,\u201d the ABC affiliate reported.\n\nMr. Woodfin was arrested Friday after police carried out a search warrant at a Ford Heights home where he was thought to have lived. When he was arrested, he allegedly told officers he was a \u201cwarrior\u201d and the \u201cstreets would run red with blood,\u201d a police source told the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nProsecutors said police found a .45-caliber pistol with several rounds of ammunition and a makeshift shooting range in the basement of the home where Mr. Woodfin was arrested, the ABC affiliate reported.\n\nBeatrice Franklin, who owns the home, said Mr. Woodfin stays there occasionally but does not live there. She told the news station that the gun belongs to her and that Mr. Woodfin\u2019s Facebook post was simply an expression of anger, not a real threat.\n\n\u201cThat gun that they found belonged to me,\u201d Ms. Franklin told the station. \u201cI am a licensed FOID cardholder, and I have paperwork stating that it\u2019s mine. So no, it\u2019s not his.\u201d\n\nMr. Woodfin was previously given probation in a 2000 sentencing for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and illegal gun possession, the station reported.\n\nHis next court date is in January.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Chicago man has been charged after online threats against police reportedly led authorities to search a suburban home, where they found a makeshift gun range and several rounds of ammunition.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Chicago man has been charged after online threats against police reportedly led authorities to search a suburban home, where they found a makeshift gun range and several rounds of ammunition.", "title": "Chicago man arrested after threatening to \u2018kill cops and innocent white kids\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/28/chicago-man-arrested-after-threatening-to-kill-cop/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/aries-woodfin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/aries-woodfin.jpg", "description": "A Chicago man has been charged after online threats against police reportedly led authorities to search a suburban home, where they found a makeshift gun range and several rounds of ammunition.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Chicago man arrested after threatening to \u2018kill cops and innocen"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Aries Woodfin, ABC"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe124b\"", "article_summary": "Police were alerted of Mr. Woodfin, who is black, after he posted a Dec. 8 Facebook message that said he was \u201cgoing to kill cops and innocent white kids,\u201d the ABC affiliate reported.\nBeatrice Franklin, who owns the home, said Mr. Woodfin stays there occasionally but does not live there.\nMr. Woodfin was arrested Friday after police carried out a search warrant at a Ford Heights home where he was thought to have lived.\nAries Woodfin, a 33-year-old convicted felon, was charged with weapons possession, assault, having a firearm without a valid permit and disorderly conduct, a local ABC affiliate reported.\nProsecutors said police found a .45-caliber pistol with several rounds of ammunition and a makeshift shooting range in the basement of the home where Mr. Woodfin was arrested, the ABC affiliate reported."}
