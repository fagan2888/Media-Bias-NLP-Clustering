Americans aren\u2019t going to care about the closing of McDonald\u2019s locations in Moscow. All this will do is anger Russia\u2019s own people, who both frequent the restaurants and know the thinly veiled reason behind their closing.\n\nThis move is just a petulant attempt by Russia to continue a pointless, stupid feud. Countries this powerful should be above this.\n\nKIERAN McCUDDEN\n\nLos Angeles, Aug. 23, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn 1991, I was walking to my hotel on a freezing cold, pitch dark December afternoon in Moscow. There was a very long queue to get into the first McDonald\u2019s in that city.\n\nI asked the man at the head of the line if he spoke English. When he said (in a heavy Russian accent) that he did, I asked how long he had been waiting. \u201cTwo hours,\u201d he replied.\n\nYes, Muscovites are upset when a McDonald\u2019s closes. It is not only a \u201csymbol of America.\u201d It is clean food, predictably tasty, in a warm place. And there are clean restrooms.\n\nSUSAN KLEE\n\nBerkeley, Calif., Aug. 22, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMy mother\u2019s family came from Russia. Grandmother made a superb borscht and a great roast chicken.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou report the closing of McDonald\u2019s in Moscow, due to political retaliation by Russia, related no doubt to American antipathy toward the aggressive policies of President Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nMany Russian immigrants retain a fondness for pickled, highly salted foods, which remain a part of the Russian diet to this day. My grandmother took advantage of the healthy American bounty. Although she did make a wonderful pickled herring from time to time, her menu was a healthy variety of fresh vegetables, meats and fish, wisely cooked.\n\nThe closing of McDonald\u2019s in Moscow deprives Muscovites of a source of grilled meat and fried potatoes, and some chicken. It could be seen as an improvement on the awful, salty, consistently pickled diet that the average Russian ingests (with a vodka chaser) until he or she dies.\n\nBig Mac, yes; Putin, no.\n\nMARC REUBEN\n\nLanghorne, Pa., Aug. 22, 2014", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140825193015, "twitter": {"description": "Readers react to the apparently politically motivated closing of four McDonald\u2019s restaurants that symbolize America.", "title": "A Big Mac in Moscow: Cold War Casualty?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/opinion/a-big-mac-in-moscow-cold-war-casualty.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003074081"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/26/opinion/0826lettersRUSSIA/0826lettersRUSSIA-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/opinion/a-big-mac-in-moscow-cold-war-casualty.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003074081", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/opinion/a-big-mac-in-moscow-cold-war-casualty.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "A Big Mac in Moscow: Cold War Casualty?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 25, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-08-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Restaurants", "published": "2014-08-25", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "McDonald's Corporation,Moscow (Russia),Restaurants", "description": "Readers react to the apparently politically motivated closing of four McDonald\u2019s restaurants that symbolize America.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/26/opinion/0826lettersRUSSIA/0826lettersRUSSIA-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "l26russia", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers react to the apparently politically motivated closing of four McDonald\u2019s restaurants that symbolize America.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/26/opinion/0826lettersRUSSIA/0826lettersRUSSIA-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Restaurant", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 25, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "org": "McDonald's Corporation", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Moscow (Russia)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140826004702, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/opinion/a-big-mac-in-moscow-cold-war-casualty.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/26/opinion/0826lettersRUSSIA/0826lettersRUSSIA-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers react to the apparently politically motivated closing of four McDonald\u2019s restaurants that symbolize America.", "title": "A Big Mac in Moscow: Cold War Casualty?"}, "pdate": 20140825, "des": "Restaurants", "articleid": 100000003074081, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Big Mac in Moscow: Cold War Casualty?", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "The closing of McDonald\u2019s in Moscow deprives Muscovites of a source of grilled meat and fried potatoes, and some chicken.\nAmericans aren\u2019t going to care about the closing of McDonald\u2019s locations in Moscow.\nKIERAN McCUDDENLos Angeles, Aug. 23, 2014To the Editor:In 1991, I was walking to my hotel on a freezing cold, pitch dark December afternoon in Moscow.\nAll this will do is anger Russia\u2019s own people, who both frequent the restaurants and know the thinly veiled reason behind their closing.\nMany Russian immigrants retain a fondness for pickled, highly salted foods, which remain a part of the Russian diet to this day."}
