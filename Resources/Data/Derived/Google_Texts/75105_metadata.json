Most of the 17 state-run exchanges are struggling to figure out how to make their marketplaces pay for themselves, a requirement of the Affordable Care Act. And the government acknowledges that there\u2019s confusion among some of the states about how to legally spend their federal grants.\n\nWhen it comes to exchange sustainability, \u201cit\u2019s too early to declare failure,\u201d said Dan Schuyler, senior director of exchange technology at Leavitt Partners, a national health consultancy. States are developing and implementing plans to cover their costs, but they\u2019re not there yet.\n\n\u201cThere are always startup costs,\u201d he said. \u201cMost businesses aren\u2019t profitable the first or second year.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s Healthplanfinder, launched in 2013, has sold individual health plans during two rounds of open enrollment, the most recent ending in April. It sells insurance on a sliding price scale based on a person\u2019s income, thanks to federal tax breaks that cover part of the cost.\n\nOfficials with Healthplanfinder sought $127 million for its two-year budget starting in 2015, plus $20 million in federal grants it already has received. The Democrat-led state House of Representatives included $124 million for the exchange in its proposal while the Senate, under GOP leadership, earmarked $85.9 million over two years.\n\nState-run exchanges nationwide got up and running under the ACA with the help of billions of dollars in federal grants that helped them develop the technology, build their websites and train workers who assist people in signing up. But that money was intended to get the programs started, not keep them running.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t exactly worked that way. This week Daniel Levinson, inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which issued the grants. It cautioned that some states were struggling with their exchange budgets and illegally allocating federal dollars to pay for operational costs.\n\nIt singled out Washington, saying the state \u201cmight use $10 million in establishment grant funds to support operations\u201d in part to pay for printing and bank fees in the latter half of 2015. Levinson urged CMS to clarify what the grants can and can\u2019t be used for to prevent their illegal use.\n\nMichael Marchand, spokesman for Healthplanfinder, said CMS approved the grant and the exchange can use the money as planned.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. CMS believes the expenditures are allowable and appropriate,\u201d Marchand said. The exchange, he said, is stuck in a disagreement between the federal offices. \u201cWe\u2019re the monkey in the middle.\u201d\n\nWashington has a plan to pay for its exchange through three revenue streams. First, all health-insurance premiums in Washington include a 2 percent state tax, and the revenue collected on exchange plans goes back to Healthplanfinder. Second, because Healthplanfinder is now also the portal for people to sign up for Medicaid, the exchange is reimbursed for those services with state and federal Medicaid dollars. And finally, the exchange charges insurance companies a per-month, per-person fee for everyone receiving insurance through the state\u2019s website.\n\nBut the equation depends on selling a certain number of plans. For insurance coverage in 2015, the exchange expected to clear 213,000 plans. By mid-April and the end of open enrollment for most residents, more than 170,000 people bought insurance through the marketplace.\n\nWith the lower enrollment, the three sources come to roughly $101 million, leaving the exchange short $26 million, which would need to be made up, perhaps with a higher assessment or with money provided from the state general fund.\n\nAnd the Senate\u2019s $85.9 million proposal creates an additional budgetary wrinkle. The plan eliminates the state\u2019s portion of the Medicaid reimbursement and keeps the 2 percent premium tax in the general fund. That makes the assessment fee the primary funding source, which could increase from its current $4.19 per health plan to $13.66.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about that,\u201d said Sydney Smith Zvara, executive director of the Association of Washington Healthcare Plans, a trade organization.\n\nThe increase means higher monthly premiums for consumers and \u201ceven with (tax) subsidies, it\u2019s still a stretch for some families,\u201d she said. If the premiums rise too high, people could drop out of the exchange, opting to be uninsured or buying unsubsidized insurance elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt could create a downwards spiral,\u201d Smith Zvara said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really serious thing looking at the viability of the exchange.\u201d\n\nDespite repeated attempts, no Republican members with the Senate\u2019s budget or health-care committees were available for comment.\n\n\u201cWashington is in a very tight spot,\u201d said Austin Bordelon, senior associate with Leavitt Partners. \u201cNo matter whose budget wins out, they\u2019re going to be coming from behind.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With enrollment in Healthplanfinder insurance plans lower than expected, the exchange faces shortfalls that could cause serious financial problems and even pose questions about its survival.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "With enrollment in Healthplanfinder insurance plans lower than expected, the exchange faces shortfalls that could cause serious financial problems and even pose questions about its survival.", "title": "State\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange struggling for viability", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/states-health-benefit-exchange-struggling-for-viability/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "With enrollment in Healthplanfinder insurance plans lower than expected, the exchange faces shortfalls that could cause serious financial problems and even pose questions about its survival.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "State\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange struggling for viability"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-05-01 10:57:37", "modified_time": "2015-05-01 14:54:45"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health"}, "article_summary": "Financial challenges are threatening the survival of Washington\u2019s Healthplanfinder insurance exchange.\nIf there\u2019s any comfort for officials with the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which operates Healthplanfinder, it might be this: they\u2019re not alone.\nWith enrollment in Healthplanfinder insurance plans lower than expected, the exchange faces shortfalls that could cause serious financial problems and even pose questions about its survival.\nIt cautioned that some states were struggling with their exchange budgets and illegally allocating federal dollars to pay for operational costs.\nThe Senate\u2019s budget plan \u201cthreatens the viability\u201d of the exchange, Ron Sims, chairman of the board overseeing the exchange, said in a recent statement."}
