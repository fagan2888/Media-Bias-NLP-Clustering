They could face a tax penalty.\n\nThe average tax penalty for not having health insurance was $172, H&R Block said. That\u2019s more than the flat fee of $95 per uncovered adult that many consumers anticipated.\n\nYet the consumers likely to be the most confused are those who received the premium tax credits. They will have to reconcile the financial assistance received with actual income. This is the part that will trip up many taxpayers.\n\nMost people chose to have the subsidies paid in advance, based on their projected income for 2014. If their actual income was higher because of a raise or new job, they would be entitled to a smaller subsidy and would have to repay the difference, subject to certain limits.\n\n\u201cThis is a fairly high percentage of people having to pay back,\u201d said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the H&R Block Tax Institute.\n\n\u201cIt really speaks to the complexity of having to estimate your income in advance,\u201d she said.\n\nH&R Block expected that most filers wouldn\u2019t accurately estimate their 2014 income since many taxpayers relied on 2012 income to estimate their 2014 income at the time of the first open enrollment.\n\n\u201cThe average tax refund for these taxpayers was almost $3,100 but it was reduced by $530 due to the tax credit reconciliation process,\u201d the firm said.\n\nThat money is sorely needed by many consumers.\n\n\u201cThe level of payback of the Advance Premium Tax Credit is significant in that it\u2019s costing taxpayers a large percentage of their refund \u2014 a refund many of them count on to pay household expenses,\u201d said Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president of H&R Block\u2019s health care and tax services.\n\nIf H&R Block\u2019s numbers are an accurate indication, more taxpayers who bought health insurance from an exchange will be hit with the bad news that they will have to repay a portion or all of their subsidy.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we expect to see a pattern like that continue,\u201d Pickering said.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, H&R Block said that about a third of insurance marketplace enrollees overestimated their 2014 income and got an additional premium tax credit of close to $365 on average.\n\nIf you received a tax credit last year, cross your fingers that you\u2019re in this group.\n\nFollow Pamela Yip on Twitter at @pamelayip.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some see smaller refunds because of having to repay premium tax credit.", "og": {"description": "Some see
