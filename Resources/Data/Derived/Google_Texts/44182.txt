Alexis Tsipras has secured enough votes to give his Syriza party a "clear victory" in the country's second general election in a year and will return to power in a coalition government with the right-wing Independent Greeks.

With nearly 80 per cent of the the vote counted, the Greek Interior Ministry declared Syriza the party with the largest share of the vote:

Syriza 35.5 percent

New Democracy 28.2 percent

Golden Dawn 7.0 percent

PASOK/DIMAR 6.4 percent

KKE 5.5 percent

To Potami 4.0 percent

Independent Greeks 3.6 percent

Popular Unity 3.3

SKAI TV reported that Tsipras' Syriza party will form a coalition government of 155 seats with its old partner, the Independent Greeks, an agreement later confirmed by Independent Greeks leader Panos Kammenos.

Speaking to crowds in central Athens after the count, Reuters reported that Tsipras said he felt vindicated, having quit and called the election last month after his party split over his own acceptance of Europe's bailout terms.

A triumphant Tsipras said that he had been given a clear, four-year mandate by the Greek people, but warned that there were difficulties ahead.

"In Europe today, Greece and the Greek people are synonymous with resistance and dignity, and this struggle will be continued together for another four years," Tspiras said, adding: "We won't recover from the struggle by magic, but it can happen with hard work."

The new coalition government will now have to lead a people who have been demoralized by austerity, a weak economy and low employment.

This disillusion was expected to be reflected in the turnout figures for the election: Around 55 percent -- a record low according to some Greece-watchers.
