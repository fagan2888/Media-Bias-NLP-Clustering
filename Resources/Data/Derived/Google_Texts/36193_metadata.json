(CBS News) - World leaders wrapped up the nuclear security summit to discuss the threat of nuclear terrorism. President Obama said the ultimate goal is to rid the world of nuclear weapons.\n\nPresident Obama said, \u201cWe didn't just come here to talk, but we came here to act.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama reported progress at the nuclear security summit, saying all 50 of the participating nations have enhanced security at their nuclear storage sites.\n\nBut the president urged leaders to protect some 2,000 tons of nuclear material around the world from terrorists. Pakistan is considered particularly vulnerable.\n\nObama said, \"There is no doubt that if these mad men ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible.\"\n\nThe president also met with leaders who cobbled together the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nObama said, \"This is a success of diplomacy that hopefully we'll be able to copy in the future.\"\n\nBut critics say the deal merely delays Iran\u2019s nuclear progress - and doesn't end it for good.\n\nNorth Korea also poses a possible nuclear threat according to Columbia professor Richard Betts:\n\nBetts said, \"It's isolated, economically weak and interested in finding sources of money and could miss calculate and sell a weapon. Not likely but not impossible.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama conceded more work needs to be done to deal with North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nPresident Obama said the U.S. released a public inventory of its supplies of highly enriched uranium, the material that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Russia chose not to participate this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON D.C.
