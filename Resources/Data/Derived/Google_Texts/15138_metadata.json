The woman reportedly bought grapes from a grocery store called Shaw\u2019s, located in Colchester, Vt.\n\nAccording to the woman\u2019s mother, she reached into the bag of grapes and the spider crawled up her arm and bit her. After catching the spider, they rushed her to the University of Vermont Medical Center, where a nurse confirmed that it was indeed a black widow spider.\n\nThe black widow, or the Latrodectus mactans, has a shiny black body with a red belly. They\u2019re found throughout the U.S., but are mostly common in the South and the West \u2014 lurking in sheds, stone walls, fences, or woodpiles. Black widows are poisonous, so if if you\u2019re bitten by one (which will often feel like a needle prick, then result in inflammation and pain spreading through the body), seek medical attention immediately. Most of the time, a bite won\u2019t cause severe effects in a healthy adult. If a child, elderly, or very ill person is bitten, however, they may not survive.\n\nOnce you're at the hospital, doctors treat black widow bites with medications and, if it\u2019s severe enough, antivenin medication to reverse the poison. Patients are typically kept at the hospital for a short time to monitor vitals and pain, but within three to four days after treatment, the symptoms will disappear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll go into the emergency room, they\u2019ll monitor you for blood pressure, heart rate, and pain, obviously, and then they\u2019ll treat for the pain with either pain medications or a muscle relaxant, and then they\u2019ll look to see if the pains get worse and the symptoms get worse,\u201d Gayle Finkelstein told WPTZ News.\n\nFortunately, the Vermont woman was treated at the hospital and released after one night. In the meantime, Shaw\u2019s notes that it\u2019s working to check its grape products throughout its stores to ensure there are no more black widow spiders to be found.\n\n\u201cThe health and safety of products we sell, and our customers, is our first concern,\u201d Brian Dowling, a spokesperson for Shaw\u2019s Public Affairs, said in a statement. \u201cWe have been closely monitoring the situation and been in contact with the family. We replaced the product in the customer\u2019s refrigerator as a precaution and took immediate action to inspect the product at the customer\u2019s store. We are also inspecting the product in all of our stores and have been in touch with the supplier, which has an extensive food safety management system in place.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a black widow spider was found in grapes. In 2013, a woman shopping at Aldi grocery store in Milwaukee spotted spiders crawling in red grapes. More were later found in grocery stores throughout Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "black widow spider, grapes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After buying a bag of grapes from a Shaw\u2019s grocery store, a Vermont woman was bitten by a black widow spider creeping around in the grapes.", "title": "Woman Bitten By Spider Lurking In Bag Of Grapes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vermont-woman-bitten-black-widow-spider-what-you-need-know-about-poisonous-bite-335196", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/27/spiders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After buying a bag of grapes from a Shaw\u2019s grocery store, a Vermont woman was bitten by a black widow spider creeping around in the grapes.", "title": "Woman Bitten By Spider Lurking In Bag Of Grapes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vermont-woman-bitten-black-widow-spider-what-you-need-know-about-poisonous-bite-335196", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/27/spiders.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/27/spiders.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-05-27T13:39:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T13:40:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After buying a bag of grapes from a Shaw\u2019s grocery store, a Vermont woman was bitten by a black widow spider creeping around in the grapes."}, "article_summary": "The black widow, or the Latrodectus mactans, has a shiny black body with a red belly.\nOnce you're at the hospital, doctors treat black widow bites with medications and, if it\u2019s severe enough, antivenin medication to reverse the poison.\nAfter catching the spider, they rushed her to the University of Vermont Medical Center, where a nurse confirmed that it was indeed a black widow spider.\nFortunately, the Vermont woman was treated at the hospital and released after one night.\nA 21-year-old Vermont woman was hospitalized after being bitten by a black widow spider that escaped from a bag of grapes, according to news reports."}
