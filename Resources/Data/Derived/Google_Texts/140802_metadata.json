The country has been successful in solving these challenges, which include two world wars, a number of other wars, placing a man on the moon, and serving as the de facto leader of the free world.\n\nFor the past seven years we, \u201cthe people,\u201d have been trying to climb a slippery slope that has resulted in losing much ground to the big-government machine in Washington. We have almost 50 million people on food stamps, the same number in poverty, a record number of people who have dropped out of the workforce, an insane Iran deal, and Obamacare is disintegrating.\n\nWe are facing a significant rise in the strength and boldness of the Chinese and Russian military while the US military is rapidly falling to pre-WWII strength. Given these problems, and many more, it is absolutely ludicrous that a sitting president would involve himself in the \u201cwhich restroom\u201d debate. Even more ludicrous is the position that he has taken regarding school restrooms. He has ordered every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match the gender identity they have chosen, else face the loss of federal funds \u2014 totally illegal.\n\nHow sad we have fallen so far under this administration.\n\nJim McCrory\n\nNatchitoches\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/opinion/2016/05/23/mail-restroom/84661742/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It is absolutely ludicrous that a sitting president would involve himself in the \u201cwhich restroom\u201d debate", "og": {"site_name": "thetowntalk.com", "description": "It is absolutely ludicrous that a sitting president would involve himself in the \u201cwhich restroom\u201d debate", "title": "Your Mail 5-23: Which restroom?", "url": "http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/opinion/2016/05/23/mail-restroom/84661742/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thetowntalk.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It is absolutely ludicrous that a sitting president would involve himself in the \u201cwhich restroom\u201d debate", "creator": "@TownTalkdotcom", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68eb9551bc870bf6e8dd8208479f1ace489375f2/c=80-0-560-480&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/28/LAGroup/Alexandria/635763854020944830-aa-letters.jpg", "title": "Your Mail 5-23: Which restroom?", "site": "@TownTalkdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898045744", "fb": {"app_id": 116986585038108}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Your Mail (Photo: Graphic)Our country has overcome many challenges over the past 240 years.\nGiven these problems, and many more, it is absolutely ludicrous that a sitting president would involve himself in the \u201cwhich restroom\u201d debate.\nWe are facing a significant rise in the strength and boldness of the Chinese and Russian military while the US military is rapidly falling to pre-WWII strength.\nEven more ludicrous is the position that he has taken regarding school restrooms.\nFor the past seven years we, \u201cthe people,\u201d have been trying to climb a slippery slope that has resulted in losing much ground to the big-government machine in Washington."}
