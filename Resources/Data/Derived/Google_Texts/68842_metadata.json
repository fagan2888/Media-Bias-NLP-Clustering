It\u2019s only natural. In an attempt to alleviate some of their worry, parents will often turn to baby monitors to help them hear what\u2019s going on in their child\u2019s crib when they\u2019re not close at hand. To help further alleviate the worries of over-obsessive parents, Sproutling Founder & CEO Chris Brune and his team have developed a high-tech baby monitor that goes above and beyond the simple walkie-talkie design of its competitors.\n\n\u201cWith a band that sits around your baby's ankle, you just know more,\u201d the Sproutling team said on its website. \u201cThe band is equipped with a smart sensor that senses heart rate, skin temperature, motion, and position. It communicates with the app on your phone and lets you know if your baby is sleeping soundly or if something is wrong.\u201d\n\nBefore you start conjuring up ideas of a baby wrapped up in cords and wires that are hooked up to a bulky piece of machinery, the Sproutling Baby Monitor is completely wireless and consists of a wearable band, a smart charger, and a mobile app. No need to worry about flexible babies with a taste for their own feet. The smart sensor responsible for tracking your child\u2019s movement is designed specifically to prevent a choking hazard. Your purchase comes with three hypoallergenic wearable bands that are machine-washable to prevent the spread of germs.\n\nThe smart sensor and wearable band combination that is fitted around your infant\u2019s ankle sends up-to-date information to your Smartphone, including sleeping habits, heartbeat, body temperature, noise level and temperature around your baby, and even their current mood. A colored background tells parents when and when not to worry (green meaning everything is fine, yellow meaning something may have set off the sensor, and red meaning something is wrong). Parents who preorder the device will get the early-bird special for $249 before it jumps up to $299.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sproutling, baby, monitor", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Wearable Sproutling Baby Monitor observes your infant's every move and sends all the information straight to your Smartphone.", "title": "Wearable Baby Monitors Are Now A Thing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/baby-apps-sproutling-baby-monitor-helps-you-keep-tabs-your-infant-anytime-anywhere-297528", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/sproutling-baby-monitor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wearable Sproutling Baby Monitor observes your infant's every move and sends all the information straight to your Smartphone.", "title": "Wearable Baby Monitors Are Now A Thing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/baby-apps-sproutling-baby-monitor-helps-you-keep-tabs-your-infant-anytime-anywhere-297528", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/sproutling-baby-monitor.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/sproutling-baby-monitor.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-11T12:43:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-11T12:43:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Wearable Sproutling Baby Monitor observes your infant's every move and sends all the information straight to your Smartphone."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd056c\"", "article_summary": "The smart sensor responsible for tracking your child\u2019s movement is designed specifically to prevent a choking hazard.\nTo help further alleviate the worries of over-obsessive parents, Sproutling Founder & CEO Chris Brune and his team have developed a high-tech baby monitor that goes above and beyond the simple walkie-talkie design of its competitors.\n\u201cThe band is equipped with a smart sensor that senses heart rate, skin temperature, motion, and position.\n\u201cWith a band that sits around your baby's ankle, you just know more,\u201d the Sproutling team said on its website.\nIn an attempt to alleviate some of their worry, parents will often turn to baby monitors to help them hear what\u2019s going on in their child\u2019s crib when they\u2019re not close at hand."}
