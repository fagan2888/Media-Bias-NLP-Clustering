With significant moisture now a month behind us, 11 News meteorologist Jordan Sherman says there's a lot of dry vegetation to fuel a potential fire. Add an expected sustained breeze to that, and the combination of conditions Saturday equals a dangerous day for fires.\n\nBut firefighters and meteorologists agree that extra vigilance can prevent fires from marring this beautiful day.\n\nFire officials say to use common sense and not throw cigarette butts out or have open fires outside, but they say to also avoid not-so-obvious things like operating equipment and machinery outside that could spark a fire.\n\nA grass fire in Falcon Friday was reportedly started by someone working on a car that backfired. The blaze spread quickly through open fields.\n\nCrews fighting that fire say a big part of why the flames did not spread to homes is because residents in the area kept the grass and brush near their homes cut short.\n\n\"We encourage everyone, especially with the oncoming dry weather, to keep their grasses mowed short. That is one way to help prevent the rapid spread of wildfires,\" said Robin Widmar with the Falcon Fire Department.\n\nFire departments all across southern Colorado say they are on alert and making preparations for the weekend.
