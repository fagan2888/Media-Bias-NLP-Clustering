(AP) - The state Game and Fish Department is looking for help in identifying bald eagle nests in North Dakota.\n\nConservation biologist Sandra Johnson says the agency is looking for locations of nests with eagles present. She says it\u2019s easy to distinguish an eagle nest because of its enormous size, and eagles are actively tending to eggs or their young in April.\n\nEagle nests historically have been found along the Missouri River. But in recent years they\u2019ve been observed in more than three-quarters of the state\u2019s counties, near streams and lakes and in rural shelterbelts.\n\nJohnson estimates North Dakota has at least 170 active bald eagle nests.\n\nNest observations should be reported to Game and Fish at 701-328-6300, or by email at ndgf@nd.gov.
