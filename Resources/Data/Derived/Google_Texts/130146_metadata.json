For the past eight years, Ariana has tended to Char\u2019s needs stemming from the moderate TBI he sustained in the blast and they have both learned and grown a great deal along the way.\n\nFaced with a military medical system and a VA benefits system unprepared to manage and assess TBI, Ariana successfully advocated for her husband to receive proper treatment and benefits. She not only has fought for him but is also an advocate for other wounded service members, veterans and their families. As an Elizabeth Dole Fellow for the state of Montana, Ariana is committed to promoting change at both state and national levels to ensure proper screening and diagnosis of TBI, appropriate training and credentialing of clinicians, and continued access to resources to support military caregivers and veterans.\n\nOriginally from Bethesda, Maryland, Ariana holds a Bachelor\u2019s Degree from Haverford College. She works as a freelance medical writer, editor and business strategist in the field of continuing medical education.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: A Month Long Salute to Wounded Warrior Caregivers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ariana Del Negro is wife and caregiver to her husband, Char Gatlin, a retired Army Infantry Captain who was wounded in 2006 by a vehicle-borne IED while dismounted in Iraq.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ariana Del Negro is wife and caregiver to her husband, Char Gatlin, a retired Army Infantry Captain who was wounded in 2006 by a vehicle-borne IED while dismounted in Iraq.", "title": "Wounded Warrior Caregiving Hero: Meet Ariana Del Negro", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/3/wounded-warrior-caregiving-hero-meet-ariana-del-ne/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/EDF-INDVS-083.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/EDF-INDVS-083.jpg", "description": "Ariana Del Negro is wife and caregiver to her husband, Char Gatlin, a retired Army Infantry Captain who was wounded in 2006 by a vehicle-borne IED while dismounted in Iraq.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wounded Warrior Caregiving Hero: Meet Ariana Del Negro"}, "Author": "THE WASHINGTON TIMES", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Ariana Del Negro, Char Gatlin"}, "article_summary": "Ariana Del Negro is wife and caregiver to her husband, Char Gatlin, a retired Army Infantry Captain who was wounded in 2006 by a vehicle-borne IED while dismounted in Iraq.\nFaced with a military medical system and a VA benefits system unprepared to manage and assess TBI, Ariana successfully advocated for her husband to receive proper treatment and benefits.\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: A Month Long Salute to Wounded Warrior Caregivers\nShe not only has fought for him but is also an advocate for other wounded service members, veterans and their families.\nShe works as a freelance medical writer, editor and business strategist in the field of continuing medical education."}
