(In fact, it was, with an IPO that jumped 37 percent in its first day of trading.) While the Chinese e-commerce giant was the talk of the New York Stock Exchange trading floor and CNBC types, shoppers in 10 countries around the world \u2014 including Australia, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the U.K. and U.S. \u2014 were buzzing with excitement over the release of Apple\u2019s new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nUnder CEO Tim Cook, Apple finally bumped up the screen size of its smartphones this year, putting out models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens years after competitors like Samsung aggressively began pushing larger and larger displays on high-end phones and \u201cphablets\u201d sized between a phone and tablet. The iPhone 6 Plus, priced at $749 without a cellular service contract, is Apple\u2019s most expensive phone ever.\n\nSLIDESHOW: iPhone 6 Frenzy Has Apple Faithful Lining Up Around the World\n\nBased on reports that said the lines for the new iPhones were longer than in previous years, going big looks likely to pay off big. The lines, though, clearly weren\u2019t just diehard Apple fans looking to land the latest device for their own use. As The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, many of those buying up the new phones were doing so with the intention of reselling them, often at wildly inflated prices, in a \u201cgrowing gray market\u201d in China, Russia and other countries.\n\nApple said earlier this week that it had gotten a record number of preorders for the new phone models within 24 hours after they were announced. More than 4 million of the devices were ordered, exceeding Apple\u2019s initial pre-order supply and surpassing the 2 million units pre-ordered in 2012 when the iPhone 5 was introduced.\n\nRelated: What the Apple Watch Will Do for Apple\n\nThe apparent strong demand suggests the iPhone 6 could provide a boost to Apple\u2019s sales growth \u2014 and may be able to restore some of the cachet Apple has lost in consumers\u2019 eyes. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Sept. 8-13, some 16 percent of respondents said that the company had become less cool over the last two years (48 percent said it had gotten cooler). By comparison, about 11 percent of respondents said Android-based phones had lost some of their luster, while 50 percent said phones powered by the Google software had gotten cooler.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Shoppers in 10 countries around the world \u2014 including Australia, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the U.K. and U.S. \u2014 were buzzing with excitement over the release of Apple\u2019s new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.", "title": "Apple iPhone 6 Generates Plus-Sized Global Buzz", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/19/Apple-iPhone-6-Generates-Plus-Sized-Global-Buzz", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/iPhone6_release_14.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/19/Apple-iPhone-6-Generates-Plus-Sized-Global-Buzz", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/iPhone6_release_14.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Shoppers in 10 countries around the world \u2014 including Australia, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the U.K. and U.S. \u2014 were buzzing with excitement over the release of Apple\u2019s new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae4b\"", "article_summary": "The iPhone 6 Plus, priced at $749 without a cellular service contract, is Apple\u2019s most expensive phone ever.\nThe lines, though, clearly weren\u2019t just diehard Apple fans looking to land the latest device for their own use.\nApple said earlier this week that it had gotten a record number of preorders for the new phone models within 24 hours after they were announced.\n(In fact, it was, with an IPO that jumped 37 percent in its first day of trading.)\nAnd you thought Alibaba was the big news in the tech world today."}
