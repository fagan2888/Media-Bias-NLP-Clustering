A criminal case was opened to investigate the incident.\n\nAbout 60 percent of SOCAR's oil production passes through the platform where the fire broke out, meaning the state company's output will be temporarily hit.\n\nThe bulk of Azerbaijan's oil is produced elsewhere, however, including on fields operated by British oil major BP.\n\nBP Azerbaijan was not available for comment on Saturday on whether adverse weather in the Caspian or the fire on SOCAR's platform had affected its production.\n\nIn a separate incident, SOCAR said on Friday that three workers were missing from another of its offshore oil platforms in the Caspian after an accident during the storm. The workers were still missing as of Saturday.\n\nFourteen workers were killed in accidents on SOCAR's oil and gas platforms in 2014.\n\n(Writing by Margarita Antidze; Editing by Helen Popper)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BAKU (Reuters) - At least one worker was killed and 30 others were missing on Saturday", "title": "One worker killed, 30 missing after Azeri oil rig fire: government", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/05/32-workers-die-after-fire-Azeri-oil-platform-committee-head", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/azerbaijan-accident-fire_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/05/32-workers-die-after-fire-Azeri-oil-platform-committee-head", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/azerbaijan-accident-fire_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BAKU (Reuters) - At least one worker was killed and 30 others were missing on Saturday", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"One body was found and a search-and-rescue operation for 30 missing workers is under way,\" it said in a statement, adding that 32 workers had been safely evacuated.\nFourteen workers were killed in accidents on SOCAR's oil and gas platforms in 2014.\nEarlier on Saturday, the head of Azerbaijan's Oil Workers' Rights Protection Committee, Mirvari Gakhramanly, told Reuters 32 workers had died and 42 had been rescued overnight.\nBAKU (Reuters) - At least one worker was killed and 30 others were missing on Saturday after an Azeri oil platform caught fire during high winds in the Caspian Sea on Friday, state energy company SOCAR said.\nAbout 60 percent of SOCAR's oil production passes through the platform where the fire broke out, meaning the state company's output will be temporarily hit."}
