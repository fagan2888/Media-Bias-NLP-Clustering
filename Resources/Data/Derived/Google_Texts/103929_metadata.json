McClatchy-Tribune Information Services\n\nOct. 27 -- Royal Plaza , the strip shopping center on Healey Street between Neil and Randolph streets in Champaign , is getting a makeover.\n\nNot only is the center getting a new facade, but also a new name and new tenant, according to Rich Park , a commercial broker for Coldwell Banker Commercial Devonshire Realty .\n\nThe new name hasn't been determined yet, and the new tenant _ an Asian grocery store _ hasn't been disclosed. But Park said the store is expected to take much of the space previously occupied by the Piccadilly Beverage Shop.\n\nThe 30,000-square-foot retail center, at 505 S. Neil St. , includes Golden Harbor restaurant, Annapoorna Stores, The School Station , Revolt Tattoo Studio and K-N Karaoke.\n\nPark said the renovation is expected to take four to six weeks, including the roof replacement and the addition of awnings.\n\nRoyal Plaza was developed in the early 1970s to fill what was once an Eisner grocery store. The eastern end, along Neil Street , has been home to several restaurants through the years, including The Ground Round, The Brown Jug, Pickles Food & Fun and Papa George.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nIn addition to the County Market store it plans to open at Carriage Center in Champaign , Niemann Foods expects to open a Harvest Market convenience store just to the southeast along Devonshire Drive .\n\nIt will be the third Harvest Market for the Quincy -based company, which opened its first in Quincy about a month ago and plans to open its second in Decatur in a couple months. The Champaign location is expected to open next spring.\n\nHarvest Market is different from most convenience stores in that it offers freshly prepared foods, such as soups, sandwiches, cheese cubes and grapes, said Gerry Kettler , the company's director of consumer affairs.\n\nIn addition to the usual snacks and groceries, the store will have soft-serve frozen yogurt with a variety of toppings.\n\nThe 4,700-square-foot store will have a seating area equipped with TVs and Wi-Fi, and its restrooms will be \"probably the nicest public bathrooms you'll find,\" featuring touchless hand dryers, he said.\n\nThe soda machine will offer customers a choice in the shape of ice they get, as well as numerous flavor combinations for both Coke and Pepsi products.\n\nOutside, the fuel pumps will have video screens imparting news and information. There will be four fuel lanes.\n\nKettler said Niemann Foods\n\nThe Harvest Market in Champaign will be adjacent to a Rainstorm Express Car Wash, just to the west on Devonshire Drive . Just to the east of Harvest Market _ at the corner of Neil Street and Devonshire Drive _ will be a Brixx Wood Fired Pizza restaurant.\n\nAs previously reported, the Carriage Center redevelopment will be anchored by County Market and Ace Hardware and by a Home 2 Suites by Hilton hotel on the north end. Wendy's will share space with an AT&T store on a lot just south of the main entrance off Neil Street .\n\nSeveral other lots remain available for sale, and there is leasable retail space between County Market and Ace Hardware.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nHolder Wealth Management has opened an office at 3007 Village Office Place , C, with plans to move to a permanent location in south Champaign in a couple months.\n\nThe investment advisory firm provides financial planning services, including portfolio management, estate planning, retirement planning and tax planning.\n\nThe chief executive officer is Daniel E. Holder , an attorney, certified public accountant and certified financial planner who most recently was a principal partner with Ruedi Holder & Associates in Champaign .\n\nBefore that, he was a senior tax partner with Clifton Gunderson from 1981 to 2001 and executive vice president of Strategic Capital Trust Co. from 2001 to 2009.\n\nHolder's son, Charles B. \"Chas\" Holder , is president of Holder Wealth Management. He, too, is an attorney and CPA.\n\nRounding out the team is Geovanny \"Geo\" Vega , who previously worked two years as a paralegal with the Phebus & Koester law firm. He will assist with the administration of client accounts.\n\nThe firm's phone number is 398-4015, and the website is holderwealthmgt.com.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nRichard Doney and Doug Ward have opened Danville Flooring Warehouse in Danville , selling carpet, vinyl flooring, hardwood flooring, commercial flooring and carpeting, ceramic tile and laminate flooring.\n\nThe business opened Aug. 25 at 807 N. Vermilion St. in a building that once housed Marie's Carpet Manor .\n\nDoney said he worked at Mielke Bros. Bargain Barn for 31 years, but with Curt and Steve Mielke planning to retire, Doney decided he wanted to work for another decade or so.\n\nDanville Flooring Warehouse offers installation, sales and service, with carpeting from Shaw and Mohawk as well as other distributors.\n\nHours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays .\n\nThe phone number is 274-7015.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nMemorable remnant\n\nMielke Bros. Bargain Barn in Danville is working to sell down inventory before the store closes this year, but one of its remnants shouldn't be hard to sell _ provided the buyer has enough room for it.\n\nThe unique remnant is a 30-by-30-foot square of artificial turf featuring the University of Illinois Chief Illiniwek logo.\n\nThe square was salvaged from the UI's Memorial Stadium in 1989 after the turf was set afire by vandals.\n\nCurt Mielke said his business bought the damaged artificial turf from the UI and subsequently sold a section of it to an indoor soccer field in Indianapolis .\n\nAnother section was sold to an Indianapolis ice skating rink so the rink could be used for other purposes.\n\nThe Mielkes have stored the Chief remnant for 25 years. They've been in business 43 years, but now the brothers are 73 and 72 and ready to retire.\n\nTheir store is at 230 W. Main St. , Danville .\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nConstruction is expected to begin this week on Villa West , the new assisted/independent living community planned for the northeast corner of Springfield Avenue and Staley Road in Champaign .\n\nThe new facility _ previously referred to as Applewood Villas in documents submitted to the city and now often referred to as simply \"Villa\" _ will include 52 beds in a 49,300-square-foot building at 4114 W. Springfield Ave. The cost of construction is estimated at $4.5 million .\n\nThe Hallbeck family, which is developing the facility, has been building homes in this area for 50 years.\n\nVilla will offer large flat-screen televisions in every apartment, Wi-Fi, a putting green, shuffleboard, a culinary staff and licensed health care staff around the clock.\n\n\"We are very excited about creating this community,\" the Hallbecks said in a release. \"We believe that just because you reach a certain age or your needs have changed, it doesn't mean your lifestyle needs to.\"\n\nDan Hallbeck of Hallbeck Development said it's hoped Villa will be ready to open in July or August of 2015.\n\nDee Giuliani , Villa's executive director, has more than 35 years of health care experience.\n\nThe community is expected to have 40 full-time and part-time employees.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nPaxton Record Editor Will Brumleve reports that Ben Grice has decided to call his planned restaurant at 102 S. Market St. in Paxton the Harvest Brewhouse.\n\nGrice is renovating the building in hopes of opening a high-end restaurant and brewery there. The building was once the home of The 102 Lounge.\n\n\"We're going to have names for all of our beers, including 'The 102 Brew' and 'Blue Mustang Ale,' among others,\" Grice said.\n\nGrice, who recently bought the former Tin Pan restaurant building at 125 S. Market St. in Paxton , plans to open The Humble Hog barbecue restaurant there in the next few weeks.\n\nHe also plans to operate Market Street Events, a catering service and venue, in the adjoining banquet hall at 121 S. Market St. in Paxton\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTwo area businesses are honoring veterans by offering them free hotcakes and haircuts.\n\nBob Evans , at 1813 N.
