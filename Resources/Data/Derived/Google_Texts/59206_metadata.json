Festival-related activities kick off at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 4, with the annual parade. The 36th Annual Randolph County Fall Festival 10K Run begins its trek through Asheboro streets at 8 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 5.\n\nFall Festival XLI officially begins at 10 a.m. on Saturday, continuing until 6 p.m. Sunday hours are also 10 a.m.-6 p.m.\n\nThe Randolph Arts Guild (RAG)-sponsored event will offer new features this year in addition to the more than 400 vendors providing arts and crafts, plenty of favorite foods and many other items during the free street festival.\n\nStreet Stage, which debuted last year, has been expanded with \u201can eclectic blend of music\u201d and other offerings for 2013 \u2014 from pottery demonstrations once again by Joseph Sand to cloggers and Dixieland tunes. This year, it\u2019s located at the corner of South Fayetteville and Academy streets.\n\nBicentennial Park Music Stage will offer \u201ca mix of Americana\u201d this year, according to Derrick Sides, the arts guild\u2019s executive director. The Courier-Tribune will also present its Readers\u2019 Choice Best of 2013 Awards at this stage Saturday afternoon. And the Gospel Music Stage will again be on the front steps of PNC Bank.\n\nA Heritage Village is being introduced on the lawn in front of the Historic Courthouse on Worth Street, representing a return to the festival\u2019s roots as an arts and crafts show.\n\n\u201cWe hope this grows in the future. We\u2019ll have a select group of artists doing very traditional things,\u201d Sides said.\n\nThis year\u2019s festival-goers will be able to learn about fiber and spindle spinning, loom and basket weaving, herbal medicine, chair caning and soap making. Heritage Village organizer Kathy McFetters perused festival scrapbooks and newspaper clippings from the past to determine the type of crafts to feature.\n\n\u201cI saw pictures of dress making, lathing, blacksmithing and candlemaking. These are the kinds of things that should be featured during our Fall Festival,\u201d McFetters said. \u201cRandolph County continues to be a reservoir of skilled and talented people who work with their hands and practice colonial life skills.\u201d\n\nThe festival area remains the same as in the past \u2014 on Sunset Avenue, from Fayetteville to Church streets, and along Fayetteville Street from Salisbury Street south to Kivett Street, with portions of some side streets (Worth, Scarboro and Academy streets) included.\n\nThe 68th Randolph County 4-H Dairy Show will once again take place during the festival and be located on South Fayetteville Street, at Kivett Street, at the festival\u2019s southern end.\n\nThe family amusements area will also provide inflatables for the kids in the Bicentennial Park parking lot off Sunset Avenue.\n\nOne event is not being held this year, the annual Horseshoe Tournament which had been taking place the past 20 years at Memorial Park. Organizers said it was ended because of waning interest.\n\nFestival-goers have a wide variety of offerings available again this year; all food sold benefits local nonprofits. All food sales benefit Randolph County nonprofits. Vendors are required to follow health department regulations and are inspected by the Randolph County Health Department during the festival.\n\nSides pointed out that the festival\u2019s overall \u201ccontinual priority\u201d remains focused on arts and crafts.\n\n\u201cWe feel we have made some strides in that.\u201d\n\nThere is a commercial area on Academy Street, with about half of those vendors being local businesses.\n\n\u201cThe people who come out and purchase items are helping many different organizations,\u201d Sides said about the nonprofit and civic groups\u2019 booths being their major fund-raisers of the year.\n\nHe also pointed out that the festival wouldn\u2019t be possible without the support RAG receives from the City of Asheboro and Randolph County. \u201cWe would not be able to do this event without those resources.\u201d\n\nSeveral local businesses are once again helping RAG with the financial support needed for Fall Festival. This year\u2019s sponsors are Randolph Telephone, Triad Heating & Cooling, Aaron\u2019s, Wells Fargo, Fairfield Inn, Asheboro Dermatology & Skin Surgery Center and Hampton Inn.\n\nParticipants, other than nonprofits, in this year\u2019s parade were asked to pay a $20 fee to cover costs of putting on the event.\n\n\u201cIt takes time and effort for our organization to coordinate and put it on,\u201d Sides said. \u201cThere\u2019s no free lunch, especially since we\u2019re using tax dollars, state and local. We need to be mindful of and make efficient use of our funds.\u201d\n\nVendors also contribute a portion of their proceeds to the arts guild and must pay a registration fee to participate, the amount determined by when they sign up.\n\nThe city will be closing downtown streets to through traffic on Friday prior to the 7 p.m. parade. The streets will remain closed until about 10:30 p.m. Sunday after cleanup.\n\n* * *\n\nCost to participate in this year\u2019s 10K is $20 in advance if paid by 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday; after then, it\u2019s $25.
