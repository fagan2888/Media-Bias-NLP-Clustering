Bill Shuster (R-Briar) just released a radio ad that accuses Tea Party opponent Art Halvorson of being negative in his campaigning against Shuster.\n\nThe Shuster ad, entitled \u2018Negative Nancy\u2019, calls Halvorson out on a few things that he mentioned in his own recent radio ad.\n\n\u201cNow the politicians in Washington want to gouge us even more with a new tax. Leading the push for this new tax is our own career politician big spender Bill Shuster,\u201d Halvorson\u2019s radio ad narrates. \u201cShuster is supporting a new proposal backed by liberals that would tax us on how far we drive. It\u2019s called track and tax. Shuster, inventing more ways to tax us, is this the kind of leadership we need? After 40 years of the Shuster dynasty and over 17 trillion dollars in debt taxpayers need a new voice.\u201d\n\nShuster\u2019s campaign is using their ad to debunk Halvorson\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cArt Halvorson has run a relentlessly negative campaign since day one,\u201d Sean Joyce, Shuster\u2019s Campaign Manager, said today. \u201cHe\u2019s been a \u2018Negative Nancy\u2019, lying about Congressman Shuster\u2019s proven conservative record every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the ad goes:\n\nMan 2- Typical Halvorson. He\u2019s run a relentlessly negative campaign for the past 9 months. Attacking Bill Shuster thousands of times online and in every speech he\u2019s given. Man 1- Art\u2019s gone as far as comparing Bill to Nancy Pelosi. Man 2- Nancy Pelosi? Bill Shuster\u2019s a proven conservative. Man 1: I know. Bill voted against Obamacare and voted 40 times to repeal it, voted against the debt ceiling increase and to cut $5 trillion in spending. Man 2: And don\u2019t forget Bill voted to cut over $10 Trillion of wasteful spending from the budget. Man 1: That doesn\u2019t sound like Nancy Pelosi. Man 2: The only Nancy in this race is Art Halvorson, he\u2019s a negative Nancy.\n\nTo make sure that no stone was left unturned, Shuster\u2019s campaign put out a Halvorson Fact Check post addressing each line of Halvorson\u2019s radio ad.\n\n\u201cArt Halvorson has been running around for month lying about Bill Shuster\u2019s record because he has nothing else to run on,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cThe problem for Art is that people around here just won\u2019t stand for his ridiculous negative attacks about our conservative Congressman Bill Shuster. Art Halvorson will literally say anything to get elected, and we already have enough of that in Washington.\u201d\n\nHalvorson and Shuster will face off along with Travis Schooley in the Republican primary for PA-9, the seat that Shuster has held since 2001.\n\nFebruary 26th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 5 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shuster\u2019s ad attempts to set the record straight.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-9-shuster-releases-negative-nancy-ad-in-response-to-halvorson/55534/", "description": "Shuster\u2019s ad attempts to set the record straight.", "title": "PA-9: Shuster Releases \u2018Negative Nancy\u2019 Ad In Response To Halvorson"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec5c\"", "article_summary": "PA-9: Shuster Releases \u2018Negative Nancy\u2019 Ad In Response To HalvorsonWritten by Jordan Krom, Contributing WriterRep.
