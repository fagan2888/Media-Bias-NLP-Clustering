George Paz, chairman and CEO of Express Scripts, received the Champion for Health Award.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of all transactions in the medical field are prescriptions, yet it represents about 15 percent of the costs. But it has the longest, biggest impact on overall, long-term health of our society,\u201d Paz told the audience.\n\n\u201cKeeping people adherent to their drug regimen keeps them out the hospital, keeps them safe and helps them grow. It\u2019s incredibly important that we do that.\u201d\n\nPas said people without health insurance pay the highest amount for prescriptions at drug stores, so Express Scripts developed Rx Outreach to help people with medications through their tough times. The problem was that it was administered within a for-profit company.\n\n\u201cWe were having trouble with Rx Outreach reaching its ultimate mission,\u201d Paz said.\n\nThen Holmes presented Paz with a business plan that showed how much better Rx Outreach would perform if it were not a part of Express Scripts. It was founded as a separate entity in 2010 with Holmes as its president. Since then, Rx Outreach has extended its reach, thanks largely to donations from drug makers.\n\n\u201cNearly 20 percent of our medications are donated by several pharmaceutical companies, and that enables us to make the medicine even more affordable to low-income people,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nHe praised Paz for his corporate and civic leadership, apart from his role in founding Rx Outreach.\n\n\u201cHis decision to put Express Scripts\u2019 headquarters on the UMSL campus \u2013 that was no accident,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cHe wanted an anchor North County, creating thousands of jobs with excellent benefits for all the people.\u201d\n\nDespite millions of people being newly covered by health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Holmes said the need for assistance with affordable medication remains.\n\n\u201cDuring the first quarter of this year, we dispensed over 101,000 prescriptions to 51,000 patients and we saved them over $20 million,\u201d Holmes told the audience. \u201cWhile I look forward to the day that Rx Outreach may not be needed, it appears that day is a long way off. We still have much work to do to help those people who cannot afford their medications.\u201d\n\nGuests at the gala bid on silent auction items and made donations at their tables to help Rx Outreach continue its work. Highest donors received gold, silver and bronze medals. The organization raised $240,000 at its first fundraising gala.\n\nRx Outreach offers more than 500 medications to eligible persons.
