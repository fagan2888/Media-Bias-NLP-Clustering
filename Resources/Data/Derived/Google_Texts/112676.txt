One of the teenagers may be paralyzed if she survives, police tell News On 6.

Police say the driver of this Crown Victoria was racing and going from 80 to 100 mph.

Two teenagers and a 6-year-old child riding in this mini-van were taken to the hospital

Tulsa Police say one of the cars involved in an injury collision late Friday night was racing and likely going between 80 and 100 mph.



The Tulsa Police corporal told News On 6 Saturday morning that the 18-year-old girl who was most seriously injured may be paralyzed from the neck down, if she survives.

The wreck took place at about 9:15 p.m. at 81st and Delaware Friday night.



"An officer drove up on a collision here at 81st and Delaware," said Sergeant Lance Eberle, Tulsa Police. "The officer and an off-duty fireman found several victims laying in the road."

The injured were riding in a white mini-van that was turning left onto Delaware from westbound 81st Street, Eberle said. A black Crown Victoria going eastbound on 81st, apparently racing a third car, hit the mini van at the back passenger side.

The other car reportedly involved in the race left without stopping, police said Saturday.



"It was a very violent collision," Eberle said. The driver of the Crown Vic was undergoing blood tests Friday night. Eberle said he did not appear to be intoxicated, but police would wait for test results.

The driver and passenger in the car were uninjured.



Two teenagers and a third occupant in the van were taken to the hospital.

Don Medford, who lives near the intersection, said he heard a boom that sounded like a fireworks explosion then came outside when he heard sirens. Medford said there haven't been as many wrecks at the intersection since the city worked to lower the hill that hampers line of sight.

"I just hope that everybody survives," he said. "We're praying for that right now."
