He is in his second pro season and was called up by the Avs on Friday to replace the injured Brad Stuart. Among 11 first-round defensemen in his draft class, Siemens will be the last one to make his big-league debut.\n\n\u201cPretty cool feeling, taking a look around, knowing that tonight was going to be the night that I was dreaming since I was 3 years old,\u201d Siemens said after the morning skate. \u201cIt\u2019s all about taking it in and focusing on what I have to do.\u201d\n\nSiemens has played in 51 games for the American Hockey League\u2019s Lake Erie Monsters this season. He has six points (all assists) and 57 penalty minutes.\n\nThe Avs are not expected to re-sign defensemen Jan Hejda and Ryan Wilson, but six other blue-liners are under contract next season. Siemens will have a tough time making the 2015-16 season out of training camp \u2014 particularly because the team will likely sign at least one high-priced defensemen in free agency \u2014 but Siemens is excited about making a good first impression.\n\n\u201cHuge opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone says you can only make one first impression.\u201d\n\nThe Avs\u2019 injured players \u2014 including Erik Johnson, Nathan MacKinnon, Jamie McGinn and Patrick Bordeleau \u2014 were interviewed after the morning skate and their thoughts about next season are here.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Duncan Siemens ready to make NHL debut in Avalanche\u2019s season finale", "title": "Duncan Siemens ready to make NHL debut in Avalanche\u2019s season finale", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/duncan-siemens-ready-to-make-nhl-debut-in-avalanches-season-finale/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_051036_duncan-siemens.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_051036_duncan-siemens.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T15:16:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:41:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the Avalanche\u2019s season finale Saturday night, defenseman Duncan Siemens will wear the No.\n16 sweater and partner with Tyson Barrie in making his NHL debut against the playoff-bound Chicago Blackhawks at the Pepsi Center.\nAmong 11 first-round defensemen in his draft class, Siemens will be the last one to make his big-league debut.\nThe Avs are not expected to re-sign defensemen Jan Hejda and Ryan Wilson, but six other blue-liners are under contract next season.\nSiemens, 21, was selected by Colorado 11th overall in the 2011 NHL draft."}
