( Stock Free Images )\n\nJoin us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)\u2014more commonly known as Obamacare\u2014is the new national health care law. The principle of sharing health costs among Christian believers, however, is as old as the New Testament\u2014and contemporary enough to be included in America\u2019s new health care law.\n\n\u201cWith great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God\u2019s grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles\u2019 feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need\u201d (Acts 4:33-35, NIV).\n\nThat\u2019s the biblical rationale for the existence of Christian-based health care sharing ministries.\n\nChristians who use a sharing ministry to meet their health care costs are employing the same principle as the early Christians. They are meeting others\u2019 needs, in this case exclusively in the area of health care costs.\n\nHealth care sharing ministries that meet the legal criteria under the PPACA are in the law as eligible options through which members can meet the legal requirement to have health cost support.\n\nThat means ministry members need not fear penalties for not having health insurance.\n\nThis particular approach is not a new concept, as the oldest health cost sharing ministry is in its 33rd year.\n\nThe system works in a way familiar to every Christian. The membership\u2014or congregation\u2014makes financial gifts that are used to meet a need.\n\nIt\u2019s the way Christians for more than 2,000 years have supported everything, from a church staff and missionaries to building programs and benevolence efforts. A need exists, whether it\u2019s to pay a pastor or help a church member who has lost a job. Money is collected and used to meet the need.\n\nHealth cost sharing ministries function in the same way. Christian members each month either send the financial gift to a central office that distributes it to the members with needs or members send funds directly to other members.\n\nHealth care sharing ministries differ from health insurance in that there is no assignment of risk. There are no contracts. Members agree to voluntarily share in meeting each other\u2019s eligible medical bills.\n\nThus, the strength of a health care sharing ministry isn\u2019t in legal compulsion, contractual obligation or threat of legal action. The strength of a true health care sharing ministry is the faithfulness and Christian commitment of its members, who are meeting a critical life need as they support their fellow Christians.\n\nHealth care sharing ministry members technically are self-pay patients. Except they really aren\u2019t. Each member has tens of thousands of fellow members supporting them with their financial gifts and prayers.\n\nAs technically self-pay patients, members are able to negotiate their own arrangements with health care providers. For example, a health care sharing member with significant chest pain spent seven hours in a hospital emergency room being tested for a possible heart attack or heart problems. The diagnosis was pericarditis, a painful condition that was, in this case, treatable with high doses of ibuprofen.\n\nThe bill was $8,900. As a self-pay patient, the member received a 47 percent discount on his bill. His health care sharing ministry paid 100 percent of his remaining costs. When he went to the cardiologist for a follow-up visit, he explained he was a member of a health care sharing ministry and asked the cardiologist for a discount.\n\nThe physician said that sounded good to him. His physicians\u2019 group had six employees whose only job each day was to file insurance claims and talk to insurance companies. Instead of his normal $130 office visit, his charge to the member was $90.\n\nOnce again, a true health cost sharing ministry is not an insurance company. Members are responsible for their personal health care administration. There is not a central office handling all aspects of their care incident and simply sending them a bill or a statement. And health care sharing ministries don\u2019t offer the same services as insurance companies.\n\nThe decision to join a health care sharing ministry should not be made lightly, quickly or without understanding that it is not a contractual legal relationship into which you\u2019re entering; it\u2019s joining hands with fellow Christians and depending on them with the same faith the early Christians demonstrated when they put their gifts at the apostles\u2019 feet.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of life and faith that worked 2,000 years ago. And it works today.\n\nRev. Howard Russell is president and chief executive officer of Christian Healthcare Ministries (CHM), located in Barberton, Ohio. CHM is the nation\u2019s longest-serving health care sharing ministry. It has tens of thousands of members in all 50 states. The ministry has the Better Business Bureau\u2019s A-plus rating as a charity. The ministry\u2019s website is www.chministries.org.\n\nDraw closer to God.
