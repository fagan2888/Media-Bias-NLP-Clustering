Family caregiving can be tough enough, but somehow it is a bit tougher when your loved one is in the hospital. My siblings and I sprang into action to develop a list of people who could visit Mom in the hospital on Christmas. We thought of presents like a new robe and slippers, a hair appointment when she came home to us, some music to lift her spirits. When we visited the hospital on Christmas Eve, Mom handed us her Christmas wish list. \u201cPlease get me everything on the list,\u201d she said. On the list \u2014 a fruit basket, chocolates, restaurant gift certificates, lottery tickets and more. \u201cIt\u2019s for the nurses and staff. I need to thank them tomorrow.\u201d And, with that simple statement, Mom reminded us of the spirit of the season \u2014 it\u2019s in giving that we receive.\n\nEvery day, 40 million Americans give so much of themselves \u2014 caring for their older parents, spouses and other loved ones so they can live independently at home. They help with bathing and dressing, meals, transportation, finances \u2014 even medical and nursing tasks, like wound care and managing medications. It\u2019s a labor of love, to be sure, and often more than a full-time job.\n\nMore support for caregivers\n\nWithout a doubt, family caregivers could use some help, commonsense solutions to make big responsibilities a little bit easier. This year, AARP fought for family caregivers in state capitals across the country, successfully getting 38 laws passed in 31 states. But we\u2019re not stopping there. In 2016, we will continue to fight for you and your family \u2014 for more support, help at home, workplace flexibility, training, financial protection and more. Supporting family caregivers is a priority for AARP because it is a priority for all of us.\n\nHappy Holidays\n\nTo all family caregivers, I know the holidays can often bring added stress, so here are a few tips holiday from caregivers for caregivers. I wish you and your families a safe, warm, and joyful holiday season. And, remember, my lesson from Mom, \u201cIt is in giving that we receive.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTo stay up to date or to get involved with AARP\u2019s caregiving advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page .\n\nor visit your .
