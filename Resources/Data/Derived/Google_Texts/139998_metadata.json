He\u2019s the former chief executive officer at Mozilla, the technology group that gave us the Firefox Web browser.\n\nEich resigned under a firestorm of controversy after it was revealed he had donated $1,000 in support of California\u2019s Proposition 8, a ballot initiative that protected traditional marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who outed Eich. But that really doesn\u2019t matter. Once his donation was revealed, supporters of gay marriage launched all-out war.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that OKCupid, the popular online dating website, asked its followers to stop using Firefox. The wireless company Credo Mobile gathered more than 50,000 signatures on a petition calling for Eich to resign.\n\nOKCupid posted a letter denouncing the Mozilla CEO, The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cThose who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame and frustration are our enemies and we wish them nothing but failure,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nWhy not demand that those who oppose gay marriage relinquish the right to own property? Why not take away their right to vote? Why not take away their children? Why not just throw them in jail? Why not force them to work in chain gangs? Why not call for public floggings? Or better yet, let\u2019s just strap them down on gurneys, stick a needle in their arm and rid the world of these intolerant anti-gay bigots once and for all.\n\nEich won\u2019t say he was forced to resign, but based on the company\u2019s press release, it\u2019s safe to say his days were numbered.\n\n\u201cMozilla prides itself on being held to a different standard and, this past week, we didn\u2019t live up to it,\u201d Mozilla Executive Chairwoman Mitchell Baker wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe know why people are hurt and angry, and they are right: it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t stayed true to ourselves.\u201d\n\nShe went on to opine about freedom of speech and equality. In her estimation, one trumps the other.\n\n\u201cEquality is necessary for meaningful speech,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard.\u201d\n\nNo, not really, Ms. Baker. Our Founding Fathers sort of worked that out in the Bill of Rights.\n\nI write about this very issue in my upcoming book, \u201cGod Less America.\u201d There are pages and pages filled with stories of workers and business owners who\u2019ve either lost their jobs or faced public floggings for their support of traditional marriage.\n\nThe left does not believe people who oppose gay marriage should be allowed to engage in the democratic process. And they have a proven track record of intimidating and bullying those who do.\n\nJust ask Angela McCaskill, the chief diversity officer at Gallaudet University. She was suspended after she signed a petition in her church to put a gay marriage referendum on the ballot in Maryland.\n\nJust ask Scott Eckern, the former artistic director of California Musical Theatre. He resigned under pressure after he gave money to support Prop 8. As one activist told The New York Times, \u201cI do believe there comes a time when you cannot sit back and accept what I think is the most dangerous form of bigotry.\u201d\n\nJust ask our nation\u2019s top military officials. They were called into President Obama\u2019s office and told that if they could not support \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d they should resign their commissions.\n\n\u201cWe were called into the Oval Office and President Obama looked at all five service chiefs in the eye and said, \u2018This is what I want to do,\u2019\u201d said Coast Guard Adm. Robert Papp in remarks reported by Buzzfeed.\n\nThe road to political correctness is littered with the bodies of folks like Brendan Eich sideswiped by the tolerance and diversity bus.\n\nI trust there are rational and reasonable individuals within the gay rights community who understand the dangers of stifling free speech and expression. But the voices that are winning the day are those who believe gay rights trump everyone else\u2019s rights.\n\nI know this may sound old-fashioned, but gainful employment should not be determined by where you put your reproductive organs.\n\nTolerance is a b*tch, ain\u2019t it?", "article_metadata": {"description": "As we enter this golden age of tolerance and diversity, the nation\u2019s gay rights community is sending a warning message to Americans: If you don\u2019t support gay marriage, you don\u2019t deserve a job..05/26/2016 18:34:26PM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "As we enter this golden age of tolerance and diversity, the nation\u2019s gay rights community is sending a warning message to Americans: If you don\u2019t support gay marriage, you don\u2019t deserve a job.", "title": "- Mozilla Chief Learns, if You Don\u2019t Support Gay Marriage, You Don\u2019t Deserve a Job", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/04/04/mozilla-chief-learns-if-you-dont-support-gay-marriage-you-dont-deserve-a-job-n1818885", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/38/4180038f-087f-44b4-b600-0d3141ff8933.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "As we enter this golden age of tolerance and diversity, the nation\u2019s gay rights community is sending a warning message to Americans: If you don\u2019t support gay marriage, you don\u2019t deserve a job.", "title": "- Mozilla Chief Learns, if You Don\u2019t Support Gay Marriage, You Don\u2019t Deserve a Job", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/04/04/mozilla-chief-learns-if-you-dont-support-gay-marriage-you-dont-deserve-a-job-n1818885", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/38/4180038f-087f-44b4-b600-0d3141ff8933.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Mozilla Chief Learns, if You Don\u2019t Support Gay Marriage, You Don\u2019t Deserve a Job, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "They were called into President Obama\u2019s office and told that if they could not support \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d they should resign their commissions.\nAs we enter this golden age of tolerance and diversity, the nation\u2019s gay rights community is sending a warning message to Americans: If you don\u2019t support gay marriage, you don\u2019t deserve a job.\nBut the voices that are winning the day are those who believe gay rights trump everyone else\u2019s rights.\nThe left does not believe people who oppose gay marriage should be allowed to engage in the democratic process.\nShe was suspended after she signed a petition in her church to put a gay marriage referendum on the ballot in Maryland."}
