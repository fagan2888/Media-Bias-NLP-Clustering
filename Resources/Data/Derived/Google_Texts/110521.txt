A Venezuelan lawmaker trying to honor late President Hugo Chavez during a public ceremony rubbed some attendees the wrong way with her rendition of the Lord’s Prayer — subbing out God and inserted the Socialist ruler.

“Our Chavez, who art in Heaven, in earth, in the sea and in us the delegates,” prayed Maria Estrella Uribe at an event in Caracas on Monday, Fox News reported. “Hallowed be thy name, thy legacy come to us to take to the people … gives us today your light to that it guides us all days and lead us not into the temptation of capitalism, deliver us from evil, oligarchy and the crime of smuggling, for centuries of centuries. Amen.”

She then wrapped with “Viva Chavez,” Fox News reported.

Miss Uribe said she changed the words because she didn’t want attendees to “leave without this spiritual commitment,” La Patilla reported.

Chavez, who died in March 2013 after a long bout with cancer, left behind an economy so poor that residents are being told to scan their fingerprints at the grocery store to prevent any one person from buying too much of a single product, Fox News reported.
