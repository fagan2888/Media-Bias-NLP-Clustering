Times A1, \u201cLeaving a Tip: A Custom in Need of Changing?\u201d \u2013 \u201cCritic\u2019s Notebook\u201d by restaurant critic Pete Wells: \u201c[]It is irrational, outdated, ineffective, confusing, prone to abuse and sometimes discriminatory. The people who take care of us in restaurants deserve a better system, and so do we. That\u2019s one reason we pay attention when a restaurant tries another way, as Sushi Yasuda in Manhattan started to do two months ago. Raising most of its prices, it appended this note to credit card slips: \u2018Following the custom in Japan, Sushi Yasuda\u2019s service staff are fully compensated by their salary. Therefore gratuities are not accepted.\u2019 Sushi Yasuda joins other restaurants that have done away with tips, replacing them with either a surcharge (Atera and Chef\u2019s Table at Brooklyn Fare in New York; Next and Alinea in Chicago; Coi and Chez Panisse in the San Francisco Bay Area) or prices that include the cost of service (Per Se in New York and the French Laundry in Healdsburg, Calif.). \u2026\n\n\u201cThese restaurants are numerous enough and important enough to suggest that a tip-reform movement is under way. \u2026 Front-of-house workers are suing one respected restaurant after another, \u2026 accusing them of playing fast and loose with the laws on tips. The charges include sharing tips with workers who aren\u2019t eligible for them and making tipped employees spend too much time on what is called sidework, like folding napkins between meals. \u2026 Some owners now think they can avoid the suits by eliminating tips.\u201d http://nyti.ms/13dbcMk\n\nDRIVING THE DAY: President Clinton will speech on the Affordable Care Act at 11 a.m. ET at his presidential library in Little Rock. Speech will stream at www.clintonfoundation.org and www.whitehouse.gov/clinton-aca-speech.\n\n--A White House official: \u201cPresident Clinton's speech is part of ongoing outreach efforts around the Affordable Care Act about a month ahead of Marketplaces opening. These efforts will help to ensure that Americans know that there will be a simple way to get health insurance that will fit your needs, lifestyle, and budget at any income level, starting this fall. President Obama, senior administration officials, and wide range of stakeholders including DJs, librarians, faith leaders, pharmacies, celebrities, and insurance companies are working to ensure that Americans know about the new health insurance options that will be available in the new Marketplaces.\"\n\nABOUT LAST NIGHT \u2013 \u201cJon Stewart returns to 'The Daily Show,\u2019\u201d by AP Television Writer David Bauder: \u201c]T[he shaggy beard he grew over the summer is gone. \u2026 The \u2026 host quickly referenced stories he missed -- Paula Deen, Anthony Weiner's alter ego \u2018Carlos Danger\u2019 and Miley Cyrus' sultry MTV dance -- then took up the challenge of trying to make comedy and social commentary out of the Syrian poison gas attack. \u2026 \u2018America taking military action against a Middle East regime \u2026 It's like I never left.\u2019 After showing Secretary of State Kerry refer to \u2018signatures of sarin gas,\u2019 \u2026 Stewart launched into a mock commercial for \u2018Signature of Sarin\u2019 perfume. \u2026 He played \u2026 tape of \u2026 pundits saying that military action against Syria is necessary because the United States would look weak \u2026 \u2018Oh, right \u2026 We have to bomb Syria because we're in the seventh grade.\u2019 \u2026 [His first guest was] the head of the United Nation's relief effort in Jordan, taking care of refugees from Syria that have now exceeded two million.\u201d\n\nSYRIA UPDATE IN 1 PARAGRAPH -- Congressional support: Speaker Boehner announced he will back the president on Syria. \u2026 House Majority Leader Cantor released a statement of support. \u2026 House Minority Leader Pelosi wrote a letter to her caucus urging support. \u2026Senate Majority Leader Reid\u2019s office indicated that he believes he has the votes to override a filibuster. \u2026 House Minority Whip Hoyer issued a statement backing \u201cthe President\u2019s call for authorizing limited but decisive military action.\u201d \u2026 Advocates who support: AIPAC \u2026 Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations \u2026 Anti-Defamation League \u2026 former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n--FLOODING THE ZONE: After Obama\u2019s news conference from Sweden, Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey will hold a Senate Armed Services Committee classified briefing at 9 a.m. Also at 9 a.m., Secretary Kerry and Director Clapper will testify at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee classified hearing. At noon, Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey will testify at a House Foreign Affairs Committee open hearing.\n\nTHE PLAYERS:\n\n--\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s Test,\u201d by Ginger Gibson, with Manu Raju: \u201cWith a majority of House Republicans unlikely to support President Obama\u2019s use-of-force resolution, Pelosi\u2019s Democrats will be key to passing an authorization of force resolution \u2026 It\u2019s a somewhat unusual position for House Democrats, who have been only marginally important since losing the House majority in 2010. But if they joined with a handful of Republicans \u2014 including House Speaker Boehner \u2014 to approve a Syria strike, they would be following a pattern that worked earlier in the year when Democrats helped Republicans pass the fiscal cliff deal and aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy. Democratic aides are already pushing back at the idea that the future of the resolution lies on their shoulders, arguing that the House GOP majority should take responsibility. But that won\u2019t change the narrative if there is a less than robust showing by the Democratic caucus. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe House Democratic leadership insists that it won\u2019t whip the vote, or try to pressure members into siding with the president. An informal survey will be taken to determine how many votes for a military strike exist. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be working behind the scenes to persuade lawmakers. The House Democratic leadership is making the case that the vote isn\u2019t about war \u2014 emphasizing that this isn\u2019t another Iraq \u2014 but about humanitarian aid, an appeal much more likely to win favor with anti-war Democrats. \u2026 Pelosi sent a letter to her members on Tuesday afternoon appealing for their support. \u2026 \u2018This is a matter of national, regional, and global security.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/17E2uWU\n\n--\u201cMarco Rubio shifts direction on Syria,\u201d by Manu Raju: \u201cFor much of the last two years, Marco Rubio has been banging the drum on Syria: Demanding U.S. intervention to knock the Assad regime from power. Now, the senator has taken a different tack: The administration has missed the boat. How the Florida Republican has evolved on the issue is emblematic of the difficulties President Obama faces in winning congressional approval of military action in Syria, particularly among Republicans. It also shows the difficult line GOP presidential contenders like Rubio must balance in trying to project a sense of American military might without turning off conservatives skeptical about following Obama\u2019s lead on a war. Indeed, the Syria vote is turning out to be the first big foreign policy test of the 2016 campaign, as prospective presidential contenders like Rubio stake out their positions on the most controversial \u2013 and consequential \u2014 vote of the 113th Congress so far.\n\n\u201cSince winning election on a tea party platform in 2010, Rubio has been a proponent of a more aggressive foreign policy, breaking from fellow tea party favorites and potential 2016 rivals like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who have argued for a more limited American role overseas. \u2026 Unlike Cruz and Paul, neither of whom believe that military action is necessary in Syria, Rubio argues what happens in Syria is \u2018vital\u2019 to the national security interest of the United States, given the Assad regime\u2019s ties to Iran and terrorism groups. But like Cruz and Paul, Rubio appears likely to vote against the resolution authorizing force against Syria. At the hearing Tuesday, Rubio attacked the administration for making a choice to \u2018lead from behind\u2019 on Syria [and said] that had the administration heeded the calls he and others made two years ago to arm the Syrian rebels, it wouldn\u2019t be in the predicament it is.\u201d http://politi.co/14iKIM7\n\n--BUT, BUT, BUT \u2026 Dan Senor predicts on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that Rubio will eventually vote FOR authorization: \u201cI think Rubio will come around. I think he's frustrated, as Republicans are. \u2026 Republicans were frustrated that Clinton acted late in the Balkans. You can come up with all these criticisms. But it's better to do something than not do something at all. \u2026 Marco will be fine. \u2026 I have confidence that Marco will be there.\u201d\n\n--RUBIO to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, who had a live special at 11 last night: \u201c\"The large number of radical Islamists who now find themselves in Syria means that if Assad were to fall \u2013 if he stays in power, that's obviously bad, because it empowers Iran, and so forth \u2013 but if he falls, it's also possible it could trigger a second civil war.\u201d\n\n--\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s Syria dilemma,\u201d by Maggie Haberman and Elizabeth Titus: \u201cHillary Clinton has answered calls that she pick a side in the Syria debate. But the former Secretary of State\u2019s brief statement Tuesday backing President Obama\u2019s campaign for a military strike won\u2019t be the last time she\u2019s asked to talk about the potentially sensitive issue. Clinton pressed during her time at Foggy Bottom to arm some Syrian rebels to combat the regime of Bashar Assad. \u2026 Clinton was seen as one of the more hawkish voices in the Obama administration and now needs to demonstrate to a liberal base that she learned from her 2002 vote authorizing the Iraq war and her carefully-calibrated walk away from it during her 2008 campaign. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018I think Mrs. Clinton finds herself in the middle of a very ironic dilemma,\u2019 said Bruce Riedel, of the Brookings Institution \u2026 \u2018She probably lost the nomination for the presidency in 2008 because Barack Obama had spoken out about a stupid war and now he\u2019s put her in the place where she either supports him or speaks out against it. From a political standpoint I think she\u2019s in a tough place.\u2019 Clinton\u2019s brief initial comments on Syria, made through an aide, came a week before the ex-Secretary of State is to give a speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia \u2013 the first in a series policy addresses \u2026 Clinton owned a piece of the Syria puzzle while at State, as one former administration official put it. It is much harder to attack her to an operation taking place months after she left \u2013 but it opens the door for familiar criticism from her opponents over her tenure at Foggy Bottom.\u201d http://politi.co/15y9FnC\n\n**A message from America's Mayors: Parents Send Congress Back to School on Background Checks -- Every day in America, seven kids are murdered with guns.

Bash spent years as chief of staff at both the CIA and Pentagon for former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a close Clinton ally. [Allen and Bash] worked together in a variety of roles while Allen was a White House staffer for President George W. Bush and as staff director of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \u2026 [Bash said: \u2018W]e\u2019ve all spent the better part of the last decade in government, mostly in the national security arena.\u2019 \u2026 [T]hey have quietly set up a consulting group built on providing advice to companies, primarily defense contractors, focused on international defense business as well as cyber, although their first client was Bash\u2019s former boss, Panetta. \u2026\n\n\u201c[The group\u2019s] client list \u2026 now surpasses a dozen, and [the principals] spent part of last week meeting with an architect to go over plans for new office space set to be ready in November. Beacon won\u2019t name the companies on that list because of nondisclosure agreements. \u2026 The firm started to coalesce in April but didn\u2019t get fully off the ground until Aug. 6, the day after Allen left his job in Congress and officially joined, helped by seed funding from Claude Fontheim of Fontheim International, another consulting firm. The other three departed their administration positions earlier in the year. .. In their new space, one of the offices is being converted into a room for their combined six kids to play. Building a firm while that firm\u2019s principals might want to return to government creates its own obstacles, such as the politics of certain clients. \u2026\n\n\u201cBeacon has already turned down clients and won\u2019t work for foreign governments, Reines said, and despite the interest in future government jobs, the principals aren\u2019t simply biding their time for an offer, alluding to the presidential elections for which Clinton may be a candidate in 2016. \u2018In terms of going back in, I think we all want to, but we also know that life doesn\u2019t necessarily work out so cutely that you have to worry about three years from now\u2019 \u2026 There also is a push to stay in the national security space, while promoting bipartisanship. \u2026 \u2018I worked for eight years for President Bush, and the last two years for the Republican Party,\u2019 Allen said. \u2018Everybody we\u2019ve talked to has almost a sense of relief on their face. They\u2019re glad that we\u2019ve got both Republicans and Democrats.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cThe group is being set up to focus on several hot areas in national security: international sales, potential vertical integration in the defense industry, and cyber. But the firm is clear that it will help only with items that align with US policy. \u2026 And since the group has no plans to do any lobbying, that help will be concentrated in strategic thinking, such as how to handle a complicated weapons sales picture in the Middle East, Shapiro said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1ee21zK\n\n--PLAYBOOK BACKSTORY: For 133 days -- a D.C. record \u2013 the embryonic firm (including associates Ashley Woolheater and Sarah Davey) flew under the radar. BGS found its soon-to-be office building through Kurt Campbell, who set up The Asia Group after leaving State in January. The guys loved the space, and the firms will be next-door neighbors when they move in. The guys are putting together an advisory group of people they respect and who have been mentors, and who they will continue to seek guidance from. The firm\u2019s user-friendly website, www.beaconglobalstrategies.com, was created by a Massachusetts developer, Initial Design Group. www.initialdesigngroup.com\n\nHAPPENING NEXT WEEK \u2013 \u201cAides: Chris Christie not meeting Rand Paul,\u201d by Maggie Haberman: \u201cChristie won\u2019t be joining Sen. Rand Paul and U.S. Senate hopeful Steve Lonegan at a New Jersey rally next week, \u2026 citing a scheduling conflict. Christie has a long-scheduled trip planned with his wife Mary Pat for her 50th birthday, a campaign aide said. \u2026 Paul, who was already planning a fundraiser with Lonegan, is also planning to make a public appearance with him \u2014 but officials had invited Paul\u2019s recent national security sparring partner, Christie, to attend. Lonegan, who ran against Christie for governor in 2009, has recently praised him as very helpful to his campaign, but also sided with Paul in a dispute over Hurricane Sandy aid.\u201d\n\nMEDIAWATCH \u2013 CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker; Meredith Artley, managing editor of CNN Digital; and Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist will announce on the 9 a.m. editorial call: \u201cPETER HAMBY will be joining the digital team as a national political reporter. Think digital correspondent a la Kelly Wallace . \u2026 His specialty is national politics -- the hot campaigns, candidates and characters. The stuff outside of the [D]istrict. He's not often found at his desk. Hamby will use his powerful social presence (over 40,000 fans and political junkies follow him on Twitter), swift and voice-packed writing skills\u2026 and his on-air experience to deliver scoops on TV and create a cross-platform conversation in text and video.\u201d\n\n--JIM SCIUTTO, ABC alumnus and chief of staff to the U.S. ambassador to China, named CNN chief national security correspondent, effective immediately: \u201cThe announcement was made \u2026 by Sam Feist, Washington bureau chief and senior vice president. \u2026 Sciutto was ABC News\u2019 senior foreign correspondent, based in primarily in London and later, from Washington. \u2026 His extensive reporting included dozens of assignments from inside Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran. He is the author of a book based on his own experiences in the Middle East, \u2018Against Us: The New Face of America\u2019s Enemies in the Muslim World.\u2019 \u2026 Most recently, Sciutto served as chief of staff and senior advisor to the U.S. Ambassador to China, Gary Locke. \u2026 He graduated from Yale University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Chinese history.\u201d\n\nSPORTS BLINK \u2013 COACH DEFENDS JOHNNY FOOTBALL \u2013 Fort Worth Star-Telegram\u2019s Jimmy Burch, in College Station: \u201cTexas A&M football coach Kevin Sumlin \u2026 fired back Tuesday at college football analysts who accused quarterback Johnny Manziel of ignoring his coach during a fourth-quarter sideline exchange. Outsiders also raised questions about the internal discipline of a program that had eight players miss all or part of the Rice game while serving suspensions. [Sumlin said] he was \u2018shocked\u2019 by the national narrative about A&M, driven primarily by ESPN analysts who viewed Manziel's action as a show of disrespect toward Sumlin \u2026 ESPN analysts Mark May and Matt Millen -- among legions of others \u2013 espous[ed] opinions Sunday that Manziel displayed his selfish side when he bumped into, then walked past, Sumlin on the sideline after drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Sumlin told a much different version Tuesday, saying he greeted the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner with some strong words and Manziel was wise to remain silent.\n\n\u201c\u2018When he came off the field, I made two statements to him; neither one of which should he have responded to,\u2019 said Sumlin, who benched Manziel after the penalty. \u2018They weren't questions. They were direct statements that I can't repeat right now.\u2019 \u2026 May, who described Manziel as \u2018a very selfish player\u2019 who acted like \u2018a 6-year-old not getting his favorite toy\u2019 in a season debut marked by hand gestures toward opponents and the sideline encounter with Sumlin. \u2026 [T]eammates \u2026 clarified Manziel's \u2018cashing out\u2019 hand gesture as something players have used in celebrations the past two seasons to show they are reaping the rewards of their time investment. \u2026 His yapping and hand gestures made him an easy target for \u2026 a 15-yard-penalty that could prove costly in a matchup against top-ranked Alabama [on Sept. 14]. \u2026 \u2018He plays with a lot of emotion and a lot of passion,\u2019 \u2026 Sumlin said. \u2018Because of that, he gets in a gray area. It's our job as coaches to keep that passion and energy going but make it positive. Is it a challenge at times? You bet, it's a challenge.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1dFWEL4\n\nKATIE COURIC ENGAGED to JOHN MOLNER: PEOPLE magazine says she \u201cecstatically accepted a proposal from her boyfriend of nearly two years, banker John Molner, 50. \u2026 Molner popped the question [over the holiday weekend] with a spectacular diamond ring at sunset on the beach in East Hampton, N.Y. \u2026 Couric and Molner, who is head of mergers and acquisitions at Brown Brothers Harriman, first went public with their romance in April 2012.
