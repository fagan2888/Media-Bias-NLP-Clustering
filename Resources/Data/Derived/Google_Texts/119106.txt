Little green army men, a favorite toy for generations of pretend soldiers, joined classics like G.I. Joe and Barbie in the National Toy Hall of Fame.

The tiny plastic soldiers, a nightmare for barefoot parents, beat out nine other finalists for the coveted spot in the museum, including Fisher-Price Little People, American Girl dolls and My Little Pony, the Associated Press reported Thursday.

The 1980’s puzzle Rubik’s Cube and soap bubbles also made it to the National Toy Hall of Fame on Thursday.

Little green army men first emerged in 1938 but fell out of favor after the Vietnam War. After the toy was prominently featured in the 1995 Pixar hit “Toy Story” the green soldiers came back in vogue.

It is unclear how many sets of little soldiers have sold over the years. They are still available for purchase online for varying prices. A “Bucket O Soldiers” is available for $16.99 and included 72 soldiers and two parachutes.

Toys are chosen for inclusion in the hall of fame by a national selection committee made up of 24 experts, including toy collectors, designers and psychologists who select nominees that have achieved icon status over generations, fostered learning, creativity or discovery, and have profoundly changed play or toy design, AP reported.
