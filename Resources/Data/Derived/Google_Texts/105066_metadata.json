Krystal Ball and Anne Thompson reported for MSNBC:\n\nMurthy\u2019s nomination has been held up by Republicans and a few red state Democrats due to this surprisingly controversial stance: He believes that guns can impact your health. Well, to be fair, this conservative coalition is not troubled by his stance, so much as they are fearful of the NRA, which decided to try to scuttle Murthy\u2019s confirmation. The NRA wrote a strongly worded letter, Rand Paul put a hold on the nomination, and Red State Democrats begged Harry Reid to not force them to vote. It\u2019s funny that the strongly worded letters of ordinary citizens don\u2019t seem to have quite the same effect.\n\nA senator can use a procedural move called a hold to prevent a motion from reaching a vote. The hold can be a secret hold or done publicly on the floor. So it doesn\u2019t matter that red state Democrats are afraid of the NRA (although the NRA\u2019s hold over our supposed representatives is sickening). A hold stops a vote from coming to the floor anyway, so this one is on Rand Paul.\n\nUnbeknownst to most of the public, the Republicans have been using the hold/secret hold to obstruct a record number of Obama\u2019s nominees. See, it\u2019s not just jobs bills/legislation that they obstruct. It\u2019s a whole shock and awe strategy implemented by Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who is on record admitting that obstructing everything Obama did would be the GOP plan for his entire presidency.\n\nIn May of 2010, I observed:\n\nThere\u2019s a disturbing trend in the Senate under President Obama, wherein Republicans are abusing secret holds in order to stall and block over 96 nominees of the President\u2019s. These nominees range from federal court nominees to executive agencies, like the TSA -an agency whose current lack of leadership puts our lives at risk every day, as evidenced by the Christmas bomber and the no-fly list failure with the Times Square bomber. Dozens of these nominees have sailed through committee hearings only to be brought to halt on the Senate floor through the use of what are called Secret Holds, which allow any senator to block any nominee at any time for any reason \u2014 anonymously. A new rule meant to lift the secrecy has had little effect.\n\nAt that time, Senator Clair McCaskill (D-MO) called the Republicans out on their abuse of procedural rules, saying Republicans were using a \u201cstall and block\u201d tactic. \u201cThis is called stall and block, stall and block, stall and block, stall and block \u2014 and fine, but own it!\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna stall and block, let\u2019s see who you are.\u201d\n\nShe warned them that they would own it, and yet here they are, blaming Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid, as if he\u2019s just refusing to call a vote because he doesn\u2019t want his own party\u2019s administration to function. Back then, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) called the unprecedented obstruction, \u201c\u2026 an attack on this administration to do its constitutional duty.\u201d\n\nBut isn\u2019t that just perfect? After all, Republicans are planning to run on Ebola now that Obamacare is such a success, and they couldn\u2019t very well run on fear if they weren\u2019t obstructing the President\u2019s administration. This way they can blame Obama for the results of their obstruction, and no one is the wiser. Vote Republican, because otherwise they\u2019ll terrorize the country and muck up government so much you\u2019ll just give in out of exhaustion. Which seems like a plausible response until you remember how they handle government (see Katrina).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans' new talking point to get around taking responsibility for their obstruction of the confirmation of Obama's surgeon general is that Harry Reid (D-NV) could call for a vote any time.
