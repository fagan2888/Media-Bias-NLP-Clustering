How Woodrow Wilson\u2019s reelection race gave birth to modern political tactics\u201d: Robert Woolley, DNC publicity director, \u201corganized the bureau along the same lines as a metropolitan daily, with departments designed to take maximum advantage of the modern mass-communications systems then emerging. A former Nashville Tennessean editor oversaw a weekly bulletin containing bits of news, statistics and editorials that was sent to 8,500 newspapers and all Washington correspondents. A former Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Constitution wrote a daily article signed by the DNC chairman, Vance McCormick.\n\n\u201cOther departments disseminated ... advertisements and short movies that could be shown in theaters. Staffers clipped favorable political cartoons ... and distributed them in printing-press-ready form to more than 1,000 newspapers. ... The editor of a farm magazine prepared material for that constituency; a staffer with close ties to labor supervised [those] appeals; ... another specialized in religious messaging. In one targeted mailing, the DNC publicity bureau sent color pictures of Wilson to almost every woman in states where they had acquired the vote, to show that the president valued their opinions.
