Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, questioned the bank\u2019s watchdog on the indictment of former Ex-Im official Johnny Gutierrez, who allegedly accepted bribes from a Florida company in exchange for help securing taxpayer-backed financing.\n\n\u201cThat is huge news,\u201d Jordan told The Daily Signal. \u201cWith that kind of corruption going on, for [bank officials] to come in here and ask Congress to reauthorize them\u2014that\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t reauthorize, that and a host of other reasons. That\u2019s a huge takeaway.\u201d\n\nThis summer, The Wall Street Journal revealed that Gutierrez, who worked as a loan officer at Ex-Im, and three other employees, had been suspended for bribery and improperly awarding contracts during their tenure at the bank. Gutierrez was later placed on leave.\n\nYesterday, the Justice Department charged the former Ex-Im loan officer with bribery. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges Gutierrez accepted cash and other things 19 times from 2006 to 2013.\n\nJordan has previously pressed bank officials for the names of the other three employees, but his inquiries haven\u2019t been satisfied.\n\n>>> Export-Import Bank Won\u2019t Respond to Information Requests About Ties to Clinton-Backed Consulting Firm\n\nIn addition to Gutierrez\u2019s case, there are 31 allegations of fraud currently being investigated by the Ex-Im\u2019s inspector general. McCarthy told the panel of lawmakers it\u2019s likely more indictments will be issued following the completion of those investigations.\n\n\u201cAll we ask is, \u2018Can you assure us that this is not going to happen anymore?\u2019 And he not only couldn\u2019t assure us of that, he said there may be future indictments,\u201d said @Jim_Jordan.\n\n\u201cAll we ask is, \u2018Can you assure us that this is not going to happen anymore?\u2019\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd he not only couldn\u2019t assure us of that, he said there may be future indictments.\u201d\n\nGutierrez appeared before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for questioning last year, but invoked his Fifth Amendment right.\n\nIn addition to McCarthy, witnesses at today\u2019s hearing included bank Chairman Fred Hochberg, Treasury Department Under Secretary for International Affairs Nathan Sheets, Ex-Im Assistant Inspector General Mark Thorum and Government Accountability Office Director of International Affairs and Trade Kimberly Gianopoulos.\n\nEx-Im is an 80-year-old agency that provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products. Last year, Congress extended the bank\u2019s reauthorization through the end of June. Lawmakers are now debating whether the bank\u2019s life should be extended or ended for good.\n\nSupporters of Ex-Im argue the bank helps small businesses compete in the global market and creates jobs in the U.S. However, opponents believe the agency serves as an engine of cronyism and corporate welfare.\n\nLast year, Congress extended Ex-Im\u2019s authorization through the end of June. Lawmakers are currently debating whether to extend its charter or allow the bank\u2019s life to end.\n\nWatch Jordan question McCarthy beginning at 03:09:51.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ex-Im's chief watchdog said today it\u2019s likely more indictments could be issued as a result of more than 31 investigations into alleged fraud at the agency.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ex-Im's chief watchdog said today it\u2019s likely more indictments could be issued as a result of more than 31 investigations into alleged fraud at the agency.", "title": "Future Indictments of Export-Import Bank Officials Likely", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150415_ExImHearing_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T22:31:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1E2JVjO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ex-Im's chief watchdog said today it\u2019s likely more indictments could be issued as a result of more than 31 investigations into alleged fraud at the agency.", "title": "Future Indictments of Export-Import Bank Officials Likely", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150415_ExImHearing_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-04-15T14:50:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T22:31:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Jim Jordan, Johnny Gutierrez, Justice Department, Fred Hochberg, Michael McCarthy, House Financial Services Committee, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee"}, "article_summary": "Jordan has previously pressed bank officials for the names of the other three employees, but his inquiries haven\u2019t been satisfied.\nYesterday, the Justice Department charged the former Ex-Im loan officer with bribery.\nLawmakers are currently debating whether to extend its charter or allow the bank\u2019s life to end.\nMcCarthy told the panel of lawmakers it\u2019s likely more indictments will be issued following the completion of those investigations.\nLawmakers are now debating whether the bank\u2019s life should be extended or ended for good."}
