The former head of equity capital markets for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Australia is back on the radar screens in the finance industry.

Mike Everett, who left the Wall Street bank in January after 11 years, has been appointed as a member of Australia-listed FRR Corporation Ltd.’s advisory committee.

He’s been awarded a total of 5 million options on the company’s stock, exercisable at A$0.01 a share. That’s on condition that FRR trades above at least A$0.02 a share or A$0.03 a share on average, over 20 business days.

The company is keen to accelerate its transformation into a high growth and strong cash-flow generating business, according to its website.

“In addition to developing the company’s contract services business, including the recently acquired accommodation rental operation, the new board intends to pursue acquisitions in high-growth sectors,” FRR states on its website.

FRR’s dealmaking board includes Corrs Chambers Westgarth private equity partner Philip Kapp and Sydney-based private equity firm Ironbridge Capital’s operational partner Mike Hill. Julian Knights, a founder of Ironbridge, is also on FRR’s advisory committee.
