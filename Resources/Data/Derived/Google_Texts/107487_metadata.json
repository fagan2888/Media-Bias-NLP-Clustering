Tom Williams/Getty Images\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Advancements in cancer research have enabled better detection and treatment of cancers and even better quality of life for cancer survivors, but is a significant portion of the U.S. public getting left behind?\n\nEven as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) promises to close gaps in health care coverage and make it more accessible, many cancer researchers are unsure how much it can do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only an issue of being able to pay for care, (but) also is the care that\u2019s delivered (provided) in a culturally appropriate way?\u201d said Dr. Christopher I. Li, program head of the translational research program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \u201cAre the barriers with distance taken care of? Issues such as child care or getting off of work, things like that \u2026 There are all these other factors that also need to be addressed. It\u2019s not just about paying for it.\u201d\n\nLi was one of the chairs of a conference sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research, where researchers came together to discuss how to help close the gap between those who are benefiting the most from new advances and those who have not done as well.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of gaps in how different groups of people fare after they contract various diseases.\n\n\u201cHealth disparities are really a global problem, and so when we talk about cancer, disparities really impact every type of cancer,\u201d Li said.\n\nMany of the cancers discussed at these meetings, he said, are both common and have higher rates in certain minority groups \u2014 in occurrence or mortality rates. For example, prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is found in African-American men at the highest rate in the world. Similarly, he said, African-American women have the highest mortality rates from breast cancer, and along with Hispanic women, they tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease when they are diagnosed. Also, Li said, African-American men and women have higher mortality rates from colon cancer.\n\nJean McDougall, a postdoctoral researcher at Fred Hutchinson, said there are good reasons to doubt the new health care law alone will close gaps in care.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to improve access to care,\u201d she said, \u201cbut whether it makes a difference in terms of the timeliness of treatment, I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even with new health law, researchers worry other factors beyond affordability will continue to create barriers", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/10/minorities-womenstrugglewithunequalaccesstocancercare.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/12/10/minorities-womenstrugglewithunequalaccesstocancercare/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Cancer_Screening.1386704931718.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Even with new health law, researchers worry other factors beyond affordability will continue to create barriers", "title": "Minorities, women struggle with unequal access to cancer care"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/12/10/minorities-womenstrugglewithunequalaccesstocancercare/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.Cancer_Screening.1386704931718.jpg", "description": "Even with new health law, researchers worry other factors beyond affordability will continue to create barriers", "card": "summary", "title": "Minorities, women struggle with unequal access to cancer care"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Race & Ethnicity, Disease, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0da4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHealth disparities are really a global problem, and so when we talk about cancer, disparities really impact every type of cancer,\u201d Li said.\nFor example, prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, is found in African-American men at the highest rate in the world.\nAlso, Li said, African-American men and women have higher mortality rates from colon cancer.\nSimilarly, he said, African-American women have the highest mortality rates from breast cancer, and along with Hispanic women, they tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease when they are diagnosed.\nTom Williams/Getty ImagesATLANTA \u2014 Advancements in cancer research have enabled better detection and treatment of cancers and even better quality of life for cancer survivors, but is a significant portion of the U.S. public getting left behind?"}
