But they spike especially when Washington and Seoul stage what they call annual defensive springtime war games. Pyongyang says the drills, which were set to start Monday and run through the end of April, are invasion rehearsals.\n\nThe North\u2019s powerful National Defense Commission threatened strikes against targets in the South, U.S. bases in the Pacific and the U.S. mainland, saying its enemies \u201care working with bloodshot eyes to infringe upon the dignity, sovereignty and vital rights\u201d of North Korea.\n\n\u201cIf we push the buttons to annihilate the enemies even right now, all bases of provocations will be reduced to seas in flames and ashes in a moment,\u201d the North\u2019s statement said.\n\nA pre-emptive large-scale military strike that would end the authoritarian rule of the Kim dynasty is highly unlikely. There is also considerable outside debate about whether North Korea is even capable of the kind of \u201cstrikes\u201d it threatens. The North makes progress with each new nuclear test \u2014 it staged its fourth in January \u2014 but many experts say its arsenal may consist only of still-crude nuclear bombs; there\u2019s uncertainty about whether they\u2019ve mastered the miniaturization process needed to mount bombs on warheads and widespread doubt about whether they have a reliable long-range missile that could deliver such a bomb to the U.S. mainland.\n\nBut North Korea\u2019s bellicose rhetoric raises unease in Seoul and its U.S. ally, not least because of the huge number of troops and weaponry facing off along the world\u2019s most heavily armed border, which is an hour\u2019s drive from the South Korean capital of Seoul and its 10 million residents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Korea again threatens nuke strikes on US, South Korea", "title": "North Korea again threatens nuke strikes on US, South Korea", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "North Korea again threatens nuke strikes on US, South Korea", "title": "North Korea again threatens nuke strikes on US, South Korea", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/07/north_korea_again_threatens_nuke_strikes_on_us_south_korea/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/south-korea-koreas-tension.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Korea again threatens nuke strikes on US, South Korea", "title": "North Korea again threatens nuke strikes on US, South Korea", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/south-korea-koreas-tension.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Foster Klug", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "There is also considerable outside debate about whether North Korea is even capable of the kind of \u201cstrikes\u201d it threatens.\nSuch threats have been a staple of young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un since he took power after his dictator father\u2019s death in December 2011.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea on Monday issued its latest belligerent threat, warning of an indiscriminate \u201cpre-emptive nuclear strike of justice\u201d on Washington and Seoul, this time in reaction to the start of huge U.S.-South Korean military drills.\nBut they spike especially when Washington and Seoul stage what they call annual defensive springtime war games.\nThe North\u2019s powerful National Defense Commission threatened strikes against targets in the South, U.S. bases in the Pacific and the U.S. mainland, saying its enemies \u201care working with bloodshot eyes to infringe upon the dignity, sovereignty and vital rights\u201d of North Korea."}
