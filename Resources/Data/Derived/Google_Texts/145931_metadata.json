The Inquirer detected the glitch while running dozens of income scenarios through the Obamacare website.\n\nThe error primarily affects households that are just barely above the poverty line in states that have not yet expanded Medicare, the Inquirer reported. It said the website has been automatically raising the cost of health insurance by thousands of dollars, nudging out consumers who simply can\u2019t afford it.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear precisely how many have been affected by the error (though the Inquirer suggested it could be in the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d). Still, the existence of the glitch raises serious questions about whether a large number of consumers have given up trying to enroll in plans because they were told incorrectly that they don\u2019t qualify for aid.\n\nThe fact that the error was spotted just this week raises obvious questions about the stability of the website.\n\n\u201cIt is almost impossible to work back from a decision and see what they did,\u201d Judy Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C., told the Inquirer.\n\nShe added there should be a notice for consumers that says, \u201cWe have found that your income for 2014 will be X, and based on that income your tax credit will be Y.\u201d\n\nHowever, Obamacare determination letters state only the users tax credit and their resulting premium.\n\n\u201cI would have no idea if it\u2019s right or wrong,\u201d Solomon said.\n\nThe report noted that neither Solomon nor local health-policy analysts nor officials had noticed the giant error on the healthcare.gov website. And it appears officials with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were unaware, too.\n\n\u201cThis tool is intended only to be used as an unofficial estimate that consumers could use before completing their application, which is where they get their official determination,\u201d a CMS spokesman said in a statement Thursday. \u201dWhile there is a small difference between the poverty levels from year to year, we will change this tool for clarity. We encourage consumers to complete their marketplace application, where they will get an accurate determination of their tax credits.\u201d\n\nSure, many users probably use the tool before applying. However, as certain analysts outside CMS have wondered, how likely is it that consumers dig deeper for more options after receiving a \u201cnot eligible\u201d notice from the site?\n\n\u201cI wonder if CMS has the capacity to recontact people,\u201d said health specialist Timothy Jost.\n\nClick here to read more.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Thousands of Americans may be misinformed about whether they\u2019re eligible for health insurance subsidies because of a little-known Obamacare website glitch.
