The FDA reported several events associated with the capsules, such as heart palpitations, tachycardia, suicidal thoughts, chest pain, anxiety, and diarrhea. \u201cProducts that contain hidden drugs pose a real danger to consumers,\" Carol Bennett, acting director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in the press release. \u201cThis is especially true when the products have names that mislead consumers into believing they are safe and natural.\u201d\n\nOther products the FDA singled out as being potentially dangerous include: Ultimate Formula, Fat Zero, Bella Vi Amp\u2019d Up, Insane Amp\u2019d Up, Slim Trim U, Infinity, Perfect Body Solution, Asset Extreme, Asset Extreme Plus, Asset Bold, and Asset Bee Pollen.\n\nDespite hype over the potential \u201chealth benefits\u201d of this so-called \u201csuper food,\u201d evidence doesn\u2019t entirely line up with some enthusiasts\u2019 claims that bee pollen assists in nutrition, suppressing appetite, improving athletic performance, and preventing joint pain. Other claims include preventing premature aging, treating mouth sores, hay fever, prostate issues, and radiation sickness. There is no scientific evidence that consuming bee pollen as a dietary supplement actually boosts your performance or helps prevent certain conditions; in fact, bee pollen has been linked to adverse effects such as anaphylaxis.\n\n\"Initially reported in 1979 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the risk of a severe allergic reaction is a real and scary side effect of a supplement that is lacking real clinical evidence to support its uses in traditional medicine,\" Dr. Mike Roussell, a nutritional consultant for athletes and food companies, writes on Shape. \"This unbalanced relationship between the potential cost-benefit and lack of solid clinical evidence for the benefit of bee pollen takes it off my list of potential supplements for my clients to use, in pill form or added to smoothies as a 'boost.'\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bee pollen products, bee pollen weight loss", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Even if bee pollen aids in losing weight or other health aspects, the FDA has announced that many products containing the substance are actually dangerous.", "title": "Bee Pollen Weight Loss Products Are Harmful And \u2018Dangerous Scam,\u2019 FDA Warns", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-warns-bee-pollen-weight-loss-products-may-contain-hidden-and-dangerous-ingredients-289054", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/bee-goods.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even if bee pollen aids in losing weight or other health aspects, the FDA has announced that many products containing the substance are actually dangerous.", "title": "Bee Pollen Weight Loss Products Are Harmful And \u2018Dangerous Scam,\u2019 FDA Warns", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-warns-bee-pollen-weight-loss-products-may-contain-hidden-and-dangerous-ingredients-289054", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/bee-goods.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/19/bee-goods.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-19T16:49:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T16:49:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Even if bee pollen aids in losing weight or other health aspects, the FDA has announced that many products containing the substance are actually dangerous."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen people buy these tainted bee pollen weight loss products, they are unknowingly taking one or more hidden drugs that have been banned from the market,\u201d Coody said in a press release.\nBee pollen is nutritionally diverse, but research has shown it's not necessarily all that it's hyped up to be.\nOne particular bee pollen product was targeted by the FDA this spring: Zi Xiu Tang Bee Pollen capsules were marketed for weight loss and body reshaping, but were found to contain an active pharmaceutical ingredient not listed on the label.\nThere is no scientific evidence that consuming bee pollen as a dietary supplement actually boosts your performance or helps prevent certain conditions; in fact, bee pollen has been linked to adverse effects such as anaphylaxis.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning about weight loss products containing bee pollen, noting that they can actually be harmful and are a \u201cdangerous scam.\u201dThese products may contain \u201chidden\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d ingredients, particularly for people suffering from high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat, and bipolar disorders, according to the FDA\u2019s national health fraud coordinator, Gary Coody."}
