The big names in attendance \u2013 former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers \u2013 spanned both sides of the political aisle. Yet despite their ideological differences on many issues, they were united in pointing to one key factor hindering the U.S. economy\u2019s too-slow recovery from recession: Our political system.\n\nThey also highlighted a few policy compromises that could improve America\u2019s future.\n\nSpeaking at the National Association of Business Economists conference, Greenspan complained, \u201cUntil the political system gets restructured into a form in which we have rational budget policies and rational fiscal policies, I don\u2019t know how we solve this problem.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Keynes Would Handle an Abnormally Slow Recovery\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office during the administration of George W. Bush and a member of George H.W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said that while it has always been difficult to translate good policy into good politics, it is a particular problem now.\n\n\u201cThe core political difference is the ability to sell principled compromise as a good outcome. That\u2019s what\u2019s missing in this era,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always politics, but the politics of this era treats principled compromise as surrender, and that\u2019s been our problem.\u201d\n\nIn the view of many highly respected economists, there are many good ideas worth compromising on right now.\n\nInvesting in Infrastructure\n\nEchoing a call from members of both parties to invest in long-term infrastructure, Summers said, \u201cPublic investments have a very substantial role to play\u201d in economic growth.\n\nRelated: CBO Shoots an Arrow in the Heart of Obamanomics\n\n\u201cA colloquial way to make the point is to ask if anyone is proud of Kennedy Airport,\u201d Summers said, referring to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport. If the answer is no, Summers suggested, \u201cAsk if a moment when the long-term interest rate \u2013 in a currency we print \u2013 is below 3 percent, and the construction unemployment rate approaches double digits, is not the right moment to increase public investment in general and perhaps to repair Kennedy airport in particular.\u201d\n\nAsked what he thought of Summers\u2019 insistence that now is the time to invest in infrastructure, Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf declined to comment directly, but pointed to numerous statements from the CBO over the past year, all of which support short-term increases in the deficit to boost output and employment, with long-term deficit reduction as the eventual target.\n\nThe Easiest Fix\n\nGreenspan took aim at the rising income gap, and blasted Congress for ignoring immigration reform, which he said would actually go a long way toward solving that problem.\n\n\u201cI consider income inequality the most dangerous part of what\u2019s going on in the United States,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cYou can see the deteriorating impact of that on our current political system, and you cannot talk about politics without talking about its impact on the economy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Unemployed and Hoping for Help from Congress\n\nNoting that there are some 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, he sharply criticized the idea, supported by many on the far right, that they should all be deported.\n\n\u201cIf we ever required them to leave the country our economy would fall apart,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cSo I think we are making a mistake in the immigration area, which in many respects could be the easiest thing to solve.\u201d\n\nWhat would really help the economy, he said, would be reform that increases, not decreases immigration \u2013 particularly among high-skilled workers \u2013 a position supported by numerous conservative economists, including Holtz-Eakin.\n\nRelated: Despite Economic Benefits, GOP Hardliners Fight Immigration Reform\n\n\u201cWe cannot manage to staff our very complex, highly sophisticated capital structure with what\u2019s coming out of our high schools,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to educate our kids, bring in other people who want to become Americans. Let them in here and let them use their skills.\u201d\n\nHe said that current restrictions on skilled immigrants are an effective wage subsidy for high-earners, contributing to increased income inequality.\n\nIncreasing competition for higher-wage jobs would eliminate some of the injustice in wages in this country, he said, because \u201cincome inequality is a relative concept.\u201d He added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring up the bottom if you bring the top down.\u201d\n\nEconomists also showed unity on the need for other changes. Summers and Holtz-Eakin \u2013 hardly ideological soul mates \u2013 both supported tax and regulatory reforms designed to boost private investment.\n\nRelated: Just Like That, \u2018The Party of No\u2019 Is Back\n\nThe Republican Holtz-Eakin and his Democratic fellow former-CBO director Alice Rivlin both supported a paid-for extension of federal unemployment insurance benefits and a restructuring of the unemployment assistance program to deliver assistance more effectively.\n\nRivlin and Holtz-Eakin were united in one other belief \u2013 resignation about the difficulty of getting through Congress proposals that economists of all stripes see as useful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at the Council on Economic Advisers twice,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019ll bring in an assistant professor or a newly tenured associate to spend a year at the White House, and they\u2019ll spend the entire year holding their heads saying \u2018I can\u2019t believe this. Why can\u2019t they just forget the politics and do this?\n\n\u201cAnd the answer is that that\u2019s not what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to make good policy good politics, and that\u2019s really hard to do. The success rate is really low. If you bat .100 you go to the Hall of Fame. Economists collectively fail all the time; you just have to get used to that.\u201d\n\nRivlin chimed in with a grim reminder: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t rational. No matter what you learn in Economics 101, people are not rational.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Big-name economists from both sides of the Republican-Democratic divide on Monday expressed frustration with a Congress that fails to take even the most obvious steps to improve the economy.", "title": "These Top Economists All Agree on the Biggest Problem the U.S. Faces", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/25/These-Top-Economists-All-Agree-Biggest-Problem-US-Faces", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02252014_Alan_Greenspan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/25/These-Top-Economists-All-Agree-Biggest-Problem-US-Faces", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02252014_Alan_Greenspan.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Big-name economists from both sides of the Republican-Democratic divide on Monday expressed frustration with a Congress that fails to take even the most obvious steps to improve the economy.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd778\"", "article_summary": "Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said that while it has always been difficult to translate good policy into good politics, it is a particular problem now.\n\u201cYou have to make good policy good politics, and that\u2019s really hard to do.\nEconomists collectively fail all the time; you just have to get used to that.\u201dRivlin chimed in with a grim reminder: \u201cPeople aren\u2019t rational.\nSome of the top economists in the U.S. gathered at a conference in Virginia on Monday.\nSummers and Holtz-Eakin \u2013 hardly ideological soul mates \u2013 both supported tax and regulatory reforms designed to boost private investment."}
