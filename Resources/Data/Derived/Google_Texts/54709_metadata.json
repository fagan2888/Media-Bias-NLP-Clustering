And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\u201d\n\nMarriage equality has arrived with nothing short of stunning speed. We went from two states supporting same-sex marriage at the start of Obama\u2019s tenure to 37 states before this week \u2014 to now making it the law of the land. Less than a generation removed from Clinton-era \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d military policy, a conservative Supreme Court justice just pronounced that the \u201cdignity\u201d of marriage must be extended across gender preferences.\n\nAlso Read: Gay Hollywood: 26 Out and Proud LGBT Stars (Photos)\n\nWhat a shift. This, in the same week that the Supreme Court declined to roll back the tide on Obamacare, preserving medical insurance for more than six million Americans and frustrating the efforts of a Republican-led determination to reverse course.\n\nBecause society had already moved on regarding both issues. Gay couples everywhere have married, raised children and become part of the fabric of their respective communities. Expanded, government-funded health care has settled in and become part of Americans\u2019 everyday realities.\n\nAlso Read: Obamacare Subsidies Upheld by Supreme Court\n\nThe court merely caught up to our new normal, and the Obama era \u2014 in which we elected an African-American president and then watched the right-wing half of the country (also known as Fox News) tie itself into knots dealing with that reality \u2014 will be credited with it. (One is tempted to wonder what timetable might have held sway had Al Gore been handed the presidency in 2000 instead of George Bush. But we resist such temptations.)\n\nIt\u2019s entertaining to observe the mental gymnastics of Republican candidates as they struggle to find words that both support our law-based democracy and a Supreme Court decision they can hardly believe. Right-wingers who have suffered a crushing loss in the culture wars are left gasping for words that make sense:\n\nAlso Read: Don Lemon Searches for Husband After Supreme Court Same-Sex Marriage Ruling: 'Who Wants to Marry Me?'\n\n\u2022 Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol tweeted: \u201cPolygamy, here we come!\u201d\n\n\u2022 Breitbart.com contributor John Nolte tweeted that the SCOTUS decision means the \u201cBig Gay Hate Machine is coming for your church next\u201d\n\n\u2022 On Fox, Martha MacCallum said, \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to think about the ramifications, when a precedent is set, what it means down the road, right? So suppose three people say, we want to be a marriage; we\u2019re three people, and we love each other, and we want to be a marriage. What\u2019s to prevent that, under this?\u201d\n\nHollywood has played an integral role in this change, and the entertainment industry should stand up and claim due credit for driving our popular culture toward a new definition of normalcy. The movie and television industry went from a shameful past of forcing some of its most talented performers to stay in the closet to celebrating the reality of gay people throughout society on television and on the big screen.\n\nAlso Read: Hollywood Blows Up Twitter Over Supreme Court's Same-Sex Marriage\n\nIt\u2019s a moment when Hollywood liberals may want to reconsider their view of Obama. Many who championed him as a first-term candidate lost their enthusiasm about halfway through the President\u2019s first term, voicing their disappointment over the his tepid support of a progressive agenda. But this week will give pause to many, the same week when the Confederate flag is on its way down the flagpole in some Southern states.\n\nJust another unexpected thunderbolt in the long journey toward social justice in America.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obma-waxword-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Sharon Waxman", "description": "The court merely caught up to our new normal, and the Obama era will justifiably get the credit", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "The court merely caught up to our new normal, and the Obama era will justifiably get the credit", "title": "Obama's 'Thunderbolt' Week Seals Liberal Legacy for a Changing Country", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obma-waxword.jpg", "height": 412}, "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/obamas-thunderbolt-week-seals-liberal-legacy-for-a-changing-country/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The court merely caught up to our new normal, and the Obama era will justifiably get the credit", "creator": "@sharonwaxman", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/obamas-thunderbolt-week-seals-liberal-legacy-for-a-changing-country/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obma-waxword-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obma-waxword-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019 Week Seals Liberal Legacy for a Changing Country", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-26T17:02:12+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Obama\u2019s \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019 Week Seals Liberal Legacy for a Changing Country", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "barack obama,al gore,lgbt,same-sex marriage,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Waxword", "tag": "Same-Sex Marriage", "published_time": "2015-06-26T10:02:12+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obama\u2019s \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019 Week Seals Liberal Legacy for a Changing Country\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/obamas-thunderbolt-week-seals-liberal-legacy-for-a-changing-country\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/06\\/obma-waxword-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"498297\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-26T17:02:12Z\",\"section\":\"Waxword\",\"author\":\"Sharon Waxman\",\"tags\":[\"al gore\",\"barack obama\",\"lgbt\",\"obamacare\",\"same-sex marriage\"]}", "sailthru.category": "waxword", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obma-waxword.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc57\"", "article_summary": "Also Read: Gay Hollywood: 26 Out and Proud LGBT Stars (Photos)What a shift.\nWe went from two states supporting same-sex marriage at the start of Obama\u2019s tenure to 37 states before this week \u2014 to now making it the law of the land.\nIt\u2019s entertaining to observe the mental gymnastics of Republican candidates as they struggle to find words that both support our law-based democracy and a Supreme Court decision they can hardly believe.\nLess than a generation removed from Clinton-era \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d military policy, a conservative Supreme Court justice just pronounced that the \u201cdignity\u201d of marriage must be extended across gender preferences.\nBut this week will give pause to many, the same week when the Confederate flag is on its way down the flagpole in some Southern states."}
