I am loving it,\u201d Mr. Paisley said by phone from Los Angeles the day after a recent broadcast. \u201c[The judges] went back to Ludacris\u2019 house and were talking about the show and our roles. We are figuring it out. And the friendships are real.\u201d\n\nWhen the show premiered June 22, critics rolled their eyes and pointed to its lackluster ratings as evidence that another singing competition \u2014 even one that is broadcast live and relies on viewers voting via apps \u2014 would not entice viewers.\n\nThe critics were wrong. The show recently gained 7 percent in total viewers (4.8 million vs. 4.5 million) and 17 percent among the all-important 18- to 49-year-old viewers, according to Nielsen figures reported by The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cRising Star\u201c\u2018s executive producers Ken Warwick (\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d) and Nicolle Yaron (\u201cThe Voice\u201d) said they hope the show triggers new excitement over traditional TV and bridges the gap between it and technology. To effect that change, the two approached the show as a chance to move beyond reality shows as tabloid fodder and into a modern, technologically exciting competition.\n\n\u201cComing from our backgrounds, I think we both thought \u2018That is just what America needs, another reality show,\u201d Mr. Warwick said during a conference call with Ms. Yaron from Los Angeles of their initial response to the show\u2019s creators. \u201cBut what caught my interest was the technology. That is quite fascinating and challenging because you never know if it is going to work or not.\n\n\u201cAs we navigate through the series, we learn how to refine it. And you become involved with the contestants,\u201d he said. \u201cLike when Sarah Darling went home. She has a very, very good voice, and it kind of gets you to see her sent home.\u201d\n\nMr. Paisley to the rescue. He immediately extended an invitation to Ms. Darling, who lost the July 13 competition by a fraction of a percentage point, to join him in a performance at the Grand Ole Opry and made good on that promise Saturday.\n\n\u201cWelcome home \u2014 back to the place you belong, Nashville, Tennessee,\u201d Mr. Paisley said to Ms. Darling, who joined him in a rendition of his \u201cWhiskey Lullaby.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just the type of engagement Mr. Warwick and Ms. Yaron hoped to find when they developed the show.\n\n\u201cWe wanted people who liked what they were doing, liked the contestants, and became emotionally attached to the talent in front of them, for whatever it is worth,\u201d Ms. Yaron said. \u201cThe [judges] genuinely are absolutely desperate to get involved in mentoring, not to become experts who criticize the performers every week. It\u2019s a passion for them and you feel it. And Josh Groban, we\u2019ve never had a host that was so deeply involved, essential, and knowledgeable.\u201d\n\nNot to mention empathetic. Mr. Paisley marveled at the contestant\u2019s courage when faced with mentoring and judging.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they do it. I sang on the show and I was nervous,\u201d he said, recalling his performance of \u201cRiver Bank,\u201d the lead single from his upcoming album. \u201cI thought, \u2018I had better freaking nail thing because I am sitting here telling people they are pitchy and stuff! I had better nail it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Paisley\u2019s 10th album, \u201cMoonshine in the Trunk,\u201d is to be released Aug. 26.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Country musician Brad Paisley is working his magic on ABC's reality competition show \"Rising Star,\" which airs Sundays at 9 p.m.", "Author": "Nancy Dunham \u2014 SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Country musician Brad Paisley is working his magic on ABC\u2019s reality competition show \u201cRising Star,\u201d which airs Sundays at 9 p.m.", "title": "Brad Paisley helps \u2018Rising Star\u2019 shine in the ratings", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/20/brad-paisley-helps-rising-star-shine-in-the-rating/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/20/7_202014_brad-paisley8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/20/7_202014_brad-paisley8201.jpg", "title": "Brad Paisley helps \u2018Rising Star\u2019 shine in the ratings", "description": "Country musician Brad Paisley is working his magic on ABC's reality competition show \"Rising Star,\" which airs Sundays at 9 p.m.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Brad Paisley, Josh Groban, Ken Warwick"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd741d\"", "article_summary": "I am loving it,\u201d Mr. Paisley said by phone from Los Angeles the day after a recent broadcast.\n\u201cWelcome home \u2014 back to the place you belong, Nashville, Tennessee,\u201d Mr. Paisley said to Ms.\nMr. Paisley marveled at the contestant\u2019s courage when faced with mentoring and judging.\nDarling, who joined him in a rendition of his \u201cWhiskey Lullaby.\u201dThat\u2019s just the type of engagement Mr. Warwick and Ms. Yaron hoped to find when they developed the show.\nShe has a very, very good voice, and it kind of gets you to see her sent home.\u201dMr. Paisley to the rescue."}
