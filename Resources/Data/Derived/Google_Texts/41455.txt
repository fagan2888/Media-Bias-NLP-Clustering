Repeatedly stonewalled by the Obama Administration on questions of abortion transparency in the Affordable Care Act, pro-life leaders are taking matters into their own hands to inform consumers which Obamacare plans include coverage of abortion on demand and which do not.

Since “open season” began on Saturday, research staff at Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) and Family Research Council (FRC) have been performing an ongoing examination of healthcare.gov and state-based exchanges, looking for information on abortion coverage and the accessibility of that information. On Thursday afternoon, pro-life leaders, including researchers from CLI and FRC, will join Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ), lead sponsor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, to share their findings to date.

Thursday’s press conference and the launch of the website follow the release of a newly surfaced video in which key Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber called the “lack of transparency” with which the law was passed a “huge political advantage.” The new web site, ObamacareAbortion.com, will go live on Thursday.

Since October of 2013, the Charlotte Lozier Institute has reported on the lack of transparency and generally confusing nature of the exchange plans. This summer, the non-partisan government watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), released a report identifying 1,036 ObamaCare plans that cover abortion on demand and receive taxpayer subsidies.
