Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn, raised over $900,000 for his re-election bid in the second quarter, his campaign said Wednesday. He also launched a new ad featuring the senator arguing with President Barack Obama.\n\nAlexander now has $3.4 million cash on hand, according to his campaign, with just over a month to go until Tennessee's Aug. 8 Republican primary.\n\nThe new ad shows C-SPAN footage of the White House Healthcare Summit in February of 2010. Alexander was one of several Republicans to attend the bipartisan meeting, and at one point, he engaged with Obama over whether healthcare premiums would rise as a result of Obamacare.\n\n\"When you said, 'premiums go up,' that's just not case,\" Obama says in the clip, addressing Alexander.\n\n\"The Congressional Budget Office report says that premiums will rise,\" Alexander responds.\n\n\"No, no, no, no, and this is an example of where we've got to get our facts straight,\" Obama says.\n\n\"That's my point,\" says Alexander.\n\n\"Lamar was proven right,\" a narrator says in the ad.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=SEfIL9RsJ7Y\n\nThe ad will begin running statewide on July 6, according to the campaign.\n\nAlexander faces a primary challenge from state Rep. Joe Carr. Carr has drawn significantly more attention in recent weeks since House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., was defeated in a primary by unknown and underfunded college professor Dave Brat. He recently went up with his first ad of the campaign, attacking Alexander for voting for the Senate's immigration overhaul bill.\n\nThe race is rated Safe Republican by the Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
