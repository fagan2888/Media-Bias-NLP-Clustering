Wah, MD\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Medical Association\n\nMr. Speaker. Members of the Board. Delegates and friends, colleagues and guests \u2013 and our international visitors: I'm honored to speak with you as I complete my term as your president. About what we've achieved, where we progressed, and what yet needs to be done.\n\nThrough AMA's work and your leadership:\n\nWe're reimagining medical education. Easing chronic disease. And ensuring physicians can still put patients first amid disruptive change.\n\nInnovative care models are enhancing quality and reducing costs.\n\nMillions of previously uninsured Americans are going online to compare prices and buy coverage.\n\nWe're fighting to make digital health a useful clinical tool instead of an exercise in meeting regulations.\n\nAnd we're moving ahead with innovation in new and exciting ways.\n\nThese reasons and more may be why our membership is up four years in a row. I like how this movie is going.\n\nIn my talks with this House, I've drawn metaphors from the movies to describe our challenges and progress.\n\nThis is my third speech. Last June, I talked about a simple country doctor on a 23rd century starship. In November, I shared how I became \"O.B. Wah Kenobi,\" the intern in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nMany of you offered suggestions on how to complete the trilogy. Bewildered by a maze of regulations? \"The Matrix.\" A noble quest? \"Lord of the Rings.\" Our relentless pursuit of regulatory victories? \"The Terminator.\"\n\nI decided I like the future \u2013 it brings out the optimist in me. So come with me\u2026Back to the Future!\n\nThere's been lots of internet traffic lately about the vision of 2015 found in the 1989 sequel to the hit movie \"Back to the Future.\" We see an imagined version of our present day from the vantage point of the past. It hints at what's to come \u2013 and what's already here. Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!\n\nIn \"Back to the Future 2,\" Marty McFly, assisted by mad scientist Doc Brown, travels decades into the future to save his son from some serious trouble.\n\nWe arrive with them in a 2015 that looks almost familiar, despite the traffic jams of flying cars. It promises hoverboards. They're actually being developed today by a company using magnetic repulsion. I want one. Of course in the real 2015, people ask me if I have to check my Blackberry out of the museum every morning.\n\nThe movie predicted smart phones, flat-screen TVs, and digital glasses, all now a reality. And of interest to many in this room, in the movie, the Chicago Cubs are World Series champions for the first time since 1908. It is, remember, a science fiction fantasy.\n\nIn Back to the Future's 2015, devices are voice-activated. Like Siri. And, you can pay for everything with a thumbprint.\n\nIn the film, interactive video conversations are commonplace, as is widespread use of tablets. All true today, more or less.\n\nIn looking at what \"Back to the Future 2\" got right and got wrong about 2015, its biggest blunder might be the widespread use of fax machines. In one scene, Marty and Doc pass a Post Office mailbox that includes a computer terminal that says \"Fax here.\"\n\nThis gets a laugh \u2013 unless you work in a practice that's still faxing paper records back and forth because their electronic records can't interact \u2013 can't interoperate \u2013 with outside systems.\n\nRegulatory Relief/MU/EHR:\n\nWhile AMA and the broader physician community strongly support the use of technology and innovation to improve the health of our patients, the \"Meaningful Use\" requirements for electronic records are a heavy burden and a prison for innovation. For a better future, EHRs need to be inter-operable, encourage physician-patient interaction, streamline workload and payment and promote team care and coordination.\n\nWe've made progress. We asked the federal government to cut the reporting period from a year to 90 days. They did it. One troubling performance measure, the patient view-download-and transmit requirement, will be eased significantly \u2013 for now.\n\nIt's a start, but I've said it before: Harness technology to improve care \u2013 don't let it harness us. The same goes for those who write regulations. Learn from mistakes and act accordingly. If something isn't working \u2013 fix it.\n\nShaping Regulation to Work for Patients and Physicians\n\nAnd if you know something won't work \u2013 don't do it. One example is our efforts to shut down the Independent Payment Advisory Board \u2013 IPAB. An appointed body of alleged \"experts\" charged with recommending Medicare provider payment cuts whenever spending exceeds preset targets. Sounds like the SGR on steroids. A visit back to the future we'd like to avoid.\n\nThat's why the AMA has criticized IPAB ever since it was created by Congress. That's why we want to end IPAB's future \u2013 before it happens. The AMA and more than 500 organizations called on Congress to repeal the IPAB and we rallied bipartisan support in Congress to get it done.\n\nThe current Senate bill already has 40 co-sponsors, the House bill 232, including 20 Democrats \u2013 well on the way to pass in a bipartisan way. And good news - the House Ways & Means Committee approved the bill this week.\n\nICD-10\n\nWe face another challenge \u2013 sort of like Biff the bully. The transition to ICD-10 codes. It's going to take more than fancy skateboarding to deal with this.\n\nWe believe ICD-10 will further disrupt physician practices when we're already facing headaches like Meaningful Use. Nonetheless, Congress and the Administration seems intent on implementing them October 1st.\n\nThe AMA and 99 state and specialty societies have urged CMS to put safeguards in place.\n\nEnd-to-end testing showed claims acceptance rates would fall from 97 percent to 81 percent if ICD-10 was implemented today. That's 20 percent failure. And this was among the doctors who volunteered \u2013 the ones at the front of the classroom, waving their hands to volunteer!\n\nHHS contends ICD-10 isn't to blame \u2013 but this may be the \"best case scenario!\" If Medicare rejects nearly one in five of the millions of claims in the system each day, we'd see a catastrophic disruption to physician practices.\n\nWe'll continue to press for more comprehensive testing, a grace period to reduce potential claims denials, hardship exemptions and advanced payment authority to head off cash flow problems.\n\nWe've been able to focus even more on these issues because of what the AMA \u2013 what all of us \u2013 accomplished this spring. Like the plot of a good movie, I've been building up to this.\n\nEliminating the SGR\n\nAnd that's the epic improvement to Medicare by eliminating the SGR\u2013 Led by the American Medical Association. Led by physicians. Led by \u2026 you.\n\nMost of this century we've worked to rid ourselves of the flawed sustainable growth rate \u2013 and its fickle, capricious hold over Medicare payments. We all know how the SGR's threats of deep cuts created instability in our practices \u2013 and sowed uncertainty about access among our Medicare and TRICARE patients.\n\nLast year, the message got traction. This year it broke through. On April 14th, the Senate followed the lead of the U.S. House and repealed the SGR!\n\nI was in Norway for the World Medical Association, and watched it unfold at 4 a.m. local time on C-SPAN. A friend of mine, a big fan of military jargon, immediately sent me an email with the subject line: \"On your watch!\" Well, I'm proud to say the elimination of the SGR happened on our watch!\n\nWhen the president signed it into law, a cheer went up throughout the land. Organized medicine won a big victory. The Senate passed it 92 to 8. Before that, it was approved by 392 members of the House. That's what's known in Washington as overwhelming, bipartisan, bicameral support \u2013 not seen much these days.\n\nWorking together, we finally ended an era of uncertainty for Medicare patients and their physicians \u2013 and opened new avenues to provide better care at a lower cost. It wasn't a \"doc fix.\" As I wrote in an article for Forbes, it was Medicare that needed fixing - not doctors!\n\nHow we did it \u2013 together\n\nMore than 700 state and specialty medical associations and other partners rallied with the AMA banner. In the month before the vote, physicians made more than 60,000 calls and fired off nearly a quarter-million emails to their elected officials.\n\nWe lit up social media \u2013 and set it ablaze. Our action alerts on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter reached more than 3.5 million online users.\n\nThere were questions and doubts. Serious ones. About whether this effort would get off the ground. Members of Congress told us it would just be patched again for 6 months to a year.\n\nA lot of moving parts had to act together at just the right time \u2013 and in just the right way. Think of Congress as the \"flux capacitor.\" They were \"fluxing.\"\n\nWe revved up the DeLorean to 88 miles per hour \u2013 punched in the coordinates \u2013 and fueled it with the 1.21 gigawatts of energy put forth by the AMA and America's physicians in a lightning bolt striking at just the right time. We burned rubber and we smashed through the barriers to success.\n\nOther provisions in the new law\n\nThere are other things for us to cheer in the new law.\n\nAnnual payment increases through 2019.\n\nStreamlined quality reporting programs.\n\nPhysicians who privately contract with Medicare patients won't have to \"opt out\" every two years\u2014once you're out, you're out \u2013 until you say you're in.\n\nMedical liability lawyers can't use Medicare quality program standards and measures in lawsuits.\n\nAnd we stopped the CMS proposal to eliminate the 10- and 90-day global surgical services bundles.\n\nIncentives to use alternative models or the new fee-for-service program. Participation is entirely voluntary.\n\nAnd did I mention annual payment increases through 2019?\n\nSo \u2013 many, many thanks to all of you who participated in this overwhelming \u2013 and overwhelmingly successful grassroots campaign. Medicine's united voice was loud, it was heard, and it was persuasive. Now it calls out for continued physician leadership as change goes forward.\n\nWe're already working to shape how this law is implemented to protect physician and patient interests. And America's physicians and the AMA are also sharpening our focus and energy toward improving this nation's health, while enhancing the patient-physician partnership.\n\nSo I hope you'll understand my wish, one last time, to do a victory lap. Maybe just once around the ballroom. Is there a DeLorean in the House? \u2026 a Hoverboard, maybe?\n\nRX: Putting Physicians in Positive Light\n\nI've mentioned \"Back to the Future 2\" and its predictions, from 1989, of what 2015 might look like. This year \u2013 2015 \u2013 also saw the release of a movie that reveals some of the new realities of our health care system. In specifics or in spirit \u2013 it reflects much of the AMA's strategic work.\n\nThe PBS documentary \"Rx: The Quiet Revolution,\" sponsored by the AMA, looked for challenges and opportunities in our health care system. It found doctors, nurses and others at work in teams to lower costs, improve outcomes and enhance quality. A transformation of the way America delivers \u2013 and receives \u2013 medical care.\n\nIts stories align with our mission to promote health, prevent sickness and help people live longer, more productive lives.\n\nFor instance, in one scene, a diabetic woman in rural Mississippi tests her blood sugar and enters the number on a tablet. Its software sends it to her care team in Jackson. The number's been high lately. The nurse calls the patient and offers to help to lower her blood sugar.\n\nAnd, most hopeful of all, this patient is getting consistently better results. She's lost weight. And sharing her experience with family, her friends and her community. Like her care team, she's invested.\n\nPrevent Diabetes STAT\n\nThis type of interaction among patients and the physician-care team is crucial to AMA efforts to improve outcomes \u2013 and prevent Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nOur work is getting results, most recently with our new partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Prevent Diabetes STAT: Screen, Test, Act\u2014Today\u2122.\n\nIt helps physicians tap prevention programs in their communities or online \u2013 and drew from our pilot with 11 practice sites in four states in Delaware, Florida, Indiana and Minnesota.\n\nIn the 2015 of Back to the Future, Doc got a new spleen and a rebuilt colon at a rejuvenation clinic. We're addressing a reality today where our efforts can prevent deadly outcomes from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. And that means a better, healthier future.\n\nChange in medical education\n\nWe know as well that tomorrow's physicians need to be better equipped to confront that future. That informs our Accelerating Change in Medical Education consortium of 11 medical schools. These projects will help transform med-ed \u2013 largely unchanged since the Flexner Report a century ago.\n\nWe're investigating new core science to give them skills to navigate an ever more complex health care system and to harness new technology to improve patient care. Designing the medical school of the future is not the stuff of science fiction, but becoming fact, thanks to the AMA and our partners.\n\nThe \"Rx\" documentary and our other strategic work with partners across the country is showing Americans what we already know: High-quality, affordable care is our priority \u2013 now and in the decades to come. When our stories are shared, our work is advanced \u2013 and our patients win.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm proud of the exciting work in innovation we're doing at the AMA. For instance, we're developing initiatives to address technology challenges and opportunities facing physicians \u2013 like our partnership with the high-tech incubator \u2013 Matter.\n\nThis health IT hub brings doctors to the technology table \u2013 and gives them the tools to apply it today for a better future.\n\nImagine if Nathan Davis, riding in a DeLorean, arrived here in Chicago this week. I think he'd be overwhelmed by the changes in medicine and the advances we've made \u2013 but I think he'd also be pleased and reassured that our mission and goals at the AMA remain true to the course set back in 1847.\n\nWe've worked \"for the betterment of public health\" in everything from medical ethics, education, vaccinations, treating epidemics and attacking tobacco. Now, AMA and America's physicians are leading the way toward a new era of better health \u2013 and a better health care system.\n\nThoughts about the future can be clouded by our daily challenges in the here and now. But meeting those challenges today means a better tomorrow. Each victory takes us back to the future \u2013 one with an ever-strengthening bond between physician and patient. Our work to achieve this may never end, but our results will be real, and lasting. The reward: Healthier patients and a healthier world.\n\nThe challenge of change swirls all around us \u2013 we need to see it as an opportunity to maximize those opportunities. It will take hard work \u2013 imagination \u2013 and creativity. I look forward to joining you \u2013 working with you \u2013 and I'll see you in the future!\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Robert M.
