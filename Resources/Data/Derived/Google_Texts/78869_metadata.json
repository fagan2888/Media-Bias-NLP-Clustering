The number of involuntary part-time workers \u2014 those who are working part-time, but wish they had a full-time job \u2014 decreased by about 200,000 people.\n\nThat made our \u201cSolman Scale U7\u201d \u2014 a more inclusive alternative to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 official unemployment rate \u2014 drop to 14.23 percent, exactly the same as it was in June. (A quick review of how we calculate the U7: We add the number of unemployed people, plus all the people who say they want a job, plus the involuntary part-timers and divide that numerator by the total of all the people who say they want a job, plus the civilian labor force).\n\nPart-timers have long been a focus of ours, especially since their ranks swelled in June. As we reported in our Labor Day broadcast segment, the number of involuntary part-time workers in America has increased by more than 50 percent since 2007. August\u2019s decrease in part-timers would seem to offset their ballooning June numbers.\n\nBut the headline numbers in Friday\u2019s report are unimpressive: the economy added only 142,000 jobs, the lowest this year, and far below the expected 230,000. \u201cGrowth slips,\u201d \u201chiring slows,\u201d heralded the New York Times and Washington Post, respectively.\n\nEven the BLS press release noted the departure in nonfarm payrolls from \u201can average monthly gain of 212,000 over the prior 12 months.\u201d Payrolls for June and July were also revised downward by a total of 28,000.\n\nOf course, as we\u2019ve long pointed out on this page, one month\u2019s data is not a reliable predictor of the job market, and the margin of error for the number of jobs added is plus or minus about 90,000 jobs. As the Brookings Institutions\u2019 Justin Wolfers reminds us on Twitter this morning, there\u2019s a lot that could still change.\n\nHere's the good news from today's jobs report: 1. These are noisy estimates 2. They'll probably be revised 3. It could have been worse. \u2014 Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) September 5, 2014\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked down from 6.2 to 6.1 percent. Well, lower unemployment \u2014 that\u2019s good news, right? Not always. In this case, it decreased because there were 268,000 more people not in the labor force. That means they\u2019re not working and they\u2019re not even looking for a job. The labor force participation rate slid back a tenth of a percentage point to where it had been earlier this year at 62.8 percent.\n\nSo in August, as was the case in much of 2013, the unemployment rate fell because people dropped out of the workforce.\n\nThe bigger question is, who are these people departing the workforce? There\u2019s a good argument to be made, as Paul Solman has hypothesized on this page many times before, that many of them are baby boomers hitting retirement age and deciding to call it quits. That would explain why the workforce decreased even when the civilian population increased, as it does most months, by about 200,000. Here\u2019s how Paul explained it last summer, when first floating the idea:\n\n\u201cTen thousand baby boomers turn 65 today\u201d has become a demographic clich\u00e9 (or meme, if you prefer). Barring a mass and age-selective plague, that means that 10,000 or so are also turning 66, their official Social Security retirement age. Many, if not most, baby boomers are retiring. And since 10,000 a day equals 300,000 a month, if two-thirds of them are hanging up their rock \u2018n\u2019 roll work shoes, Friday\u2019s numbers would make sense: 200,000 or so retirees offsetting the 200,000 or so new working-age Americans.\n\nThe more ominous story line, however, is, that some of these people dropping out of the workforce aren\u2019t ready to retire \u2014 they still need work; they just can\u2019t get it. In fact, baby boomers retiring, Georgetown professor Harry Holzer says, is only half of the explanation. The other half, he says, are nearly 4 million people below retirement age.\n\nSince the population is also rising among that demographic, Holzer says, \u201cyou would expect that labor force activity among those people would go up, just like their population\u2019s going up.\u201d But it\u2019s not, and that\u2019s where the really worry lies for the economy. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what their future plans are and why so many of them are leaving,\u201d says Holzer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economy added a fewer than expected 142,000 jobs last month -- the lowest monthly gain of the year.
