Yes, 51 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted in 2008 when Barack Obama made history. However, that fell to 45 percent in 2012, and then to 21 percent in 2014, according to the U.S. census.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nThe response to my text messages matches that. So I wincingly have to give some credence to Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s recent jab that she sees \u201ca complacency among this generation of young women.\u201d\n\nWhat Schultz really means is, we aren\u2019t coming out strongly for Hillary Clinton, whom we \u201cshould\u201d support because, you know, we share a gender and are historically a Democratic-leaning demographic.\n\nIn our defense, this supposed sweeping apathy isn\u2019t just limited to young women. Or millennials in general, for that matter. In the most recent midterm elections, overall voter turnout plummeted to a 72-year low, and New York ranked 49th in voter participation, according to a report by the Nonprofit Vote group.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nThe stats make it easy for leaders like Wasserman Schultz to paint our generation as complacent. But complacency is not the picture I see.\n\nI see young teachers who care deeply about the future of education and have creative policy ideas. I see young doctors and nurses who can spend hours talking about how broken the health care system is and how to fix it. I see young lawyers and police officers committed to criminal justice reform and keeping us safe.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t we voting if we\u2019re so passionate about political issues? I blame our broken two-party system. It\u2019s so static and such a turnoff \u2014 nothing changes, and when it does, it often becomes a hard-to-follow soap opera. Obamacare. Fiscal cliff. Sequester. Planned Parenthood defunding.\n\nThis disillusionment in party politics is why half of millennials describe themselves as political independents, which the Pew Research Center says is near the highest levels of political and religious disaffiliation recorded for any generation since it has been polling on these topics. Only 26 percent of millennials reported that politics and government are a \u201ctop three\u201d interest, versus 45 percent of baby boomers.\n\nThis has big implications for a system that makes us squeeze ourselves into a \u201cDemocrat\u201d or \u201cRepublican\u201d box, when our views sometimes put us in both.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are next week and, sure, the debate antics of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders\u2019 $1 donation momentum, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic primary endorsement from Planned Parenthood all caught the attention of millennials. But I\u2019m not sure whether this means we are any more interested in 2016 politics. Will we actually go vote, or is all this just something to tweet in the moment?\n\nI hope it\u2019s the former, and that this will be the year my generation goes to the polls to vote for candidates who will champion the issues we care deeply about. Fingers crossed.\n\nI\u2019ll let you know how my text message goes this November.\n\nAmanda Fiscina is a Web producer for Newsday Opinion.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 08:23:00 -0500", "sailthru.author": "Amanda Fiscina", "description": "This is the reality: Millennials vote in disappointing numbers.", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.5930989.1441142470!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "This is the reality: Millennials vote in disappointing numbers.", "title": "Fiscina: Millennial votes are up for grabs", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/amanda-fiscina/millennial-votes-are-up-for-grabs-in-2016-1.11354444", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.5930989.1441142470!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is the reality: Millennials vote in disappointing numbers.", "title": "Fiscina: Millennial votes are up for grabs", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.5930989.1441142470!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "sailthru.title": "Fiscina: Millennial votes are up for grabs", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "millennials, voting", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "millennials, voting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd328a\"", "article_summary": "Other years I say: \u201cPlease just do it for me.\u201dThis is the reality: Millennials vote in disappointing numbers.\nI see young doctors and nurses who can spend hours talking about how broken the health care system is and how to fix it.\nAmanda Fiscina Amanda Fiscina is a web producer for Newsday.\nBut I\u2019m not sure whether this means we are any more interested in 2016 politics.\nOnly 26 percent of millennials reported that politics and government are a \u201ctop three\u201d interest, versus 45 percent of baby boomers."}
