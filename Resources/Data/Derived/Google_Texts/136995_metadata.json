Since I\u2019m a fiscal policy economist, I\u2019m tempted to say that bad tax policy is the fastest way of causing damage. And France might be my top example .But other forms of government intervention also can have a poisonous effect. Regulation, for instance, imposes an enormous burden on our economy\n\nToday, though, we\u2019re going to look at how subsidies can result in costly distortions. More specifically, using examples from the health sector and higher-ed sectors, we\u2019re going to see how \u201cthird-party payer\u201d is a very expensive form of intervention.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the example from the healthcare sector. Writing for the Institute for Policy Innovation, Merrill Matthews has a must-read article about an unintended consequences of Obamacare.\n\nHe starts with a very sensible point about the effect of third-party payer.\n\nHealth care actuaries will tell you that when people have to spend more out of pocket for health care, they tend to spend less. And when a third party\u2014employers, health insurers or the government\u2014insulates consumers from the cost of care they tend to spend more. Just imagine how much more people would spend on cars if they could have any car they wanted for a $20 copay.\n\nThe car-buying example is great. I\u2019ve previously tried to make the same point about third-party payer by using the examples of home insurance and car insurance, but I may have to steal Merrill\u2019s argument since it\u2019s so intuitively effective.\n\nBut that\u2019s a digression. Merrill has a far more important point about what\u2019s actually happening today in the health care sector.\n\n\u2026out-of-pocket spending on health care has declined for decades\u2014until the Affordable Care Act kicked in. In 1961, Americans forked over 43 cents out of their own pocket for every dollar spent on health care. That out-of-pocket spending steadily declined over the years so that by 2010 consumers were only spending about 12 cents out of pocket. \u2026Enter Obamacare in 2010. By 2012 out-of-pocket spending had risen to 14.8 percent of total health care spending, and by 2013 it was up to 15.2 percent, according to the Health Care Cost Institute. With people spending more out of pocket, they will naturally curb their spending. And expect to be spending more out of pocket in the future. That\u2019s in part because so many Americans have had to shift to very high deductible policies in order to afford Obamacare\u2019s very expensive coverage. Thank you, President Obama! \u2026The upshot of these higher deductibles is that people will spend less on health care, and that is helping to slow the growth in health care spending\u2014giving Obama his boasting point. Rising deductibles aren\u2019t the only factor, but they are an important one.\n\nYet Obama doesn\u2019t really deserve to boast.\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s the irony: Obama never intended any of this. He thought Obamacare would reduce out-of-pocket spending. And he and most Democrats have railed against high-deductible policies for years, claiming that greedy health insurers were taking people\u2019s money but didn\u2019t have to pay any claims (because of the high deductibles). And yet under Obamacare deductibles have never been so high. The fact is that moving to higher deductibles, especially when accompanied by a tax-free health care spending account for smaller and routine expenditures, is good policy.\n\n\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that Obama\u2019s \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on employer-provided health insurance also is good policy (though it was implemented the wrong way).\n\nSo maybe, as that policy also takes effect, we\u2019ll get even further reductions over time in third-party payer!\n\nWhich might cause me adjust my overall assessment of Obamacare. In the past, I\u2019ve said it was awful policy because it expanded the Medicaid entitlement while also mucking up the private insurance market.\n\nAll that\u2019s still true, but we\u2019re getting some unintended consequences that are positive. Not only are some states refusing to expand Medicaid, but Merrill\u2019s big point is that the private insurance market is evolving in ways that have some good effects.\n\nSo maybe instead of ObamaCare shifting us from a 68-percent-government-controlled healthcare system to one where government has 79-percent control, as I speculated back in 2013, maybe we\u2019ll wind up with a system that\u2019s \u201conly\u201d 73-percent dictated by government.\n\nNot a victory, to be sure, but at least we\u2019re going in the wrong direction at a slower pace.\n\nNow let\u2019s shift to the higher-ed sector.\n\nPaul Campos, a law professor at the University of Colorado, writes in The Atlantic about the surging level of subsidies for higher education.\n\n\u2026when considering government support for American higher education as a whole, subsidies for colleges and universities are\u2014even on a per-student basis and despite the enrollment explosion\u2014greater than ever before. In particular, per-capita government subsidies are far higher now than they were 35 years ago, when tuition was drastically lower. \u2026The federal government is currently spending approximately $80 billion per year on subsidies for higher education\u2014a figure that almost exactly matches the combined higher-ed spending of the 50 legislatures. \u2026The Pell grant program has expanded rapidly, more than tripling in size since 2000. \u2026What\u2019s far less known\u2026is the remarkable extent to which the federal tax code has been amended in ways that benefit colleges and universities. According to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s most recent estimates of federal tax expenditures, the IRS is currently redistributing approximately $45.7 billion annually in tax revenue in ways that directly and indirectly support American higher education. (This represents a 675 percent increase in such spending since 1990.)\n\nEven though I agree with his analysis, I get agitated when tax preferences are referred to as \u201cspending.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not particularly relevant today. What matters is that there\u2019s been an unbroken increase in handouts and subsidies for the higher-ed sector over the past few decades.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart from his article.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the policy implications. Mr. Campos outlines a series of problems in the higher-education sector.\n\n\u2026total per-student government support for higher education has increased. Yet this increase has failed to stop or even slow massive tuition increases at both public and private schools. \u2026many higher-ed institutions have become increasingly bloated and inefficient\u2014even as they\u2019ve relied on a growing population of poorly paid contingent faculty members and on hundreds of billions of dollars of federal student loans, only a small percentage of which are currently being repaid in a timely manner. \u2026roughly half of recent college graduates in the U.S. find themselves either unemployed or seriously underemployed. And many graduates struggle to pay educational debts that, unlike almost all other debts in American society, typically can\u2019t be settled via bankruptcy.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t really connect the dots, other than to point out that it is absurdly dishonest when some people (like Senator Bernie Sanders) want others to believe that we need even more intervention and more handouts to compensate for non-existent budget cuts.\n\nClaiming that skyrocketing tuition has been caused by \u201ccuts\u201d in government subsidies only helps delay American higher education\u2019s inevitable day of fiscal reckoning.\n\nIf he did connect the dots, he would have explained that the higher-ed sector is needlessly expensive and pointlessly inefficient because of all the subsidies from government.\n\nHe may even agree with that assessment, though he isn\u2019t explicit about the connection. Though Professor Richard Vedder doesn\u2019t hesitate in pointing out that bad government policy deserves the blame.\n\nAnd if you want to learn more, here\u2019s a great video from Learn Liberty explaining why subsidies have translated into higher tuition.\n\nLast but not least, here\u2019s my two cents on the issue, including my dour prediction that the higher-ed bubble won\u2019t pop until and unless we stop the handouts from government.\n\nYet another reason why we should dismantle the Department of Education.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "breaking news, headlines, politics, polls, elections, election predictions, economy, world news, top stories, pundit, peoples pundit", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Dan Mitchell uses examples from the healthcare and higher-ed sectors to demonstrate how the third-party payer is a very expensive form of intervention.", "title": "Government-Subsidized Third-Party Payer is a Great Recipe to Make a Sector of the Economy More Expensive, Less Efficient", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/healthcare-capitol-hill-e1432480315557.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-24T11:42:14-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2015/05/24/government-subsidized-third-party-payer-is-a-great-recipe-to-make-a-sector-of-the-economy-more-expensive-and-less-efficient/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dan Mitchell uses examples from the healthcare and higher-ed sectors to demonstrate how the third-party payer is a very expensive form of intervention.", "creator": "@danieljmitchell", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/healthcare-capitol-hill-e1432480315557.jpg", "title": "Government-Subsidized Third-Party Payer is a Great Recipe to Make a Sector of the Economy More Expensive, Less Efficient | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2015/05/24/government-subsidized-third-party-payer-is-a-great-recipe-to-make-a-sector-of-the-economy-more-expensive-and-less-efficient/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/25517", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/25517", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "article": {"section": "Policy", "tag": "regulations", "published_time": "2015-05-24T11:16:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-24T11:42:14-04:00"}, "description": "Dan Mitchell uses examples from the healthcare and higher-ed sectors to demonstrate how the third-party payer is a very expensive form of intervention."}, "article_summary": "Health care actuaries will tell you that when people have to spend more out of pocket for health care, they tend to spend less.\nBy 2012 out-of-pocket spending had risen to 14.8 percent of total health care spending, and by 2013 it was up to 15.2 percent, according to the Health Care Cost Institute.\nSince I\u2019m a fiscal policy economist, I\u2019m tempted to say that bad tax policy is the fastest way of causing damage.\nIn 1961, Americans forked over 43 cents out of their own pocket for every dollar spent on health care.\nMerrill has a far more important point about what\u2019s actually happening today in the health care sector."}
