Will Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), who narrowly defeated former Congressman Joe Sestak (D-PA) in the 2010 election, cruise to a second term? Sestak\u2019s announcement to seek a rematch with Toomey next year was greeted with a lukewarm reception from Pennsylvania Democrats. Many Democrats think Sestak can\u2019t win statewide. And they\u2019re still mad that he did not heed calls from state and national Democrats, along with the leader of his party\u2013President Obama\u2013to not challenge the late Sen. Arlen Specter in a primary. Specter had just switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. Sestak would go on to defeat Specter in that race.\n\nWell, the ending wasn\u2019t what Democrats wanted in 2010, but Sestak is unfazed. He often notes that those who aren\u2019t happy with his 2016 candidacy are establishment \u201cWashington D.C. Democrats.\u201d Regardless, Democrats now have someone that will hopefully push Mr. Sestak aside, win statewide, and clinch a race that many in the party view as a \u201cmust-win.\u201d Enter Katie McGinty, the Chief of Staff for PA\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. She\u2019s expected to resign today and make it official at a later date. National Journal\u2019s Alex Roarty scooped the story last night:\n\nPennsylvania Democrat Katie McGinty will resign her position as chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf on Thursday in preparation to run for the United States Senate, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation tell National Journal. McGinty will not make a formal declaration Thursday that she's running for the seat held by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, according to the sources. But her decision to resign her high-profile job after only seven months all but guarantees a Senate campaign, sources added. They expect a formal campaign announcement within weeks. McGinty's entrance would be a major victory for Democrats in Washington, who have scoured Pennsylvania looking for a top-tier candidate in what should be a politically-crucial Senate battleground in 2016. Party leaders are wary about the only Democrat in the race, former Rep. Joe Sestak, concerned that his unwillingness to listen to strategic advice could cost them a winnable race against the well-entrenched Toomey. But Sestak is certain to stick in the race against McGinty, setting up a highly competitive primary battle.\n\nRoarty also mentioned that McGinty isn\u2019t new to politics. A fact that was elaborated on by the Patriot-News\u2019 Christian Alexandersen, who wrote that she \u201cworked for then-Senator Al Gore on initiatives aimed at strengthening patent protections, encouraging manufacturing and supporting science education, according to her online bio. Later, McGinty served as deputy assistant for President Bill Clinton and then served as chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\u201d\n\nAlexandersen cited G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, saying, \u201cMcGinty really wants to win an election and serve. So far, he said, she's been unable to do that. A run for the Senate seat may be her chance to taste primary election victory.\u201d\n\nThis second go-around at an election could be easier, as the field will be considerably less crowded. McGinty ran in the 2014 gubernatorial primary and was shellacked by then-candidate Tom Wolf. Nevertheless, Wolf chose her to quarterback his super PAC after some intraparty drama within the PA Democratic Party, specifically the refusal of soon-to-be-former state party chairman Jim Burn\u2019s refusal to step down at the time. Typically, the gubernatorial nominee picks the next party chair.\n\nIn the end, Wolf\u2019s PAC, Campaign for a Fresh Start, would pretty much run all campaign operations, bypassing the state party. Yet, Emily Schultheis, also of the National Journal, wrote in 2014, that McGinty\u2019s failed gubernatorial bid provided the fresh start that has evolved into a senate bid:\n\nVeteran operatives in the state say McGinty's primary run, though unsuccessful, widely impressed Pennsylvania Democrats\u2014meaning she's both an asset to Wolf now and a future candidate, if she's interested in running. Pennsylvania strategists say it's likely she'll be back on the ballot in 2016\u2026\n\nYes, indeed. For now, Sen. Toomey does enjoy a comfortable lead over Sestak. Let\u2019s see what happens in the next round of polling.\n\nLast note: Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski\u2013a Democrat\u2013also launched a bid for the U.S. Senate. On July 8, four days after federal agents arrived with search warrants at city hall, he suspended his campaign \u201cto fully focus on assisting in the federal investigation of Allentown contracting practices both prior to his being elected and since.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic blood bath?.05/27/2016 8:09:36AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Democratic blood bath?", "title": "Matt Vespa - PA Senate Race: Democrats Finally Have Someone To Pit Against Joe Sestak", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/07/23/pa-sen-democrats-finally-have-someone-to-pit-against-joe-sestak-n2029236", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/203/9a960ef4-f65f-433e-b915-99b607d006f4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Democratic blood bath?", "title": "Matt Vespa - PA Senate Race: Democrats Finally Have Someone To Pit Against Joe Sestak", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/07/23/pa-sen-democrats-finally-have-someone-to-pit-against-joe-sestak-n2029236", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/203/9a960ef4-f65f-433e-b915-99b607d006f4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "PA Senate Race: Democrats Finally Have Someone To Pit Against Joe Sestak , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "But her decision to resign her high-profile job after only seven months all but guarantees a Senate campaign, sources added.\nWill Sen.
