The Senate on Thursday passed an amendment to repeal the tax by a vote of 90-10, but the amendment was included in a bill that will be vetoed because it would repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe Cadillac tax is slated to take effect and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a repeal would cost about $93 billion in lost revenue.\n\nA key priority for Democrats, The Hill said, is making the stimulus-law expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit permanent.
