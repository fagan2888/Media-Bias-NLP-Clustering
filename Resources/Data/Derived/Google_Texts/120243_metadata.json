In Bensonhurst, there are 21,064 residents (11.2 percent) without health insurance, according to the report. The Brooklyn neighborhoods with the greatest number of uninsured are Bushwick (22 percent) and Sunset Park (16.3 percent). Citywide, the comptroller\u2019s report found that 962,805 people, 11.4 percent of residents, are without health insurance.\n\n\u201cClose to one million New York City residents lack even the most basic health coverage,\u201d Stringer said in a press release. \u201cTo ensure the long-term economic future of our City we need to make sure our residents are healthy and well. We want to get the word out: with the Affordable Care Act in place, getting health insurance is easier and more affordable than ever.\u201d\n\nThe comptroller\u2019s report was timed to coincide with the beginning of the Affordable Care Act open enrollment period, which runs from November 1, through December 15 for coverage to begin on January 1, 2016. Enrollment will remain open through January 31, 2015 for coverage to begin March 1, 2016.\n\nWhile the ratio of uninsured New Yorker\u2019s still hovers above 10 percent, the number has fallen steadily since the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was signed into law in 2010.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen real progress in reducing the number of City residents who are covered, but we must continue to reinforce that being uninsured can have real economic and health consequences for you and your family,\u201d Stringer said.\n\nNew Yorker\u2019s can find out how to apply for health insurance through the state\u2019s online marketplace. The Brooklyn Public Library also provides free healthcare navigator services at several branches. The Mapleton Library,\n\nlocated at 1702 60th Street, hosts a health insurance navigator on Tuesdays, 1pm \u2013 8pm.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Bensonhurst Bean", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.bensonhurstbean.com/2015/11/11-2-percent-of-bensonhurst-bath-beach-residents-are-uninsured/", "article_author_name": "Rachel Silberstein", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.bensonhurstbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bay-parkway_effect.jpg?fit=702%2C524", "site_id": "06bdfea73a2bdf75ac1bf64c10bd89c8", "article_published_time": "2015-11-12T13:20:11+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T01:22:13+00:00", "keywords": "affordable health care, brooklyn community board 11, cb 11, comptroller, comptroller report, health insurance, scott stringer, weekinreview, health, news", "wp_version": "7.8.0.3"}, "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 5.2.5.1 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface.", "og": {"site_name": "Bensonhurst Bean", "description": "More than one in ten residents living in Community District 11, which includes Bensonhurst\u00a0and Bath Beach,\u00a0do not have health insurance, according to figures released Monday by Comptroller Scott Stringer.
