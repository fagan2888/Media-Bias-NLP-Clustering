ACG to Open Office in Washington, D.C., in Public Policy Push

The global group is promoting Amber Landis to vice president of public policy

Public policy has been an increasingly significant focus of the Association for Corporate Growth for several years. The global organization, which boasts 90,000 middle-market dealmakers as members in 57 chapters, became an official federal lobbying agency in 2013. Now, the ACG is opening an office in Washington, D.C., and is promoting Amber Landis to vice president of public policy.

Landis has “deep knowledge and experience on the policy issues impacting ACG members,” says ACG CEO Gary LaBranche. She joined the ACG in March 2013 as a director of public policy and has been responsible for the organization’s legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts. She was “instrumental” in the creation of the Caucus on Middle Market Growth in the U.S. House of Representatives and established ACG's Private Equity Regulatory Task Force.

Throughout her career, Landis has represented the public policy interests of a wide range of companies and organizations, including: Whirlpool Corp. (NYSE: WHR); a retail trade group that included Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and The Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD); and TenCate USA, a multinational defense and textiles technology group based in the Netherlands.
