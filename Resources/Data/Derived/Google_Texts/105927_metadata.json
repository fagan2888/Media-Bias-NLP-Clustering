He was held without charge for nearly six years in a U.S. Navy brig in South Carolina before eventually pleading guilty and receiving a sentence of just over eight years behind bars.\n\nAl-Marri\u2019s nephew, Saleh Garallah Kahlah al-Marri, said Sunday that his uncle returned home to the small energy-rich country the previous evening and was greeted by representatives from the Qatari interior and foreign ministries.\n\n\u201cHe is in high spirits,\u201d Saleh al-Marri said. The nephew thanked Qatari officials for their help in getting al-Marri back home, saying they made \u201ctremendous efforts\u201d to do so.\n\nAl-Marri will not be making comments to the media for now because \u201cwe want to give him an opportunity to reintegrate into society,\u201d the nephew added.\n\nQatari officials could not immediately be reached on al-Marri\u2019s release. The U.S. Embassy in Doha had no comment.\n\n\u201cWe were advised by the Qatar embassy that Ali has arrived home. His family has confirmed his arrival,\u201d al-Marri\u2019s defense attorney, Andrew J. Savage, said in a brief email.\n\nAl-Marri was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2009 after pleading guilty to conspiring to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. He was expected to serve less than six years in consideration for time spent behind bars before and after his stay in the brig.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Qatari man, once held as enemy combatant by US, returns home", "title": "Qatari man, once held as enemy combatant by US, returns home", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Qatari man, once held as enemy combatant by US, returns home", "title": "Qatari man, once held as enemy combatant by US, returns home", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/18/qatari_man_once_held_as_enemy_combatant_by_us_returns_home/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/us-qatar-enemy-combatant.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Qatari man, once held as enemy combatant by US, returns home", "title": "Qatari man, once held as enemy combatant by US, returns home", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/us-qatar-enemy-combatant.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Abdullah Rebhy and Adam Schreck", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0af7\"", "article_summary": "The nephew thanked Qatari officials for their help in getting al-Marri back home, saying they made \u201ctremendous efforts\u201d to do so.\nQatari officials could not immediately be reached on al-Marri\u2019s release.\nHe was held without charge for nearly six years in a U.S. Navy brig in South Carolina before eventually pleading guilty and receiving a sentence of just over eight years behind bars.\n\u201cHe is in high spirits,\u201d Saleh al-Marri said.\nAl-Marri was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2009 after pleading guilty to conspiring to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization."}
