If the government\u2019s efforts to force Apple to write custom software that will break the encryption protecting mass-murderer Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s iPhone succeed, it will be an epochal case in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and privacy law. But there\u2019s another area where the dispute has major implications, and that is the very nature of how the Supreme Court judges cases. Regardless of its outcome, this fight will be remembered as a defining moment of early 21st-century law, likely eclipsing Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, Bush v. Gore, and King vs. Burwell in terms of far-reaching consequences. Despite their dramatic scale and immediate, heavily politicized implications, the rulings that decided Obamacare and campaign finance regulations are ultimately just legal frameworks for policy changes that can be reversed (like, say, Prohibition)\u2014but this case contains the seeds of far more sweeping change.\n\nWhatever the outcome, the case will mark a fundamental\u2014and inevitable\u2014evolution of American law: It will be the moment that constitutional originalism was laid to rest as an outdated judicial philosophy that is unworkable in the 21st century. It\u2019s ironic that a legal battle that started within weeks of Antonin Scalia\u2019s death will undo the judicial philosophy identified most conspicuously with the late associate justice. But even Scalia, were he still alive and on the bench, would not plausibly have been able to fit the elements of this case within the framework of textualism and original intent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a great deal at stake from a real-world standpoint as well. Those drawing the battle lines in court and in the press are making increasingly dramatic claims in both directions, warning of the dangers of capitulation. Apple\u2019s detractors accuse CEO Tim Cook of \u201cgrandstanding\u201d in defense of his products\u2019 market value. Meanwhile, Apple and its defenders accuse the FBI of tactically seizing upon an incendiary, politically charged test case as a power grab that will allow massive government overreach and potentially unlimited violation of privacy. Apple refuses to comply with the agency\u2019s motion to compel the company to write new software that would defeat the iPhone\u2019s fundamental, intrinsic inability to reveal its contents without the user\u2019s express compliance. Despite the agency\u2019s \u201cone-and-done\u201d assurances, Apple insists this would open the door to similar requests being made and enforced in the future, which would mean, potentially, that nobody\u2019s iPhone\u2014or any other digital device\u2014would be private ever again.\n\nBut, as important as these questions are, the arguments so employed are less far-reaching than the underlying quantum leap in legal thinking that this case represents. As this dispute demonstrates, digital technology creates a level of abstraction that can\u2019t be penetrated by traditional legal terminology. Ironically enough, it was Apple who first attempted to make digital concepts less abstract in the 1980s when they pioneered the use of real-world metaphors to represent more obscure or confusing data-processing procedures. Apple introduced words and visual avatars like document, folder, trash, sleep, and\u2014most significantly in the current context\u2014lock as a symbolic language that let non-computer-scientists work with digital data in ways that were understandable. But as computer software develops new capabilities evolving beyond the limitations of the typewriter\u2014or the VCR, or the film-based camera, or the Bell telephone\u2014the meaning of those symbols and metaphors evolves and changes. The digital environment is essentially abstract and malleable; its rules change all the time.\n\nLaw, however, is based in the real world; its abstractions are necessarily rigid and difficult to change. This is the foundation of textualism. In any century, property is property; a contract is a contract; a lock is a lock; and a key is a key. According to a textualist reading, jurists like Antonin Scalia have been able to successfully argue, for example, that gun ownership in the present day may be understood according to the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment\u2014regardless of the vast historical and contextual contrasts between 1791 and 2016\u2014because in either century, bearing arms means the same thing. Until now, old-world legal concepts could be stretched to cover post-industrial and post-communication-age scenarios.\n\nBut the iPhone is fundamentally different. A September 2015 white paper explains the framework of Apple\u2019s encryption-based operating system, in which a combination of a users\u2019 password, Apple\u2019s signed certificate, and a unique identifying code factory-burned into the device\u2019s CPU together create a permanent, impenetrable shield. Unlike a physical lock, or a safe deposit box\u2014or even a pre-Snowden, traditional cellphone\u2014that shield cannot be broken without literally compromising the security of every other iPhone. By extension, this crack would give the government access not just to the audio records of phone conversations\u2014as in traditional warranted wiretaps\u2014but the entire life of the person owning the phone: the photographs, emails, text messages, work documents, private papers, browsing history, credit card information, and all the other elements of 21st century life that are contained in the pocket supercomputers that nearly everybody in the developed world carries with them every minute of every day.\n\nIn other words, there is no existing statute or decision that can determine the outcome of this case without aggressive interpretation. The abstractions are too new and strange. The manifold roles played by Apple's ubiquitous devices are too various and comprehensive, penetrating into every aspect of citizens\u2019 public and private lives\u2014the legal rules of this iPhone world will have to be written from scratch.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The FBI\u2019s fight with Apple will have far-reaching implications beyond the government\u2019s ability to snoop through an iPhone.", "sailthru.author": "Jordan Orlando", "description": "After the conflict between the FBI and Apple Inc. over one of the San Bernardino terrorists\u2019 iPhones heated up last week, one aspect of the importance  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "After the conflict between the FBI and Apple Inc. over one of the San Bernardino terrorists\u2019 iPhones heated up last week, one aspect of the importance  ...", "title": "The Fight Over a San Bernardino Shooter\u2019s iPhone Is Shaping Up to Be the Case of the Century", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/the_fbi_s_fight_with_apple_will_be_the_case_of_the_century.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160223_JURIS_Tim-cook.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After the conflict between the FBI and Apple Inc. over one of the San Bernardino terrorists\u2019 iPhones heated up last week, one aspect of the importance  ...", "title": "The Fight Over a San Bernardino Shooter\u2019s iPhone Is Shaping Up to Be the Case of the Century", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/the_fbi_s_fight_with_apple_will_be_the_case_of_the_century.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160223_JURIS_Tim-cook.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-25T14:41:16Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "The Fight Over a San Bernardino Shooter\u2019s iPhone Is Shaping Up to Be the Case of the Century", "sailthru.headline": "The Case of the Century", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"The Fight Over a San Bernardino Shooter\\u2019s iPhone Is Shaping Up to Be the Case of the Century\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/the_fbi_s_fight_with_apple_will_be_the_case_of_the_century.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160223_JURIS_Tim-cook.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100160225010\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-25T14:41:16Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Jordan Orlando\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"scotus\",\n    \"antonin scalia\",\n    \"apple\",\n    \"san bernardino\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "The implications will go way beyond the government\u2019s ability to snoop through an iPhone.", "tw-line": "The fight over a San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone will be the case of the century:", "keywords": "Tim Cook, SCOTUS, US vs. Apple, Syed Rizwan Farook, San Bernardino, San Bernardino iPhone, Apple iPhone encryption, iPhone security, iPhone privacy, government surveillance", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "Tim Cook, SCOTUS, US vs. Apple, Syed Rizwan Farook, San Bernardino, San Bernardino iPhone, Apple iPhone encryption, iPhone security, iPhone privacy, government surveillance", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "After the conflict between the FBI and Apple Inc. over one of the San Bernardino terrorists\u2019 iPhones heated up last week, one aspect of the importance  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160223_JURIS_Tim-cook.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4bef\"", "article_summary": "As this dispute demonstrates, digital technology creates a level of abstraction that can\u2019t be penetrated by traditional legal terminology.\nIn other words, there is no existing statute or decision that can determine the outcome of this case without aggressive interpretation.\nIn any century, property is property; a contract is a contract; a lock is a lock; and a key is a key.\nBut, as important as these questions are, the arguments so employed are less far-reaching than the underlying quantum leap in legal thinking that this case represents.\nIf the government\u2019s efforts to force Apple to write custom software that will break the encryption protecting mass-murderer Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s iPhone succeed, it will be an epochal case in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and privacy law."}
