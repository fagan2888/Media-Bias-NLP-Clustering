Once there, the star-spangled Avenger faced off against one of Cap\u2019s oldest enemies, the Sons of the Serpent\u2014a white supremacist terror group suspected of kidnapping and possibly killing Mexicans caught crossing the desert.\n\nThe masked Serpents, with their big guns and their big, muscly arms, resemble a militarized Ku Klux Klan and spew recognizable Trump-isms at a group of unarmed immigrants. They lovingly refer to a hypothetical \u201cmighty Wall,\u201d accuse all Mexicans of stealing jobs, seeking welfare, and bringing \u201ctrouble and disease and crime,\u201d and piously invoke America\u2019s \u201cgreatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d the Serpents\u2019 leader booms at the immigrants, \u201cYou know how you make me press a 1 for English at the beginning of every call to my satellite provider? That is something I cannot abide!\u201d\n\nIn writing a racist group of armed vigilantes who violently attack, abduct, or kill border crossers into his book, Spencer didn\u2019t expect anyone to sympathize with, let alone defend what he thought was an obvious group of villains. The good hosts of Fox and Friends proved him wrong.\n\nIn a segment aired in October, Fox News correspondent Clayton Morris decried Cap\u2019s latest clash with the Serpents as a blatant slight \u201cagainst conservatives\u201d and dismissed Sam Wilson\u2019s now year-long stint as Captain America as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d (in the same breath, Morris also points out that Sam, formerly the Falcon, \u201cis, uh, African-American\u201d). Morris, a \u201ccomics expert,\u201d also called the Serpents a \u201cnew, odd enemy\u201d for Cap (they\u2019ve been around since 1966).\n\nCo-host Tucker Carlson also sympathized with the Serpents\u2019 leader, calling him just \u201can American who has misgivings upon unlimited illegal immigration and the costs associated with it.\u201d Fellow co-host Heather Childers called for writers to \u201ckeep politics out of comic books\u201d\u2014except for storylines about \u201cthe people who are working the border to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the issue, Wilson had delivered a statement publicly acknowledging his own political beliefs\u2014a significant, decidedly un-Steve Rogers move. In a sharp bit of comedy, Spencer (who also writes Marvel\u2019s funny and poignant Astonishing Ant-Man, as well as Morning Glories and The Fix for Image Comics) omits the actual content of Wilson\u2019s statement and cuts straight to reactionary, satiric headlines. (Sam Wilson: Captain Anti-America? Cap Versus the Constitution? Captain America Approval Rating Plummets Under 50 Percent!)\n\nThe headlines were meant as a joke\u2014making Fox\u2019s earnest, unwitting parallel of the hysteria all the more surreal for Spencer. \u201cThere is nothing better than being proven right,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe were very clear in the book\u2014these were not peaceful protesters of border policy,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cSo when you see people saying \u2018He\u2019s talking about me!\u2019 well, unless you\u2019re going down and kidnapping or murdering border crossers, no, we weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast talked to Spencer about writing Sam as Captain America (Captain America: Sam Wilson #2 hit retailers this week) and what he thought of the Fox and Friends segment.\n\n\n\nYou've written Steve Rogers as Captain America a few times before, what has writing Sam Wilson been like?\n\nI\u2019d written Sam a little as Falcon, and found the voice came pretty easily. I like the character a lot\u2014he\u2019s sort of an everyman, he\u2019s got a good sense of humor. But really, the appeal was in getting to do the story of Sam as Cap. It\u2019s a very big deal, just the idea of an African-American Captain America, and how that affects the public at large and how that very different perspective on what the country is all about would shape how he did the job. Getting to tell part of that story was a huge thrill for me\u2014and I\u2019ll always owe Rick Remender, the previous writer, big-time for coming up with the idea in the first place, and making it happen.\n\nIn the first issue, Sam feels moved to publicly declare his own deep-held beliefs after seeing how politically divided the country has become. Why did it feel important for him to do that?\n\nSam and Steve are very different guys. Steve has always been very invested in the idea of Captain America as a symbol, as something bigger than himself. He also became Cap at a time when the country was strongly united against a common enemy. Sam, on the other hand, has always been about direct involvement in people\u2019s lives and the issues\u2014he\u2019s very much of the \u201cWhy We Can\u2019t Wait\u201d school. He has a background in social work\u2014community organizing, if you will. As Marvel\u2019s first African-American superhero, he\u2019s been at the forefront of a lot of stories about one of the most divisive issues in the country: race relations. He even ran for office at one point. So it seemed clear to me that Sam would, especially over time, come to view the nature of the job differently.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason\n\nIn the scene, we skip right past his actual statement and straight to the reactionary headlines\u2014which makes for great comedic effect, but I also wondered if you ever considered including part of what he said?\n\nNot really, no. [Marvel SVP, Executive Editor] Tom Brevoort and I talked a lot about that, in fact\u2014to me, it\u2019s just unnecessary. What matters is the decision he makes\u2014to get down in the muck a little bit, to speak to the issues of the day in hopes of bringing people together\u2014and the media circus that follows that. Because I really do think you could do this story about someone from any political persuasion. The fact is we say we want candor and strong stances from our leaders, but everything is filtered through \u201cgotcha\u201d journalism and so much is twisted and manipulated by outlets and individuals who have vested interests not in telling the truth, but in making the news of the day fit certain worldviews.\n\nWhat has been funny is what a Rorschach test it\u2019s been, though. People think they know exactly what Sam said at this press conference. The projection is fascinating. And in addition to that\u2014we haven\u2019t made any kind of statement yet on whether or not what Sam did here was a good thing! As in, whether or not this is something a Captain America should do in the first place. I think the jury is very much out on that, and it\u2019s a big part of our story moving forward.\n\nSam mentions that Steve Rogers kept his personal political beliefs close to the vest. Though Sam\u2019s intentions are admirable, do you think it might have been a bit naive to believe that taking a strong public stance would create more unity?\n\nIt was naive in some way, but I think that makes sense when you look at the role of Captain America and how it\u2019s perceived in the Marvel Universe. The person who carries that shield is a larger-than-life figure to the average Joe on the street, and seen as above the fray. So it\u2019s easy to see how the person in that costume might believe they could move the needle on some pressing issues without getting submerged in the politics. But clearly, he underestimated just how powerful partisanship and opportunistic journalism are as forces in our culture right now.\n\nLook at this way\u2014if Abraham Lincoln or George Washington came back to life and decided they needed to speak up on a certain issue, how long would it take before their approval ratings dropped? That\u2019s kinda what Cap is in the Marvel Universe, on a level with the most venerated American heroes. But it probably still wouldn\u2019t be enough to overcome the toxicity of the culture.\n\nI was just reading this study about what drives partisanship, even in an era of deep disillusionment with political parties. And the evidence is pretty overwhelming\u2014it\u2019s not belief in one\u2019s own ideas, it\u2019s fear of the other side. That\u2019s really what motivates people to vote, it seems\u2014not \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix this\u201d but rather, \u201cWe can\u2019t let the other team win.\u201d That\u2019s what Sam runs directly into\u2014an entire political structure that really has no interest in coming together. Moderation and compromise might poll well, but they are terrible for that business.\n\nOK, the Fox and Friends segment\u2014what were your initial thoughts on it? They seem to think the Sons of the Serpent are a new adversary for Captain America. And that he should be fighting ISIS instead... or Hitler.\n\nLook, as a writer of fiction that\u2019s somewhat speculative in nature at times, there is nothing better than being proven right. I mean, what\u2019s on the page is exactly how they reacted to the story. Sam does not take any position on immigration in the issue. He does not say undocumented immigrants should get Obamacare benefits or student loans\u2014he says armed vigilantes can\u2019t violently attack, abduct, or kill border crossers. That would seem to me to be a position we can all agree on.\n\nSo to see that twisted and manipulated and turned into \u201cCaptain America Attacks Illegal Immigration Opponents\u201d was pretty amazing thing to watch. I mean, I don\u2019t know if there will ever be a more surreal moment in my life than watching Tucker Carlson defend the Sons of the Serpent. That\u2019s something, if I put it in a book, people would say it was over the top. It was through the black mirror stuff.\n\nWhat does it say to you that they saw the Sons of the Serpent as ordinary Americans?\n\nWell, I think the first question is one of sincerity. That\u2019s not something you can speak to with certainty, but it seems to me you have a lot of media outlets today\u2014on both sides of the political divide\u2014that pay the bills by scaring people, making them feel like they\u2019re under attack, like they\u2019re being persecuted. And saying \u201csubversive popular culture is corrupting everything around you and aiding your enemies\u201d is a favorite for those folks.\n\nBut beyond that, again, we were very clear in the book\u2014these were not peaceful protesters of border policy. So when you see people saying, \u201cHe\u2019s talking about me!\u201d well, unless you\u2019re going down and kidnapping or murdering border crossers, no, we weren\u2019t. I am a pretty staunch environmentalist, but I do not look at Poison Ivy as an indictment of my beliefs.\n\nWhat I will say is I think we touched a nerve because it\u2019s a hot-button issue of the moment right now. And this goes back to that culture of getting people fired up and scared and divided\u2014we have this sad history of taking groups and turning them into boogeymen. And once that takes hold, a lot of folks will just immediately and automatically reject any story that portrays that group in a positive/sympathetic light. And my hope is, we can use stories to counter-effect that, to show that even these folks you don\u2019t agree with, there are certain basic values that should be upheld no matter what. That you can\u2019t just put them in a \u201cvillain\u201d box and be done with them. It\u2019s sort of empathy force-feeding, and it\u2019s something you\u2019ll see applied to both sides in this book. This is just a first example. I fully expect to get it from the other side at some point.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that some of the reaction to the issue mirrors the headlines depicted in the issue. Did you know it would provoke that kind of reaction?\n\nI have to be honest\u2014I thought maybe there would be a little bit of this, but within the comics community. Like the odd Twitter comment or wherever. Beyond that, hand to God, it came as a total surprise to me. It\u2019s like we keep talking about\u2014I just didn\u2019t really think anyone was gonna get caught up in defending the de facto white supremacist terrorist group of the Marvel Universe since 1966.\n\nWhat was funny was, the day the book came out I didn\u2019t hear any of this. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until later in the week, once certain web sites started running stories on it. From there it just snowballed. For about 48 hours I was getting non-stop hate mail, really ugly stuff. The Fox & Friends thing happened, and a lot of outlets picked that up\u2014and that really set off a much bigger wave of very supportive messages, which was very nice.\n\nAnd then once it got to The Daily Show, I just thought, Wow, this really is something people are talking about, you know? It\u2019s in the broader conversation. It can be hard to tell that when you\u2019re in the middle of it, but once Trevor Noah\u2019s making jokes about it, you know it broke through. And as a writer, that\u2019s just enormously gratifying. I couldn\u2019t have dreamt of a better start for this book.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen some outlets assume that since your public persona tends to skew a certain way, your beliefs and Sam\u2019s must be the same. How would you respond to that?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s pretty silly to me. I write a lot of characters, all with different views on the world and different politics. It\u2019s not hard for me to make that distinction. Sam and I do not have identical politics. I am not Sam. I have absolutely no desire to simply confirm my own beliefs and write a book that only appeals to people who agree with me.\n\nThere will be villains in this book that have left-wing ideologies. There will be conservatives portrayed in a positive light in the book. I want to write a book that examines modern-day America through a superhero comic book lens\u2014Cap comics have a long tradition of that. That\u2019s all.\n\nAt the end of the issue, we see ex-partners Sam and Steve Rogers at odds--what is their relationship going to be like going forward?\n\nThis is really the ground we cover in the second issue. My hope is that we\u2019ve created a point of disagreement between the two of them that speaks to their individual beliefs and doesn\u2019t paint either of them as the bad guy. That\u2019s what gets me excited about this part of the story: we tried to insert a little nuance in the debate, to illustrate how sticky some of these tough political issues are. Fingers crossed we pulled it off.\n\nI imagine that writing an issue like Captain America comes with a little more oversight from Marvel than there was when you started writing Ant-Man, who was a little more obscure, at least before the movie came out. What's it been like with a headlining character like Captain America?\n\nMarvel has been amazingly supportive\u2014they have a great culture in place, of letting creative people run free as much as possible. I\u2019m always a little surprised by it, but happily so. There hasn\u2019t been anything yet that they\u2019ve told me I couldn\u2019t do. It really hasn\u2019t felt much different than any other assignment in that regard. Obviously with the 75th Anniversary and the Captain America: Civil War movie out next year, the book is in something of a spotlight\u2014but at the end of the day, the work feels pretty much the same.\n\nWhat's your vision for Sam Wilson: Captain America going forward and what are themes you hope to address?", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "MelissaHLeon"}, "keywords": "Captain America, Comic Books, Sam Wilson, Fox and Friends, Tucker Carlson, Google, entertainment, Fox News, Marvel", "publicationDate": 201511010400, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "description": "Nick Spencer, the writer of \u2018Captain America: Sam Wilson,\u2019 discusses bringing the black Captain America to life and \u2018Fox and Friends\u2019 \u2019 boneheaded criticisms of his comic book.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Captain America Writer Slams Fox News for Sympathizing With His Xenophobic Villains", "tags": "captain_america,entity:product/comic_books,sam_wilson,fox_and_friends,tucker_carlson,syndication:syndication-google,topic:entertainment,fox_news,marvel", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"\u2018Captain America\u2019 Writer Slams Fox News for Sympathizing With His Xenophobic Villains\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/01/captain-america-writer-slams-fox-news-for-calling-his-xenophobic-villains-ordinary-americans.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/11/01/captain-america-writer-slams-fox-news-for-calling-his-xenophobic-villains-ordinary-americans/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48213994.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/11/01/captain-america-writer-slams-fox-news-for-calling-his-xenophobic-villains-ordinary-americans\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-01T04:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"author\":\"Melissa Leon\",\"tags\":[\"captain_america\",\"comic_books\",\"sam_wilson\",\"fox_and_friends\",\"tucker_carlson\",\"syndication-google\",\"entertainment\",\"fox_news\",\"marvel\"]}", "news_keywords": "Captain America, Comic Books, Sam Wilson, Fox and Friends, Tucker Carlson, Google, Entertainment, Fox News, Marvel", "sectionTaxanomies": "entertainment", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Melissa Leon", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/melissa-leonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/11/01/captain-america-writer-slams-fox-news-for-calling-his-xenophobic-villains-ordinary-americans", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Nick Spencer, the writer of \u2018Captain America: Sam Wilson,\u2019 discusses bringing the black Captain America to life and \u2018Fox and Friends\u2019 \u2019 boneheaded criticisms of his comic book.", "title": "\u2018Captain America\u2019 Writer Slams Fox News for Sympathizing With His Xenophobic Villains", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/01/captain-america-writer-slams-fox-news-for-calling-his-xenophobic-villains-ordinary-americans.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/11/01/captain-america-writer-slams-fox-news-for-calling-his-xenophobic-villains-ordinary-americans/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1446419843308.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/melissa-leon", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "What's your vision for Sam Wilson: Captain America going forward and what are themes you hope to address?\nSteve has always been very invested in the idea of Captain America as a symbol, as something bigger than himself.\nYou've written Steve Rogers as Captain America a few times before, what has writing Sam Wilson been like?\n(Sam Wilson: Captain Anti-America?\nAs in, whether or not this is something a Captain America should do in the first place."}
