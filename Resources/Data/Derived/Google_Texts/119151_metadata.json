It puts the U.N.\u2019s anti-ISIS efforts on equal footing with its fight against al Qaeda\u2019s financial networks and ties together existing sanctions that some officials worry have not been evenly implemented.\n\nISIS has pulled in roughly $500 million from selling oil on the black market, Lew said on Thursday. It has made millions more in the form of ransoms that it collects from families of people held hostage and in the form of taxes on its residents.\n\n\u201cISIL is a challenging financial target,\u201d Lew said, calling for countries to ramp up their efforts to block the group\u2019s oil sales and access to the financial market.\n\n\u201cWhile we are making progress to financially isolate ISIL, if we are to succeed we all must intensify our efforts, on our own and together at the international level.\u201d\n\nPassage of Thursday\u2019s resolution also carried symbolic heft, showing that major global powers could come together to tackle ISIS. The U.S. and Russia, in particular, have been at odds in their efforts to uproot the group\u2019s footing in Iraq and Syria, with differences over whether Syrian President Bashar Assad should stay in power.\n\nThis week, Secretary of State John Kerry John KerryGOP senator calls for China to crack down on illegal opioid Obamas to live in home of former Clinton press secretary: report Even in defeat, Trump could harm the country irreparably MORE said that the U.S. is \u201cnot seeking so-called \u2018regime change,\u2019 as it is known in Syria.\u201d Still, Assad should not be in power to lead the country going forward, he maintained.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The U.S. and Russia drafted the resolution together.", "description": "The U.S. and Russia drafted the resolution together.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The U.S. and Russia drafted the resolution together.", "title": "UN adopts measure to cut off money to ISIS", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/263645-un-adopts-measure-to-cut-off-money-to-isis", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/kurdsisis11172015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/263645-un-adopts-measure-to-cut-off-money-to-isis", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-17T16:35-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-17T16:35:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "keywords": ",John Kerry, Jack Lew,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/263645-un-adopts-measure-to-cut-off-money-to-isis", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The U.S. and Russia drafted the resolution together.", "card": "summary", "title": "UN adopts measure to cut off money to ISIS"}, "dcterms.title": "UN adopts measure to cut off money to ISIS"}, "article_summary": "The United Nations Security Council came together on Thursday to adopt a resolution targeting the funding supply for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\nISIS has pulled in roughly $500 million from selling oil on the black market, Lew said on Thursday.\nThe 15-member council unanimously approved the measure, which the United States and Russia drafted jointly, as part of an escalating focus on ISIS amid concerns about the organization\u2019s ability to reach far beyond the borders of its self-proclaimed caliphate.\n\u201cISIL is a challenging financial target,\u201d Lew said, calling for countries to ramp up their efforts to block the group\u2019s oil sales and access to the financial market.\nIt has made millions more in the form of ransoms that it collects from families of people held hostage and in the form of taxes on its residents."}
