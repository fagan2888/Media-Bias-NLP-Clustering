(King, you may recall, was on his way to a fifth Iditarod title last year when he and his team stalled in blowing snow with low to no visibility on an icy trail, and was forced to scratch just miles from the finish line.)\n\nIn the Quest, Joar Leifseth Ulsom, who had held onto third or fourth place since the race\u2019s start, scratched on Feb. 15, citing the well-being of his dogs.\n\nBy the time Brent Sass (winner of the 2015 Yukon Quest) crossed the finish line, 10 mushers had scratched and Mackey \u2013 four-time Quest and Iditarod champ -- was 15th in a field of 16 remaining mushers.\n\nAnother expectation-defying surprise: Snow, or lack of it.\n\nWhile some his Iditarod competition competed in the Yukon Quest, Pete Kaiser, Yup\u2019ik, (who has two top-10 finishes in five Iditarods) and team were home in Bethel, preparing mentally, physically and strategically for the Iditarod.\n\nRELATED: Alaskans Mourn the Passing of George Attla, Mushing Legend and Mentor\n\nOn Feb. 10, Kaiser was preparing drop bags for his team \u2013 3,000 pounds of dog food, booties and other supplies he and his dogs will need during the Iditarod. Barring any significant snowfall at home, he and his team would fly 427 miles northeast to Tanana to get in some work. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a lot of snow [in Bethel],\u201d he said that day.\n\nHe was succinct in his view of the Quest, and what it could say about competition in the Last Great Race: \u201cAny top competitors in the Quest are top competitors in the Iditarod,\u201d he said.\n\nRichie Diehl, Dena\u2019ina Athabascan, the 2014 Iditarod\u2019s Most Improved Musher, finished 13th in the Kuskokwim 300 in January, had planned to race in the Tustamena -- 200 miles of trails in the Caribou Hills on the Kenai Peninsula \u2013 as a final pre-Iditarod test. But that race \u2013 postponed from its Feb. 7 start date to Feb. 21 -- was cancelled for lack of snow.\n\nOn Feb. 13, Diehl was watching the weather. The weekend forecast was 40 degrees with rain that threatened to turn into slush the little snow that had fallen this year. If needed, he and his team would fly to Anchorage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 3-4 inches on the ground. We used to get 3-4 feet, sometimes more,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody I talk to, all of the elders, they say this is not how it used to be. [Climate change] is right in front of us.\u201d\n\nAnd not just in Aniak. Other mushers have said lack of snow is forcing them to travel farther to train. And this year, lack of snow in the Alaska Range compelled the Iditarod race committee to change the race\u2019s official start from Anchorage to Fairbanks (the ceremonial start will still take place in Anchorage). It\u2019s only the second time in the race\u2019s 43-year history that the start location has been changed.\n\n\u201cWhile some snow did fall east of the Alaska Range over the past couple of weeks, other parts of the trail, in very critical areas, did not get much or any of it,\u201d Iditarod CEO Stan Hooley said on the Iditarod website Feb. 11.\n\nLooking ahead to the Iditarod, Diehl has a lot of confidence in his team. They\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on the trails and \u201cthey\u2019re looking good,\u201d he said. Of his race strategy in the Iditarod, he quipped, \u201cI\u2019ll leave that to myself.\u201d\n\nDitto for Chuck Schaeffer, Inupiaq -- raced in the 1985 and 1990 Iditarods -- who said he expects the teams that come off the Quest will be more ready for the Iditarod. \u201cThe dogs are trail-tough and used to a schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cI do watch the Yukon Quest fairly closely, but [I\u2019m] mostly focused on my own thing.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of this year\u2019s Iditarod he\u2019s looking forward to: Mushing into Huslia, the hometown of Alaska Sports Hall of Fame musher George Attla Jr., who passed away on Feb. 15 at the age of 81.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recent Yukon Quest provided a look at the mettle of some of the mushers and teams for the upcoming Iditarod, and was a reminder that if you have any expectations in a sled d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/21/road-iditarod-mushers-expect-be-shocked-every-turn-159296", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/mushers_rep_for_iditarodjpg_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Road to Iditarod: Mushers Expect the Unexpected At Every Turn"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-02-21T08:51-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/21/road-iditarod-mushers-expect-be-shocked-every-turn-159296", "dc": {"title": "Road to Iditarod: Mushers Expect the Unexpected At Every Turn"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Road to Iditarod: Mushers Expect the Unexpected At Every Turn"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf76\"", "article_summary": "By the time Brent Sass (winner of the 2015 Yukon Quest) crossed the finish line, 10 mushers had scratched and Mackey \u2013 four-time Quest and Iditarod champ -- was 15th in a field of 16 remaining mushers.\nBut that race \u2013 postponed from its Feb. 7 start date to Feb. 21 -- was cancelled for lack of snow.\nOther mushers have said lack of snow is forcing them to travel farther to train.\nWhile some his Iditarod competition competed in the Yukon Quest, Pete Kaiser, Yup\u2019ik, (who has two top-10 finishes in five Iditarods) and team were home in Bethel, preparing mentally, physically and strategically for the Iditarod.\nThe weekend forecast was 40 degrees with rain that threatened to turn into slush the little snow that had fallen this year."}
