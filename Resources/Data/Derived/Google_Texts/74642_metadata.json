In other words, thinking, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d is certainly not a good way to motivate yourself to get off the couch.\n\nThe researchers examined over 800 Americans in an online study, asking them whether they believed in a \u201cjust world\u201d (the belief that their positive actions will lead to constructive results that improve their lives). Participants who didn\u2019t believe in a just world were more likely to not exercise, the researchers found, compared to those who did believe in a just world. This was especially true for people who were already overweight or obese and had experienced weight discrimination in the past, hanging onto a \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d mindset.\n\nPeople who accept weight discrimination and negative views of themselves end up perpetuating the bad cycle, believing that they\u2019re lazy and won\u2019t amount to anything. \u201cWhen someone feels bad about themselves and is applying negative stereotypes to themselves, they give up on their goals,\u201d Rebecca Pearl, a researcher at Yale University and author of the study, said. What this might be is a form of internalized oppression, when people internalize negative stereotypes directed at them, which then make them perform less effectively. Internalized oppression has been described in several different studies, including one in which women who identified themselves as students at an elite college consistently scored better than similar women who identified themselves simply as women.\n\n\u201cThreats to belief in a just world may lead to negative outcomes for health behaviors and psychological well-being among individuals who have experienced weight bias and perceive it to be pervasive,\u201d the authors write in the conclusion. But this \u201cwhy try\u201d effect can be diminished by analyzing your beliefs and accepting the notion that believing your actions can and will be constructive. Life may not always be fair, and the world may not always be just \u2014 but your personal actions to better yourself are an individual effort that should not be influenced by societal pressures or internalized oppression.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "exercise, negative thinking, self esteem", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who believe life isn\u2019t fair are not as likely to stick to exercise goals as people who believe their hard work and actions will amount to something positive.", "title": "Thinking Life\u2019s Not Fair Will Only Make You Fat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/negative-thoughts-believing-lifes-not-fair-demotivates-people-exercise-achieve-goals-311860", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/22/lazy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who believe life isn\u2019t fair are not as likely to stick to exercise goals as people who believe their hard work and actions will amount to something positive.", "title": "Thinking Life\u2019s Not Fair Will Only Make You Fat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/negative-thoughts-believing-lifes-not-fair-demotivates-people-exercise-achieve-goals-311860", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/22/lazy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/22/lazy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-22T17:16:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-22T17:18:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who believe life isn\u2019t fair are not as likely to stick to exercise goals as people who believe their hard work and actions will amount to something positive."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf550\"", "article_summary": "What this might be is a form of internalized oppression, when people internalize negative stereotypes directed at them, which then make them perform less effectively.\nPeople who have negative thoughts are less likely to get themselves to the gym, according to a new study.\n\u201cWhen someone feels bad about themselves and is applying negative stereotypes to themselves, they give up on their goals,\u201d Rebecca Pearl, a researcher at Yale University and author of the study, said.\nPeople who accept weight discrimination and negative views of themselves end up perpetuating the bad cycle, believing that they\u2019re lazy and won\u2019t amount to anything.\nIn other words, thinking, \u201cWhy bother?\u201d is certainly not a good way to motivate yourself to get off the couch."}
