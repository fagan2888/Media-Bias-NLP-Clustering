We are not satisfied with what he has been able to accomplish \u2014 there is much more to be done \u2014 but neither is he. Notably, he is responsible for co-authoring the program in 2000 that started the federal government\u2019s timber payments.\n\nWyden has also been a leader in the debate over digital privacy. He didn\u2019t want the government to be able to peek inside someone\u2019s cell phone without a warrant. He fought the plan that would have had social media companies enlisted by the government to help track the behavior of their users. He spoke out loudly when some, including President Obama, brought up the possibility of eliminating or reducing the tax deductions for charitable contributions. That was a foolish idea and deserved to be squashed.\n\nWyden has not lost touch with the lives of Oregonians. There\u2019s more to it than just holding town meetings, but he has been holding a town meeting in each of Oregon\u2019s 36 counties every year.\n\nWyden faces challenges in the Democratic party from Paul Weaver, a former locomotive engineer, and Kevin Stine. Stine, a Navy veteran on the Medford City Council, is a noteworthy candidate and is more liberal than Wyden on a number of issues. Stine\u2019s policy positions line up fairly well with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nWe have disagreed with Wyden on some issues \u2014 on some areas of forest management, designation of new wilderness and taxation policy. But he is a formidable voice for Oregon and for the nation, and the best choice in the Democratic primary.\n\nFour candidates are on the Republican primary ballot: business owner Carpenter from Bend, consultant Mark Callahan, consultant Dan Laschober, and Lane County Commissioner Faye Stewart.\n\nThere are policy differences among them. But there isn\u2019t a lot of daylight there. They seem more focused on Wyden than each other.\n\nCarpenter stands out. He has created businesses and jobs. He knows what that takes. He owns Bend\u2019s Centratel, the telephone answering service, and a number of other businesses. He also has a nonprofit organization, Kashmir Family Aid, that has provided education assistance in the Kashmir region of Pakistan. Former state representative Jason Conger has endorsed him.\n\nCarpenter came to Oregon in his 20s, working in the timber industry. And he has a particular interest in cultivating the federal forests \u2014 not clear-cutting, he emphasized. He wants a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control who is coming into the country and what they are bringing. He is an opponent of Common Core and favors school choice and vouchers to get government out of education.\n\nIn general, he told us he hopes to see government get smaller and reduce regulation. For instance, he deals with regulations dealing with patient privacy every day because of his answering service business, and while he certainly believes in the importance of patient privacy, he said the regulations could use some thinning. As a general rule, he would vote against new taxes.\n\nCarpenter could make a difference in Washington for Oregon.\n\nAs for the Independent Party\u2019s primary, Reynolds is the clear choice. He\u2019s a progressive who wants to get big money out of politics and the government out of bulk data collection, end the Affordable Care Act and replace it with expanded Medicare. If conspiracy theories are your thing, the candidate for you is his opponent: Marvin Sandnes. He can tell you what he thinks really happened on 9/11.\n\nTo recap, it\u2019s Wyden, Carpenter and Reynolds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For U.S. Senate, we urge voters to support Ron Wyden in the Democratic primary, Bend businessman Sam Carpenter in the Republican primary and Steven Reynolds in the Independent Party primary.
