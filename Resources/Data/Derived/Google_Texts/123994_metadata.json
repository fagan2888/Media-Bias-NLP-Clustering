It contends they orchestrated a secret boycott of SawStop\u2019s finger-saving technology, fearing that if it gained traction, they would face increased liability for injuries from standard table saws.\n\nAs reported by FairWarning, more than 67,000 U.S. workers and do-it-your-selfers suffer blade contact injuries annually, according to Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates. That includes more than 33,000 injuries treated in emergency rooms, among them 4,000 amputations. The SawStop system instantly stops a whirring blade on contact with skin, typically resulting in a minor nick instead of a life-changing injury.\n\nThe suit, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Va., says the big manufacturers joined forces to spurn the technology when it was offered to them, and manipulated industry guidelines to keep safety systems, such as the one developed by SawStop, from becoming the industry standard. As a result, the suit contends, SawStop should be paid at least $10 million in lost revenue along with treble damages.\n\nThe 40-page complaint was filed on Feb. 20, and the 22 defendants\u2014including saw manufacturers, their subsidiaries and affiliates\u2014have yet to file answers.\n\nIn a statement to FairWarning, Cheryl Kilborn, director of media relations for Robert Bosch LLC, noted that \u201cthe use and adoption\u2019\u2019 of the SawStop technology \u201chas long been debated in the industry.\u201d\n\nBut Kilborn said Bosch \u201chas acted in a lawful and responsible manner, we deny the claims in the lawsuit, and we will vigorously defend our position in court.\u201d A Makita spokesman declined comment, and Black & Decker and Ryobi did not return calls.\n\nThough not named as defendants, the Power Tool Institute, an industry trade group, and Underwriters Laboratories, a safety consulting firm that oversees the content of voluntary table saw standards, were described in the lawsuit as co-conspirators. Representatives of both groups declined comment.\n\nIndustry officials have said in the past that their saws are reasonably safe. They have claimed that the cost of flesh detection technology and paying royalties to SawStop would make some popular lines of saws unaffordable.\n\nThe suit says the conspiracy began in 2001 or 2002, but was not revealed until February, 2010, through testimony of a retired Ryobi official at a trial in Boston. The case involved a worker named Carlos Osorio, who had sued Ryobi after suffering severe hand injuries in a table saw accident, and won a $1.5 million judgment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The complaint names such industry leaders as Bosch and Black & Decker", "title": "Power tool makers accused in lawsuit of thwarting adoption of finger-saving device", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The complaint names such industry leaders as Bosch and Black & Decker", "title": "Power tool makers accused in lawsuit of thwarting adoption of finger-saving device", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/power_tool_makers_accused_in_lawsuit_of_thwarting_adoption_of_finger_saving_device_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_182599061.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The complaint names such industry leaders as Bosch and Black & Decker", "title": "Power tool makers accused in lawsuit of thwarting adoption of finger-saving device", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_182599061.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Myron Levin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Black & Decker, Bosch, FairWarning, Power Tool Makers, Power Tools, SawStop LLC", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4034\"", "article_summary": "The complaint by SawStop LLC, of Tualatin, Ore., names top power tool companies, including Bosch, Black & Decker, Makita, and Ryobi Technologies.\nThough not named as defendants, the Power Tool Institute, an industry trade group, and Underwriters Laboratories, a safety consulting firm that oversees the content of voluntary table saw standards, were described in the lawsuit as co-conspirators.\nThe case involved a worker named Carlos Osorio, who had sued Ryobi after suffering severe hand injuries in a table saw accident, and won a $1.5 million judgment.\nTopics: Black & Decker, Bosch, FairWarning, Power Tool Makers, Power Tools, SawStop LLC, Business News, NewsThis piece originally appeared on FairWarningLeading power tool manufacturers have conspired for years to thwart adoption of a safety device that could prevent thousands of finger amputations and other disfiguring injuries in table saw accidents, according to a federal antitrust lawsuit filed by the developer of the safety technology.\nIt contends they orchestrated a secret boycott of SawStop\u2019s finger-saving technology, fearing that if it gained traction, they would face increased liability for injuries from standard table saws."}
