John McCain is a hero. Over and out. \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) February 8, 2016\n\nThe last line was a response to Trump\u2019s past criticism of the Arizona senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee.\n\nRelated: Chris Christie Channels \u2018Animal House\u2019 in Defending His Record\n\nWhen asked about the tone of his tweet by CNN correspondent Dana Bash, Bush replied, \u201cWell, he is a whiner and I\u2019m defending the honor of people I respect. I think that\u2019s more than appropriate. I do this with joy in my heart because I do believe that this country is the most extraordinary country on the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nDescribing himself a \u201cjoyful warrior,\u201d Bush said he was not willing to stand idle while Trump is \u201ctrying to hijack\u201d the GOP.\n\nMoments after the interview aired, CNN host Wolf Blitzer had Trump on the phone, and asked him to react to Bush.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stiff,\u201d Trump began. \u201cHe\u2019s not a guy who can be president. He doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Rubio\u2019s Debate Stumble Could Derail Him as the \u2018Establishment Candidate\u2019\n\nTrump accused Bush of lying about his positions on various subjects, including abortion and gun rights. It almost seemed as though Trump had compiled a list of zingers he wanted to use on Bush, and was in a hurry to get them all out.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a desperate person he\u2019s a sad and pathetic person. He doesn\u2019t even use his last name in his ads. He\u2019s a sad person who\u2019s gone absolutely crazy. I mean, this guy is a nervous wreck. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHe\u2019s spent over a $100 million and he\u2019s a failed candidate. He\u2019s a laughingstock.\u201d\n\nRelated: Will Bernie Sanders\u2019 Foreign Policy Stumbles Derail His Campaign?\n\nBush has repeatedly hit Trump for his use of eminent domain laws to take private property for development, and drew some blood in the last debate when the crowd plainly sided with him on the subject.\n\nBut on CNN, Trump trotted out a new line of attack: The Bush family used eminent domain to secure some of the land for the home stadium of the Texas Rangers baseball team \u2014 once partly owned by Jeb\u2019s brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\nWhen Blitzer pointed out that Jeb Bush was not part of that deal, Trump said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t use it, because he\u2019s not smart enough to use it\u2026but how can he criticize me for using eminent domain when his family used it?\u201d\n\nThe parade of insults continued when Blitzer asked Trump to respond to Bush\u2019s calling him a \u201cwhiner.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Carson Might Poison the Well for Cruz with Evangelicals\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a whiner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI get things done. Jeb is the kind of guy, if he weren\u2019t in government nobody would give him a job. Couldn\u2019t get a job. You look at what he says \u2014 he lies so much.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his claim that Bush is running a \u201cfailed campaign\u201d and predicted that he would be the \u201clast of the governors\u201d when the votes are counted in New Hampshire tomorrow. (The governors refer to the three current or former governors remaining in the race: Bush, John Kasich of Ohio and Chris Christie of New Jersey.) \u201cCertainly he\u2019s the least talented of the governors.\u201d\n\nAs discussion of Bush wrapped up, Trump hurriedly threw in a few shots at Bush\u2019s decision to bring his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush, on the campaign trail over the weekend: \u201cHe\u2019s an embarrassment to his family. He has to bring his mother out and walk his mother around at 90 years old. I think it\u2019s a very sad situation.\u201d\n\nDespite his claims to the contrary, Trump is not at all shy about punching down, but he\u2019s most likely to do it when he feels threatened, as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson learned when their campaigns began to gain momentum. While Bush doesn\u2019t appear to be a genuine threat to Trump at this point, especially not in New Hampshire, the billionaire\u2019s over-the-top response suggests that he feels the sting from some of Bush\u2019s attacks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In an epic rant on CNN Monday afternoon, Donald Trump went after former Florida govern", "title": "Trump's Tirade Suggests Jeb\u2019s Jabs Are Hitting the Mark", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/Trump-CNN-Tirade-Suggests-Jeb-s-Jabs-Are-Hitting-Mark", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/08/Trump-CNN-Tirade-Suggests-Jeb-s-Jabs-Are-Hitting-Mark", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_4.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In an epic rant on CNN Monday afternoon, Donald Trump went after former Florida govern", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) February 8, 2016The last line was a response to Trump\u2019s past criticism of the Arizona senator and 2008 GOP presidential nominee.\nMoments after the interview aired, CNN host Wolf Blitzer had Trump on the phone, and asked him to react to Bush.\nBut on CNN, Trump trotted out a new line of attack: The Bush family used eminent domain to secure some of the land for the home stadium of the Texas Rangers baseball team \u2014 once partly owned by Jeb\u2019s brother, former President George W.
