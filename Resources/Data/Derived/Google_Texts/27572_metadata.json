CMS said it will also add extra penalties for readmissions and failures tied to value-based purchasing.\n\nUnder the final rule, CMS will also enforce two payment rates for long-term hospitals, one standard rate and another site-neutral rate to be applied to services that don't meet criteria for the standard rate. As a result, CMS expects long-term care hospitals to see $250 million less in payments for the year. However, for the cases that do meet requirements for the standard rate, those payments will be 1.7 percent higher in 2016.\n\nAs for uncompensated care payments under the agency's Disproportionate Share Hospital regulations, CMS said it will distribute $6.4 billion to cover those expenses in 2016, $1.2 billion lower than 2015 due to the drop in the uninsured rate as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nCMS also plans to add seven new quality measurements to its Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program, four that will take effect in 2018 and three in 2019. It is also adjusting the program so that hospitals may choose to submit only four of the 28 electronic clinical quality measures in 2016 to be applied to 2018 payment rates.\n\nCMS will also expand its value-based purchasing program to include a measure for care coordination beginning in 2018 and a 30-day mortality measure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease beginning in 2021.\n\nLastly, the agency is softening its pneumonia readmission penalty to account for extraordinary circumstances like natural disasters. It also said it will continue to measure how socioeconomic differences across the country affect readmissions and is in the midst of a two-year trial to determine a risk adjustment based those factors.\n\nHere is the full rule:\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-lifts-inpatient-hospital-payment-rates-09-percent-beefs-value-based-payment-measures", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic-hospital-building-feature_7.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lift the rate it pays inpatient hospitals in 2016 by 0.9 percent, the agency announced Friday, as long as facilities participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program and demonstrate meaningful use through the use of electronic health", "title": "CMS lifts inpatient hospital payment rates by 0.9 percent, beefs up value-based payment measures"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic-hospital-building-feature_7.gif"}, "title": "CMS lifts inpatient hospital payment rates by 0.9 percent, beefs up value-based payment measures", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lift the rate it pays inpatient hospitals in 2016 by 0.9 percent, the agency announced Friday, as long as facilities participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program and demonstrate meaningful use through the use of electronic health", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lift the rate it pays inpatient hospitals in 2016 by 0.9 percent, the agency announced Friday, as long as facilities participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program and demonstrate meaningful use through the use of electronic health records.&#13; The new rate is a drop from the 1.1 percent hike proposed earlier this year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "CMS also plans to add seven new quality measurements to its Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program, four that will take effect in 2018 and three in 2019.\nAs a result, CMS expects long-term care hospitals to see $250 million less in payments for the year.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lift the rate it pays inpatient hospitals in 2016 by 0.9 percent, the agency announced Friday, as long as facilities participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program and demonstrate meaningful use through the use of electronic health records.\nThe final rule also bolsters CMS's plans to convert the way it pays hospitals from a fee-for-service to a value-based reimbursement model.\nCMS said it will also add extra penalties for readmissions and failures tied to value-based purchasing."}
