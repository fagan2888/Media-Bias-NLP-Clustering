Gusto, already processing annual payroll for over 30,000 businesses, is using technology to create an integrated payroll and benefits platform to bring efficiency and simplicity to an industry that\u2019s currently mired in paperwork, manual data entry, and errors.\n\n\u201cEmployers and employees rely on health insurance to protect themselves and their families. It doesn\u2019t make sense that choosing and managing such important benefits is so complicated, overwhelming and manual. I was shocked to learn that 60% of customers who transfer their existing health insurance coverage to Gusto arrive with legacy broker errors,\u201d said Joshua Reeves, CEO and co\u00adfounder of Gusto. \u201cOur benefits are entirely online and paperless. We combine the expertise of our brokers with proprietary software to automatically recommend the best plans for an employer\u2019s budget. It's like Kayak for health insurance.\u201d\n\nA recent survey of more than 500 small business owners across the U.S. found that over 70% of small businesses do not currently offer health insurance to employees, citing high costs and frustration with traditional brokers. The first solution of its kind, Gusto simplifies the process of selection and enrolling in benefits from start to finish. One of the unique advantages of Gusto\u2019s benefits offering is that it is seamlessly integrated with Gusto\u2019s payroll service. By analyzing key information including company location, number of employees and average employee salary, Gusto is the only benefits solution on the market that leverages data and technology to match businesses and their employees with health plans that are just right for their needs and budget.\n\n\u201cAs an employer, I take pride in taking care of my team \u2013 it\u2019s not just a responsibility, it\u2019s something I feel passionate about doing. Before Gusto, it was extremely difficult for a small business like mine to offer health benefits,\u201d said Charles Bililies, founder and CEO of San Francisco-based fine-casual restaurant Souvla. \u201cGusto gave me an incredibly easy way to provide a range of health plans to my employees and managers, which has helped us recruit talented individuals and keep everyone healthy and happy.\u201d\n\nWith Gusto\u2019s benefits offering, businesses can now:\n\nSave weeks of time: While traditional brokers take at least four weeks for an application submission, the vast majority of employers (79%) completed the entire selection process with Gusto in a few days. One customer completed the process in 26 minutes.\n\nWhile traditional brokers take at least four weeks for an application submission, the vast majority of employers (79%) completed the entire selection process with Gusto in a few days.
