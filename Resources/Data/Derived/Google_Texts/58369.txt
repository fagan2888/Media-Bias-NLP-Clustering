Although the halls of Meridian Public Schools are relatively quiet during summer break, one building on campus had voices reverberating, as MPSD Board Members were reflecting on the past year and the upcoming year. The meeting attended by all board members, the superintendent, and their attorney, was a training or refresher meeting on the role of the board.

"It's very important that board members know what their role is," MPSD Board President Marvis Killingsworth said. "In our case our role in regards to Meridian, not just in general; in Meridian and our community and the things we have to do."

The meeting is not only a training course, but a retreat meeting as MPSD Superintendent Dr. Alvin Taylor states.

"It's when the board gets together with the superintendent and the attorney," said Dr. Taylor. "We kind of revisit goals and direct us. The board makes decisions about what direction; they look at the direction in which the district is going."

A district that has seen success over the past few years, whether it be through academics or sports.

"Because of the board, the cohesiveness of the board and our relationship with the superintendent and our school board attorney, things are looking real good," said Killingsowrth. "We are making decisions based on our children and our children's future."

In addition to the role of the board, board members also discussed the expectations for the board attorney and the superintendent, along with goals for the upcoming school year, like safety.

"The main thing has been those last few years, safe and orderly schools," said Killingsworth. "We are going to have to have that. We are going to have to have a safe place for our students and a safe place for our teachers."

The board will meet Tuesday, June 30, 2015 for discussion of the 2015-2016 school year budget.
