Brandon Marshall, a Broncos starting inside linebacker, was headed to the airport but had a more important trip first. Asphalt disappearing under his car tires, Marshall turned down a street in West Las Vegas.\n\nThrough the most difficult times \u2014 the concern for his mother\u2019s safety, the anxiety about his own future \u2014 Marshall found solace at his granddad\u2019s home. Little Roy Williams, a World War II Navy veteran and master carpenter, had a way of putting people at ease. A man of faith and principle, Little created peace amid turbulence for young Brandon, let him know it was OK to dream.\n\n\u201cI always considered him the rock of our family,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cHe was the major father figure in my life. His home was everybody\u2019s safe house. You could get a good meal, good conversation, watch sports. Talking to him, it would just take my mind off a lot of things.\u201d\n\nMarshall always thought about his granddad. But this June day was different, the gravitational pull strong. He knew he had to visit, recognizing Little\u2019s advice could help him deal with the lingering pain and doubt caused by the Lisfranc surgery on his right foot. Little had been in and out of a hospital the last few months. He wasn\u2019t feeling well, though it never occurred to Marshall he wouldn\u2019t improve.\n\n\u201cI was there at his house with my cousin Anthony. He said, \u2018Anthony, you are a successful engineer. Brandon, you are in the NFL. I am proud of you,\u2019 \u201d recalled Marshall, hesitating. \u201cThen he actually cried. I was shocked. It was the first time in my life I had seen him cry. It was then that I understood the impact we had on each other. And when I knew something was really wrong.\u201d\n\nLittle Roy Williams died a few weeks later at age 88, passing away July 7 after contracting pneumonia following surgery. The family gathered at his bedside: Brandon, along with mother Barbara and his brother, Marcus. When you mention Little two months later, the memories tumble out. Little \u2014 he had an uncle named Big \u2014 sitting in his maroon chair in his Las Vegas living room, dressed in his Los Angeles Lakers cap and sweat shirt, talking to her boys. The breakfasts at Denny\u2019s in Reno following Brandon\u2019s games at the University of Nevada.\n\nA picture from one of those days is her favorite. One taken in a hospital remains the most poignant. Brandon is holding his granddad\u2019s hand in his final moments. \u201cIt means a lot to Brandon and I. It\u2019s very powerful,\u201d Barbara said.\n\n\u201cTribute \u2026 was beautiful\u201d\n\nLittle\u2019s absence hurts Brandon. It can be heard in his voice. He has dedicated this season to his granddad, and honored him with a tattoo on his chest reading \u201cWilliams 7-1826\u2014 7-7-15\u201d while depicting a hand holding a hammer about to pound a nail.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about it. He wanted to surprise me. When he sent me the picture, it brought me to tears,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cFor him to give him that tribute. \u2026 It was beautiful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Brandon to explain how much Little meant to him as he embarks on the most important season in his NFL career. Little was the one who explained things to him. He encouraged him to play sports. He rented a van for the family and drove Brandon off to college, where he started four seasons. He reminded him to keep his priorities straight. He taught him to be a man after Brandon and Marcus watched their father abuse Barbara, who courageously escaped to a shelter with her sons when they were 10 and 12, forging steps of hope that have led her to help victims of domestic violence.\n\n\u201cI was so fortunate my children had such a great man like that in their lives,\u201d said Barbara, whose son Marcus is a talented singer and songwriter. \u201cHe really taught them about respect and responsibility.\u201d\n\nThis season set up as a challenge before Little died. Marshall injured his right foot Dec. 14 at San Diego. He missed the final two games last season, then played sparingly in the playoff loss to the Colts. When the injury didn\u2019t heal, Marshall had surgery March 11. He will play this season with two screws in his foot, his recovery a month ahead of schedule as he starts Sunday\u2019s opener against the Ravens.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have control of what happens to me, but I have control over how I respond,\u201d said Marshall, echoing his granddad\u2019s advice. \u201cIt\u2019s going to nag at me. I have to work hard and rehab. I am still fighting these battles. It\u2019s painful. It\u2019s aggravating.\n\n\u201cBut you know what? I have to push through this for my team, myself and my family. I am on a mission to prove I can overcome a Lisfranc injury and have a great season.\u201d\n\nNo denying super dream\n\nIt never dawned on Broncos tight end Virgil Green that Marshall would not play again. They first met at Nevada when Marshall lived across the street. Green recognized Marshall, then an outside linebacker, had uncommon focus.\n\n\u201cHe was really mature, well beyond his years,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe trained a lot at the facility this offseason, and I just knew that somehow, someway Brandon would find a way to get back on the field.\u201d\n\nBarbara likes to joke the three of them \u2014 she, Brandon and Little \u2014 could be triplets. They have inner strength, quiet confidence, their values mirroring each other.\n\nHumility defines Marshall. He deflects praise, and talks about his team like it\u2019s his family.\n\nHe led the Broncos in tackles last season with 110, a rocket ride to prominence after the Jaguars cut him, forcing him to climb up from Denver\u2019s practice squad. The ascension began in 2013, a season he will forever remember because of Little.\n\nIt was after the third preseason game, and his granddad rang.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018Hey, Brandon I had a dream that you were playing in the Super Bowl. In the Super Bowl!\u2019 At first I got excited. I thought it was cool. But then I thought about where I was at,\u201d Marshall said with a smile. \u201cI said, \u2018Granddad, I am in Jacksonville, it might be a while.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, Brandon, I had the dream.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMarshall ended up in Denver. He was not an active player, at least not until Dec. 24, but his imagination ran wild.\n\n\u201cAs the season went on, I realized we had a great team. Then next thing I know we are in the Super Bowl,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cOne of my favorite memories is talking to him about that, and telling him he was right.\u201d\n\nSunday will be a transition for Marshall. As part of his game-day ritual, he called his granddad on his way to the stadium. It began in college. They were snapshots back to Marshall\u2019s youth when he hung out in Little\u2019s home and talked sports.\n\n\u201cIt was just great hearing his voice, you know?\u201d Marshall said.\n\nHe will call his mom Sunday. They will pray and give thanks.\n\n\u201cI had to be here for this game. It\u2019s going to be emotional,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cI am so used to talking to my dad during the games. We couldn\u2019t hear each other, but he wanted to know all the details. It\u2019s going to be tough. But it\u2019s good too. My dad\u2019s spirit lives on through Brandon.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
