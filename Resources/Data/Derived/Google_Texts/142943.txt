At Easter services on Sunday morning, the pastor of a historic Baptist church in Alexandria, Virginia, discouraged congregants from trying to take selfies with President Obama and instead “let the brother worship” in peace.

Mr. Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and the couple’s two daughters, Malia and Sasha, attended services at the Alfred Street Baptist Church.

The church’s pastor, the Rev. Howard-John Wesley, welcomed the first family to the service but admonished his congregation against snapping photos of the president.

“How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,” Mr. Wesley said. “This is not selfie time. Let the brother worship in the house of God.”

The first family last year attended Easter services at Washington’s 19th Street Baptist Church.

During the president’s time in office, the Obamas also have attended services at Washington National Cathedral, Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Vermont Avenue Baptist Church, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church, Shiloh Baptist Church and others, according to the White House.
