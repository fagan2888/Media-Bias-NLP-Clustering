Juel C. Burnette, III was recently named Branch Manager by 1st Tribal Lending for its Sioux Falls office.

The Pinole, California lending company is a division of Mid America Mortgage, Inc.

Burnette has focused on providing banking products, mortgage loans and banking industry education to tribal communities his entire career. For the past 15 years, the Rosebud Sioux member has been a leading advocate promoting the HUD Section 184 Indian Housing Loan Program as a Home Mortgage Sales Supervisor with Wells Fargo.

According to a 1st Tribal Lending press release, “Burnette’s years of expertise make him the perfect leader to launch our new branch office in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.”

"I have been fortunate to have served tribal nations and their people for the last 23 years at Wells Fargo, and I am excited to continue serving tribal nations in my new role as Branch Manager for 1st Tribal Lending," noted Mr. Burnette.

Also joining Mr. Burnette is Eric Sprenkle, a HUD 184 program originator for the last 13 years, Adam Hicks, a HUD 184 program originator for 11 years and Nate Schmidt, a HUD 184 program originator for 5 years according to the release.

All three specialists come over from Wells Fargo with a wealth of knowledge and experience while all being independently licensed in most states with large tribal populations.

The new branch will focus its initiative on serving tribal nations around the country in a more direct approach, something Burnette has always made his objective. “We believe that our tribal nations are under-served by the lending community and we would like to see that continue to change as we go forward in our new venture with 1st Tribal Lending.”
