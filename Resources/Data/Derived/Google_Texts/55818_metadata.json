When the IRS finalized this proposal in May 2012, it cited no authority for its decision to depart from the clear language of federal law.\n\nJonathan Adler and I were the first to criticize this decision in August 2011, and have continued to show how it is contrary to federal law and the PPACA\u2019s legislative history.\n\nToday, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \u2013 known as the second-highest court in the land \u2013 ruled in Halbig v. Burwell that the Obama administration is indeed imposing taxes and spending funds through those 36 federal Exchanges without statutory authority, and indeed contrary to the plain language of the PPACA.\n\nSimply put, the President is violating the law.\n\nUnlike other courts who have examined Halbig and related cases, the D.C. Circuit looked at the totality of the evidence, reached the only conclusion the law and the evidence permit, and struck down the IRS rule.\n\nThe court rejected the seemingly endless string of legal arguments the administration offered in defense of its actions. Despite those arguments, the court held, \u201cthe government offers no textual basis\u2026for concluding that a federally-established Exchange is, in fact or legal fiction, established by a state.\u201d As a result, the PPACA \u201cdoes not authorize the IRS to provide tax credits for insurance purchased on federal Exchanges\u201d and the Obama administration\u2019s decision to offer them anyway is not only unauthorized but \u201cgives the individual and employer mandates\u2026broader effect than they would have\u201d if the IRS followed the law.\n\nWhile the dissent was political, focusing on the plaintiff\u2019s motives, the opinion of the court was authored by Judge Thomas B. Griffith, whom the Washington Post has described as \u201cwidely respected by people in both parties, and those who have worked with him elsewhere regard him as a sober lawyer with an open mind. There is considerable reason to think he would make a fine judge.\u201d His nomination to the D.C. Circuit drew praise from prominent Democrats including Seth Waxman and David Kendall. Indeed, then-senator Barack Obama himself supported Griffith\u2019s nomination. Griffith noted that while the court\u2019s ruling could have a significant impact on the PPACA, \u201chigh as those stakes are, the principle of legislative supremacy that guides us is higher still.\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Circuit applied the law that Congress enacted. Any downstream effects of Halbig are the result of the PPACA itself, not today\u2019s ruling. If those effects are intolerable, then it is up to Congress to change the law, not the IRS. If Halbig results in people losing health-insurance subsidies, the blame lies with a president who recklessly offered millions of Americans tens of billions of dollars in subsidies he had no authority to offer, that could vanish with a single court ruling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Simply put, the President is violating the law.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Simply put, the President is violating the law.", "title": "Statement on D.C.
