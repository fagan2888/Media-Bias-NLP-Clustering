You have collected the endorsement of most of boston's top racial minorities. Can you argue that they cannot really bring those to the polls tackle what is your position on that -- votes to the polls. What is your position on that? They have been working the districts and working the neighborhoods and visiting senior centers on my behalf. I am happy with where our campaign is leading into the last couple of days. Truly bringing together one boston. Could they bring together the votes for themselves when they were running tackle -- when they were running? They believe in the same things we believe, make sure the education system is approved and closing the achievement gap. They have worked extremely half -- extremely hard. Let's move to casinos. You say if you lived in east boston, you would vote for it. Can you say you are confident that a casino can be trouble- free? Caesar's was forced to drop out because of problems and controversy. The reason why the issue was found out is the way the legislation was put together. The commission followed all of the appropriate stepso make sure there was a good provider.

I hope they will do a stronger background themselves to make sure they pick the right partner. With caesar's out of the picture, is it harder for the people of eastern -- east boston to make a decision? That might be an issue. That is something the voters will figure out. The mayor has seen -- has said complementary things about john connolly. Does his profile give you pause? I have people supporting my candidacy who were supportive of the mayor. The mayor has stayed out of this race. The mayor does not do anything halfhearted. He is a resident of the city of boston. He is a voter. We have knocked on his door and asked him for his vote. I will make sure I asked him again for his vote. It is one of those things. People make decisions and move however they want to move. I am proud of the money my campaign has raised. We have raised $2.5 million. We have 8000 different owners. I have contributions of $10 from people. A woman gave me a check for $10. Her note was, I need you to get elected. She was a nun. I have carried that note around in my pocket for the last several months. I view that as something special. Same thing happened when I was running for state rep. A woman gave me a $10 bill and i still have it. You have suggested big changes at the bra. Is that why some of the money has been going to john connolly at the -- john connolly?
