One of America\u2019s greatest strengths is our free market. A thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy \u2013 it\u2019s how we create jobs, expand opportunities, and give everybody a shot at success. It\u2019s what has made America the strongest country on Earth.\n\nThe most essential ingredient in a healthy free market is competition. But right now, too many companies are engaging in behaviors that stifle competition \u2013 like blocking new competitors from entering the market or limiting the information and options that give consumers real choice. As a consequence, the rest of us pay higher prices for lower quality products and services. Workers receive lower wages than they otherwise would. Small businesses and entrepreneurs can get squeezed out of the market. And none of that is fair \u2013 or good for our economy.\n\nThe deck should not be stacked in favor of the wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations, against working Americans. That\u2019s why my administration is doing everything we can to reverse this trend and promote more competition in the marketplace. In addition to enforcing the rules on the books, I\u2019ve directed federal agencies to identify anti-competitive behavior in different industries, and find new and specific ways to promote competition.\n\nOne industry that\u2019s ripe for change is cable TV. Right now, 99 percent of cable and satellite TV customers rent set-top boxes from their providers. According to one survey, this costs households an average of more than $230 per year. We spend some $20 billion to rent these devices. While we have almost unlimited choice in what we watch on television, from traditional programming to online content, there\u2019s next to no competition to build a better, user-friendly product that allows you to easily access all this content in one place. So most consumers just rent whatever the cable company offers. Because we have to. That means companies have little incentive to innovate. As a consequence, we need multiple devices and controllers to access content from different sources. That makes no sense.\n\nSo my administration has encouraged the FCC to remove the barriers to competition that prevent new players from offering innovative cable box options to consumers.\n\nWe know this works. For years, Americans had to rent our telephones from the phone company. This was a while ago, but when the FCC finally unlocked competition for home phones, the marketplace was flooded with all kinds of phone options with new features, and at different price points. Consumers suddenly had many options. And the whole industry moved forward as a result. The same can happen with cable boxes, and in dozens of areas of our economy \u2013 all of which can make a difference in your everyday life.\n\nThe bottom line is, competition is good for consumers, workers, businesses, and our economy. So I\u2019m going to keep doing everything I can to make sure that our free market works for everyone. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Touts FCC Cable Box Plan, 'Private Sector Is the Lifeblood of Our Economy,' 'Competition Is Good'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Touts FCC Cable Box Plan, 'Private Sector Is the Lifeblood of Our Economy,' 'Competition Is Good'", "title": "Obama Touts FCC Cable Box Plan, 'Private Sector Is the Lifeblood of Our Economy,' 'Competition Is Good' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Obama-416-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/04/16/obama-touts-fcc-cable-box-plan-private-sector-is-the-lifeblood-of-our-economy-competition-is-good/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Touts FCC Cable Box Plan, 'Private Sector Is the Lifeblood of Our Economy,' 'Competition Is Good'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Obama-416-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Obama Touts FCC Cable Box Plan, 'Private Sector Is the Lifeblood of Our Economy,' 'Competition Is Good' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, FCC, President Obama,Breitbart TV, Obama,cable", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2016-04-16T06:40:06-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5bbf\"", "article_summary": "So I\u2019m going to keep doing everything I can to make sure that our free market works for everyone.\nThe bottom line is, competition is good for consumers, workers, businesses, and our economy.\nThe most essential ingredient in a healthy free market is competition.\nOne of America\u2019s greatest strengths is our free market.\nSo my administration has encouraged the FCC to remove the barriers to competition that prevent new players from offering innovative cable box options to consumers."}
