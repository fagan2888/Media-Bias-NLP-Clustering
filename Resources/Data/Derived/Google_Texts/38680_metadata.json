The Massachusetts resident credits the blockbuster films based on \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d trilogy of novels for opening the floodgates and showing that family-friendly movies don\u2019t have to be so \u201cPollyanna.\u201d\n\nNow playing in theaters nationwide, \u201cThe Giver\u201d is about a seemingly perfect Community where the elders have eradicated pain and suffering from daily life. Community roles such as \u201cnurtures\u201d and \u201cpilots\u201d are assigned, family units are limited to two children, and imperfect babies are discarded.\n\nAlso missing are memories, music, and love.\n\n>>> Commentary: \u2018The Giver\u2019 Shows the Consequences of Big Government Domination\n\nJonas, a youth played by Brenton Thwaites, is chosen to be the Community\u2019s next Receiver of Memory, burdening him with the responsibility of learning harsher realities. Jeff Bridges is cast as the current holder of that title, who then becomes the Giver in transferring memories to Jonas.\n\nFellow Oscar winner Meryl Streep plays the Chief Elder and country-pop star Taylor Swift appears as Rosemary, who receives a special honor.\n\nWith flashbacks to such poignant real-world images as \u201cthe Tank Man\u201d from China\u2019s Tiananmen Square, director Phillip Noyce signals to his audience that this dystopia isn\u2019t so far away.\n\nFlaherty, who has produced more than 30 films, argues that \u201cThe Giver\u201d transcends politics, although he readily admits it has a clear message: Individual freedom beats safety and security.\n\nIn this Q&A with The Daily Signal, he talks about what it took to turn \u201cThe Giver\u201d into a box office contender.\n\nThe Daily Signal: How did Lois Lowry think up such a fascinating concept for the original novel?\n\nFlaherty: The backstory is amazing. Her father had Alzheimer\u2019s, and she realized that a lot of the painful memories from his past were gone. It made her think: What would a world look like where people didn\u2019t have painful memories \u2013 would that be good, would that be bad? She just took it from there.\n\nQ: \u201cThe Giver\u201d is cherished as a classic novel for young adults. Why did it take almost 20 years to be made into a movie?\n\nA: Nobody could figure it out \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a candy, it wasn\u2019t a mint \u2026 it defied easy categorization. There are plenty of bean counters in Hollywood and they just look at all the different columns, and they didn\u2019t know what column to fit this into, so they just all went running.\n\nQ: What turned the tide?\n\nA: Harvey Weinstein [the movie producer and studio executive] stepped up; it was his daughter\u2019s favorite book. And once we had \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d numbers to point to, Hollywood is such a follow-the-leader business, so it became a little bit easier. But luckily, since the Weinstein Company is its own distributor, we could control our own destiny.\n\nQ: What exactly did \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d do to help?\n\nA: It showed people that you could have a family-friendly movie that wasn\u2019t so \u201cPollyanna\u201d \u2014 that you could have a movie with a lot of intensity, a lot of action, a lot of life-or-death stakes, and still have the family enjoy it.\n\nQ: Why do you consider \u201cThe Giver\u201d the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of Walden Media?\n\nA: What I love is just that whole idea that all it takes is one person armed with courage and faith, and they can change the world. You see that in this film with the [images of] Tank Man from Tiananmen, Nelson Mandela \u2013 it shows a lot of other people who peacefully took on some of the greatest military powers in the world.\n\nQ: What made you decide to include historical figures?\n\nA: My best friend was the supreme commander at Tiananmen Square. I\u2019m on her board to try to abolish the one-child policy in China, which in some instances now is the two-child policy \u2013 which is what we have in \u201cThe Giver.\u201d\n\nIn China, they\u2019ve completely eliminated any reference to Tiananmen in their history books. So I thought it was fitting that in this totalitarian regime, any memory of Tiananmen was gone for all but one person, just as it is in China now. Except it\u2019s happening with much faster speed in China, in terms of the erasing of history.\n\nQ: Does \u201cThe Giver\u201d have political messages?\n\nA: I don\u2019t see a political side to any of the virtues, but all of the great cardinal virtues are on display. C.S. Lewis talks about the road to hell being paved with good intentions. And what\u2019s amazing about this Community is it\u2019s clear that they didn\u2019t wake up one morning and have everything [depicted] here. People surrendered their liberty inch by inch by inch, until they woke up and realized that they had surrendered everything.\n\nQ: Bill and Hillary Clinton were among those at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s exclusive screening of \u201cThe Giver.\u201d Do you think they appreciated the themes?\n\nA: It transcends politics because it gets people away from ideology to just ask the basic questions of the trade-off between security and liberty. And also the thing I think that the left and the right are starting to unite on is \u2026 people telling us what size soda we can drink, what type of flour and sugar can be in our cookies, and that kind of government overreach. I think folks on the left and the right can agree that it\u2019s gone too far.\n\nQ: Why did Taylor Swift get involved?\n\nA: She loved the book, and there\u2019s a beautiful section about the first time Jonas hears music. She\u2019s a very thoughtful, intellectual person, and I think she loved the idea of people coming into contact with all these different firsts \u2013 their first time falling in love, first time experiencing music, first time experiencing color.\n\nAlso the role was perfect for her \u2013 we didn\u2019t have to \u201cTaylor\u201d it. There was a role for a brilliant, thoughtful piano player, so the first person who pops into mind is Taylor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Film producer Michael Flaherty talks with The Daily Signal about individual liberty in \"The Giver,\" which stars Jeff Bridges, Maryl Streep and Taylor Swift.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Film producer Michael Flaherty talks with The Daily Signal about individual liberty in \"The Giver,\" which stars Jeff Bridges, Maryl Streep and Taylor Swift.", "title": "Q&A: Meryl, Taylor, Government Overreach, and 'The Giver'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140814_GiverValues_Harkness.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-17T14:07:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/YimCiN"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Film producer Michael Flaherty talks with The Daily Signal about individual liberty in \"The Giver,\" which stars Jeff Bridges, Maryl Streep and Taylor Swift.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140814_GiverValues_Harkness.jpg"}, "title": "Q&A: Meryl, Taylor, Government Overreach, and 'The Giver'", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "government overreach,individual freedom,media", "published_time": "2014-08-17T03:01:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-17T14:07:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "The Giver, Walden Media, Lois Lowry, Michael Flaherty, meryl streep, jeff bridges, nelson mandela"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4a4\"", "article_summary": "Fellow Oscar winner Meryl Streep plays the Chief Elder and country-pop star Taylor Swift appears as Rosemary, who receives a special honor.\nJeff Bridges is cast as the current holder of that title, who then becomes the Giver in transferring memories to Jonas.\nThere was a role for a brilliant, thoughtful piano player, so the first person who pops into mind is Taylor.\nIn this Q&A with The Daily Signal, he talks about what it took to turn \u201cThe Giver\u201d into a box office contender.\nQ: Bill and Hillary Clinton were among those at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s exclusive screening of \u201cThe Giver.\u201d Do you think they appreciated the themes?"}
