According to the affidavit, the two girls were in the bathroom when they looked out the window and saw Jenkins shining a light on the front of his body and touching his genital area.\n\nPolice said the family also reported another incident on April 20. According to the father, he observed Jenkins masturbating from a downstairs window. He said the blinds were open, but Jenkins normally keeps them down and closed. The father told police when Jenkins spotted him at the window, Jenkins stood up and walked off. The 17-year-old daughter said she also saw Jenkins masturbating from their upstairs bathroom window, the same day her father saw him.\n\nThe mother and father told police they saw Jenkins committing a similar lewd act on May 6.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Jenkins was convicted of Peeping Tom and received a one-year suspended sentence in December 2013 for watching a 54-year-old woman, who was in her residence. Police said Jenkins admitted the woman was in her underwear.\n\nThe affidavit also states Jenkins was convicted of Stalking in June 2010 after he approached his female neighbor at her residence on four occasions, left a rose and letter saying he wanted to be with her, told her he knew her work schedule, when she's home or not and she could walk around naked if she wanted because he could see her. The female told police she saw Jenkins on her patio attempting to look inside her home. She also said she would walk outside and find Jenkins standing in his yard, staring at her.\n\nAnother incident listed in the affidavit states Jenkins was banned from Borders Bookstore on June 25, 2009 after the employees received complaints of him approaching children in the store. Police said Jenkins asked a 14-year-old girl for an email address and told an 8-year-old girl she was pretty. Then on June 26, 2009, police spoke with a witness at a Barnes and Noble. The witness told police Jenkins would sit alone in the children's book area and watch the children ages four to 10 years old.\n\nJenkins is being held in the Oklahoma County Jail on $200,000 bond for each count.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma City police arrested a man who officials say has been reported several times for indecent exposure and other lewd acts over the last five years.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25599688/okc-man-charged-with-three-counts-of-indecent-exposure", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25599688_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma City police arrested a man who officials say has been reported several times for indecent exposure and other lewd acts over the last five years.", "title": "OKC Man Charged With Three Counts Of Indecent Exposure"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25599688_SA.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma City police arrested a man who officials say has been reported several times for indecent exposure and other lewd acts over the last five years.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Man Charged With Three Counts Of Indecent Exposure"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-man-charged-with-three-counts-of-indecent-exposure", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/05/23", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media, charged, three, counts, indecent, exposure, lewd, acts, jeffery, jenkins, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS30", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media, charged, three, counts, indecent, exposure, lewd, acts, jeffery, jenkins, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcf1\"", "article_summary": "The 17-year-old daughter said she also saw Jenkins masturbating from their upstairs bathroom window, the same day her father saw him.\nThe father told police when Jenkins spotted him at the window, Jenkins stood up and walked off.\nThe mother and father told police they saw Jenkins committing a similar lewd act on May 6.\nJeffery Lorne Jenkins, 51, was booked into the Oklahoma County Jail early Friday morning on three counts of Indecent Exposure.\nThe female told police she saw Jenkins on her patio attempting to look inside her home."}
