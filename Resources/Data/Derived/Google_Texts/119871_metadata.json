Richard Burr of North Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah along with GOP Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan have put together a replacement for ObamaCare. And while neither their supporters nor detractors are likely to admit it, the plan bears a striking resemblance to, well, ObamaCare.\n\nHealth-care markets present a particular set of problems, with a limited range of possible solutions. So all realistic proposals for reform are going to have some basic structural similarities. The differences arise in what policymakers prioritize within those bounds.\n\nThat's what really divides the left from the right on this issue. And that's the reason Republicans seem perpetually doomed to keep offering replacements for ObamaCare that are basically suckier versions of ObamaCare.\n\nFirst, you need to get costs under control. You can do that with single-payer, all-payer rate setting, or by creating functional market competition between insurance providers. The first two options mean increasing government involvement, and the GOP won\u2019t go there. And with ObamaCare, the Democrats actually picked option three as well. So the differences between ObamaCare and Burr-Hatch-Upton are limited to how they create that market.\n\nAccording to Avik Roy, Burr-Hatch-Upton would \u201cremove federal barriers\u201d to selling and buying insurance across state lines. That moves us toward one national market in health insurance rather than 50 state-sized markets, which ostensibly means more competition and lower premiums. The downside is it turns the market into the Wild West; every state would be under pressure to offer the most lenient, skimpy, provider-friendly regulations they could to attract business, and insurers would cluster toward whatever state wins that race to the bottom. Good for insurance providers, bad for consumers.\n\nThe obvious win-win solution here \u2014 one national market and sound regulation \u2014 is to move the regulations from the state to the federal level. The original House version of ObamaCare did that by creating one national exchange, and if Republicans were smart, they'd be trying get us back there.\n\nNext, you have to decide what to do with Americans who are high health risks and who have pre-existing conditions. ObamaCare simply outlaws denying consumers coverage due to pre-existing conditions, and this is what necessitates the infamous individual mandate. Insurers can\u2019t keep sick people out of their risk pools, so their costs go up. Forcing all healthy Americans to enter the risk pools and buy coverage balances out the insurers\u2019 finances.\n\nBurr-Hatch-Upton does away with the mandate, and instead forbids insurers from considering pre-existing conditions as long as consumers keep themselves continuously covered by one plan or another. But if anyone lets their coverage lapse, insurers could again factor in their pre-existing conditions when deciding what to charge them or whether to offer them coverage.\n\nSo what if we had another big recession, and lots of people lost their jobs unexpectedly? They might not be able to afford any plan that covered their condition. And they\u2019d be toast.\n\nThis is one of those funny instances where ideology completely overwhelms practical sense. The fees ObamaCare's mandate charges for noncompliance are relatively mild. But the consequences of not staying covered under this GOP alternative are potentially ruinous. Burr-Hatch-Upton may not have a \u201cmandate,\u201d per se. But the stick it would threaten Americans with if they don\u2019t buy health care is actually far bigger and scarier than the stick ObamaCare is wielding.\n\nNow, Burr-Hatch-Upton does try to provide a backstop by setting up high-risk pools \u2014 separate streams of subsidies that go to Americans with pre-existing conditions or whatnot. The problem is that high-risk pools have been tried before and they\u2019ve always been significantly underfunded.\n\nBy quarantining the high-risk population from everyday consumers, you make it much easier to leave the former group in the lurch. If policymakers just don\u2019t feel like adequately funding the high-risk pools, the people in them will be screwed. Everyone else will be held harmless.\n\nIn contrast, ObamaCare's subsidies for high-risk Americans are the subsidies for healthy Americans. Everyone\u2019s in the same pool, so healthy consumers do face higher premiums. But policymakers also can\u2019t pick and choose how much money to pump into subsidies for one group versus the other. They can only help all Americans more, or help all Americans less.\n\nFinally, the last piece of health-care reform is providing those subsidies, so people can afford the coverage they have to buy. The decisive factor here is how much the parties are willing to spend. ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies are more generous, extend higher up the income ladder, and go up and down along with premiums. Burr-Hatch-Upton's subsidies are less generous, don't go as high, and aren\u2019t pegged to premiums.\n\nGiven that ObamaCare\u2019s subsides are themselves too low, Burr-Hatch-Upton is definitely moving in the wrong direction on that one.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019ve probably noticed a pattern. Every time Burr-Hatch-Upton diverges from ObamaCare, it\u2019s trying to keep costs as low as possible for healthy and younger Americans, keep government spending down, and keep the regulatory burden off insurers. The trade-off is it takes considerably greater risks with sicker, older, and poorer Americans.\n\nObamaCare offers the sicker, older, and poorer considerably greater protection, at the cost of higher premiums for everyone, more government spending, and more regulations.\n\nThis is where health-care reform really does become a test of values. Which Americans are you most concerned with protecting, and which are you most willing to pile more burdens on? It\u2019s an inescapably moral question.
