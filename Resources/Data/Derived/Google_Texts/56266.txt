Regarding David Ignatius’s Sept. 4 Washington Forum column, “What is Netanyahu’s next move?”:

Our impending pact with Iran should be passed, and simultaneously the United States should safeguard it by supplying Israel with our most advanced “bunker busting” bomb technology.

Many people fear that if we lift the trade sanctions and vastly enrich Iran’s coffers, the funds will not be used for peaceful purposes and Iran will secretly resume development of its atomic capability. Some advocates for the agreement argue that the United States would have the capacity to detect treaty violation and resume trade sanctions as a deterrent.

A much more effective deterrent would be to supply Israel with the capability to immediately destroy atomic facilities. The Israelis have every reason to fear and mistrust a country that vows to carry out Israel’s ultimate destruction and funds its terrorist enemies.
