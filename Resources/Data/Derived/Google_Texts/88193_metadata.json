REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n3889729\n\nPresident Barack Obama told NBC News today that he\u2019s tried to keep his rhetoric calm during the budget impasse over Obamacare, but then urged Wall Street to worry over the partial shutdown of some government spending.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of my presidency I have bent over backwards to work with the Republican Party and have purposely kept my rhetoric down,\u201d insisted the president, who is meeting Wednesday evening with congressional leaders for the first time since the shutdown struggle started.\n\nObama, however, immediately contradicted his claim by suggesting that the GOP\u2019s popular opposition to his health-care takeover \u2014 which passed on a party line vote during a heated fight after midnight on a weekend in 2010 \u2014 threatens Wall Street\u2019s financial leaders.\n\n\u201cI think they should be concerned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI had a chance to speak to some of the financial industry who came down for their typical trip [to the White House] and I told them it is not unusual for Democrats and Republicans to disagree\u2026 but when you have a situation in which a faction is willing potentially to default on U.S. government obligations, then we are in trouble, and if they\u2019re wiling to do it now, they\u2019ll [also] be willing to do it later,\u201d he told NBC.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m pretty well known for being a calm guy \u2014 sometimes too calm,\u201d Obama said.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, Obama and his aides and Democratic allies have accused the Republican legislators of being anarchists, suicide-bombers, hostage-takers, arsonists, political terrorists, fanatics, blackmailers, and ideological crusaders.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re not for is negotiating with people with a bomb strapped to their chest,\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, Obama\u2019s top media adviser, said in a CNN interview this week.\n\nRepublicans \u201chave shut down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans,\u201d Obama told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe crisis will end \u201cwhen Republicans realize they don\u2019t get to hold the entire economy hostage over ideological demands,\u201d Obama told the reporters gathered in the White House\u2019s briefing room.\n\nUnless the White House agrees to \u201cgut\u201d health care, Obama said in his weekly address Saturday, Republicans will \u201cpush the button, throwing America into default for the first time in history and risk throwing us back into recession.\u201d\n\nOpponents of his Obamacare network \u201chave made such a big political issue out of this, trying to scare everybody with lies about \u2018death panels\u2019 and \u2018killing granny,\u2019 he said in a speech last week to cheering supporters in Maryland.\n\nRepublicans favor \u201cshutting down the government just because you don\u2019t like a law\u2026 no Congress before this one has ever \u2013 ever \u2014 in history been irresponsible enough to threaten default\u2026 [and they are trying] to blackmail a President,\u201d Obama told his acolytes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to submit to this kind of total irresponsibility,\u201d he declared, before ending his speech, \u201cGod bless the United States of America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Hysterical,
