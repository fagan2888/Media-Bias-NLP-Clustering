No appointments necessary.\n\nSANTA CRUZ >> Many Americans might scratch their heads more than usual during this tougher tax season. It\u2019s the first year the uninsured could face penalties under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll will need to take some action related to the health care law. It could be as easy as declaring whether or not a filer had health insurance in 2014.\n\nHowever, many taxpayers may find the process much more complicated. To help, tax firm H&R Block Inc. is opening its offices Thursday and answering questions about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on taxes this season for free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big change. There\u2019s no doubt about it. It\u2019s the biggest change we\u2019ve seen in two decades,\u201d said Sue Ellen Smith, a tax specialist with H&R Block in San Francisco. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act made 46 changes to the tax code.\u201d\n\nThe reform act requires most Americans to have had health insurance last year and gave help covering the cost for those who qualified.\n\nSome may have to pay a levy for not being covered, so their refunds might be smaller than they thought.\n\nMany believed that they would only have to pay a paltry penalty of $95, but that\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cThe penalty is whichever is greater: 1 percent of your household income or $95 per person in your household,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAnd the penalties will increase year to year. Next year, the uninsured can expect to pay 2 percent of their income or $325 per person.\n\nAbout half of the nearly 6.8 million of Americans who used subsidies to make the insurance more affordable may have to pay back some money, estimated H&R Block. The Advance Premium Tax Credit was based on expected earnings in 2014. Those who earned more would need to return part of the subsidy. Those who earned less may receive a larger refund.\n\nThis might surprise to about two out of three filers, according to an H&R Block survey in October. About the same number of respondents said that they did not know receiving the tax credit might change their refund when filing this year.\n\n\u201cThis is all brand new. This is all uncharted territory,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere are new forms and possible reconciliations.\u201d\n\nFrom 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday, H&R Block\u2019s tax preparers are giving free advice and handing out information sheets that spell out penalties and eligibilities for exemptions. No appointment is necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf You Go\n\nWhat: Tax firm H&R Block is offering free advice about how the Affordable Care Act and new health insurance options may affect taxes.\n\nWhere: H&R Block tax offices.\n\n\u2022 Santa Cruz: 724 Water St. and 1804 Mission St.\n\n\u2022 Scotts Valley: 237 Mount Hermon Road #B\n\n\u2022 Capitola: 1850 41st Ave.\n\n\u2022 Watsonville: 1842 Main St.\n\nWhen: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday.
