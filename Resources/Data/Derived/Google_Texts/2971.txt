Brookings, SD

The 76th meeting between the Coyote and Jackrabbit women was as entertaining as advertised. USD was unable to clinch the top spot in the Summit League, making for an interesting final week of the regular season.

Jackrabbit senior Megan Waytashek didn't play in her team's 82-78 loss in Vermillion a month ago. She made up for it in round two by scoring 18 points propelling SDSU to a 77-67 win in Brookings.

"It was definitely hard for me to sit there and watch that game from my computer, but it was fun to be back with my teammates and help us get the win," Waytashek said.

The Jackrabbits were also paced by freshman Macy Miller. She followed up her 25 point outing in the Dakota Dome by collecting her first career double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds at home. Needless to say USD Head Coach Amy Williams wasn't surprised.

"No shocker. She handles herself with such poise and it is uncharacteristic of a freshman. She is a tremendous player that we are going to find a way to deal with over the next three and a half years," Williams said.

The Jackrabbits are currently in second place behind the Coyotes in the Summit League standings. With two games remaining, Miller believes that this win against their rivals puts them in a good position.

"This really helps us moving forward. We are building momentum and just from this game our defense is playing really well. I feel like this is going to push us the next two games and we're going to play our best basketball." Miller said.

Nicole Seekamp led USD with 18 points in the loss. She knows her team still controls their own destiny with a one game lead over SDSU. The only question now is can these Coyotes handle being the leader of the pack, rather than chasing the Rabbits.

"We're not really trying to think about that. If it happens it happens. We don't want to put that much pressure on ourselves thinking about that. The last couple of years we haven't had a title to go for and we still did well, so I think we are going to be fine," Seekamp said.

Both the Jackrabbit and Coyote women will finish the regular season with two home games with a lot in common. They are both this Thursday and Saturday and each team will play IUPUI and Western Illinois.
