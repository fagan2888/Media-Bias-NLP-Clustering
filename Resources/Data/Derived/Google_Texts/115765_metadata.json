He attended Immaculate Conception School from first through twelfth grade. He is buried near his parents in the town cemetery.\n\nSo it\u2019s only fitting that for its 25th anniversary, the Lebeau Zydeco Festival honored the native son behind the music\u2019s only million-seller, \u201c(Don\u2019t Mess With) My Toot Toot.\u201d With its danceable groove and open-to interpretation lyrics, that record became an international hit 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be proud that people here remember him,\u201d said Franklin Simien, one of Rockin\u2019 Sidney\u2019s 12 brothers and sisters and a former bandmate.\n\nRemember him they did. The first song from the first band to perform, Geno Delafose and French Rockin\u2019 Boogie, was a cover of Simien\u2019s \u201cJalape\u00f1o Lena.\u201d Just as it did when it was new, the number drew eager dancers to the floor steps away from Immaculate Conception Catholic Church.\n\nSidney Simien started pleasing crowds as a child. \u201cWhen I was in first grade, we used to have little dances,\u201d recalled John Rideau of Lebeau. For a dime or a quarter, \u201che played on the stage in the (Immaculate Conception) gym, so we could raise a few dollars for the things we needed.\u201d\n\nHe was reluctant at first to admit he wanted to make a living in music, his sister Majesta Simien LeDee said. When an elementary school teacher asked his classmates what they wanted to do when they grew up, little Sidney was so embarrassed the teacher asked him to tell her in the hallway out of earshot from the other children.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be a singing cowboy,\u201d like Herb Jeffries, the \u201cBronze Buckaroo\u201d of Saturday afternoon movie matinees, LeDee said. For that to happen, the teacher recognized that the child would need music lessons.\n\nEventually, a priest who charged other students for piano lessons taught Sidney Simien for free, his sister said.\n\nThe family didn\u2019t have much money. The Simiens planted and harvested cotton, and Sidney lagged behind. \u201cHe was always in the field making his songs,\u201d LeDee said. \u201cHe\u2019d go in the barn to be in his little private place to make his songs.\u201d\n\nAnother sister, Mildred Simien LeDee, recalled her brother as \u201ca dreamer. Dreaming about (how) he would get away and make a living playing music.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d also entertain his nine sisters and three brothers with jokes, stories and funny drawings, the sisters said.\n\nSimien started his musical career performing rhythm and blues. He switched from piano and organ during the 1970s as zydeco music gained popularity, and for awhile he worked into his act impersonations of Stanley \u201cBuckwheat\u201d Dural and Clifton Chenier.\n\nHis biggest success came from an album he recorded in his home, playing all the instruments and performing the vocals. After the single attracted attention in Louisiana and Texas, the Epic record label promoted it on country stations.\n\nThere it stayed on the Top 40 for 18 weeks, became a certified platinum hit and won a Grammy Award.\n\nAlthough he never again scored a hit as big, Simien reveled in the one he\u2019d made and stayed active on the scene until throat cancer ended his life in 1998. He was 59 years old.\n\nMajesta LeDee carried from her home in New Iberia a vanload of display boards, portraits, scrapbooks and vinyl record jackets to show the Lebeau festival crowd Saturday. That crowd also included alumni at a reunion for the classes of 1963, \u201864 and \u201865 of Immaculate Conception and Phyllis Wheatley high schools, now closed.\n\n\u201cI think he would really feel honored\u201d that the event honored him, LeDee said. \u201cHe tried for so long to be successful. I prayed for him every day.\n\n\u201cI think God finally answered my prayers and his hard work.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/07/04/lebeau-fest-rocks-honor-native-son/29710571/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "25th annual Lebeau Zydeco Festival is a fundraiser for Immaculate Conception Catholic Church", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "25th annual Lebeau Zydeco Festival is a fundraiser for Immaculate Conception Catholic Church", "title": "Lebeau fest rocks in honor of a native son", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/07/04/lebeau-fest-rocks-honor-native-son/29710571/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "25th annual Lebeau Zydeco Festival is a fundraiser for Immaculate Conception Catholic Church", "title": "Lebeau fest rocks in honor of a native son", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffbcd75ac94fa362e7f1792ef61e293090eeac67/c=519-0-1881-1362&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/04/Opelousas/B9317668564Z.1_20150704163218_000_GIGB8PV2V.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3247\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Dancers celebrate the Fourth of July with Geno Delafose and French Rockin' Boogie at the 25th annual Lebeau Zydeco Festival.\nEventually, a priest who charged other students for piano lessons taught Sidney Simien for free, his sister said.\n(Photo: Freddie Herpin, Daily World)Buy PhotoRockin\u2019 Sidney Simien was born in Lebeau.\nHe attended Immaculate Conception School from first through twelfth grade.\n\u201cHe\u2019d go in the barn to be in his little private place to make his songs.\u201dAnother sister, Mildred Simien LeDee, recalled her brother as \u201ca dreamer."}
