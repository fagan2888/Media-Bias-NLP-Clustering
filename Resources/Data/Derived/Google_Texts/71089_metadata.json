These debates allow students to interact with their counterparts across the nation and world through live-stream communication.\n\nThe Atlas Week debate, similar to current debates in Congress, media and courts across the country, compared two sides of a difficult ethical dilemma that the United States faces today.\n\nIn the style of parliamentary debate, the motion of the evening asserted, \u201ca single-payer government-based health insurance system allows greater benefits for citizens than does a private-payer employer-based healthcare system.\u201d SLU\u2019s debaters were assigned with supporting the single-payer system, while UNE\u2019s debaters were assigned to support a privatized healthcare system.\n\nThe SLU and UNE teams agreed that healthcare is a right, but UNE provided evidence that the current US healthcare system simply needs to be updated, and not changed to a completely new model. De Lorimier, a freshman at SLU, emphasized for his team that in \u201ca world that is increasingly emphasizing equality for all, there is not healthcare available to everyone.\u201d\n\nIn short, where is the \u201ccare\u201d part of healthcare today? De Lorimier continued to argue that the Affordable Care Act should not be abolished or amended, but should be extended. Japan, Vermont, Canada and Spain were examples of healthcare systems compared to the United States\u2019 throughout the night.\n\nThe students participating in the debate had a common background in the study of healthcare systems, thus the discussion of how to best support the welfare of healthcare systems from a business and economic perspective was central to the arguments of both sides.\n\nSLU cited the statistic of annual healthcare spending of the United States in 2015, $3.8 trillion, to demonstrate that healthcare costs are rising out of control.\n\nUNE\u2019s support of the current privatization of healthcare examined the far-flung ideals of a single-payer system, such as presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u2019 healthcare plan, and sought to predict its downfalls. Matt Devine from UNE cited an Emory University study that found a more realistic view of Bernie Sander\u2019s healthcare plan.\n\nThe current plan, which sets taxes at 8.4 percent for healthcare for all citizens, would in reality need to set taxes near 20 percent to cover all of the funds needed.\n\n\u201cMedicare and Medicaid are biggest drivers of the nation\u2019s debt,\u201d Devine explained, \u201cour own \u2018affordable\u2019 care act is what is killing our own economy.\u201d\n\nAnother major point of dispute in the debate was what statistics are good representations of the US population and are comparable to Americans\u2019 healthcare needs.\n\nWith every point UNE gave, SLU found an argument to refute it. UNE compared the US to Canada\u2019s single-payer system to point out its downfalls, but SLU\u2019s Meigs wanted to bring the debate within American borders.\n\nFollowing suit, UNE then attempted to use the example of Vermont\u2019s state-wide attempt at single-payer healthcare to illustrate how it would not succeed at the national level. Debater Hannon from SLU pointed out that the population of Vermont, of all states, does not represent the demographics of America.\n\nA common misconception cleared up by Hannon was that a single-payer system is not the same as socialized healthcare, thus there is no affect on quality of care. Often, critics of a single-payer system do not actually know what it means.\n\nSocialized healthcare involves the government managing and owning all aspects of the system, but the single-payer model simply means that healthcare is available to all citizens thanks to tax dollars that allow for government funding to provide insurance coverage.\n\nTo conclude the night, Dr. Breitbach, SLU\u2019s Athletic Training program director, who judged the debate, acknowledged the SLU debate team for their great performance that was full of statistics and studies to back up their arguments. Meigs and Devine were also commended for receiving the top scores for their speeches.\n\nLearning that $24,675 per year is the average annual cost that an American family spends on healthcare, this debate combined social justice and economics to consider how the United States should move forward to help its citizens obtain preventative and immediate solutions to heighten their quality of life.\n\nSAID provided an event for Atlas Week participants to learn about the diverse entities of a healthcare system that need to be examined for it to run efficiently and concurrently maintain quality of care.\n\nDebates allow discourse and formal presentation of differing viewpoints. In the future, the Center of Global Citizenship will continue their live-stream program with SAID to allow students and faculty to open their minds to new ideas from all across the world.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.3.6", "description": "Atlas Week 2016 extended past the sphere of the SLU community on Tuesday night, April 6, when four debaters from an IPE Healthcare Systems class at SLU \u2013", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "SAID provided an event for Atlas Week participants to learn about the diverse entities of a healthcare system that need to be examined for it to run efficiently and concurrently maintain quality of care.\nJapan, Vermont, Canada and Spain were examples of healthcare systems compared to the United States\u2019 throughout the night.\nThe Atlas Week debate, similar to current debates in Congress, media and courts across the country, compared two sides of a difficult ethical dilemma that the United States faces today.\nTo conclude the night, Dr. Breitbach, SLU\u2019s Athletic Training program director, who judged the debate, acknowledged the SLU debate team for their great performance that was full of statistics and studies to back up their arguments.\nOften, critics of a single-payer system do not actually know what it means."}
