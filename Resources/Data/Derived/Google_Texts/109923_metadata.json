These gaffes certainly won't help. Let's take a look at some of the worst mistakes Dems have made on the campaign trail so far:\n\n1.) That awful/insensitive/shameful and now infamous ad from the Wendy Davis (D-TX) gubernatorial campaign.\n\n2.) Those colorful campaign memos from Michelle Nunn\u2019s (D-GA) campaign, in which her own campaign referred to her as a \u201clightweight.\u201d\n\n3.) Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) saying he was \u201cbrain dead\" after he couldn't answer a simple, softball question.\n\n4.) Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) struggling to offer an answer as to how the Obama administration has handled the Ebola crisis. MSNBC even mocked him for that interview.\n\n5.) Alison Lundergan Grimes (D-Ky.) refusing to say if she voted for President Obama.\n\n6.) Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu (D) claiming Louisiana is full of sexists and racists.\n\n8.) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) rudely interrupting her opponent Scott Brown (R) during his final comments at a recent debate. She was booed.\n\n9.) Sen. Begich forgetting that almost anyone can access YouTube and catch him in a lie.\n\n10.) Michelle Obama getting Bruce Braley\u2019s (D-Iowa) name wrong \u2013 multiple times.\n\n11.) Landrieu makes another appearance on this list for having to pay back thousands of dollars to her constituents for flights she took to fundraisers or other campaign events that were inappropriately billed to her Senate office.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.) The revelation that Mary Burke\u2019s (D-WI) family fired her from their family business for \u201cincompetence.\u201d\n\n14.) DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz claiming that President Obama has joined Democrats on the campaign trail, then failing to name even one Senate race for which he's campaigned.\n\n15.) Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC) neglecting to show up to the final debate with her GOP challenger Thom Tillis in one of the country's tighest races, giving him a whole hour to state his case uncontested. Hagan's absence even prompted a rant from liberal MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow.\n\nThis was quite possibly the quickest/easiest list I\u2019ve ever compiled. I wonder how much it'll grow by Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This started as a top ten list..05/26/2016 1:11:26AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "This started as a top ten list.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - The 15 Worst Democrat Gaffes This Election", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/11/02/the-10-worst-democrat-gaffes-this-election-n1912649", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/276/21683d86-cf70-40b7-b8ab-f2241d083b18.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "This started as a top ten list.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - The 15 Worst Democrat Gaffes This Election", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/11/02/the-10-worst-democrat-gaffes-this-election-n1912649", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/276/21683d86-cf70-40b7-b8ab-f2241d083b18.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The 15 Worst Democrat Gaffes This Election, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2831\"", "article_summary": "Let's take a look at some of the worst mistakes Dems have made on the campaign trail so far:1.)\nSen.
