Authorities say an inmate who escaped from the Jefferson County jail on Sunday night is still at-large after a roughly two-day search.

Travis Sandlin, 32, the first person ever to escape from the county jail, is considered dangerous. Law enforcement said Monday they believe Sandlin might be connected with two vehicles that were reported stolen since his escape, one of which was found off Interstate 70 in the high country.

Officials believe Sandlin could be fleeing in a blue Honda Pilot with a license plate number 251ZCD.

The escape happened between 9 and 10 p.m. Sunday during an authorized outdoor recreation time after Sandlin apparently pushed through a metal mesh fence.

Officials believe about 30 minutes passed before they realized Sandlin had escaped.

Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, said there were no updates on the search for Sandlin as of Tuesday morning.

Sandlin has a long criminal record dating back to 2000, including a 2003 conviction that left him a registered sex offender.

The sheriff’s office asks anyone with tips about Sandlin’s escape to call 303-271-5612. Anyone who sees Sandlin should call 911.
