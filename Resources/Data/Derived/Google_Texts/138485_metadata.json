Fewer say Congress should repeal the law and replace it with a Republican-sponsored alternative (12 percent) or repeal it and not replace it (19 percent).\u201d\n\nTo put it another way, the only issue that the Republicans thought they had in their favor in 2014 has turned against them. The GOP has it all wrong. The majority doesn\u2019t think that Obamacare is a job killing monstrosity that must be killed today. Most people want the law to stay in place, but they also want political leaders to improve it.\n\nWhile 48% of respondents want the law to be worked on and improved, only 12% support the Republicans\u2019 big idea that they can replace Obamacare with their own alternative. The American people have taken a contradictory view of the ACA. By a margin of 47% to 35%, the law itself remains unpopular, but a majority (56%) don\u2019t want the law repealed or replaced.\n\nIt is very possible that a majority may never warmly embrace the ACA, but they also understand the need for healthcare reform, so they don\u2019t want the law to go away either. It is a complicated position, and Republicans have set themselves up for total failure by embracing such a black and white approach to the ACA.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that candidates who run on improving the ACA are likely to get a warm reception from voters. Since Republicans refuse to do anything that would keep the existing law in place, Democrats have an uncontested playing field when it comes to improving the law.\n\nA majority wants this country to move forward on healthcare reform, but they understand that Obamacare is not the perfect finished policy product.\n\nThis adds up to a win for President Obama and the Democrats.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s worst nightmare has always been that Obamacare would grow in popularity over time. The ACA isn\u2019t getting more popular, but the actual healthcare reform law is growing in support. This is disastrous news for Republicans who have based the entire election strategy for 2014 and 2016 on getting rid of Obamacare.\n\nThe American people are speaking, and they want their affordable healthcare to be here to stay.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll dealt a blow to Republicans by finding that support for repealing the ACA has hit an all time of low of 31%.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A new Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll dealt a blow to Republicans by finding that support for repealing the ACA has hit an all time of low of 31%.", "title": "Republicans' Worst Nightmare Comes True: Support For Repealing Obamacare Hits All Time Low", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/02/26/republicans-worst-nightmare-true-support-repealing-obamacare-hits-time.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/boehner-mcconnell-sad.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-26T15:22:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-02-26T15:22:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T15:22:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A new Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll dealt a blow to Republicans by finding that support for repealing the ACA has hit an all time of low of 31%.\nWhile 48% of respondents want the law to be worked on and improved, only 12% support the Republicans\u2019 big idea that they can replace Obamacare with their own alternative.\nThe ACA isn\u2019t getting more popular, but the actual healthcare reform law is growing in support.\nThis is disastrous news for Republicans who have based the entire election strategy for 2014 and 2016 on getting rid of Obamacare.\nThe majority doesn\u2019t think that Obamacare is a job killing monstrosity that must be killed today."}
