File photo. (Thomas R. Cordova / Staff Photographer)\n\nWhen Jessica Reed\u2019s elderly father began experiencing severe eye pain this week, she took him to the emergency room at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center in Torrance and was quickly stunned at the crowded conditions they encountered.\n\n\u201cThey were taking patients\u2019 vitals and giving them blood tests, pills or even IVs in the lobby,\u201d said the Redondo Beach resident. \u201cI was very shocked to see that.\u201d\n\nReed soon learned what was occurring on that Monday, the first workday of the new year, when Dr. William Conrad, chairman of the Emergency Department, publicly asked the tired, frustrated and ailing patients for their patience.\n\nConrad, who himself had been called into work because of the massive influx of outpatients, announced to the crowd at about 8 p.m. Monday that the hospital was experiencing the greatest number of emergency room visits in its 55-year history.\n\nAt that moment, 109 patients were seeking treatment \u2014 the highest number ever at one time, a hospital spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cI remember the days in 1999 when we would occasionally have a patient-free environment,\u201d said Conrad, an ER doctor at the Torrance hospital for 16 years.\n\n\u201cWe would see about 60 patients a day,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened over the following 16 years is we\u2019ve reached an incredible volume. In a single day (Monday), we saw 283 patients in a 29-bed emergency room. It\u2019s a staggering number.\u201d\n\nAcross town, Torrance Memorial Medical Center was experiencing a similar surge Monday with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d 285 patients admitted to the hospital, said Dr. Eric Nakkim, who co-manages the Emergency Department with registered nurse Shahin Thomas.\n\nPatients waited up to three hours to be seen that day, far longer than the usual time of about 40 minutes, Nakkim said.\n\n\u201cIt was very busy, very crazy, very stressful,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt put a stress on everyone.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the patients we see are gastrointestinal, cold, sore throat, earache,\u201d she added. \u201cThose types of things could be seen in urgent care or could be seen by their primary physician.\u201d\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the outpatient overload this week:\n\n\u2022 Winter is prime season for coughs and colds, so hospital ERs traditionally are busier during those months anyway.\n\n\u2022 Monday was the first workday of 2016 and many family doctors had shut their doors for the holidays, so there was pent-up demand for treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Many primary care physicians are also so busy their patients may not be able to get a quick appointment to treat an illness and, rather than wait days or weeks for one, choose to go to an ER.\n\n\u2022 Those who had struggled with an illness over the holiday weekend suddenly realized Monday they weren\u2019t ready to go to work and headed to an ER for treatment.\n\n\u2022 Some hospitals have closed their doors over the past few years, which can contribute to a patient overload for others at peak times.\n\n\u2022 Perhaps most significantly, the Affordable Care Act kicked in a year or so ago, significantly increasing the number of insured. But many of those who signed up may not have their own family doctor or are otherwise unaware of the complex health delivery system, including the network of urgent care centers that are available.\n\nPatient volume in the emergency room at Torrance Memorial has increased about 25 percent since what many call Obamacare took effect, Thomas said.\n\n\u201cThose patients who were medically disenfranchised now have health care coverage, which is good,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cBut there is an imbalance between the outpatient resources for those patients and the number that are now insured.\u201d\n\nThat hospital ERs can get clogged with patients who clearly do not have emergency medical issues has potentially troubling implications for seriously ill patients and those who care for them.\n\nEmergency rooms that are always staffed around the clock offer perhaps the most expensive medical care that exists.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, ERs are, after all, for people with genuine medical emergencies. And their care can be compromised when doctors and nurses are instead dealing with relatively minor medical conditions.\n\nFor instance, when emergency rooms are overloaded, ambulances can be put on what\u2019s called diversion.\n\nIn those situations, a hospital with a crowded emergency room can decide not to accept patients arriving by ambulance for one-hour increments. The problem, of course, is that patients arriving by ambulance often are in need of more immediate medical care than those who walk in.\n\nBut hospitals by law can\u2019t stop treating folks who just walk in. So they divert ambulances to other hospitals.\n\nWhile diversion is \u201cuncommon\u201d at Torrance Memorial, on Monday it occurred for six hours in a 24-hour period.\n\nLikewise, Little Company of Mary was forced to impose diversion for 25 hours from Jan. 4-6.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen things are so bad that we\u2019re on diversion, it\u2019s highly likely that at that same moment in time all of our neighbors are on diversion as well,\u201d Nakkim said. \u201cAnd when everyone is on diversion, then functionally it\u2019s just like everyone\u2019s open. A patient has got to go someplace.\u201d\n\nSo the ERs accept the patients anyway.\n\n\u201cIt puts a tremendous strain on the system,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s much simpler to give care when you\u2019re not dealing with these huge volumes.\u201d\n\nIndeed, things could be much worse at Torrance Memorial during peak periods had the hospital not changed the way it treated patients in the ER in an effort to reduce long waits to see a physician.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, the hospital began redeploying staff in its 200-foot-long, 40-bed emergency room into five \u201cpods\u201d of doctors, nurses and technicians that are responsible for eight to 10 beds each.\n\nAt least one team is responsible for seeing nonemergency cases, Nakkim said.\n\nThe result is that doctors spend less time walking the length of the ER, communication and accountability between the small teams improves and patient wait times are cut almost in half.\n\nMeanwhile, doctors find themselves counseling patients who may not have a family doctor to get one before they fall ill again or suggesting other resources such as urgent care clinics for some minor medical issues.\n\nPreventive medicine means fewer health problems and can help reduce unnecessary ER visits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t particularly blame these people at all for coming in for care,\u201d Nakkim said. \u201cI do try to educate them after the fact on where to go. When they first come in, I don\u2019t lecture them \u2014 \u2018Why didn\u2019t you go to your doctor?\u2019 \u2014 That\u2019s not really my place, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. We\u2019re about treating people right.\u201d\n\nWhich is why Conrad made his emergency room announcement Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing when it changes the perception: it\u2019s no longer one of \u2018these people are uncaring and they\u2019re not working hard,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that leadership be available.\u201d\n\nAnd it was appreciated by the likes of Reed, especially considering she and her father spent about 10 hours in the emergency room, during which he was administered a painkiller in the lobby.\n\n\u201cHe is awesome,\u201d Reed said of Conrad. \u201cOnce he came out and told us that, I think everybody in the room was more at ease, including myself.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Jessica Reed\u2019s elderly father began experiencing severe eye pain this week, she took him to the emergency room at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center in Torrance and was quickly stunned at the crowded conditions they encounter", "title": "Post-holiday surge swamps Torrance hospital ERs with record numbers of patients", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/health/20160108/post-holiday-surge-swamps-torrance-hospital-ers-with-record-numbers-of-patients", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20160108/NEWS/160109567/AR/0/AR-160109567.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "831px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Post-holiday surge swamps Torrance hospital ERs with record numbers of patients"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "When Jessica Reed\u2019s elderly father began experiencing severe eye pain this week, she took him to the emergency room at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center in Torrance and was quickly stunned at the crowded conditions they encounter", "title": "Post-holiday surge swamps Torrance hospital ERs with record numbers of patients", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/health/20160108/post-holiday-surge-swamps-torrance-hospital-ers-with-record-numbers-of-patients", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20160108/NEWS/160109567/AR/0/AR-160109567.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "emergency care,emergency room,Hospitals,overcrowding,patients,Torrance, Emergency care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "emergency care,emergency room,Hospitals,overcrowding,patients,Torrance, Emergency care"}, "article_summary": "Torrance Memorial Medical Center.\nWhile diversion is \u201cuncommon\u201d at Torrance Memorial, on Monday it occurred for six hours in a 24-hour period.\nPatient volume in the emergency room at Torrance Memorial has increased about 25 percent since what many call Obamacare took effect, Thomas said.\n\u201cI remember the days in 1999 when we would occasionally have a patient-free environment,\u201d said Conrad, an ER doctor at the Torrance hospital for 16 years.\nIn a single day (Monday), we saw 283 patients in a 29-bed emergency room."}
