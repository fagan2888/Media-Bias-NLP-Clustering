Eric Greggs, one of three speakers at the 45-minute service.\n\nChambers graduated from South Panola High last year and worked in sales at a Batesville clothing and gift shop.\n\nAlabama author Linda Oliver said Chambers had recently asked her to help write a book about her life.\n\nOliver, of Birmingham, said Chambers approached her while she was packing up after a speech about her own book at an Oct. 25 church conference in the Batesville area.\n\n\u201cShe thanked me for sharing some of the horrible facts of my own story\u201d and then asked for help with hers, Oliver said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I want my story to be told.\u2019\u201d Oliver did not elaborate.\n\nThe Rev. Larry Kilgore of Crowder Baptist Church, about 15 miles from the funeral home where Chambers\u2019 funeral was held, said she talked with him about personal problems, but had a relationship with Christ.\n\n\u201cJessica was a young lady who just loved to be loved,\u201d he said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t talk about Chambers\u2019 problems: \u201cI will not expose her in death,\u201d he said.\n\nGreggs preaches at Community Church of God in Charleston, about 25 miles from Wells Funeral Home in Batesville, which live-streamed the service.\n\nHe said a church member called last Sunday, the day Chambers\u2019 body was found, to tell him about her death. \u201cI was struck with a heavy heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI got off the phone and told my wife, \u2018I don\u2019t even feel like preaching anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, he said, resurrection is the \u201cgood ending to the story.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will see you on the other side. Hallelujah.\u201d\n\nThe chapel where Chambers\u2019 funeral took place seats about 400 and was full, said owner Tommy Wells.\n\nPolice are reconstructing the last few hours of Chambers\u2019 life and are asking the public to come forward with information. So far, they have few solid leads, in spite of $11,000 offered in rewards.\n\nShe was still alive when a passing motorist saw her lying near her burning Kia Rio sedan about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 7, and she spoke to rescue workers, District Attorney John Champion has said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not releasing what she said, but we\u2019re acting on it,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 13 Dec 2014 17:57:13 -0400", "Description": "BATESVILLE, Miss. \u2014 About 400 mourners packed a chapel in Mississippi today to say goodbye to a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive, among them classmates who used permanent markers to writ", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "BATESVILLE, Miss. \u2014 About 400 mourners packed a chapel in Mississippi today to say goodbye to a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive, among them classmates who used permanent markers to writ", "title": "Hundreds at funeral for Miss. woman burned alive", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/ap/hundreds-attend-miss-funeral-for-woman-burned-alive-20141213/", "image": {"width": 482, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141213/ARTICLE/141219643/AR/0/AR-141219643.jpg", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2014-12-13T20:24:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "BATESVILLE, Miss. \u2014 About 400 mourners packed a chapel in Mississippi today to say goodbye to a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive, among them classmates who used permanent markers to wr", "title": "Hundreds at funeral for Miss. woman burned alive", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141213/ARTICLE/141219643/AR/0/AR-141219643.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-12-13T17:57:13Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-12-13T20:24:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hallelujah.\u201dThe chapel where Chambers\u2019 funeral took place seats about 400 and was full, said owner Tommy Wells.\nHe didn\u2019t talk about Chambers\u2019 problems: \u201cI will not expose her in death,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I want my story to be told.\u2019\u201d Oliver did not elaborate.\nGreggs preaches at Community Church of God in Charleston, about 25 miles from Wells Funeral Home in Batesville, which live-streamed the service.\nLarry Kilgore of Crowder Baptist Church, about 15 miles from the funeral home where Chambers\u2019 funeral was held, said she talked with him about personal problems, but had a relationship with Christ."}
