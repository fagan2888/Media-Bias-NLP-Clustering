Obama tells young people to worry less about marijuana legalization and more about climate change

President Obama thinks young people passionate about marijuana legalization need to get their priorities straight.

In his interview with VICE—which the site published at 4:20pm—Obama said young people should focus on more important things—like climate change.

“Young people, I understand this is important to you, but you should be thinking about climate change, the economy, jobs, war and peace,” he said. “Maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana.”

“For young people, I’m sorry, but if you legalize marijuana it would be the biggest part of your legacy,” noted his interviewer, VICE founder Shane Smith.

“It shouldn’t be young people’s biggest priority,” Obama replied.

He went on to pay lip-service to the idea of decriminalizing marijuana, and fixing the criminal justice system’s focus on prosecuting non-violent drug offenses. He also noted that many conservatives agree with him on decriminalization.

But he later added some caveats as far as ending the drug war: “I always say to folks, you know, legalization or decriminalization is not a panacea. Do we feel the same way about meth? Do we feel the same way about coke?”
