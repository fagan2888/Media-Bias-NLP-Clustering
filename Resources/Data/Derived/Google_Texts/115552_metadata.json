While some healthy younger people have made their decision based on the economy reality that it is cheaper to get health insurance than it would be to pay the penalty, it is likely that as more young people are aging out of being on their parents\u2019 insurance, they are getting coverage of their own.\n\nThe ACA will make it possible for future generations not to know the fear and stress that comes with being uninsured.\n\nThe last Republican hope for stopping Obamacare has been that young people would not sign up, but the number of young people who signed up has nearly doubled. Americans of all age like having health insurance. Republicans have failed to stop the law, and as more Americans get covered the idea of total repeal is looking more and more like empty campaign rhetoric.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s victory on healthcare has been a comprehensive crushing of the Republican opposition that will forever change how future generations view their right to have health insurance. With Obamacare, President Obama has fundamentally transformed America for the better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration announced today that ACA enrollment has increased by 1.8 million over last year and that enrollment has nearly doubled with young people compared to the same time in 2014.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Obama administration announced today that ACA enrollment has increased by 1.8 million over last year and that enrollment has nearly doubled with young people compared to the same time in 2014.", "title": "Republicans Crushed As Obamacare Enrollment Nearly Doubles With Young People", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/12/23/republicans-crushed-obamacare-enrollment-doubles-young-people.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ObamaSmile3.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-23T19:18:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,aca enrollment,Obamacare,Obamacare enrollment increase,obamacare working,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-12-23T19:18:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-23T19:18:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aca enrollment, Obamacare, Obamacare enrollment increase, obamacare working"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31ea\"", "article_summary": "The last Republican hope for stopping Obamacare has been that young people would not sign up, but the number of young people who signed up has nearly doubled.\nThat includes 2.1 million people under age 35 \u2014 nearly double the number of young people enrolled during the same period last year.\nThe Obama administration announced today that ACA enrollment has increased by 1.8 million over last year, and that enrollment has nearly doubled with young people compared to the same time in 2014.\nAmericans of all age like having health insurance.\nIt is being speculated that more young people are signing up because the penalty for not having health insurance has increased to $695 or 2.5% of gross income."}
