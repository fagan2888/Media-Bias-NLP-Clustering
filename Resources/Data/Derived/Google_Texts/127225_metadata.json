When Department of Health and Human Services administrators decided to base 30 percent of hospitals\u2019 Medicare reimbursement on patient satisfaction survey scores, they likely figured that transparency and accountability would improve healthcare. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) officials wrote, rather reasonably, \u201cDelivery of high-quality, patient-centered care requires us to carefully consider the patient\u2019s experience in the hospital inpatient setting.\u201d They probably had no idea that their methods could end up indirectly harming patients. Beginning in October 2012, the Affordable Care Act implemented a policy withholding 1 percent of total Medicare reimbursements\u2014approximately $850 million\u2014from hospitals (that percentage will double in 2017). Each year, only hospitals with high patient-satisfaction scores and a measure of certain basic care standards will earn that money back, and the top performers will receive bonus money from the pool.\n\nPatient-satisfaction surveys have their place. But the potential cost of the subjective scores are leading hospitals to steer focus away from patient health, messing with the highest stakes possible: people\u2019s lives. The vast majority of the thirty-two-question survey, known as HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) addresses nursing care. For example, in a section about nurses, the survey asks, \u201cDuring this hospital stay, after you pressed the call button, how often did you get help as soon as you wanted it?\u201d \"Patients can be very satisfied and be dead an hour later.\" This question is misleading because it doesn\u2019t specify whether the help was medically necessary. Patients have complained on the survey, which in previous incarnations included comments sections, about everything from \u201cMy roommate was dying all night and his breathing was very noisy\u201d to \u201cThe hospital doesn\u2019t have Splenda.\u201d A nurse at the New Jersey hospital lacking Splenda said, \u201cThis somehow became the fault of the nurse and ended up being placed in her personnel file.\u201d An Oregon critical-care nurse had to argue with a patient who believed he was being mistreated because he didn\u2019t get enough pastrami on his sandwich (he had recently had quadruple-bypass surgery). \u201cMany patients have unrealistic expectations for their care and their outcomes,\u201d the nurse said. In fact, a national study revealed that patients who reported being most satisfied with their doctors actually had higher healthcare and prescription costs and were more likely to be hospitalized than patients who were not as satisfied. Worse, the most satisfied patients were significantly more likely to die in the next four years. Joshua Fenton, a University of California, Davis, professor who conducted the study, said these results could reflect that doctors who are reimbursed according to patient satisfaction scores may be less inclined to talk patients out of treatments they request or to raise concerns about smoking, substance abuse, or mental-health issues. By attempting to satisfy patients, healthcare providers unintentionally might not be looking out for their best interests. New York Times columnist Theresa Brown observed, \u201cFocusing on what patients want\u2014a certain test, a specific drug\u2014may mean they get less of what they actually need. In other words, evaluating hospital care in terms of its ability to offer positive experiences could easily put pressure on the system to do things it can\u2019t, at the expense of what it should.\u201d\n\nAs a Missouri clinical instructor told me, \u201cPatients can be very satisfied and dead an hour later. Sometimes hearing bad news is not going to result in a satisfied patient, yet the patient could be a well-informed, prepared patient.\u201d * * * How far will a hospital go to satisfy a patient? Recently, some have rushed to purchase extra amenities such as valet parking, live music, custom-order room-service meals, and flat-screen televisions. Some are offering VIP lounges to patients in their \u201cloyalty programs.\u201d Related Story The Case for Seeing a Nurse Instead of a Doctor And because almost every question on the survey involves nurses, some hospitals are forcing them to undergo unnecessary nonmedical training and spend extra time on superfluous steps. Perhaps hospitals\u2019 most egregious way of skewing care to the survey is the widespread practice of scripting nurses\u2019 patient interactions. Some administrators are ordering nurses to use particular phrases and to gush effusively to patients about both their hospital and their fellow nurses, and then evaluating them on how well they comply. An entire industry has sprouted, encouraging hospitals to waste precious dollars on expensive consultants claiming to provide scripts or other resources that boost satisfaction scores. Some institutions have even hired actors to rehearse the scripts with nurses. In Massachusetts, a medical/surgical nurse told The Boston Globe that the scripting made her feel like a \u201cStepford nurse,\u201d and wondered whether patients would notice that their nurses used identical phrasing. She\u2019s right to be concerned. Great nurses are warm, funny, personal, or genuine\u2014and requiring memorized scripts places a needless obstacle in their path. The concept of \u201cpatient experience\u201d has mischaracterized patients as customers and nurses as automatons. Some hospital job postings advertise that they are looking for nurses with \u201cgood customer-service skills\u201d as their first qualification. University of Toledo Medical Center evaluates staff members on \u201ccustomer satisfaction.\u201d\n\nBy treating patients like customers, as the nurse Amy Bozeman pointed out in a Scrubs magazine article, hospitals succumb to the ingrained cultural notion that the customer is always right. \u201cNow we are told as nurses that our patients are customers, and that we need to provide excellent service so they will maintain loyalty to our hospitals,\u201d Bozeman wrote. \u201cThe patient is NOT always right. They just don\u2019t have the knowledge and training.\u201d Some hospitals have hired \u201ccustomer-service representatives,\u201d but empowering these nonmedical employees to pander to patients\u2019 whims can backfire. Comfort is not always the same thing as healthcare. As Bozeman suggested, when representatives give warm blankets to feverish patients or complimentary milkshakes to patients who are not supposed to eat, and nurses take them away, patients are not going to give high marks to the nurses. More disturbing, several health systems are now using patient satisfaction scores (likely from hospitals\u2019 individual surveys) as a factor in calculating nurses\u2019 and doctors\u2019 pay or annual bonuses. These health systems are ignoring the possibility that health providers, like hospitals, could have fantastic patient satisfaction scores yet higher numbers of dead patients, or the opposite. * * * On the nursing blog Emergiblog, one nurse reported that at a hospital that switched its meal service to microwaved meals, food-service administrators openly attributed low patient scores to nurses\u2019 failure to present and describe the food adequately. It is both noteworthy and unsurprising that the hospital\u2019s response was to tell the nurses to \u201cmake the food sound better\u201d rather than to actually make the food better. \"We want a total cultural transformation. I want that Disney-like experience, the Ritz Carlton experience.\" This applies to scripting, too: It does not improve healthcare, but makes it sound better. The University of Toledo Medical Center (UTMC) launched an entire program based on patient satisfaction, iCARE University, which mandated patient satisfaction course work and training for every university student and employee. \u201cService Excellence Officer\u201d Ioan Duca told a publication sponsored by Press Ganey, a company that administers the surveys for hospitals, \u201cI am really focused on creating a church-like environment here. We want a total cultural transformation. I want that Disney-like experience, the Ritz Carlton experience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A misguided attempt to improve healthcare has led some hospitals to focus on making people happy, rather than making them well.", "author": "Alexandra Robbins", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A misguided attempt to improve healthcare has led some hospitals to focus on making people happy, rather than making them well.", "title": "The Problem With Satisfied Patients", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/04/RTR4SL1M/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/the-problem-with-satisfied-patients/390684/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The University of Toledo Medical Center (UTMC) launched an entire program based on patient satisfaction, iCARE University, which mandated patient satisfaction course work and training for every university student and employee.\nBy attempting to satisfy patients, healthcare providers unintentionally might not be looking out for their best interests.\nIn fact, a national study revealed that patients who reported being most satisfied with their doctors actually had higher healthcare and prescription costs and were more likely to be hospitalized than patients who were not as satisfied.\nWorse, the most satisfied patients were significantly more likely to die in the next four years.\nThese health systems are ignoring the possibility that health providers, like hospitals, could have fantastic patient satisfaction scores yet higher numbers of dead patients, or the opposite."}
