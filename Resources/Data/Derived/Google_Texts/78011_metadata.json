But this takes the school\u2019s penchant for cronyism and secrecy to a whole new level.\n\nAs the Associated Press\u2019 Ryan Foley reported recently, the university has awarded no-bid contracts worth almost $322,000 to a company run by former Iowa Republican Party chairman Matt Strawn. Iowa law requires that public entities seek bids for good and services costing more than $25,000.\n\nBut no bids were collected on the work tied to Strawn\u2019s first contract, which was issued in the spring of 2013 for \u201conline and grassroots advocacy.\u201d The contract called for the school to pay Strawn $24,900 \u2014 a price that was clearly established to skirt the $25,000 threshold for bidding.\n\nMonths later, the school commissioned Strawn to conduct statewide polling and focus-group research, and obtained a waiver for the bidding process by claiming that \u201cno other vendor\u201d in Iowa could do that sort of work \u2014 a blatant fabrication.\n\nIn fact, Strawn had to subcontract with other firms to assist with both the advocacy and the polling. Those other companies, by the way, also have strong ties to the GOP: One was founded by Jim Anderson, the former executive director of the Iowa Republican Party, and the other is a prominent Republican pollster based in Texas.\n\nWhy would a state university hand out contacts in this manner to politically connected individuals? Is it because the contracts are managed by the school\u2019s vice president for external relations, Peter Matthes, who is a former Iowa Senate Republican Caucus staff director? Or is it simply poor management, with no favoritism involved?\n\nHard to say. But what\u2019s really alarming about all this is the university\u2019s refusal to make public the poll\u2019s findings. The school justifies the secrecy by pointing to an exemption in the state\u2019s Open Records Law for documents that if disclosed would give an advantage to Strawn's competitors and also would \"serve no public purpose.\u201d\n\nThat argument doesn't hold water. The school claimed that the polling contracts weren\u2019t put up for bids because there was \u201cno other vendor\u201d who could possibly do this sort of work. So how can it now claim that Strawn and his pals will be put at a competitive disadvantage if the results of their work are made public?\n\n\"It's their copyrighted report,\" says UI General Counsel Carroll Reasoner. \"The information in it could be used by competitors of them, using their protocol for polling \u2014 and also by competitors of the university as we seek out students to come to the university and figure out how we want to message ourselves to students and parents.\"\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, if the polling served a legitimate public purpose, then the results of that polling \u2014 which would simply reveal the school's perceived strengths and weaknesses \u2014 must also be in the public interest. The argument for keeping this information confidential is simply a legal fiction that has been sloppily constructed on other, conflicting fabrications of the school\u2019s own creation.\n\nUI President Bruce Harreld, who is struggling to win the confidence of Iowans and the school\u2019s own faculty, should make the polling results public today, and the Iowa Board of Regents should agree to examine the Strawn contracts and the manner in which they were awarded.\n\nIf Harreld and the regents refuse to act, the matter should be brought before the Iowa Legislature\u2019s Government Oversight Committee for public hearings on the matter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1YjTI9P", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "School upholds its longstanding traditions of secrecy and cronyism", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "School upholds its longstanding traditions of secrecy and cronyism", "title": "Editorial: UI's secrecy, no-bid contracts deserve scrutiny", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/12/16/editorial-uis-secrecy-no-bid-contracts-deserve-scrutiny/77362780/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "School upholds its longstanding traditions of secrecy and cronyism", "title": "Editorial: UI's secrecy, no-bid contracts deserve scrutiny", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7435c19fa70305d22322d9861f94c7df7adddfe3/c=0-50-300-350&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Iowa Board of Regents", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Iowa Board of Regents", "title": "Editorial: UI's secrecy, no-bid contracts deserve scrutiny", "author": "The Register's Editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd6e5ad74959dbe2ed77c8b644dfbe57be63d799/c=0-0-300-400/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18cbabf2f9685653eff4c2a514d66c0e30b62fbf/c=0-50-300-350/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37e68ecc3062366e70415c1a85b338b623bb0d2c/c=0-88-300-313/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d350ad9ed1564be287e55e48643c5a57b844c53/c=0-116-300-285&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-16T05:01:44.143000-06:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Secrecy and cronyism at UI", "articleid": 77362780, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/74d8969463fce9225d0ed207f06893337dd111ac/c=0-116-300-285/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d6c70f30549385387f5ecc3af18b74d1b6b92537/c=38-0-263-400/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/12/21/B9315436723Z.1_20141221002214_000_G1O9C7SRM.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "The school claimed that the polling contracts weren\u2019t put up for bids because there was \u201cno other vendor\u201d who could possibly do this sort of work.\nThe University of Iowa has hired a company to conduct polling for the school in an effort to improve its image.\nAs the Associated Press\u2019 Ryan Foley reported recently, the university has awarded no-bid contracts worth almost $322,000 to a company run by former Iowa Republican Party chairman Matt Strawn.\nBut this takes the school\u2019s penchant for cronyism and secrecy to a whole new level.\nIowa law requires that public entities seek bids for good and services costing more than $25,000."}
