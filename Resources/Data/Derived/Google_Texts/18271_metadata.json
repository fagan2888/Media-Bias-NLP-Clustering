CEO Paananen said that Supercell, which has only 180 employees, is in no rush to release new games and will continue to focus on a catalog of only four titles. IHS Technology's Kent does not see that as a problem. \"There comes a time when all games wane in popularity, but Supercell's audience will certainly give them scale to build on when that happens,\" he said.
