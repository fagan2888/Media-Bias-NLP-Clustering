The Republican-only vote for speaker will take place this week as planned.\n\n\u201cThe new Speaker will establish the date for these additional leadership elections. This new process will ensure House Republicans have a strong, unified team to lead our conference and focus on the American people\u2019s priorities,\u201d Boehner said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. government is set to run out of money sometime on or around November 5. If lawmakers don\u2019t increase the limit on federal borrowing, the United States would default on its financial obligations for the first time in its history.\n\nThe issue has sharply divided the House GOP conference in recent years, with hardline conservatives \u2013 like the kind that helped drive Boehner from office \u2013 arguing against such an increase.\n\nRelated: McCarthy Isn\u2019t Speaker Yet, but Some Conservatives Want to \u2018Fire\u2019 Him Already\n\nThe looming November deadline was shaping up to be the first big test for Boehner\u2019s replacement, presumably current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nHowever, by handing off responsibility for electing the second and third posts on the totem pole, Boehner has injected a new unstable element into an already volatile situation.\n\nShould McCarthy garner the 124 GOP votes necessary to become the speaker nominee and win the House floor vote with 218 supporters, he could put off the elections until after the debt ceiling deadline, leaving a veteran team of Republican leaders in place.\n\nHowever, McCarthy could lose the floor vote to a challenger like House Oversight and Government Reform chair Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), who declared his candidacy over the weekend.\n\nChaffetz said Republicans should be ready for a debt default and push for more government shutdowns to achieve their policy goals, according to CNN.\n\nRelated: Boehner\u2019s Strange Plan to Stay in Power a Little Longer\n\nIf McCarthy loses, he\u2019d keep his current job. Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) would also stay put.\n\nOf course, Boehner himself could negotiate some kind of debt ceiling increase with the Obama administration before he leaves office and give a new speaker a reprieve.\n\nSpeaking last month on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d before the latest default drama developed, Boehner said, \u201cI don't want to leave my successor a dirty barn. I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner has ripped up the script for how Congress will tackle the next debt ceiling deadline.", "title": "Here\u2019s Why the Odds of a U.S. Debt Default Just Increased", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/05/Here-s-Why-Odds-US-Debt-Default-Just-Increased", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07032011_Debt-Ceiling-Emily-Flake_DL_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/05/Here-s-Why-Odds-US-Debt-Default-Just-Increased", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07032011_Debt-Ceiling-Emily-Flake_DL_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner has ripped up the script for how Congress will tackle the next debt ceiling deadline.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc995a\"", "article_summary": "Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner has ripped up the script for how Congress will tackle the next debt ceiling deadline.\nOf course, Boehner himself could negotiate some kind of debt ceiling increase with the Obama administration before he leaves office and give a new speaker a reprieve.\nChaffetz said Republicans should be ready for a debt default and push for more government shutdowns to achieve their policy goals, according to CNN.\nRelated: Debt Ceiling Bombshell Jeopardizes McCarthy\u2019s CoronationBut he added a new wrinkle by postponing the internal House GOP elections for majority leader and whip \u2013 originally expected to take place this Thursday \u2013 until after his replacement gets the gavel.\nThe issue has sharply divided the House GOP conference in recent years, with hardline conservatives \u2013 like the kind that helped drive Boehner from office \u2013 arguing against such an increase."}
