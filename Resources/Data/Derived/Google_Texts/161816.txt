The community is coming together to help long-time employees of a well known business.

Workers from Montego Bay seafood restaurant in Panama City Beach are still unsure of their job security after the restaurant caught fire last Sunday.

Another restaurant's efforts will help Montego Bay's employees just in time for Christmas.

For just $10 locals could enjoy food, music and a great time.

Sunday night Pineapple Willy’s hosted a benefit for the employees of Montego Bay restaurant.

Panama City Resident Jeff Still said, "Montego Bay has been a long standing memory of this community here and with the devastation of the fire we decided that we would come out and back the community and give back what we could give back."

Activities included live and silent auctions on cakes and bikes, they even had a local band play Christmas songs for the crowd.

All proceeds from the $10 door fee will be donated towards Montego Bay employees.

A portion of Sunday night's bar sales will go to those employees as well.

Jeremy Evans, Pineapple Willy's manager said, "Couldn't be a better time of the year you know, as far as giving back because this is the season of giving.

Jeremy Evans is a manager at Pineapple Willis. His brother worked at Montego Bay Seafood restaurant before the fire.

"He is one of the employees and his friends that I've talked to they're very thankful very appreciative of it."

About 200 locals filled Pineapple Willy’s restaurant for Sunday night's benefit.

Evans says he's just proud of the community's support.

"I think it's very special and such a close knit family out here on the beach and especially in Panama City and Bay County, everybody coming together for this great cause," he said.

Investigators say that fire ignited in the attic of Montego Bay restaurant last Sunday around midnight and so far there are no talks of rebuilding the restaurant.
