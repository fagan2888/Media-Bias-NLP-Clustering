No one should be able to say, whatever happens, that they didn\u2019t know what\u2019s actually going on here.\u201d When journalist James Patrick McFadden spoke those words, he was referring to the holocaust sparked by the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe vs. Wade decision and its companion Doe vs. Bolton, which legalized abortion during all nine months of pregnancy. In the immediate wake of Roe, he founded The Human Life Foundation and The Human Life Review, a dynamic and multi-faceted quarterly. His mission was to confront and to document the assaults on human life and dignity wrought by Roe, including abortion, infanticide, cloning, euthanasia, and eugenics.\n\nAfter Jim McFadden died in 1998, his daughter, Maria McFadden Maffucci, stepped up as the Review\u2019s editor. She continues to keep the torch burning at the HLR offices in midtown Manhattan. In a recent interview with Stella Morabito for The Federalist, Maffucci reflected on the evolution of the pro-life movement and the Human Life Review\u2019s scope and critical role in that movement.\n\nStella: So much has happened over the past 40 years since Roe and the founding of the Human Life Review. If you could first give a quick tour of the life of the publication itself, what highlights would you point to? And what is it up to today?\n\nMaria: What comes to mind is that in 1983 President Ronald Reagan wrote an article for the Human Life Review called \u201cAbortion and the Conscience of the Nation,\u201d which about a year later was published in book form\u2026 Another interesting high point was when Walker Percy, the famous novelist, wrote a letter to the New York Times about abortion, and not only did the Times not publish it, but they didn\u2019t even answer him. We published it. When my Dad founded the Review in 1975, the eminent British author Malcolm Muggeridge was really enthusiastic and he started contributing. Archbishop Fulton Sheen was one of our first subscribers. And William F. Buckley, with whom my father worked closely at National Review, was a very strong supporter of the Human Life Review at the outset. But I think the great thing about the Review is that from its earliest days we\u2019ve been open to all sorts of articles from all sorts of different people.\n\nWhen Walker Percy, the famous novelist, wrote a letter to the New York Times about abortion, and not only did the Times not publish it, but they didn\u2019t even answer him. We published it. We\u2019ve managed to keep going for 40 years, which isn\u2019t that easy since we are a print publication. We\u2019ll have a new look starting in Winter 2015 and The Human Life Review is now online as well. Our website has a weekly blog and Twitter feed now also. And we\u2019re looking forward to more people being a part of the conversation. We definitely want to reach the pro-life leaders of tomorrow. We want to reach more people in the medical profession and the legal profession, because we\u2019re going to have to really fight back against what\u2019s going on.\n\nStella: In recent years you also started hosting a big October event in Manhattan, The Great Defender of Life Awards Dinner. What can you tell us about the event, and some of your past honorees?\n\nMaria: Yes, the upcoming dinner on October 23 will be our twelfth. The first one, in 2003, was a testimonial to my father because we had chosen \u201cGreat Defender of Life\u201d to put on his tombstone. And our first honoree was Congressman Henry Hyde. In the past we\u2019ve also honored Nat Hentoff, who is a Jewish atheist pro-life columnist for the Village Voice, honored Mary Kenny, who is an Irish journalist and TV personality in England and Ireland ,Bill McGurn, formerly with the Wall Street Journal and now with the New York Post. Last year we honored Eric and Susanne Metaxas, the first time we honored a married couple.\n\nAt this year\u2019s ceremony we\u2019re honoring Clark Forsythe, who is senior counsel for Americans United for Life and author of \u201cAbuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe v. Wade.\u201d Our co-honoree is Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, who is a real dynamo and represents the youthful face of the pro-life movement. Sally Muggeridge, the niece of Malcom Muggeridge and president of the Malcolm Muggeridge Society, is our mistress of ceremonies. It\u2019s a wonderful evening because there\u2019s such a feeling of camaraderie and we honor people who deserve to be honored.\n\nThe Changing Abortion Debate Stella: In general, how do you think the content of the abortion debate has evolved during the past 40 years?\n\nMaria: In the early days of Roe, people would ask: \u201cwho can say when life begins?\u201d People talked about \u201cproducts of conception\u201d or \u201cbunches of cells.\u201d Nobody argues that way anymore, especially now with ultrasounds. There\u2019s no question it\u2019s a baby. We used to think if people just knew, they would change their minds. But now they do know, and it\u2019s much more blatantly utilitarian and increasingly eugenic. The question from the other side isn\u2019t whether or not the baby is alive in the womb, but: \u201cWell, what kind of quality of life would that child have?\u201d or \u201cWhy should my own life be put on hold?\u201d So I think the debate has evolved in a frightening way in that sense.\n\nThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s a baby. We used to think if people just knew, they would change their minds. Stella: The pro-abortion side\u2019s arguments seem to be appealing more and more to raw emotion these days, to justify things like late term abortion. That was something most pro-abortion folks used to really squirm about if you mentioned it. What aren\u2019t people getting about this? And can you see any way for a real debate to evolve with things this extreme?\n\nMaria: They\u2019re definitely relying on emotion. We\u2019ve reached such a point of narcissism and selfishness in our society. For example, with Wendy Davis advocating for late-term abortions in Texas, the stories are always emotional. It\u2019s always about a woman who really wanted a child, but the child would be disabled and the mother starts thinking about what that child\u2019s life would be like and how much the parents would suffer. It\u2019s the arrogance of deciding that someone else\u2019s life won\u2019t be good enough. And it\u2019s hard debating because right now people have such different moral codes, such different compasses.\n\nThe one logical thing that I think should work\u2014if people were paying attention\u2014is to note that if one group of humans can be killed, then any group of humans can be killed. It only depends on who\u2019s in power, who\u2019s deciding which group to kill. That ought to scare people. But it doesn\u2019t, because they have a sense of security that they\u2019re always going to be on the right side, the powerful side. And that\u2019s just not true. People should be able to see this from past struggles, like slavery and the Holocaust. Logically the parallels are obvious. However, people just don\u2019t see them. I watched Twelve Years a Slave, a terribly powerful movie. And I remember wondering if Hollywood would ever praise a movie that exposes abortion for what it is, because the themes are the same: man\u2019s inhumanity to man, and considering one class of humans \u201cless-than.\u201d\n\nAn Open Discussion of Infanticide and Eugenics Stella: Yet there are bioethicists today who shrug off human dignity. What do you make of the Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer and his outlandish support for infanticide and his animal-rights arguments?\n\nMaria: Peter Singer is part of this movement that seems almost like science fiction. He is a utilitarian, and believes pain is bad, actually thinks we can do away with suffering. And believes parents should have the right to kill even their born children up to a certain point\u2014he doesn\u2019t say what age that is. The scariest people are people like Singer in academia who advise medical boards.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe in God, then there\u2019s nothing wrong about making some life-and-death decisions for yourself and for others. Stella: Sometimes when I hear such outlandish views, I ask, \u201cDo they really believe that stuff?\u201d\n\nMaria: I can\u2019t get into his head. I think we should argue all of the life issues from the standpoint of human rights, from common sense. But there is a point\u2014and this comes to Singer\u2019s goal of getting rid of suffering\u2014that if you don\u2019t believe in God, then there\u2019s nothing wrong about making some life-and-death decisions for yourself and for others. If you don\u2019t have a belief that some things are just beyond the pale for humans to do to each other\u2014that murder and suicide are wrong because they\u2019re deeply morally, and transcendentally wrong\u2014then it\u2019s hard not to feel sympathy for some of those hard cases.\n\nStella: So what kind of impact do you think the abortion culture, and now open discussion of infanticide and euthanasia, have had broadly on American society today? On the American family and the coarsening of American culture, including the hook-up culture among youth?\n\nMaria: Regarding the hook-up culture, biologically women will suffer more from the consequences of sex. But even for men, I think it hurts the relationship between the sexes terribly, and of course that hurts the family. By trying to control it all and closing off opportunities, the whole family unit is hurt. And you can\u2019t really fight this if you don\u2019t talk about sex. You can\u2019t trivialize sex. As a society if we don\u2019t stop trivializing sex we aren\u2019t going to have respect for human life.\n\nFor people born after 1973, I don\u2019t know what kind of collective mental effect it has to know that you could have been aborted, to know that your siblings might have been aborted. Another impact is that for people born after 1973, I don\u2019t know what kind of collective mental effect it has to know that you could have been aborted, to know that your siblings might have been aborted. What does that do to you? It gets into your consciousness. And that\u2019s the thing. If you know you had a sibling aborted, and that it was \u201cokay\u201d and your mother was exercising her rights, you can\u2019t say there\u2019s a not a part of you that doesn\u2019t wonder who that sibling would have been.\n\nStella: It\u2019s going to create some pathologies across society, it seems.\n\nMaria: Yes, it must. Also, there are all the men and women who aborted and think it\u2019s not affecting them. We all agree now that divorce has repercussions. That doesn\u2019t mean we think it should never happen. But we all agree that divorce has negative effects on children. But with abortion we can\u2019t say that. You can\u2019t even go there. With all of the studies done on divorce, following kids for generations, you\u2019d think we\u2019d be doing that for families that had abortions.\n\nBeneath the Glossy Magazine Covers Stella: What\u2019s your take on the \u201cWar on Women\u201d rhetoric? You and I can see abortion itself as a central element of a full frontal war on women. The March for Life in Washington has a huge contingent of post-abortion women who will tell you how horribly destructive and violent the abortion culture has been to them. So how do you think the pro-abortion side co-opted the \u201cWar on Women\u201d rhetoric so that being pro-abortion became synonymous with being pro-woman?\n\nAbortion and sex without consequences is turning women against their own uniqueness. Maria: I think it\u2019s because they focused on contraception. They focused on Mitt Romney and made him seem like he wanted to send women back to the \u201950s and \u201960s being the stay-at-home mom with the perfect little casserole. And that does scare women. Of course, it seems at face value like a step into the past where women\u2019s careers and education were not taken as seriously. So they focused the argument on that in order to distract people from abortion. And no matter how much we\u2019d say it\u2019s not about contraception, they know that, propaganda-wise, they\u2019ll win with that kind of fear-mongering.\n\nAt the same time, when you do start studying life issues and abortion, you realize that some contraceptives are abortifacients, and you ought to take a serious view of sex. The sad thing is that abortion and sex without consequences is turning women against their own uniqueness. So many women at the end of the day regret not having children. Abortion is definitely a war on women. There are a lot of base motives for pushing certain contraceptives, pushing abortion. There\u2019s money-making (Planned Parenthood, after all, is a billion-dollar business!) and there\u2019s eugenics. The big push for contraceptives, especially dangerous kinds like Norplant, which focuses on certain demographics, is eugenics. But if the mainstream media is against you right now, they\u2019ll twist the reasonable things you say and they\u2019ll let slide things other people say that are horrible.\n\nStella: There was a movie this past summer, a box-office flop called \u201cObvious Child,\u201d which was supposed to put a positive spin on abortion. What\u2019s your take on how they\u2019re putting together their propaganda? Does it seem like the pro-abortion elites are now just kind of trying on different things for size to see what works?\n\nMaria: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting because they\u2019re trying to do what we\u2019ve been seeing with pro-life indie movies like \u201cBella\u201d and \u201cOctober Baby.\u201d With those, you might kind of sit there and wonder if this is propaganda trying to make you see the pro-life point of view. But \u201cObvious Child\u201d was just so obviously a propaganda movie for abortion.\n\n\u201cObvious Child\u201d is an amazing title. It was trying to show that the woman was \u201cobviously\u201d a child and not ready to be a mother. But what about the fact that it\u2019s obviously a child she aborted, and she\u2019s a stand-up comic and she has a fling and she has an abortion and she makes a joke about it? Ha ha ha. You know. Not funny. Even when they try to be flippant, I\u2019m surprised they would use that title, because you can so easily say \u201cObviously it\u2019s a child.\u201d It\u2019s just so weird.\n\nStella: And why do you think it\u2019s so easy for people to wave off the Kermit Gosnell horrors in that Philadelphia abortion clinic? Do you think it\u2019s desensitization? Or have we reached such a point of ignorance as a society that we don\u2019t even know how to dig ourselves out?\n\nKermit Gosnell was horrible, but people tell themselves that he was an \u2018outlier\u2019 or \u2018the exception.\u2019 Maria: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s new. I think it\u2019s human nature. I think that throughout history, there are always awful things that happen. Someone will mention them, and you\u2019ll say \u201cNo! They don\u2019t really do that, do they?\u201d And once you find out that they do, you can maybe do something about it, or go back to your state of ignorance before. Let\u2019s just take the example of slavery. In the movie, Amazing Grace, he [abolitionist William Wilberforce] tried to show that the way slaves were brought over from Africa was completely inhuman. People knew that, but they chose to look the other way. We all do it to some extent. Because it\u2019s overwhelming. And also people think when things are that bad, it just can\u2019t be true across the board. Gosnell was horrible, but they tell themselves that he was an \u201coutlier\u201d or \u201cthe exception.\u201d There\u2019s this glossy-magazine idea of women\u2019s health care and it doesn\u2019t go with the Gosnell idea. They just don\u2019t want to believe it.\n\nStella: Over the past couple of years we\u2019ve seen a campaign by the pro-abortion side to get women to \u201cshare their abortion stories\u201d as a means of pushing back against lost public-opinion support. Cosmopolitan ran a story by a young woman who videotaped herself undergoing an abortion, then posted it on the Internet. New York Magazine recently touted \u201cabortion doulas,\u201d hand-holders for women while they have abortions. What do you think is driving all of this?\n\nMaria: It\u2019s complicated. Definitely among people who\u2019ve had abortions, there\u2019s reluctance to face what they\u2019ve done, so they take all that energy into justifying what they did. And there are younger people who buy the line that this is important for their freedom so they need to just champion it and be hardnosed about it and not give in to any other feelings. The problem is that reality is what it is, and the truth of it still comes out.\n\nThe abortion doula story was awful. It was awful that a young woman would put herself through this. The emotions are complicated. Again, abortion is a huge industry. It\u2019s not all sincere emotion. It\u2019s a lot of strategic PR. But what really scares NARAL and Planned Parenthood is the absence of [an] enthusiastic following among the young. We have that ourselves now. I think young people are not going to make abortion their life\u2019s cause. The stories of some of the women who first pushed for legalized abortion are very invested in justifying their own abortions. What scares them is not seeing the same kind of passion on their side among the young. The bad thing is that so many medical decisions are made in crisis without a lot of knowledge, so that young women who really want their babies are intimidated by professionals. They defer to them and end up aborting.\n\nHuman Life, Inc. Stella: So what do you think allows Planned Parenthood to get a pass when it comes to a healthy American skepticism of big business?\n\nWe don\u2019t see someone saying: \u2018I think you should have an abortion, but\u2014full disclosure\u2014I\u2019m two abortions away from my quota.\u2019 Maria: Again it\u2019s a glossy, women\u2019s-magazine way to cover up the fact that it\u2019s a huge business. That they\u2019re under pressure to talk you into an abortion. That they have quotas. Abby Johnson\u2019s book ,\u201cUnplanned,\u201d is all about that, how much pressure she was under as a clinic director to come up with the requisite number of abortions and make more money. So where\u2019s the healthy cynicism about this business, not to mention the laws insisting that clinics are clean? When a doctor talks about a drug, he needs to disclose whether or not he is paid. We don\u2019t see someone saying: \u201cI think you should have an abortion, but\u2014full disclosure\u2014I\u2019m two abortions away from my quota.\u201d\n\nStella: When we\u2019re talking about the life issues\u2014abortion, cloning, embryonic stem cell research, assisted suicide, euthanasia\u2014is there a certain point at which we just say we\u2019re dealing with eugenics?\n\nMaria: I think from the very beginning we were dealing with eugenics, because Margaret Sanger [who founded Planned Parenthood] was a eugenicist. One of the driving forces behind liberalizing abortion laws was not really women\u2019s rights. It was eugenics. Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview with NYTimes Magazine: \u201cFrankly I had thought that at the time it [Roe v. Wade] was decided, there was concern about population growth, and particularly growth in populations that we don\u2019t want to have too many of.\u201d But she\u2019s not different from many other people. They\u2019re just smart enough not to say it. Richard Dawkins recently said if you have Down Syndrome, you should be killed. Why? I mean that\u2019s how the Holocaust started\u2014with disabled children. It\u2019s really been about that forever. Eugenics is also coming more to the fore in screening for characteristics in sperm and egg donors.\n\nStella: Is there any particular human life issue that you see as the biggest threat facing human dignity in the coming years?\n\nMaria: I would just say the biggest threat is what\u2019s happening at end of life or with sudden disabling and not having life support offered. Obamacare and incentives for saving money are reaching a boiling point. How are you going to feel safe? My father was prescient about that, that a doctor would become either a \u201cquality of life\u201d doctor or a \u201csanctity-of-life\u201d doctor. And there are going to be fewer and fewer sanctity-of-life doctors. If you are a sanctity-of-life doctor, who is going to back you up, hospital-wise, medicine-wise, insurance-wise?\n\nReaching Out When People Don\u2019t Want to Talk Stella: How can we help people of goodwill best understand what is really at stake? How can we make them more aware of their own human dignity as well as the dignity of others?\n\nThere\u2019s no one way to reach everyone. That\u2019s why the pro-life movement has to be so diverse and have so many different approaches. Maria: With the number of abortions we\u2019ve had in this country, it\u2019s hard to reach people. If you point out the evil of it, you\u2019re going to get a defensive response. So how do you try to start to say: \u201cWe\u2019re all human. We all make mistakes. There are a lot of pressures. Let\u2019s try to open our eyes, forgive ourselves, and move on.\u201d That\u2019s another reason being religious helps. Understanding that we\u2019re all sinners and we\u2019re capable of doing horrible things, but we can be forgiven. If you don\u2019t have that and you take pride in your behavior, it\u2019s just too crushing to see that your behavior is wrong. There are a lot of very good people who are pro-abortion. How do we reach them? What we do at the Human Life Review is try to appeal to people\u2019s brains and hearts. But there\u2019s no one way to reach everyone. That\u2019s why the pro-life movement has to be so diverse and have so many different approaches.\n\nStella: Going forward, where would you say the Human Life Review is headed, in terms of focus?\n\nMaria: We\u2019re going to be part of this counter-cultural movement now against Obamacare. There\u2019s a great opportunity to reawaken people\u2019s sense of right and wrong when it comes to these things. Question the authority of Obamacare. We want to give people the tools to work intelligently against these really inhuman policies. And we need to reach out more to popular culture. We need to have pro-life themes well represented in the arts. As Seth Lipsky of the New York Sun said: what the pro-life movement needs is an \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin,\u201d a great work of fiction or a movie that really shows people the humanity of the unborn.\n\nStella: The Human Life Review is no ordinary academic journal. It\u2019s astonishingly dynamic. What can you tell us about the diversity of the journal\u2019s contributors and its scope?\n\nMaria: We\u2019ve had famous people and we\u2019ve had brilliant academics contribute, but we\u2019ve also had an anonymous man write poignantly about how his father was euthanized\u2014\u201clet die\u201d in a hospital. I think our youngest contributor so far is a homeschooled young man whose pro-life speech won a speech contest. We\u2019ve had stay-at-home moms, and teachers, and one of our recent contributors is a wonderful man, retired, who volunteers at nursing homes and has a great perspective on end-of-life issues. We have academics who read the Review, but many of our most faithful cover-to-cover readers are not. They\u2019re businessmen, doctors, moms, dads.\n\nThe Review is meant to encompass a broad type of article and it\u2019s also meant to be a record. So part of our editing philosophy is to let people speak as much in their own voice as possible. And when you pick up a copy, there may be one article that\u2019s very journalistic, like Bill Murchison, who\u2019s a columnist and is one of our senior editors. His articles are wonderful. They read quickly. They\u2019re witty. And then you might have a real research paper by Mary Meehan, another senior editor. Or a truly thoughtful philosophical essay by our third senior editor, Ellen Wilson Fielding, Throughout you\u2019ll see that kind of combination. So we see it more like an orchestra, not one instrument.\n\nStella: Bravo!
