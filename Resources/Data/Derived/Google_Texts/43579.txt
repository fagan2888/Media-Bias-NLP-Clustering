NEW DELHI (AP) — Millions of yoga enthusiasts are bending their bodies in complex postures across India as they take part in a mass yoga program to mark the first International Yoga Day.

Tens of thousands of schoolchildren, bureaucrats, homemakers, soldiers and ordinary folk on Sunday spread their yoga mats across New Delhi’s main thoroughfare that has been transformed into one sprawling exercise ground.

Police are keeping vigil and security is tight as the crowd of yoga practitioners including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, members of his Cabinet and foreign diplomats are twisting and turning their bodies and meditating to mark the day.

Many believe that yoga, the ancient form of exercise, is the best way to calm the mind and the best form of exercise for the body.
