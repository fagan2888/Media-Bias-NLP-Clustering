In return, however, the companies must comply with a bevy of regulations that even the state calls \u201cextensive.\u201d\n\nIn June, fans of Uber and Lyft were up-in-arms after Virginia sent cease and desist letters demanding that Uber and Lyft shut down operations. Uber devotees even took to twitter with the hashtag #VANeedsUber and Uber vowed to continue operating despite the state\u2019s interference.\n\nGovernor Terry McAuliffe and Attorney General Mark Herring will now temporarily allow Uber and Lyft to resume operations in the state, provided that they comply with a long list of safety regulations. These include, among others, background checks of drivers, insurance requirements, and the maintenance of driver documentation which \u201cmust be available to DMV on demand to investigate any complaints, and must be available for periodic audits to ensure compliance.\u201d\n\nVirginia also stipulates that if Uber or Lyft fail to meet the requirements, the DMV can revoke the company\u2019s operating authority.\n\nWhile some safety regulations can certainly be seen as reasonable, the attempt to showcase the Virginia government\u2019s mighty power in reference to these innovative companies is exactly the reason the Republican National Committee spoke out on Uber\u2019s behalf Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhy should any company have to fight the government tooth-and-nail just to be a given a chance to compete?\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said. \u201cThe issue is larger than Uber. How many companies, how many products, how many innovations have died prematurely because the government over-reached and interfered in the free market? Government has a role to play, but that role isn\u2019t to protect the status quo.\u201d\n\nUber and Lyft\u2019s ability to operate has only been granted on a temporary basis until Virginia can complete a study on a long-term legislative solution to the current traffic jam between Uber, Lyft and taxi companies. The study is to be completed in time for the 2015 legislative session.\n\nThat may be why Uber isn\u2019t counting its chickens just yet. In an e-mail to users, Uber said that while the temporary agreement will enable it to operate in the short-term, \u201cthe work isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need your voice again in January when legislators are back in session,\u201d the company said, \u201cto make sure they pass legislation that permanently allows us to operate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Passenger Christina Shatzen gets into a car operated by a driver for Lyft.
