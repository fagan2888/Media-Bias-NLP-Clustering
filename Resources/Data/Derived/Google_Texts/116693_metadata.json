He is currently the Chief Engineer at Rantec Power Systems in Los Osos and has previously worked as a self-employed engineering consultant.\n\nHe has never held a publicly elected office.\n\nRandol White: Welcome to \u201cIssues and Ideas.\u201d\n\nSteve Isakson: Thank you very much.\n\nRW: And just quickly, how long were you in Antartica? You were there during the time that planes could not come in and out.\n\nSI: Fourteen months. For 10 of those months nobody came to visit at all. We were isolated.\n\nRW: Five of you.\n\nSI: Just five of us.\n\nRW: Anyone who\u2019s seen \u201cThe Martian\u201d recently can relate to what it was somewhat like, you know, for you during that period. OK, back to the topic at hand. This is not your first time running for this Congressional seat. You ran in 2014 as well. Can you explain what drives you to run for it each term?\n\nSI: What drove me initially the first time was I looked at what Congress was doing, which was nothing. The dysfunction was horrible. Things such as when a bill comes to Congress proposed by the president, and it\u2019s dead without even being read. It\u2019s not been released yet and they just say it\u2019s dead on the floor. That\u2019s dysfunction. That\u2019s just one party saying I\u2019m going to stand on this side, you\u2019re going to stand on that side and we won\u2019t talk.\n\nRW: And so how would you work to change that when a lot of people who run for Congress say they\u2019re tired of how Congress is operating. Polls show that the American public is almost entirely on that side with them. What would be your method for getting things to work?\n\nSI: Obviously I can\u2019t do everything by myself but one advantage I would have as an independent is, and I will remain an independent, is both sides will talk to me. I could hold parties if need be and bring the two sides together because I\u2019m somebody that\u2019s not \u2018the other side.\u2019 Many decades ago off the floor the two sides were very friendly and attended parties and such. I gather at this point that\u2019s almost probably nonexistent. I think it exists a little more in the Senate but not in the House. As an independent I can talk to each side, work with them, and hopefully benefit. The other point would be to encourage others to do the same thing. There\u2019s more power in numbers to try to change the dysfunction that\u2019s going on there now.\n\nRW: Your website runs down some of the issues that you believe are important and I think it\u2019s a good representative list of issues that are important to residents here on the central coast, so I want to touch on a few of those. On climate change you are not a denier but it\u2019s more nuanced than that. Can you explain?\n\nSI: I have little doubt that some climate change is occurring. But climate change in general is, in general everything\u2019s warming up. You look at the drought right now. The fact that we\u2019re having a drought isn\u2019t really climate change. If you look at the cycles about every 22 years we have a major drought that lasts several years in this area. So the existence of the drought isn\u2019t an indication of climate change. Now, this particular drought is a little bit longer than most droughts and we\u2019ve seen that pattern in several cycles coming up.\n\nRW: It\u2019s more severe, with warmer temperatures.\n\nSI: Yes, and so that may be an indication of climate change. Also, they used to call it global warming. Well, climate change isn\u2019t necessarily global warming. It\u2019s been shown that if things keep changing on the East Coast during the winters, it will simply get colder and things will ice over because of changes in the ocean. So climate change is something that\u2019s occurring. There\u2019s little doubt that emissions, carbon emissions and methane emissions, are contributing to that. It\u2019s also\u2014we will adapt to some of the climate change. Water, during a drought period, is pretty severe. If the droughts continues to get worse, that will get\n\nRW: Yes. You said the government can help when it comes to our drought cycles and I assume you\u2019re also referring to the groundwater situation in North County, San Luis Obispo. How exactly do you believe government intervention can play a constructive role in this area?\n\nSI: Most of the action is probably on the local level, such as the desal plants, what have you, or putting in regulations for low-flow toilets, that sort of thing. But some of the research that can be done on more of the federal level is encourage more efficient watering techniques for the farmers even, to use less water. In California I think like 90% of the water usage is on farms so that\u2019s a major area that could benefit from the research on how to reduce the water usage to go on at the federal level because that would be useful across the nation. They can also help fund, actually, believe it or not, power plants, the desal plants, their high cost is to a large extent, not totally, coming from the power usage. If we encourage more solar farms, for instance, that power could be transferred\u2014if desal plants were actually building the solar plants, maybe with federal encouragement, federal funds, then the cost of desal plants would be decreased.\n\nRW: Speaking of power plants, PG&E is currently asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew its operating permits for the two reactors at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. You say it may not make economic sense to continue its operation.\n\nSI: Well, that would be true. Nuclear power is a very expensive form of power. It does have pluses and it\u2019s a good baseline power feed for the network. Seven percent of the power comes from Diablo Canyon\u2014for California R: For California. Yes, currently California depends heavily on Diablo. SI: So if you just cut it off you may see a lot of rolling blackouts because there\u2019s limited power from here to there. But there are several solar farms now in the California Valley area, for instance, that have provided quite a bit of power and there\u2019s plenty of room out there to expand that and create more power. I think that\u2014and the cost of the solar power is actually getting to be less than maintaining Diablo Canyon. It would be in PG&E\u2019s best interest to develop the facilities. There\u2019d have to be storage that would go along with it to build out more solar farms and actually reduce the costs of running the PG&E system.\n\nRW: How do you feel about Diablo from an environmental perspective? What about the waste and the concern about the seismic activity where Diablo is located?\n\nSI: There are a lot of concerns with Diablo Canyon. I think in general nuclear power has proven relatively safe compared to carbon emissions and it does provide the base loads for some things. But I think the estimate on the Fukushima accident is something like $500 billion dollars of damages, and hey, accidents do happen. They may not be likely but they can happen and destruction of that nature, when nobody\u2019s .responsible for it, and if the damages occur, PG&E\u2019s liability is quite limited on that, and so it was designed for a 40- year life, and they\u2019re trying to extend it to 60? I\u2019d want to make sure that those safety plans are locked down to beyond question and I would personally just as soon do away with their release from liability, get rid of Price Anderson and make the shareholders of PG&E liable for any damages they do with the thing. That would encourge them, at least, to make sure it\u2019s safe, because it\u2019s their money that\u2019s on the line.\n\nRW: Since we\u2019re talking energy, Phillips 66 is proposing a rail spur to the company\u2019s Santa Maria refinery, just west of Nipomo, and communities all along the rail line are expressing concern over an increase in oil trains that this would create if approved. Can you share with us your thoughts on whether this project should move move forward in terms of bringing increased oil by train to the Phillips 66 refinery?\n\nSI: From what I know of the situation in general I would tend to discourage it, because I don\u2019t think rail is as safe\u2014as many people say, despite the rates of accidents, pipelines seem to be a safer and more economical way to import it. Now what they\u2019re talking about and I haven\u2019t found any evidence of this, is just a temporary increase because we lost a pipeline and we need to look at maintenance, that might be feasible as long as they\u2019re bringing in the safety needs to handle anything that happens. I can imagine rail cars going over the Cuesta Grade, well, it happens all the time, I\u2019m certain, an accident along in that area, and some of the tight turns up there, it might be too probable. So I\u2019d want to see them put some safety precautions in place. I\u2019d prefer a limited lifetime while they make up, perhaps, for all the oil they\u2019re losing from the breakage of the pipeline at this point.\n\nRW: Yes, the breakage of that pipeline along the Gaviota coast really brought renewed attention to the oil-drilling operations in the Santa Barbara Channel. What are your thoughts on offshore drilling in California as a means to extract oil and gas?\n\nSI: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough to justify the risks associated with it. I\u2019ve seen enough studies, that area around Santa Barbara has actually sunk a little bit and from my background in physics I can understand how that might encourage a few earthquakes here and there over the years, not frequently, but it could happen. And certainly even during the middle of the oil spill cleanup some more oil was found that is believed just to be seepage from those areas, and so I would not tend to encourage it at all and certainly I would not want to see oil derricks off my coast anyway, that\u2019s part of the reason I live here.\n\nRW: Do you have similar thoughts on fracking as a means to extract oil and gas?\n\nSI: Fracking concerns me even more because I saw one study that some of the fracking oils takes five times as much energy, to get six gallons out you have to put in five gallons, so you get a very small yield out of that and you\u2019re just adding to the carbon emissions.\n\nRW: Now, you say that it would not be wise to repeal at this point the Affordable Care Act known as ObamaCare. Can you talk a little bit about where we stand with that act and how you believe things should move forward?\n\nSI: The Affordable Care Act has has provided insurance to more people, allowing them to get more medical care and it has benefited us in a lot of ways like doing away with pre-existing conditions. At one point I had troubles getting insurance because all the insurance companies wanted to put on a lot of pre- existing condtions, just in case, and so for a couple years it would be limited. So ObamaCare has been limited in that respect. It does seem that the costs for an awful lot of people have gone up and mostly those costs have been given to the insurance companies, is they\u2019ve got, since you\u2019re required to get insurance, they have a group of people who have to get insurance, so you can\u2019t get out of it, so I think the costs have gone up for a variety of reasons, partially the benefits, partially the populace that has to get insurance. So I don\u2019t want to get people out of it but I would like to see ways of getting costs down. One proposal some people make is the single payer system, because the overhead, usually the government system might be 5% overhead whereas insurance companies tend to charge 20% overhead more. I\u2019d look into it. There are sometimes disadvantages on it so it has to be studied and I don\u2019t have the details of all that. But I would like to bring the costs down rather than allowing people to go uninsured again.\n\nRW: Do you see ObamaCare somewhat as like a hybrid car between gasoline and electric cars, there had to be sort of that inbetween?\n\nSI: That\u2019s what it\u2019s appearing. It got it into place, it got people insured, providing it, the government\u2019s involved with some of that but it\u2019s a hybrid at this point.system where we didn\u2019t want to interfere with industry at all but we still got some of the benefits.\n\nRW: What are your views on campaign finance? You said prior to our interview that you likely won\u2019t be bringing in the big money as some of the other candidates will in this race. How do you feel about that?\n\nSI: A lot of the dysfunction occurring in Congress, in my opinion, is because the people there are getting their campaign funds from bigger donors, directly or indirectly, and they don\u2019t want to upset the apple cart. Even Donald Trump at one of the debates recently was asked, you\u2019ve given money to a lot of different candidates, why do you do that? \u201cWell, it\u2019s because I\u2019m looking for favors,\u201d was his reply, and I was taken aback that he even said that. It might be reality but for someone to nonchalantly say, well, I\u2019m looking for favors, that\u2019s why I\u2019m giving out the money, while it might be legal, it tends to make everyody in Congress who\u2019s taking said donations, you\u2019re not really voting for them, you\u2019re voting for their donors at that point, because they\u2019re going to bend over backwards for their\n\nRW: Well, Steve Isakson from Atascadero, the latest to enter the race for the 24th Congressional District, thank you so much for joining us here on \u201cIssues and Ideas.\"\n\nSI: Thank you very much, I appreciated your bringing me in.\n\nRW: And you are listening to KCBX, central coast public radio.
