It's just sound bites.\"\n\n\n\nI watched the Freedom Summit in Iowa Saturday on my computer at home. As our governor spoke, I was exchanging texts with a state legislator who will remain nameless.\n\nI bet the legislator a six-pack of beer that Chris Christie will enter the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s yet to mention a stance on an issue,\u201d he wrote me. \u201cIt\u2019s just sound bites.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I wrote back. \u201cNow gimme my beer.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Christie took exactly the position you\u2019d expect a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination to take: Say nothing; but sound determined when you say it.\n\nAfter all, that worked for Mitt Romney last time around. Remember how he used to pound the dais and proclaim that his first act in office would be to repeal Obamacare?\n\nIn fact, Romney invented the Obamacare approach when he was Massachusetts governor. (See video below) Republicans remain in denial about this, and I\u2019d never heard one mention it until Donald Trump did Saturday. The Donald argued that Romneycare alone should keep Republicans from nominating Romney for the 2016 nomination.\n\nIt should indeed. But then it should have kept them from nominating him in 2012. They did it anyway. And then they professed shock when voters chose the real Obama over the imitation.\n\n\n\nAmong those who misread that race was Kellyanne Conway, a Fox News personality and pollster who spoke at the summit. The host introduced Conway with gushing praise for her polling skills, but I have a different recollection from my one encounter with her.\n\nThat came just 10 days before the 2012 election, when I was on a three-person panel with her before a Republican group in Morristown. When the moderator pressed us for our predictions, Conway said that \u201cI do believe Romney will win, and we will all go to bed early,\u201d according to a report of the event from the Morristown Green site. So did the other panelist.\n\nThat left it to me to inform the audience of the grim reality: \u201cMulshine predicted a very close vote but bet a six-pack it would be Obama,\u201d the article states.\n\nI didn\u2019t have any takers on that bet. Pat Murray certainly wouldn\u2019t have taken it. He\u2019s the head of the Monmouth University Poll with whom I\u2019d been consulting prior to that race.\n\nLike most professional pollsters, Murray noted that Obama was leading in the dozen or so swing states and therefore would cruise to a comfortable win. That\u2019s exactly what happened, yet on Election Day top Republican insiders were still predicting a Romney landslide.\n\nI saw little evidence from the speakers Saturday that things will be different next year. The contenders offered a variation on what Romney offered: We promise to drastically cut the federal budget \u2013 with the exception of course of Medicare, Social Security and defense.\n\nOf course, most of the budget goes to those three programs, so where would the candidates cut? Like Christie, they\u2019re not saying. To do so might cost support in crucial swing states like Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado.\n\nBut bashing big government is not a strategy that will work with swing voters, Murray said when I called him after the event.\n\n\u201cLook at these states. Their big concern is not big government,\u201d he said. \u201cBig government is okay if it\u2019s helping me out.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s reflected in the records of two of the last three Republican nominees for president. George W. Bush gave us the biggest Medicare expansion ever. Romney gave us the individual mandate to buy health insurance.\n\nAs for the third, John McCain wants a government big enough to run the entire world. On a talk show Sunday he called for more \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in places like Yemen. Insane as that is, it\u2019s more accepted by the mainstream GOP than the so-called \u201cneo-isolationism\u201d of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who did not attend the Saturday event and clearly would have been unwelcome.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Christie to sort this all out. I can\u2019t wait to hear how he plans to do it.\n\nWe certainly got no hint of that over the weekend. But we did get news Monday that Christie's crew is planning to set up an exploratory committee.\n\nAnd I\u2019m planning on enjoying that India Pale Ale.\n\n(Below: I don't know if the Donald was trying to help Christie with these remarks, but the way he demolished Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush leaves Christie as the most prominent mainstream hopeful standing - although Alan Steinberg makes a good case Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker could knock him from that perch. This is the reasoning behind Christie's run.)\n\nBy the way, the real name for the river in Des Moines is - ready for this? - the Des Moines River.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2016-presidential-election, chris-christie, columns, paul-mulshine, opinion", "title": "Denial is not a river in Des Moines: Chris Christie needs a new strategy (Mulshine)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Denial is not a river in Des Moines: Chris Christie needs a new strategy (Mulshine)\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/01/denial_is_not_a_river_in_des_moines_chris_christie.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njcom_photos/photo/2015/01/24/16852040-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15055798\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-27T12:52:22Z\", \"author\": \"Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"2016-presidential-election\",\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"chris-christie\",\"columns\",\"paul-mulshine\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njcom_photos/photo/2015/01/24/16852040-standard.jpg", "creator": "@Mulshine", "description": "Many top Republicans believed Mitt Romney would win in a landslide last time around despite his obvious flaws; if Chris Christie wants to be the presidential candidate next year he needs to come up with some new ideas fast.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, January 27, 2015, 10:55 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/njcom_photos/photo/2015/01/24/-85debd408aa20fd3.JPG\", \"author_name\": \"pmulshin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"2371\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Opinion\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Many top Republicans believed Mitt Romney would win in a landslide last time around despite his obvious flaws; if Chris Christie wants to be the presidential candidate next year he needs to come up with some new ideas fast.", "title": "Denial is not a river in Des Moines: Chris Christie needs a new strategy (Mulshine)", "url": "http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/01/denial_is_not_a_river_in_des_moines_chris_christie.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njcom_photos/photo/2015/01/24/16852040-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.mulshine"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, January 27, 2015,  7:52 AM", "article_author": "Paul Mulshine | The Star Ledger", "Description": "Many top Republicans believed Mitt Romney would win in a landslide last time around despite his obvious flaws; if Chris Christie wants to be the presidential candidate next year he needs to come up with some new ideas fast."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9715\"", "article_summary": "To do so might cost support in crucial swing states like Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado.\nBy the way, the real name for the river in Des Moines is - ready for this?\nI bet the legislator a six-pack of beer that Chris Christie will enter the 2016 presidential race.\nBut bashing big government is not a strategy that will work with swing voters, Murray said when I called him after the event.\nLike most professional pollsters, Murray noted that Obama was leading in the dozen or so swing states and therefore would cruise to a comfortable win."}
