Kentucky has been held up as one of the success stories of Obamacare, with its state-run exchanges running well and signing up thousands for health coverage.

But The Associated Press has reported that about 280,000 Kentuckians will have to give up their current health insurance and sign up for coverage that complies with the standards of the Affordable Care Act.

Kentucky officials say about 130,000 people will see their individual policies discontinued, while 150,000 small group policies will be canceled, AP reported.

SPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, linked to the article on his Twitter account as Republicans hammer away at President Obama for promising that people who like their health plans can keep them under his signature reforms.

The Obama administration is hoping that many of these people find affordable alternatives on their state-run exchange or through HealthCare.gov, which is supposed to help people in 36 states without state-run exchanges find coverage and take advantage of government subsidies that knock down their premiums.

However, HealthCare.gov and some state websites have been plagued by glitches that make it difficult for people to shop for coverage.

Time is of the essence because the White House may have to consider extending open enrollment past March 31 if the problems persist and more people lose coverage than gain it.

Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, has been one of Obamacare’s most enthusiastic backers, claiming in the past that the state’s insurance exchange would bring great benefits for the commonwealth.
