The investigation concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove a violation of federal law by Officer Wilson. The investigation concluded much more. The investigation concluded that physical evidence and witness statements corroborated Wilson's claim that Michael Brown reached into the car and struck the officer. It concluded that claims that Wilson reached out and grabbed Brown first \"were inconsistent with physical and forensic evidence.\" The investigation concluded that there was no evidence to contradict Wilson's claim that Brown reached for his gun. The investigation concluded that Wilson did not shoot Brown in the back. That he did not shoot Brown as he was running away. That Brown did stop and turn toward Wilson. That in those next moments \"several witnesses stated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson.\" That claims that Brown had his hands up \"in an unambiguous sign of surrender\" are not supported by the \"physical and forensic evidence,\" and are sometimes, \"materially inconsistent with that witness\u2019s own prior statements with no explanation, credible for otherwise, as to why those accounts changed over time.\"\n\nUnlike the local investigators, the Justice Department did not merely toss all evidence before a grand jury and say, \"you figure it out.\" The federal investigators did the work themselves and came to the conclusion that Officer Wilson had not committed \"prosecutable violations under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242.\" Our system, ideally, neither catches every single offender, nor lightly imposes the prosecution, jailing, and fining of its citizens. A high burden of proof should attend any attempt to strip away one's liberties. The Justice Department investigation reflects a department attempting to live up to those ideals and giving Officer Wilson the due process that he, and anyone else falling under our legal system, deserves. One cannot say the same for Officer Wilson's employers. The Justice Department conducted two investigations\u2014one looking into the shooting of Michael Brown, and another into the Ferguson Police Department. The first report made clear that there was no prosecutable case against one individual officer. The second report made clear that there was a damning case to be made against the system in which that officer operated: Ferguson\u2019s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City\u2019s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs. This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson\u2019s police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing, and has also shaped its municipal court, leading to procedures that raise due process concerns and inflict unnecessary harm on members of the Ferguson community. Further, Ferguson\u2019s police and municipal court practices both reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias, including racial stereotypes. Ferguson\u2019s own data establish clear racial disparities that adversely impact African Americans. The evidence shows that discriminatory intent is part of the reason for these disparities... Partly as a consequence of City and FPD priorities, many officers appear to see some residents, especially those who live in Ferguson\u2019s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue... The \"focus on revenue\" was almost wholly a focus on black people as revenue. Black people in Ferguson were twice as likely to be searched during a stop, twice as likely to receive a citation when stopped, and twice as likely to be arrested during the stop, and yet were 26 percent less likely to be found with contraband. Black people were more likely to see a single incident turn into multiple citations. The disparity in outcomes remained \"even after regression analysis is used to control for non-race-based variables.\" Related Story Blues Lives Matter One should understand that the Justice Department did not simply find indirect evidence of unintentionally racist practices which harm black people, but \"discriminatory intent\u201d\u2014that is to say willful racism aimed to generate cash. Justice in Ferguson is not a matter of \"racism without racists,\" but racism with racists so secure, so proud, so brazen that they used their government emails to flaunt it.\n\nThe emails including \"jokes\" depicting President Obama as a chimp, mocking how black people talk (\"I be so glad that dis be my last child support payment!\"), depicting blacks as criminals, welfare recipients, unemployed, lazy, and having \"no frigging clue who their Daddies are.\u201d This humor\u2014given the imprimatur of government email\u2014resulted in neither reprimand, nor protest, nor even a polite request to refrain from reoffending. \"Instead,\" according to the report, \"the emails were usually forwarded along to others.\" One should resist the urge to clutch pearls and carp about the \"mean people\" of Ferguson. Bigoted jokes are never really jokes at all, so much as a tool by which one sanctifies plunder. If black people in Ferguson are the 47 percent\u2014a class of takers, of immoral reprobates, driving up crime while driving down quality of life\u2014then why should they not be \"the sources of revenue?\" In this way a racist \"joke\" transfigures raw pillage into legal taxation. The \"joke\" is in fact an entire worldview that reveals that the agents of plunder, the police, are in fact not plundering anyone at all. They are just making sure the reprobates pay their fair share. That is precisely what Ferguson's officials told federal investigators: Several Ferguson officials told us during our investigation that it is a lack of \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d among African-American members of the Ferguson community that causes African Americans to experience disproportionate harm under Ferguson\u2019s approach to law enforcement. Our investigation suggests that this explanation is at odd with the facts. On the contrary the investigation \"revealed African Americans making extraordinary efforts to pay off expensive tickets for minor, often unfairly charged, violations, despite systemic obstacles to resolving those tickets.\" And while the investigation found no lack of \"personal responsibility\" among black residents of Ferguson, it did find that the very same people making the charge were often busy expunging fines for their friends: In August 2013, an FPD patrol supervisor wrote an email entitled \u201cOops\u201d to the Prosecuting Attorney regarding a ticket his relative received in another municipality for traveling 59 miles per hour in a 40 miles-per-hour zone, noting \u201c[h]aving it dismissed would be a blessing.\u201d The Prosecuting Attorney responded that the prosecutor of that other municipality promised to nolle pros the ticket. The supervisor responded with appreciation, noting that the dismissal \u201c[c]ouldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\u201d\n\nAlso in August 2013, Ferguson\u2019s Mayor emailed the Prosecuting Attorney about a parking ticket received by an employee of a non-profit day camp for which the Mayor sometimes volunteers. The Mayor wrote that the person \u201cshouldn\u2019t have left his car unattended there, but it was an honest mistake\u201d and stated, \u201cI would hate for him to have to pay for this, can you help?\u201d The Prosecuting Attorney forwarded the email to the Court Clerk, instructing her to \u201cNP [nolle prosequi, or not prosecute] this parking ticket.\u201d\n\nIn November 2011, a court clerk received a request from a friend to \u201cfix a parking ticket\u201d received by the friend\u2019s coworker\u2019s wife. After the ticket was faxed to the clerk, she replied: \u201cIt\u2019s gone baby!\u201d\n\nIn March 2014, a friend of the Court Clerk\u2019s relative emailed the Court Clerk with a scanned copy of a ticket asking if there was anything she could do to help. She responded: \u201cYour ticket of $200 has magically disappeared!\u201d Later, in June 2014, the same person emailed the Court Clerk regarding two tickets and asked: \u201cCan you work your magic again? It would be deeply appreciated.\u201d The Clerk later informed him one ticket had been dismissed and she was waiting to hear back about the second ticket. It must noted that the rhetoric \"personal responsibility\" enjoys not just currency among the white officials of Ferguson, but among many black people (\"black-on-black crime!\") who believe that white supremacy is a force with which one can negotiate. But white supremacy\u2014as evidenced in Ferguson\u2014is not ultimately interested in how responsible you are, nor how respectable you look. White supremacy is neither a misunderstanding nor a failure of manners. White supremacy is the machinery of Galactus which allows for the potential devouring of everything you own. White supremacy is the technology, patented in this enlightened era, to ensure that what is yours inevitably becomes mine.\n\nThis technology has proven highly effective throughout American history. In 1860 it meant the transformation of black bodies into more wealth than all the productive capacity of this country combined. In the 1930s it meant the erection of our modern middle class. In Ferguson, it meant funding nearly a quarter of the municipal budget: The City has not yet made public the actual revenue collected that year, although budget documents forecasted lower revenue than 10 was budgeted. Nonetheless, for fiscal year 2015, the City\u2019s budget anticipates fine and fee revenues to account for $3.09 million of a projected $13.26 million in general fund revenues... In a February 2011 report requested by the City Council at a Financial Planning Session and drafted by Ferguson\u2019s Finance Director with contributions from Chief Jackson, the Finance Director reported on \u201cefforts to increase efficiencies and maximize collection\u201d by the municipal court. The report included an extensive comparison of Ferguson\u2019s fines to those of surrounding municipalities and noted with approval that Ferguson\u2019s fines are \u201cat or near the top of the list....\u201d While the report stated that this recommendation was because of a \u201clarge volume of non-compliance,\u201d the recommendation was in fact emphasized as one of several ways that the code enforcement system had been honed to produce more revenue. The men and women behind this policy did not approach their effort to \"produce more revenue\" somberly, but lustily. As the fruits of plunder increased, Ferguson officials congratulated and backslapped each other: In one March 2012 email, the Captain of the Patrol Division reported directly to the City Manager that court collections in February 2012 reached $235,000, and that this was the first month collections ever exceeded $200,000. The Captain noted that \u201c[t]he [court clerk] girls have been swamped all day with a line of people paying off fines today. Since 9:30 this morning there hasn\u2019t been less than 5 people waiting in line and for the last three hours 10 to 15 people at all times.\u201d The City Manager enthusiastically reported the Captain\u2019s email to the City Council and congratulated both police department and court staff on their \u201cgreat work.\u201d It is a wonder they did not hand out bonuses. Perhaps they did. The bonus of being white in Ferguson meant nigh-immunity from plunder. The bane of being black in Ferguson meant nigh-inevitable subjugation under plunder. Plunder is neither abstract nor theoretical. Plunder injures, maims, and destroys. Indeed the very same people who were calling on protestors to remain nonviolent were, every hour, partner to brutality committed under the color of law: We spoke with one African-American man who, in August 2014, had an argument in his apartment to which FPD officers responded, and was immediately pulled out of the apartment by force. After telling the officer, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a reason to lock me up,\u201d he claims the officer responded: \u201cN*****, I can find something to lock you up on.\u201d When the man responded, \u201cgood luck with that,\u201d the officer slammed his face into the wall, and after the man fell to the floor, the officer said, \u201cdon\u2019t pass out motherf****r because I\u2019m not carrying you to my car.\u201d The residents of Ferguson do not have a police problem. They have a gang problem. That the gang operates under legal sanction makes no difference. It is a gang nonetheless, and there is no other word to describe an armed band of collection agents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Darren Wilson was innocent.
