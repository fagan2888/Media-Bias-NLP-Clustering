Some union plans could fit that definition, though not all.\n\nMany bigger businesses and unions, which employ other companies to act as their plan administrators, have already said they don\u2019t think this will go far enough to help them.\n\nBut they\u2019re not the only critics. Commercial insurers have said they need the payments from the reinsurance fund and any exemptions would make everyone else pay more than they should. GOP lawmakers have also been critical of what they describe as an effort by the administration to carve out an exemption to the tax specifically for the unions that were supportive of the health law and are now complaining about it.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services nodded to some of these criticisms in its rule, saying: \u201cSeveral commenters stated that the proposed exemption inappropriately treats self-insured plans with TPAs differently from self-insured, self-administered plans, and will inequitably shift reinsurance costs from self-insured, self-administered plans to self-insured plans with TPAs and health insurance issuers. Several commenters stated that the proposed exemption inappropriately favors \u2018union plans.\u2019\u201d\n\nFederal officials said in the rule they believed the plans were \u201ca unique subset\u201d and the exemption was narrowly drawn, and that as a result, \u201cwe estimate that the exclusion of self-insured, self-administered plans will have a small effect on the 2015 uniform contribution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The slew of regulations released by the Obama administration Wednesday to implement the federal health law included confirmation that some labor unions and businesses would get a break from the law's so-called belly button tax.", "title": "Some Unions Get Break From Health Law\u2019s \u2018Belly Button Tax\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/06/some-unions-get-break-from-health-laws-belly-button-tax/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Some Unions Get Break From Health Law\u2019s \u2018Belly Button Tax\u2019", "description": "The slew of regulations released by the Obama administration Wednesday to implement the federal health law included confirmation that some labor unions and businesses would get a break from the law's so-called belly button tax.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Louise Radnofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The slew of regulations released by the Obama administration Wednesday to implement the federal health law included confirmation that some labor unions and businesses would get a break from the law's so-called belly button tax.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-06T20:34:03-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/06/some-unions-get-break-from-health-laws-belly-button-tax/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-43965", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The slew of regulations released by the Obama administration Wednesday to implement the federal health law included confirmation that some labor unions and businesses would get a break from the law's so-called belly button tax.", "title": "Some Unions Get Break From Health Law\u2019s \u2018Belly Button Tax\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/06/some-unions-get-break-from-health-laws-belly-button-tax/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-43965", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-06T20:36:54-05:00"}, "article_summary": "The slew of regulations released by the Obama administration Wednesday to implement the federal health law included confirmation that some labor unions and businesses would get a break from the law\u2019s so-called belly button tax.\nSome union plans could fit that definition, though not all.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services nodded to some of these criticisms in its rule, saying: \u201cSeveral commenters stated that the proposed exemption inappropriately treats self-insured plans with TPAs differently from self-insured, self-administered plans, and will inequitably shift reinsurance costs from self-insured, self-administered plans to self-insured plans with TPAs and health insurance issuers.\nFor 2015, the fee has been set at $44 \u2014 but it won\u2019t apply to any plan that is both \u201cself-insured\u201d and \u201cself-administered,\u201d the Wednesday rules say.\nCommercial insurers have said they need the payments from the reinsurance fund and any exemptions would make everyone else pay more than they should."}
