COLUMBUS, MISS. (WCBI) – – Lowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, has confirmed that the victim is Brandon Michael Gordon, 25, of Columbus. According to Interim Police Chief, Fred Shelton, police believe the young man was shot around Florence Street, then fled to Beech Street where he was found behind a home. Gorden called 911 and police tried pinging his phone to find his location in an attempt to save his life.

“We received the 911 call about 1:40 p.m. concerning the person that had been shot laying in the backyard at that address. Upon arrival, we located a young man that had been shot. He was calling the ambulance, he was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead,” said Interim Chief Shelton.

A resident of the home, Alexis Rice, was in the house with her brother when police started to put crime scene tape around their yard.

“I was in my room just watching a couple of videos on YouTube, and then I just heard doors slamming, and I’m thinking like what’s going on? I’m thinking it’s my brother or something, that’s why I ran into the living room to see what was going on,” said Alexis Rice.

She had no idea what was going on because she never heard or saw anything until cops arrived.

“Yeah, I’m in shock because it happened like in the back of my yard,” said Alexis Rice.

Officers are trying to determine if or why a dispute happened, and what the motive for the shooting may be.

They are actively pursuing a lead to arrest a person of interest, but have not released a name.

Interim Police Chief, Fred Shelton says the Columbus Police Department will not stop until they solve this case.

“We’re on top of this. We’re making sure this doesn’t happen. If anybody has any information concerning this case, do give us a call,” said Interim Police Chief Fred Shelton.

Lowndes County Coroner, Greg Merchant, wouldn’t say how many times the victim was shot, and police say they are still unsure if the victim and shooter knew each other.
