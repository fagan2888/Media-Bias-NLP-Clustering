Robbinsville mayor Dave Fried threatens to sue Amazon over severe traffic problems he says have been caused by the company's presence.

Less than two weeks after threatening to sue retail giant Amazon, a small town New Jersey mayor is backing off.

Earlier this month, Robbinsville Mayor Dave Fried went after the online retail giant for creating a 'dangerous' gridlock situation in his town, which is home to one of Amazon's largest, most modern distribution centers. He said the town's infrastructure could not handle the company's surging holiday business.

"The last thing we want to do is shut down a warehouse before Christmas â€” especially a warehouse of this magnitude," Fried said on CNBC's "Fast Money. "Public safety is our first priority."

Amazon, which reports it has about 4,000 regular, full-time associates and additional seasonal employees at the Robbinsville location, sent a letter to the mayor with a traffic mitigation plan which would stagger its employees' hours to ease congestion.

"We are proud to be a catalyst for economic growth, and we also pride ourselves in being good neighbors... We are working hard to implement this new holiday staffing plan as expeditiously as possible," wrote Amazon.
