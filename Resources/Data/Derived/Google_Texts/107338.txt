The Connecticut Attorney General has proposed selling a historic ship to a nonprofit in order to pay off its $2.2 million debt.

The Amistad has been docked in New London since April. A judge Wednesday approved the cancelation of a trip to New Haven this fall and authorized the ship's receiver to spend up to $4,000 for repairs.

Attorney General George Jepsen proposed selling the state subsidized ship for $315,000 to Discovering Amistad Inc. in the hopes that it will preserve its educational mission.

The group plans to revise the ship's mission and make it less reliant on public funding.

New London Mayor Daryl Finizio says he hopes the new owners will keep the boat in the city.

The ship is expected to stay in New London until late October.
