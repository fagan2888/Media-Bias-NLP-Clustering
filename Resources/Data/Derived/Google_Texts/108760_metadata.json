They are often people living in poverty, and poverty is associated with a certain category and groupings of diseases,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be even harder for us to be able to spread our resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image Patricia Hogue, center, listens Wheatly's response to her question about student body diversity.\n\nMs. Wheatly, the former West Virginia University provost who has an academic background in biology and physiology, underscored her understanding of medical colleges and clinical operations, saying she worked closely with leaders at WVU\u2019s Health Sciences Center.\n\nAs a young student, she said some expected her to obtain a medical degree, but watching her mother battle and then succumb to breast cancer when Ms. Wheatly was 16 made her too emotionally \u201craw\u201d to pursue a medical profession.\n\nIn answers to audience questions, Ms. Wheatly affirmed her commitment to research and said universities should provide faculty with the infrastructure, time, and equipment needed to be successful. She also said that given the rising expense associated with research, that an institution the size of UT should identify its areas of strength and develop niche programs for research efforts.\n\nMs. Wheatly spent Thursday meeting with university faculty, staff, and students; she addressed about 200 people at her first forum, held on the main campus and streamed online. She said today that Thursday\u2019s forum was viewed online by about 1,000 people.\n\nThe other two candidates, Christopher Howard, president of the private Hampden-Sydney College, and Sharon Gaber, University of Arkansas provost, will come to Toledo next week. Each will participate in similar forums.\n\nMr. Howard is next up to meet members of the university community. He will participate in a 1:30 p.m. forum Monday at University Hall on the main campus.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2015/02/20/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z_cT/CTY-wheatly21-Michele-Wheatly.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By VANESSA McCRAY<br>BLADE STAFF WRITER", "description": "The University of Toledo Medical Center will be tasked with providing accessible, quality care while keeping an eye on cost in response to national health-care reform, said Michele Wheatly, a candidate for UT president.
