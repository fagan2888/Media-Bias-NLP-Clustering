College Football season is right around the corner and fans across the country are getting ready.

Saturday, the Panama City Seminole club did their part with their annual Kickoff Party.

Hundreds of Seminole fans got together at Sharky's Restaurant for food, fun and they even got to meet an FSU icon.

Legendary Florida State Defensive Coordinator Mickey Andrews gave the Seminole faithful a preview of how he thinks the team will do.

Proceeds from the event are donated to Florida State athletics.

"The club does lots of things with all the money we raise from the Jimbo Fisher event to the Kickoff Party to game watching parties we do here at Sharky's," said Chris Smith, Club President. "We use that money to pay for scholarships, we have a scholarship at FSU Panama CIty, we give $2,500 to a student here. You name it, we do it."
