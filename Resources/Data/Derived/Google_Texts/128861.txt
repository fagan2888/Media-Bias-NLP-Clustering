The event may have showcased what tomorrow's products could achieve but away from the limelight, there's a growing network of robotics manufacturers working hard to help integrate machines into defense and law enforcement.

U.S.-based iRobot, best known for selling 10 million vacuum cleaning robots worldwide including its popular Roomba model, also manufactures a family of four law enforcement machines. They are currently in use by government agencies across the world, with the majority being used by the U.S.'s partners at NATO. The company's robot range -- the FirstLook 100, the 310 SubV, the 510 Packbot and the heavy duty 710 Warrior – aren't humanoid but have been used in Afghanistan, at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant and were deployed by the police during the Boston bombings. They will also be used in Brazil for the upcoming Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.

Tom Phelps, director of Robotics Products North America at iRobot told CNBC in a telephone interview that the next step for the firm was developing its fleet so they can work better as a team – including increasing the radio range so that a police team can get a better remote view of a building or outside space.

"The trend will be to make sure that the family will work together more seamlessly," he said.
