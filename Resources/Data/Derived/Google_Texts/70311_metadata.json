Jerry told Mr. Obama, \u201cThank you, you pretty much saved my finances and you saved my life.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama replied, \u201cJerry, I know the story, of you\u2026 battling courageously against an illness and then you hitting lifetime limits potentially in insurance. One of the goals for the Affordable Care Act was not just to help people get insurance who didn\u2019t have it, it was to give better protections for people who already had insurance.\u201d\n\nThe President continued, \u201cYou were a perfect example of somebody who could be caught with debilitating bills or alternatively not being able to get the care you needed, so a lot of the protections essentially made existing insurance better for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nKeep reading for more from Jerry\u2019s exclusive with President Obama.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act: The Affordable Care Act could be unraveled in an upcoming Supreme Court vote. The President shared this message: \u201cDespite all the politics and noise around it, what\u2019s happened now is millions have health insurance who didn\u2019t have it before, people who did have health insurance before like you, Jerry, are much more secure in the insurance that they\u2019ve got, it\u2019s costing less than anybody expected, it\u2019s working well.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama also told Jerry, \u201cI get ten letters a night out of the 40,000 letters and emails and messages that we get, some of them are just saying thank you for something, some of them are saying you're an idiot\u2026\u201d Jerry asked, \u201cDo you answer the ones who call you an idiot? President Obama quickly answered, \u201cI do!\u201d Jerry asked, \u201cAre they surprised?\" President Obama responded, \u201cI think sometimes they are\u2026 I will tell you the number of stories I've gotten like yours\u2026 it\u2019s made a difference in a lot of people's lives.\u201dAs Jerry and the President strolled through the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Obama also talked about his teenage daughters, Malia and Sasha. \u201cThe truth is the girls are wonderful. They work hard, they work a lot harder than I ever did when I was a kid\u2026 most importantly, they\u2019re kind, they\u2019re respectful, they don\u2019t have an attitude. The President credited Michelle Obama\u2019s mother, Marian Robinson, with helping provide a \u201cnormal\u201d upbringing. \u201cPartly maybe because my mother-in-law was here and we said we don\u2019t want to see any attitude out of them, and they\u2019ve been terrific. They do think that their dad is sometimes a little embarrassing.\u201dWith his days in the White House winding down, Mr. Obama told Jerry he will take some of the furniture with him when he leaves office. \u201cA bunch of the furniture in this house, we bought\u2026 so there\u2019s a bunch of furniture here that\u2019s ours\u2026 sometimes people are surprised to hear we pay for all our groceries!\u201d The President admitted he will miss 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \u201cIt\u2019s a home inside this incredible, historical, monument, and we are extraordinarily privileged to be here.\u201d The first thing they will do when they leave the White House? \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that it won\u2019t be up to me, it will be up to Michelle.\u201dPresident Obama is known for being an avid sports fan, but he\u2019s not ready to take sides in the NBA championship. \u201cI think both teams are playing incredible basketball, Lebron is playing unbelievably, but Steph Curry, even though he\u2019s had a couple of bad games, I\u2019ve met him, he\u2019s a wonderful young man, a deserving MVP. My sense is he\u2019s gonna pick it back up, so who knows, but I\u2019m sure enjoying watching it.\u201d As for the NHL finals, there is no question of who the former Senator from Illinois is rooting for. \u201cBlackhawks!\u201d Jerry told him, \u201cYou\u2019re talking to a guy from Tampa Bay.\u201d The President laughed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my condolences.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After successfully battling melanoma and thyroid cancer, \u201cExtra\u201d correspondent Jerry Penacoli got a rare opportunity today to thank President Obama for saving his life with the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Extra", "description": "After successfully battling melanoma and thyroid cancer, \u201cExtra\u201d correspondent Jerry Penacoli got a rare opportunity today to thank President Obama for saving his life with the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Exclusive!
