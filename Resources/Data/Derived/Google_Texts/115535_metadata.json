On Monday, they could all be found on the Tarmac of Sundance Airport.\n\nAmong the owners: Carol Elliott who at 89 years old she's happy to show you her mind is still firing on all cylinders. She can name all the presidents and all the serial numbers to her classic cars.\n\nShe bought a 20 model Dodge touring car because it's just like the one her dad got when he returned home from World War I.\n\n\u201cHe got home and drove by the model T dealership real fast and went to Dallas and bought my Dodge and I still have it,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nShe'll take it, who she calls Bonnie, out Wednesday when the tour heads to Automobile Alley in downtown Oklahoma City.\n\nThroughout the week, the car owners are driving across Central Oklahoma, making daily stops along the way to show off their vehicles. They\u2019ll visit Chickasha on Thursday and Norman on Friday.\n\nThe Glidden tour is the oldest and largest antique car tour in America developed back in 1904 to demonstrate the reliability of the automobile.\n\n\u201cThe last time the Glidden tour was in Oklahoma was 1910, so every 105 years,\u201d said Chuck Mai, AAA spokesman.\n\nThis is Elliott's 20th Glidden tour but she doesn't do much driving anymore. Now, she hopes her son will take up her hobby, and more people will find restoring classic cars is right up their alley.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "For the first time in over a century the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.", "author": "Dana Hertneky", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/29937087/classic-car-tour-makes-stop-in-okc", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8708028_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For the first time in over a century the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.", "title": "Classic Car Tour Makes Stop In OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8708028_G.jpg", "description": "For the first time in over a century the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.", "card": "summary", "title": "Classic Car Tour Makes Stop In OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "classic-car-tour-makes-stop-in-okc", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/09/01", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Classic Cars", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS31", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Classic Cars"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c95\"", "article_summary": "For the first time in over a century, the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.\nFor the first time in over a century the AAA Glidden Classic Car Tour is in central Oklahoma.\nThe Glidden tour is the oldest and largest antique car tour in America developed back in 1904 to demonstrate the reliability of the automobile.\nThroughout the week, the car owners are driving across Central Oklahoma, making daily stops along the way to show off their vehicles.\n\u201cThe last time the Glidden tour was in Oklahoma was 1910, so every 105 years,\u201d said Chuck Mai, AAA spokesman."}
