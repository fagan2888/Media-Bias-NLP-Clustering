It is considered to be the largest such sweep in terms of the amount of money lost and the number of people arrested and charged.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch pointed out that one of those charged with fraud was a Miami-based medical health facility that had billed the Medicare for intensive psychotherapy procedures that amounted to tens of millions of dollars despite only transferring patients from one location to another.\n\nMany of the patients in the facility suffered from Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and they did not have the ability to communicate with alleged caregivers and therapists.\n\nIn California and Louisiana, four alleged companies received $22 million-worth of funds from Medicare for sending talking glucose monitors to patients regardless of whether they needed it or not.\n\nThe DOJ indicted one pain management physician in Tampa, Florida who was paid over $1 million for studies on nerve conduction and other services that never occurred.\n\nA home care company in Miami was given payments worth $2.5 million for services the facility never performed. The company sent the claim to Medicare even though six of the physicians listed almost never billed the healthcare program for seeing the same patients. One of the doctors disputed that he only saw four of the 188 patients the company claimed he did.\n\nNine people in Brooklyn, New York were charged by the Justice Department for two separate counts of fraud regarding occupational and physical therapy schemes.\n\nSylvia Burwell, secretary of the HHS, said that they are now more proactive in eliminating fraudulent claims to Medicare. She said that they have shifted from a \"pay and chase\" method when it comes to recognizing claims to more of a \"prevention model.\"\n\nBurwell said that the enforcement abilities of federal agencies have been bolstered courtesy of the Affordable Care Act, or more popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe health care law has provided the federal government an additional $350 million-worth of funds for efforts concerning prevention and law enforcement. It has allowed the DOJ to hire additional prosecutors and expand the agencies handling crackdowns to nine cities from the initial two.\n\nPhoto: National Museum of the U.S. Navy | Flickr\n\n\u00a9 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.
