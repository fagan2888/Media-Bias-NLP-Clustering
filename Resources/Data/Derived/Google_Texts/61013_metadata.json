We use it to check in with friends, keep tabs on family members, shop for jobs and new purchases, and stay abreast of the latest breaking news. And let\u2019s not forget the \ufb02ame wars in product reviews and comment sections. No matter your preferred means of self-expression, social media drastically expands your attackable surface for hackers.\n\nIf you want to minimize your exposure to the threat of identity theft, it is imperative that\n\nyou become master of your domain\u2014at least as it exists on other domains like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn. And by \u201cmaster\u201d I mean that you need to learn how to use it in a way that minimizes your exposure to the threat of identity theft.\n\nThe Pew Research Center\u2019s statistics for social media in 2014 showed that 74 percent of Americans used some form of social media, and more than 71 percent of these users have a presence on Facebook.\n\nWhile I\u2019m going to talk about Facebook here, feel free to pick your poison, because when it comes to social media, there isn\u2019t a company out there that doesn\u2019t make you an easier target for identity thieves. As far as the Three Ms go, the same thinking applies regardless of the venue. If you\u2019re going to use social media, you must take steps to minimize your exposure.\n\nSome people like the puppy pics and game app requests of Facebook, while others prefer the information river of Twitter or the career-focused content more native to LinkedIn. Some prefer to look at pictures and pithy memes on Instagram, while others just like liking things in the public way that Pinterest makes possible. Then of course there are all those gadgets and appliances\u2014there are 2.8 billion currently installed in the United States\u2014that fall under the category of the Internet of Things (e.g., Fitbit, Jawbone, or smart home devices like Nest; for more on this see Chapter 6), designed not only to make your life easier but also to feed your information to companies who use it for marketing, research, and product development. Virtually all of these devices invite you to share your personal information not just with their app but with the world as well, via social media. Often, the devices come preset to share everything with everyone, and you can only maintain your privacy if you change the right settings.\n\nEvery milestone achieved on your healthy lifestyle wearable, entered on a \ufb01tness website, or logged on a phone-based app; every hour logged sleeping and talking and watching television; every time your smart appliance makes you co\ufb00ee or turns on the morning news\u2014all of that is tracked, and, depending on the company, either comes with a default setting to tell your friends and followers on social media your every move as related to that device, or includes an easy way to share those things.\n\n#AlexFromTarget would have remained a humble checkout boy with a hip haircut had it not been for Twitter and Tumblr. He\u2019s one of the few examples of someone who found an upside to social media\u2014and troll me all you want, but I maintain that this upside does only apply to a few select users, even if we point to the growing army of microcelebrity, mega YouTubers or the assorted superaccounts on this or that platform. Even with all the stars launched on social media, including Justin Bieber, the odds that you\u2019re bene\ufb01ting from your pro\ufb01le remain miniscule.\n\nLike a Justin Bieber also-ran, Alex Lee\u2019s odd luck put him within easy reach of fame and fortune. But that\u2019s not how it usually works. Generally, social media serves only as a time-suck and an open door through which any bad player can glean what\u2019s needed to steal your identity.\n\nSocial media makes you vulnerable to identity thieves in ways that most people aren\u2019t thinking about. They all know that some of their \u201cfriends\u201d may be weirdos, or possibly even criminals\u2014but even so, they still put their personal information where it can be seen by those \u201cfriends.\u201d It de\ufb01es logic.\n\nIn a SUNY\u2013Bu\ufb00alo study published in 2014, Facebook users were asked about a phenomenon called farcing\u2014friending a target with a fake account that looks like it comes from someone they know. Most of the users they talked to were aware of the dangers\u2014 that among all those they counted as Facebook friends, there were possibly a few scammers\u2014but that understanding didn\u2019t have a big e\ufb00ect on the ways they used the site. The underlying belief was that \ufb01nancial harm (or worse) wouldn\u2019t come about as a result of their information being on the site. (It\u2019s important to bear in mind that while the focus in the above study was on Facebook, farcing happens on every social media platform.)\n\nUnfortunately, we know this to be a false assumption. Identity thieves do not need much of your personal information to scam you, and what they need may be in the \u201cabout\u201d silo of your timeline. It could be in a tagged photo, or, as we saw in the Science study on unicity and the reidenti\ufb01cation of anonymized data, it could be a picture of your lunch or cocktail on Instagram coupled with a tweet or Facebook status update that provides that last piece of the puzzle that a scammer needs to access your credit.\n\nA few years ago I read a story about a newly instituted (and quickly suspended) employment screening policy of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. There was the usual stu\ufb00 you might expect in the job seeking process\u2014you had to complete an application that included a bunch of personally identi\ufb01able information\u2014but there was an extra piece of information requested that gave one applicant pause: The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services had requested his Facebook username and password.\n\nRobert Collins had previously worked for the department. He took a leave of absence after his mother died, and when that came to an end he applied for a job at another facility under the\n\noversight of the corrections department. This process involved being recerti\ufb01ed for employment in a job that involved regular contact with criminals. It was an admittedly sensitive hire, and the employer in this instance really did have to do a good job screening potential hires. The wrong person could cause serious problems, ranging from the proliferation of illegal substances within prison walls to smuggling prisoners weapons to aiding and abetting an escape.\n\nThe Internet ages very fast, and by any measure, 2011 was a very long time ago in the realm of things digital. But the behavior that Collins reported was inexcusable even at the time. According to Collins, his interviewer did not ask for, but rather demanded, his Facebook username and password.\n\nNow, imagine you need a job. You know the process is winding down to a last sanity check\u2014where the prospective employer calls a few people to make sure you\u2019re not a loony\u2014and then you\u2019ll get an offer. You can tell. Now, imagine you\u2019re sitting in an o\ufb03ce waiting for them to make that next move, and instead you get this curveball: \u201cDo you mind if we poke around your Facebook account?\u201d What would you do? If you are like a lot of people, including Robert Collins, you\u2019re going to hand over the keys to your Facebook account, or whatever other account the gatekeeper asks to see. The interview process is intense. You\u2019ve gotten this far. It\u2019s simply too hard to \ufb01nd a job, and the stress is too great not to acquiesce to such a request\u2014 no matter how wrong it seems\u2014when the alternative is not getting the job o\ufb00er. And you are pretty careful about what you post, right? There aren\u2019t any embarrassing pictures of you. What about your private messages? Are you careful there, too?\n\nSo what happened at Mr. Collins\u2019s interview?\n\n\u201cHe logged into my account and went through my pages, my posts, my messages, all my pictures, things like that,\u201d Collins told a reporter, not long after it happened. This private a\ufb00air had become a news story because, immediately following the interview, Collins contacted the American Civil Liberties Union. When the ACLU got in touch with the Department of Corrections about the incident, the explanation demonstrated two things: that no one there had thought much about the parameters native to privacy and social media\u2014much less about best practices\u2014and that they didn\u2019t really understand why requesting login information might be a problem.\n\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say there was a question on the application about social media (i.e., do you use it?), and if the answer was yes, the follow-up gave the option of providing an applicant\u2019s login information \u201cfor screening purposes.\u201d In other words, it was yet another one of those \u201cvoluntary\u201d items that an employer can review\u2014like your credit report or a drug test\u2014to determine if they should hire you. And once asked for their information, who wouldn\u2019t feel some pressure to say yes? Doubtless there would be plenty of applicants willing to hand over the keys to their likes, dislikes, and online behavior\u2014including the way it chronicles their behavior in real life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thieves -- plus your bosses and exes -- are trolling Facebook for your details.
