What are the top three considerations a company should make before adopting a new technology?

ROBERT HOWELL: Assuming that there is a cheaper, low-cost, technological development “available” to replace legacy business technology, the three top considerations a company should consider before adopting the new technology are, first, is the new technology proven enough or are there still uncertainties about its quality, reliability, and services; second, are the purported improvements significant enough to justify the change, and the implications of making a change on organizational dynamics; and third, do the total economics support making the change. There are a number of historical examples of next generation hardware and software evolutions, for example desk top and personal assistant devices and office suite upgrades, where the hardware and software turned out not to be as unique or as developed as initially expected and for which software glitches undid the purported promises and benefits. Obviously, there are no perfect answers when considering new technological developments’ value equation, but going into them with some caution and openmindedness is appropriate.
