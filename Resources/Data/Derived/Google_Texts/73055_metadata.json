Instead of universal coverage, we have a universal nightmare that\u2019s still there when we wake up. What went wrong?Pretty much everything went wrong. That Obamacare isn\u2019t working as advertised should surprise no one. Giant, complicated government-constructed machines always bring unexpected results. This one is more giant and complicated than most.The Affordable Care Act is so complex because it took major compromises just to get all the Democrats aboard. Recall that in the 2008 primaries, Barack Obama opposed the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d he now defends so vigorously. Hillary Clinton insisted the mandate was critical. She eventually got her way, despite losing the nomination.On the other hand, we can\u2019t claim the system was working fine before Obama broke it. Back in 2008, many of us thought health care couldn\u2019t possibly get worse.Then we got Obamacare. Oops.The program\u2019s failure to rein in high costs \u2013 especially drug costs \u2013 forced insurers to hike their 2016 rates, sometimes dramatically. Because the Obamacare tax credits track income rather than the cost of coverage, lower-income people saw their net costs jump the most.My own insurance agent gave me an awful report from the trenches last week. This is someone who\u2019s been in the business a long time but says he never saw anything like this.Even lifelong Democrats are seething with anger and frustration, he said. He knows exactly why, too.\u201cI have clients who get decent subsidies who can't afford the insurance. Families in the $20k to $40k range had great subsidies in the first two years, getting full PPO plans for $150 to $250 per month. Then the rates jumped, the subsidies stayed the same, and the coverage got worse. What looked like a great deal to those on the lower end is now an empty suit.\u201dAn empty suit, indeed. The low-income consumers whom Obamacare was supposed to help just saw their rates skyrocket and their benefits sliced.Do the math. If a family making $40,000 have to pay $400 a month, after subsidies, for partial coverage and another $100 on co-pays and deductibles, that\u2019s 15% of their income.They are probably still unhealthy, too. Obamacare did nothing to help them and may even be hurting them.The real scary part is we\u2019ve only touched the surface. Next year the penalty for not having coverage rises to $695 or 2.5% of your income, whichever is higher.For many folks, that \u201cpenalty\u201d will be far less than it costs to buy insurance that is unusable because they can\u2019t afford to pay the deductibles. They will take the penalty hit.If enough people make that perfectly rational choice, Obamacare will enter the death spiral many predicted.Obamacare\u2019s next line of defense is the employer mandate, which expands in 2016 to include companies with as few as 50 full-time employees. I predict many will do their duty by offering coverage, but it will be such a bad deal the employees won\u2019t take it.What can anyone do about all this?Not much, for now. The GOP court challenges have accomplished little. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s, R-Fla., cut to the \u201crisk corridor\u201d feature drew a little blood, but it also gave insurers another reason to raise prices.I agree with the Republican goal of replacing Obamacare. I disagree with the piecemeal strategy.Rubio in particular seems not to understand what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: \u201cNever strike a king unless you are sure you shall kill him.\u201dOpposing Obamacare by making it even worse serves only to increase suffering for average citizens. Better to let it die on its own \u2013 which it will \u2013 and have an alternative ready to take its place.What that alternative will be is debatable. The fact that we\u2019ll need it is not.
