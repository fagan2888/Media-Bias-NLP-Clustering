He sees about one to two gun injuries every shift he works.\n\n\u2018To have starved our society of research in this matter for 20 years is really difficult to justify.\u2019\n\nHarrison Alter, Highland Hospital ER doctor\n\n\u201cThese are young people,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an enormous amount of human potential that\u2019s lost to a lifetime of colostomy bags and pressure sores and wheelchair ramps. And there\u2019s real fear in their eyes.\u201d\n\nAlter says there\u2019s a serious lack of research that could help prevent gun injuries. In 1996, gun lobbyists accused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of promoting gun control, and Congress threatened to cut the agency\u2019s funding. A rider attached to an appropriations bill banned the use of federal money on studies that promote gun control.\n\nBut the effect was more broad: Out of fear of losing its funding, the CDC stopped conducting or supporting studies into the public health effects of gun violence.\n\n\u201cSo that sort of wiped out a generation of firearm injury researchers,\u201d Alter says. \u201cTo have starved our society of research in this matter for 20 years is really difficult to justify.\u201d\n\nToday he says there are fewer than 20 medical researchers dedicated to studying gun violence. One of them is Garen Wintemute, an ER doctor at UC Davis Medical Center.\n\n\u201cLet me draw a contrast between firearms and motor vehicles,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the 1960s, death rates from car accidents were going up every year. It was a true epidemic on the highway, Wintemute says.\n\n\u201cSo we mobilized. We recognized the problem, we put smart people in charge, and we gave them money to do research,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicymakers asked for recommendations, and turned them into new policy and regulation.\u201d\n\nAdvocates pushed car manufacturers to install airbags; cars were re-engineered to make them safer. Since then, Wintemute says motor vehicle death rates plummeted 60 percent, even though Americans are driving more.\n\n\u201cWith firearm violence, we\u2019ve done exactly the opposite,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have repeatedly, consciously, deliberately turned our back on the problem.\u201d\n\nWintemute thinks the reason is race politics. Gun violence is seen as a problem that mainly affects young African-American men killed on city streets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re people not like policymakers,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in age and ethnicity. And so it\u2019s easy not to take action.\u201d\n\nIn fact, gun suicides far outnumber gun homicides. More middle-aged white men die from self-inflicted gunshot wounds than men of color who die in gun homicides. Wintemute points this out when he meets with lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThese people look just like you, Senator,\u201d he says he tells them.\n\nWintemute says more research is needed to understand what the risk factors and patterns of gun violence are and what kinds of interventions work.\n\nRecently, 2,000 doctors signed a petition asking Congress to remove barriers to doing research like this. Some Democrats are trying. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said she would push to end the ban in the year-end funding bill.\n\nRep. Mike Thompson, D-Napa, hosted a forum for the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a gun guy. I\u2019m a hunter. I support the Second Amendment,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe law-abiding people have a right to own and use firearms.\u201d\n\nBut he says those rights can be protected at the same time experts conduct research.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the debate that we\u2019re having, the issue of gun safety or gun violence prevention, is in conflict with the Second Amendment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an either-or.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans and the National Rifle Association have resisted.\n\n\u201cIf efforts were made to do a stringent, unbiased, all-inclusive evaluation on which laws actually work when it comes to reducing gun violence, that would be a different story,\u201d says Amy Hunter, NRA spokeswoman.\n\nShe says past CDC studies were \u201cbiased\u201d and questioned whether the agency could be trusted to do unbiased research now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not going to support efforts that do nothing but attempt to convince Americans that lawfully owned firearms are a public health menace,\u201d she says.\n\nBack in Oakland, where hundreds of people have been killed or assaulted with a gun this year, Dr. Harrison Alter says research would play an important role for the community.\n\n\u201cI think one thing research can do is restore hope,\u201d he says.\n\nTake cancer research that has led to more effective treatments. Or the car accident research that has led to safer child seats and cars. Alter believes they can do the same with guns.\n\n\u201cSo a situation that seemed hopeless, to thousands of families every year, now, there\u2019s hope,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s research.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressional action in 1996 effectively stopped all research into risk factors and patterns of gun violence.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Doctors Call for End to 20-Year Ban on Gun Violence Research\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/14\\/doctors-call-for-end-to-20-year-ban-on-gun-violence-research\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-14 07:07:36\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-14 17:57:31\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":122140,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Gun Violence\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/iStock_000075492037_Large-e1450105459397.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Congressional action in 1996 effectively stopped all research into risk factors and patterns of gun violence.", "title": "Doctors Call for End to 20-Year Ban on Gun Violence Research", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/14/doctors-call-for-end-to-20-year-ban-on-gun-violence-research/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/iStock_000075492037_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "gun violence,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the debate that we\u2019re having, the issue of gun safety or gun violence prevention, is in conflict with the Second Amendment,\u201d he says.\nRep.
