He said that would help hold down costs and have people go to less expensive urgent-care facilities where possible.\n\nAlso he said, \"If family members otherwise would be forced on other [health care] plans because of the complicated rules we have, this would allow family members to stay on the same plan.\"\n\nThe debate on Medicaid expansion came because the federal Affordable Care Act had intended that states would expand Medicaid to cover some of the poor who don't qualify for subsidies in the health marketplace, and it offered money to help. Several states turned it down, and sought waivers for plans they prefer instead.\n\nWard last year also pushed Healthy Utah, but House members balked at the long-term costs. They worried that Healthy Utah's wider expansion \u2014 and a 90-10, federal-state split \u2014 could attract more people than believed, and be more expensive than a smaller expansion even with a 70-30 split instead.\n\nWard said his bill contains a \"roll-back\" provision so that if the state ever finds a 90-10 split and a wider Medicaid expansion is more expensive, it would revert to the smaller expansion and 70-30 split.\n\nHouse leaders have said they do not believe a Healthy Utah-style proposal has the votes to pass the House. So House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, is drafting a proposal that he says would cover about a third of those in the uninsured gap. He says it would cover those who are the poorest, many of whom are homeless.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A doctor in the House is recommending that legislators adopt a form of Medicaid expansion that closely mirrors the \u201cHealthy Utah\u201d plan previously proposed by Gov.
