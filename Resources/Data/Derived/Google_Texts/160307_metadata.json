It also risks subverting some of the goals of the law the president is trying to protect,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u2019 editorial board said Monday.\n\nThe paper was referring to the Obama administration\u2019s picking and choosing which aspects of the Affordable Care Act to enforce, most recently with last week\u2019s announcement that employers with 50 to 99 employees would get a one-year exemption from the mandate to provide insurance for workers.\n\n\u201cRather than changing the mandate by fiat, President Obama should have asked Congress to fix the provision,\u201d the Times continued. \u201cOn the other hand, the Republicans who control the House have shown no interest in improving the law; they just want to kill it. So it\u2019s hard to fault Obama for not engaging in a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d\n\nBut despite blaming anti-Obamacare sentiment from Republicans in Congress, the West coast\u2019s largest newspaper said Obama should have made an effort to engage the co-equal branch.\n\n\u201cAnd with congressional Republicans cheering for the law to fail rather than trying to ensure its success, the administration doesn\u2019t have a lot of good options for solving the implementation problems it has encountered,\u201d the Times said. \u201cStill, it would be easier to defend its actions had it at least made an effort to work with Congress on the necessary fixes. And if it has to resort to bending deadlines and mandates, it should do so in a way that doesn\u2019t undermine the law\u2019s goals.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times seems to be part of a shift with mainstream media outlets questioning Obama\u2019s executive actions.\n\nLast week, the Washington Post argued that the Obama administration had its own mandate: to uphold the law passed by Congress.\n\n\u201cYes, Republicans have done everything they can to impede implementation of this law. Yes, their \u2018solution\u2019 \u2014 gutting the individual mandate \u2014 is an awful idea. And, yes, their public response to the administration\u2019s action was predictably over-the-top,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial stated.\n\n\u201cBut none of that excuses President Obama\u2019s increasingly cavalier approach to picking and choosing how to enforce this law,\u201d the Post continued. \u201cImagine how Democrats would respond if a President Rand Paul, say, moved into the White House in 2017 and announced he was going to put off provisions of Obamacare he thought might be too onerous to administer.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has said it has the authority under the Internal Revenue Code to make changes to the law, but the Post disagreed.\n\n\u201cBut the administration is unilaterally making distinctions between large businesses and medium ones; the latter group, which will get hit hardest and scream loudest when the employer mandate kicks in, will be treated more leniently,\u201d the Post continued. \u201cThe law is also explicit that the government should be enforcing penalties already; that\u2019s the plainest interpretation of Congress\u2019s intent. The administration shouldn\u2019t dismiss that without exceptionally good reason. Fear of a midterm shellacking doesn\u2019t qualify as good reason.\u201d\n\nUSA Today also weighed in last week, mostly critical of how the administration is unable to implement a law it support.\n\n\u201cThe latest example was Monday\u2019s decision to postpone, yet again, part of the mandate that most employers provide insurance,\u201d USA Today\u2019s editorial board said. \u201cYou can call that one either way. It is, indeed, a convenient way to defuse criticism in the fall elections. But it\u2019s also smart to get the details right before unintended damage is done. That is precisely where the administration has failed \u2014 missing its own deadlines for fulfilling parts of its own law.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and USA Today are three of the five major newspaper with a national reach. The other two papers have not deviated: The New York Times\u2019 editorial page has been consistently supportive of Obama and the health care law, while the Wall Street Journal has been consistently opposed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 6, "twitter": {"description": "Major newspaper editorial pages that President Barack Obama has generally been able to count on for support are now raising red flags about the White House's potential for executive overreach.    \u201cAlthough the administration may have the right motives, its aggressive use of executive power to change...", "title": "Liberal Newspapers Waking Up to Obama\u2019s \u2018Aggressive\u2019 Executive Power", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/17/liberal-newspapers-waking-up-to-obamas-aggressive-executive-power/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/399x6005.jpg", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "liberal, newspapers, waking, up, obamas, aggressive, executive, power", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, executive-orders, government, mainstream-media, media, obamacare, politics, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 9820, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "barack-obama,executive-orders,mainstream-media,obamacare,government,media,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 138, "description": "Major newspaper editorial pages that President Barack Obama has generally been able to count on for support are now raising red flags about the White House's potential for executive overreach.    \u201cAlthough the administration may have the right motives, its aggressive use of executive power to change...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/766181", "linkedin-count": 2, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Major newspaper editorial pages that President Barack Obama has generally been able to count on for support are now raising red flags about the White House's potential for executive overreach.    \u201cAlthough the administration may have the right motives, its aggressive use of executive power to change...", "title": "Liberal Newspapers Waking Up to Obama\u2019s \u2018Aggressive\u2019 Executive Power", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/17/liberal-newspapers-waking-up-to-obamas-aggressive-executive-power/", "image": {"width": 399, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/399x6005.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 600}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-17T17:45:00+00:00", "twitter-count": 384}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde86f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRather than changing the mandate by fiat, President Obama should have asked Congress to fix the provision,\u201d the Times continued.\n\u201cAlthough the administration may have the right motives, its aggressive use of executive power to change deadlines and weaken requirements sets an unwelcome precedent.\nIt also risks subverting some of the goals of the law the president is trying to protect,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\u2019 editorial board said Monday.\nLast week, the Washington Post argued that the Obama administration had its own mandate: to uphold the law passed by Congress.\n\u201cBut none of that excuses President Obama\u2019s increasingly cavalier approach to picking and choosing how to enforce this law,\u201d the Post continued."}
