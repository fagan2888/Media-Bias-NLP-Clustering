It\u2019s bad for our families, and our economy.\u201d\n\nBut not all Republicans agree; one is Irene Jacusis of New Port Richey, who was uninsured until now.\n\n\u201cI did not vote for Obama,\" she said. \"But I am so in love with this plan, with this health care plan, what can I do?\"\n\nShe knows that her party wants to repeal it. \"But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to,\" she said. \"There are too many people out there who need this and require it.\u201d\n\nShe says her husband Ronald died last year from a rare sarcoma because he waited too long to see a doctor after he felt a lump.\n\n\"If my husband had gone, if he had insurance at the time, when it was the size of a marble and had gotten an x-ray and taken care of it at stage 1 level, he would be alive today.\"\n\nAnother Republican who wants to keep the Affordable Care Act is Mary Fallon of St. Petersburg. She was a teacher for many years, but because she was paid from grant funds she didn\u2019t qualify for health insurance. She had to buy her own policy, but then she got sick. Hello, pre-existing condition.\n\nShe was between \u201ca rock and a hard place. If I canceled my insurance, I was uninsurable.\"\n\nIf she dropped the policy and got sick, she could lose everything.\n\n\u201cBy the time I canceled my policy I was up to $768 a month, so what is that, almost 10 grand a year? With $5,000 deductible. Do the math.\"\n\nThen came the Affordable Care Act and Healthcare.gov. After running into glitches, Fallon found her way to Johnnie Ruth Clarke health center in St. Petersburg. And a navigator, Johanna Santiago.\n\n\u201cIn a half hour she had my account set up, and I had a confirmation, a password, a login, and I was good to go,\" said Fallon, 49. \"This was December and I cried. I just held my hands up in the air. Thank you, god. Finally, some relief. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n\nNow her premium is $150 a month, she said. Her deductible is only one-third as much as it used to be.\n\n\u201c I have dental insurance!\" she said in wonder. \"And all the doctors that I do see, my dentist, my GYN, for a whole year I\u2019m paying less than I paid per month.\u201d\n\nFallon says she thinks the Affordable Care Act will help the economy. \u201cThe difference is now I can take the money that was going to that one insurance premium and I can go to the hair stylist,I can get my house repaired. I\u2019m spending money in my community. This is going to be a ripple effect, this is going to restart the economic engine. We have been so enslaved by the health insurance system.\u201d\n\nShe says people who have health care security -- such as veterans and Medicare patients -- need to see that others need health care, too. But she knows they don't think that way; as a registered Republican, she sees it in her mail.\n\n\u201cEvery day I receive four-color glossy postcards for the election from candidates. It\u2019s all hate mail. There\u2019s no platform or program for fixing the problem of insurance, there\u2019s just anti-Affordable Care. It\u2019s just anti-Obamacare, all this hate. There\u2019s no solution.\"\n\nPeggy Arvanitas of Seminole has been a Republican for decades. In fact, she helps get GOP voters out to the polls.\n\nAnd yet, on her car there\u2019s a bumper sticker that says \"I Heart Obamacare.\" Here\u2019s why: She lost her coverage last year when the company she worked for went under; she had to take a part-time job with no benefits.\n\nThen the health law kicked in. Since Jan. 1, she\u2019s had a Humana plan she likes. Because her income is low, she pays just $10 a month.\n\nWhen Arvanitas finishes her business degree and passes the CPA exam, she says, her income will go up, and the premium will, too. She sees that as sensible and fair.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a Democrat or Republican issue,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a health care issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "By now, the Republican Party\u2019s view of the Affordable Care Act should be pretty familiar, as in this ad from David Jolly: \u201cI\u2019m fighting to repeal Obamacare", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/some-republicans-love-obamacare", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201402/Irene_Jacusi_smiling.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By now, the Republican Party\u2019s view of the Affordable Care Act should be pretty familiar, as in this ad from David Jolly: \u201cI\u2019m fighting to repeal Obamacare", "title": "Some Republicans Love Obamacare"}, "story_id": 276205699, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Carol Gentry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Some Republicans Love Obamacare"}, "nid": 5512, "datePublished": "2014-02-12", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Republican Party, David Jolly", "wordCount": 781, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb338\"", "article_summary": "\"But I am so in love with this plan, with this health care plan, what can I do?\"\nWe have been so enslaved by the health insurance system.\u201dShe says people who have health care security -- such as veterans and Medicare patients -- need to see that others need health care, too.\nShe was a teacher for many years, but because she was paid from grant funds she didn\u2019t qualify for health insurance.\nAnother Republican who wants to keep the Affordable Care Act is Mary Fallon of St. Petersburg.\nBy now, the Republican Party\u2019s view of the Affordable Care Act should be pretty familiar, as in this ad from David Jolly:Health News Florida Editor Carol Gentry talks to Republicans who like their health plans under Obamacare."}
