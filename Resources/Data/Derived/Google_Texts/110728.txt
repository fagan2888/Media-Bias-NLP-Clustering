Senior's title one of four claimed by victorious Trojans

NIWOT -- Tommy Nichols wasn't the only Longmont High wrestler to claim individual glory at the Gary Daum Classic on Saturday. But of the four Trojans who topped their brackets, he needed the win the most.

The Trojans senior entered the local showcase with a losing record and fighting through an ankle injury. Nichols ran through the 182-pound weight class with three pins and won a 9-1 major decision over Platte Valley's Garrett McCullar in the championship match.

For Nichols, who is hungry for a state tournament berth his final season with the Trojans, Saturday's dominance was exactly what he needed to get his season back on track.

"It was a really fun day," Nichols said. "I've been up and down this season and I'm nursing an ankle injury right now. I didn't wrestle well in the beginning of the season but really why I'm here is to place top four at regionals and place at state. That's what really matters and this is preparation and confidence for that."

Nichols, who improved to 11-8 with four wins, missed the state tournament cut last season because he was injured. The two years before that, he said, he was too young or not good enough. But he feels like this is his year.

Nichols wrestled for Lyons High School his freshman and sophomore seasons before transferring to Longmont. Now a Trojan in Class 4A, he is hoping the switch will make a difference. The Trojans are happy to have him, as his individual title helped them win their second straight Gary Daum team championship with 155 points. Erie edged Weld Central for second place.

"I have a lot of frustration, intensity and anger I've built up after not going to state for three years and I'm ready to release it all this year because it's all I have left," Nichols said. "I transferred to Longmont because I moved houses. I really haven't had a lot of time to connect with my coaches at Longmont High but today I wanted to impress all my coaches and proved that I'm a good wrestler because of them."

Ranked fifth in Class 4A by Tim Yount's On the Mat rankings, Trojans senior Ivan Wolf kept himself in contention for his school's takedown record and defeated Boulder's Martin Selby 11-3 to win the 152-pound championship. Fellow senior Drake Greeott dominated the 160-pound bracket, winning a 15-4 major decision of Niwot's Jessie Slepicka in the finals.

With three pins, second-ranked senior Jaime Ramos-Vega won the 195-pound bracket. He pinned Weld Central's Evan Paxton in 38 seconds to win a short and sweet title match.

"We won it last year and our goal was to win it again this year," said Greeott, who is ranked fifth in 4A. "It went pretty good. We came out and wrestled well. This was the first tournament back from the break. We set out to win it as a team and that's what we did."

Lane Olsen scored a third-place finish for the Trojans at 145 pounds. Fernando Ramos-Vega, who is ranked fourth in 4A, took third at 170 pounds after losing in the semifinals to Erie's Ladd Bunker, who was voted most outstanding wrestler by the tournament coaches. Jared Wells also finished third place, going 4-1 on the day at 126 pounds.

While the Trojans took turns posing with the trophy afterwards, head coach Adam Keiswetter said the Gary Daum victory was a much-needed boost with regional tournaments just under a month away.

"I'm just proud of my guys because we struggled Thursday night against Thompson Valley," Keiswetter said. "We had some guys missing from our lineup Thursday and a couple guys who lost some close ones just dominated today. I'm really proud with how they rebounded today."
