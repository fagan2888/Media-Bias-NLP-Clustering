LONDON (MarketWatch) — U.K. stocks rose in Wednesday’s half-day trading session, with shares of Smith & Nephew PLC logging their best rise in six years on a report of a takeover bid.

The FTSE 100 UKX, -0.07% closed up 0.2% to 6,609.93, its seventh consecutive win. The last run of seven straight wins took place in February. Trading in London closed early for the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays. The market will reopen on Monday.

Shares of Smith & Nephew PLC SN., -0.59% topped the FTSE 100 on Wednesday as they climbed 7.7%, the strongest advance since October 2008, according to FactSet data. That move added to Tuesday’s more than 4% rise, which followed a Bloomberg report that U.S. surgical-implants maker Stryker Corp. SYK, +0.18% is preparing a bid for the medical-devices maker.

An offer may be presented in the coming weeks, and may represent a significant premium to Smith & Nephew’s current share price, the report said.

Oil shares ended higher, outperforming a pullback in oil futures, with Brent crude UK:LCOG5 moving below $61 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDSB, +0.47% tacked on 0.7%, and Tullow Oil PLC TLW, +1.81% rose 0.6%. BP PLC BP., +0.19% and BG Group PLC UK:BG each rose 0.2%.
