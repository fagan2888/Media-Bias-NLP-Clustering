People are mainly seeking immediate help to relieve symptoms as they are in a hurry, they rarely stop for a prolonged intervention,\" she said.\n\nIn the morning, hundreds of people bypassed a border checkpoint and police cordon, and walked straight into Croatia along a path between an orchard and a vineyard.\n\nCroatian authorities said more than 2,000 people were sheltered in the Opatovac camp near the border. From there buses were taking them to the nearest train station in Tovarnik or straight to the Slovenian border.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said many more migrants were on their way to Serbia from Macedonia.\n\n(Writing by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Justyna Pawlak and Raissa Kasolowsky)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "LJUBLJANA/BERKASOVO, Serbia (Reuters) - Slovenia said on Tuesday it would deploy the a", "title": "Slovenian army to help control migrants at border, thousands held up in Balkans", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/20/Slovenia-use-army-help-guard-border-migrant-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-balkans_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/20/Slovenia-use-army-help-guard-border-migrant-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants-balkans_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "LJUBLJANA/BERKASOVO, Serbia (Reuters) - Slovenia said on Tuesday it would deploy the a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b7a\"", "article_summary": "Attempts by Slovenia to ration the flow of migrants since Hungary sealed its border with Croatia at midnight on Friday have triggered a knock-on effect through the Balkans, with thousands held up at border crossings.\nBy late morning on Tuesday, 5,000 migrants had entered Slovenia, after some 8,000 in total had crossed the border on Monday, the Slovenian Interior Ministry said.\nFrom there buses were taking them to the nearest train station in Tovarnik or straight to the Slovenian border.\nOn Monday, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said many more migrants were on their way to Serbia from Macedonia.\nAs the smallest country on the Balkan migration route, Slovenia had \"limited possibilities of border control and accommodating migrants\", the government said in an earlier statement."}
