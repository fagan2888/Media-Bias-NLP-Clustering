Well, the forces of progressive intolerance have won: she\u2019s not going to teach at the institution anymore (via NYT):\n\nA Yale lecturer who came under attack for challenging students to stand up for their right to decide what Halloween costumes to wear, even to the point of being offensive, has resigned from teaching at the college, the university said Monday. The lecturer, Erika Christakis, an expert in early childhood education, wrote an email in October suggesting that there could be negative consequences to students ceding \u201cimplied control\u201d over Halloween costumes to institutional forces. \u201cI wonder, and I am not trying to be provocative: Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious,\u201d she wrote, \u201ca little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?\u201d She wrote the email in response to a directive from the Intercultural Affairs Committee at Yale that warned students that it would be insensitive to wear costumes that symbolized cultural appropriation or misrepresentation, or both, like feathered headdresses, turbans, war paint, blackface or redface, or costumes that made fun of people. Ms. Christakis has made a \u201cvoluntary decision not to teach in the future,\u201d according to a statement from the university on Monday. Her husband, Dr. Nicholas Christakis, a physician and a professor of sociology at Yale, will take a one-semester sabbatical, the university said. The statement said the administration hoped Ms. Christakis would reconsider.\n\nChristakis and her husband, Nicholas, serve as associate master and master of Silliman College, which is part of Yale\u2019s network of undergraduate communities. Nicholas was seen being swarmed by the legions of political correctness, calling his position that respected constitutional right to free speech \u201cdisgusting.\u201d In one exchange, a student said he shouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night. Yes, Yale students, the elite of elites, are whining about\u2026nothing.\n\nThe Yale firestorm was based off of this infamous email and an alleged racial incident at a frat party. In that case, a party hosted by Sigma Alpha Epsilon reportedly barred a student of color from entering because only \u201cwhite girls\u201d were allowed. As Jazz wrote over at Hot Air, Yale Dean Jonathan Holloway stated that the investigation into the matter showed \u201cno evidence of systematic discrimination against people of color.\u201d\n\nSo, it looks as if the scorn brought down on Mr. and Mrs. Christakis was unwarranted, inappropriate, and just plain idiotic. They were purged for supporting freedom of speech, and for not initially submitting to the authoritarian ethos of safe spaces, which is just a fancy way of entertaining a system of neo-segregationist tendencies. Institutions of higher learning need to put an end to this madness. They need to tell them that the real world has no safe spaces. That they should focus on learning as much as they can, even if it makes them uncomfortable, because they\u2019ll most likely be graduating with student loans\u2013and fighting for culturally appropriate Halloween costumes isn\u2019t going to pay that debt. Higher education isn\u2019t about comfortability; it\u2019s about experimenting with new ideas, even if you disagree with them. I had a self-avowed anarchist as my political philosophy professor. I disagreed with most of his views politically\u2013he was very good at keeping his opinions out of the classroom\u2013but that doesn\u2019t mean this person needed to go so I could feel at home.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that we have this confederacy of liberal authoritarians, so focused on creating safe spaces, most notoriously racially-based ones, because they\u2019re afraid of their fellow citizens\u2019 rights to be whoever they want to be, though they\u2019re too stupid to see that because they only look at one\u2019s race, gender, or whatever inch-deep characteristic in order to divide the student body. If you can\u2019t accept that, I can only pray for you\u2013the world is going to eat you alive. This bunch may see their behavior as a source of strength; it\u2019s not. It confirms what many on the right already think, which is that the overly educated are incredibly soft. If Halloween costumes cause you to almost have a stroke, you seriously need to get a grip on reality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"terrorists\" win..05/26/2016 19:43:25PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The \"terrorists\" win.", "title": "Mob Rule: Yale Professor Who Sent Innocuous Email About Halloween Costumes Won't Teach There Anymore", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/11/mob-rule-yale-professor-who-sent-innocuous-email-about-halloween-costumes-wont-teach-there-anymore-n2090121", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/342/2015-12-08T191016Z_1_LYNXMPEBB714P_RTROPTP_3_USA-RACE-YALE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The \"terrorists\" win.", "title": "Mob Rule: Yale Professor Who Sent Innocuous Email About Halloween Costumes Won't Teach There Anymore", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/11/mob-rule-yale-professor-who-sent-innocuous-email-about-halloween-costumes-wont-teach-there-anymore-n2090121", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/342/2015-12-08T191016Z_1_LYNXMPEBB714P_RTROPTP_3_USA-RACE-YALE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Mob Rule: Yale Professor Who Sent Innocuous Email About Halloween Costumes Won't Teach There Anymore, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "If Halloween costumes cause you to almost have a stroke, you seriously need to get a grip on reality.\nRemember Erika Christakis, who challenged the idiotic political correctness associated with Halloween costumes in an email at Yale.\nYes, Yale students, the elite of elites, are whining about\u2026nothing.\nHer husband, Dr. Nicholas Christakis, a physician and a professor of sociology at Yale, will take a one-semester sabbatical, the university said.\nThe lecturer, Erika Christakis, an expert in early childhood education, wrote an email in October suggesting that there could be negative consequences to students ceding \u201cimplied control\u201d over Halloween costumes to institutional forces."}
