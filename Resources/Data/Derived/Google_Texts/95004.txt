DES MOINES, Iowa - Quick thinking kept a fire from spreading at a south Des Moines apartment complex Tuesday night.

Firefighters responded to Somerset Apartments, in the 6600 block of Southeast 5th Street, at about 11:30 p.m. Officials said a tenant was able to put out the fire using a fire extinguisher before crews arrived on the scene.

Damage was limited to one of the units on the third floor deck and exterior.

Crews said the fire could have easily spread to the attic, and then throughout the complex if it wasn't for that fire extinguisher.

Officials have not said what caused the fire.
