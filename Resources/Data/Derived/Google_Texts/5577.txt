BARTAHATCHIE – A shooting over the weekend in Bartahatchie sent a Monroe County man to Baptist Memorial Golden Triangle in Columbus.

Monroe County Sheriff Cecil Cantrell said that on Friday night, Dustin Fretwell and his stepfather, David Conners, were drinking when they got into a fight. Conners shot Fretwell in the chest with a .22.

“When we got there, Dustin said he didn’t want to sign any papers against Conners, so there is nothing we can do,” Cantrell said.

Marketing officials at Baptist stated Tuesday morning that Fretwell is not currently a patient at the facility.
