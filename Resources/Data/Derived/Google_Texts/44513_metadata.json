However, just half of the county\u2019s Latinos said the same about their well-being.\n\nSponsored by United Way and several other groups, the report captures a snapshot of the quality of life in the county. It was released Monday at an event well attended by nonprofit and local government leaders, who use the report to tailor services to meet the county\u2019s needs.\n\nTo view the 2014 Community Assessment Project The full report will be posted at unitedwaysc.org/community-assessment-project.\n\nData from the report highlights the disparities between the county\u2019s whites and Latinos in jobs, health, housing and education. Latinos are more likely to forgo basic necessities than their white neighbors.\n\n\u201cLatinos are twice as likely to go without food and 10 times as likely to go without rent or housing or utilities,\u201d said MariaElena De La Garza, executive director of the Community Action Board.\n\nRegular access to health care is a struggle for more than three-quarters of the Latino community, versus 92 percent of whites.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure there are services where they need them and where they live,\u201d said Lisa Hernandez, health officer and medical services director at the county\u2019s Health Services Agency.\n\nWhile more of the county\u2019s residents have health insurance, fewer people have dental coverage.\n\nChildren in the county also have lower rates of immunizations than the rest of the state, and residents are pretty good at eating fruits and vegetables, but also \u201cpretty good at eating junk food,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nThe report also showed unemployment continues to decline and the median family income is rising.\n\nIn the last two years, the median sale price of a home increased 32 percent to $535,000.\n\nHowever, the kinds of new jobs in the county are raising concern. The high cost of living and the prevalence of low-wage jobs in major industries, such as agriculture and service, contribute to a widening gap between whites and Latinos, said Ton\u00e9e Picard, executive vice president and chief development officer of Bay Federal Credit Union, who presented the report\u2019s economic findings.\n\n\u201cA whole sector of our community continues to feel challenged,\u201d Picard said, adding that education and training are key to improving the county\u2019s workforce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, the report outlines several positives.\n\nDespite water concerns and dissatisfaction with traffic, crime and increased homelessness, survey respondents reported an overall satisfaction with the quality of life. People are happy with schools, organic farming continues to grow and crime rates are down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to decrease our arrest rates in Santa Cruz County without increasing the population in the jails,\u201d said Craig Haney, a professor of psychology and legal studies at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nAnd the juvenile arrest rate has decreased more than 62 percent since 2008.\n\nIn other good news, protected land makes up a third of county lands and nearly half of the survey respondents reported shopping at a farmers\u2019 market or produce stand once a week.\n\nTo view the 2014 Community Assessment Project\n\nThe full report will be posted at unitedwaysc.org/community-assessment-project.\n\n2014 Community Heroes\n\nEvery year, the public nominates community leaders whose work helps realize the Community Assessment Project\u2019s goals.\n\nIn health:\n\n\u2022 Silvia Austerlic has increased awareness of end-of-life care and grief support services for Latinos through Mensajeros de Confianza. \u2022 Laura Marcus is the director of Dientes Community Dental Care and provides low-cost dental services to the most vulnerable county residents.\n\n\u2022 Guillermina Porraz has worked to ensure residents have equal access to health care and nutrition for 20 years with Salud Para La Gente.\n\n\u2022 Kate Hinnenkamp, Rosalba Contreras, John Frigon and Gary McNeil are honored as the Affordable Care Act Outreach and Enrollment Campions of Santa Cruz County.\n\nIn natural environment:\n\n\u2022 Alan Schlenger\u2019s role as treasurer for the Santa Cruz County Community Farmers Market has been instrumental in helping the organization become self-sustaining.\n\n\u2022 Charles Kieffer has served as a volunteer education for Santa Cruz State Parks for more than 25 years and is the chair of the Castro Committee for Friends of Santa Cruz Parks.\n\nIn economy:\n\n\u2022 Brent Haddad is the director of UCSC\u2019s Center for Entrepreneurship, where he fosters internship programs that educate students and infuse businesses with innovative talent.\n\nIn education:\n\n\u2022 Carol Polhamus served as an instructor with the County Office of Education Alternative Education Programs for more than 25 years, and she motivated students to meet their potential. \u2022 Lawrence P.
