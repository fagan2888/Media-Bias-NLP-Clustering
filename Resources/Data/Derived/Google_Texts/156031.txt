Brisbane Muslim community leader Ali Kadri says attacks on the mosque are causing fear in the wider Muslim community.

A LOGAN mosque has been targeted by four “hate” attacks, including two on the weekend.

In the most recent incident, about 50 anti-Muslim leaflets were dumped in the grounds of the Kingston mosque early yesterday.

“This is very insulting to the Muslim community, and we are disgusted that someone would take this action against us,’’ Brisbane Muslim community leader Ali Kadri said.

“We condemn their actions, as should all Australians, but I am calling for calm.

“While there is anger in the community over what is happening, there should be no retaliation or demonstration of that anger.”

The leaflets featured racist taunts such as “Terrorists born in Australia are not Australians – they are Muslims” and “Muslims are not welcome in Australia, go back to where you came from”.

A photo of Mecca with a pig superimposed on top was also left at the mosque.

Brisbane Muslim community leader Ali Kadri said the material featured the logo of the Patriot Defence League, which has a fierce anti-Islamic agenda. It’s not clear if the group is also linked to pig bodies being thrown into the grounds in two separate incidents earlier this year.

“Attacks like these are causing fear in the Muslim community,’’ Mr Kadri said. “Muslims, especially women, are afraid to go out in public, or to go shopping because of these actions. We feel like strangers in our own community.’’

Mr Kadri said he didn’t believe the recent attacks were the result of last week’s anti-terror raids in Logan and Brisbane that saw charges laid against two men.

“There are extremists in every community, but at this time all Australians need to have a dialogue so that this country is safe,’’ he said.
