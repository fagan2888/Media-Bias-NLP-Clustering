In May, for example, it was revealed that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had improperly targets conservative groups seeking nonprofit status.\n\nThe following month, in June, the public learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting phone records of virtually every Americans for domestic surveillance purposes. In the fall, controversy arose over the disastrous Obamacare rollout and millions of health plan cancellations caused by the law, despite frequent assurances from President Obama that Americans could keep their current coverage.\n\nIn his fifth year in office, President Obama averaged an approval rating of 45.8%, according to Gallup, the second-lowest point of his presidency.\n\nGallup based the results on more than 175,000 interviews conducted between January 20, 2013 through January 19, 2014. His third year in office remains President Obama\u2019s worst, when his approval rating averaged 44.4%.\n\nLooking at the fifth-year numbers compared to past two-term presidents, Obama ranks near the bottom, barely surpassing the 45.7% average approval rating of George W. Bush. Richard Nixon has the lowest fifth-year approval rating, at 41.1%.\n\nDwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan had the best numbers, averaging 62.8% and 60.4%, respectively, in their fifth years in office. Bill Clinton averaged 57.9%.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2013, President Obama\u2019s approval rating averaged 41.2%. This is not far off from the average 41% approval rating recorded the third-quarter of 2011, the worst mark of his presidency.\n\nPresident Obama actually matches Bush on average 20th quarter approval ratings, both with 41.2%. But Gallup notes that President Obama\u2019s numbers fell \u201cto a more extreme degree.\u201d\n\nThough they\u2019re near the bottom of recent presidents, they don\u2019t come close to Nixon, who averaged the 28% approval rating in the final quarter of his fifth year in office, recorded during the midst of the Watergate scandal.\n\n\u201cThere is no guarantee that Obama will suffer a similar fate. In the short term, however, all recent elected presidents except Clinton saw at least some decline in their 21st quarter in office, and only Clinton had a sixth-year approval average higher than his fifth-year average,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Jones of Gallup.\n\n\u201cFrom a historical perspective, then, the prospects for Obama\u2019s approval rating to improve are not great, although improvement would not be unprecedented,\u201d he added.\n\nThough President Obama has time to rebound, the sixth year of a presidency is usually one of the most difficult politically. Known as the \u201csix-year itch,\u201d voters are more likely to reject candidates from a president\u2019s party in a mid-term election, typically translating into losses in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "2014 election,Approval rating,Barack Obama,controversy,Gallup,George W.
