Meagan, CC BY 2.0\n\nOver 3,600 dogs and cats have fallen sick from certain pet jerky treats since 2007, in an outbreak that veterinarians at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have called \u201cone of the most elusive and mysterious\u201d they have come across. But those leading the investigation of the contaminated jerky treats manufactured in China still don\u2019t have the answer to what has caused the illnesses.\n\nThe FDA today proposed a rule to improve animal food safety, with the aim of preventing foodborne illness among both pets and their owners. The rule, under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, would require animal food manufacturers to have a formal plan and procedures to prevent foodborne illness. For the first time, this proposition would make animal food facilities address sanitation and other solid manufacturing practices.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement addresses a critical part of the food system, and we will continue to work with our national and international industry, consumer and government partners as we work to prevent foodborne illness,\u201d FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg said in the release.\n\nShortly after eating the treats in question, pets susceptible to the disease experienced vomiting, diarrhea, decreased activity or an increase in drinking water and urination. Some severe cases have afflicted the animals, including kidney failure, stomach bleeding, and a rare kidney disorder.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) conducted over 1,200 tests in their investigation, visiting the manufacturers of the jerky pet treats which were located in China, according to a report released this week. Investigators also met and discussed the issue with experts in academia, industry, state labs and foreign governments, but to no avail: the reason behind the sickened pets remains unknown. The FDA is asking pet owners to notify them if their pets fall ill. Veterinarians may require samples of blood, urine or tissue from sickened pets for FDA analysis.\n\n\u201cOur beloved four-legged companions deserve our best effort, and we are giving it,\u201d CVM Director Bernadette Dunham said in the FDA report.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, foodborne illness, pet jerky treats, outbreak", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA hopes to prevent foodborne illness among U.S. pets in light of an elusive outbreak sickening thousands of dogs and cats.", "title": "FDA Proposes Pet Food Safety Rules After Jerky Treats Sicken 3,600 Dogs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-proposes-pet-food-safety-rules-after-jerky-treats-sicken-3600-dogs-and-cats-261033", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/25/puppy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA hopes to prevent foodborne illness among U.S. pets in light of an elusive outbreak sickening thousands of dogs and cats.", "title": "FDA Proposes Pet Food Safety Rules After Jerky Treats Sicken 3,600 Dogs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-proposes-pet-food-safety-rules-after-jerky-treats-sicken-3600-dogs-and-cats-261033", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/25/puppy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/25/puppy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-10-25T17:00:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-25T17:12:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA hopes to prevent foodborne illness among U.S. pets in light of an elusive outbreak sickening thousands of dogs and cats."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd20\"", "article_summary": "But those leading the investigation of the contaminated jerky treats manufactured in China still don\u2019t have the answer to what has caused the illnesses.\nThe rule, under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, would require animal food manufacturers to have a formal plan and procedures to prevent foodborne illness.\nThe FDA has proposed a new rule in the hopes of preventing foodborne illnesses among U.S. pets.\nThe FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) conducted over 1,200 tests in their investigation, visiting the manufacturers of the jerky pet treats which were located in China, according to a report released this week.\nThe FDA today proposed a rule to improve animal food safety, with the aim of preventing foodborne illness among both pets and their owners."}
