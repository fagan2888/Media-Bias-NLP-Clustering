Hospital employees receive 11 personal holidays.\n\nThe letter, signed by Dr. Selwyn Vickers, dean of the medical school, Dr. Will Ferniany, CEO of UAB Health System, and Dr. James Bonner, president of the health system, cites \"significant external economic pressure\" in deciding to forgo raises this year.\n\nThis pressure affects all three of the system's missions: education research and clinical care, the letter stated.\n\nHere's how, according to the letter:\n\nThere is less funding for education from the state;\n\nThe National Institutes for Health (NIH) funding for grants is flat.\n\nRegulatory burdens continue to grow in an effort to increase transparency and reduce waste in the industry.\n\nOn top of these three things, the letter cites, is a change in the way hospitals are paid by the federal government is changing under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Soon, we will be paid not on the volume of patients we treat but on the quality of their care and their level of satisfaction with their experience,\" the letter states.\n\nFor months UAB has been conducting a sweeping review of operations to find ways to cut expenses, the hospital confirmed in May.\n\nThe financial pressures hitting UAB are being felt at virtually all of the nearly 100 hospitals across the state.\n\nBaptist Health System in early May confirmed it had laid off 23 people in a reorganization across four hospitals and its headquarters.\n\nRural hospitals are especially vulnerable, officials say.\n\nPreviously on AL.com, Glenn Sisk, CEO of Coosa Valley Medical Center, said the three biggest factors stressing hospital budgets in Alabama are no Medicaid expansion, $220 billion in Medicare cuts to hospital services and Alabama's low wage index which helps determine Medicare reimbursement rates.\n\nThe Medicare cuts came from the ACA as a way to pay for expansion of health care coverage in the country. Part of that plan was to expand Medicaid to lower and middle income citizens who are uninsured. But at least 21 states, including Alabama, have declined the government's offer to fund that expansion.\n\nSaid Jones: \"Alabama Medicaid has been historically underfunded to meet the needs of the state, and those challenges continue.\"\n\nRead more health coverage from Mike Oliver.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, news", "title": "UAB Medicine workers won't get raises, no current plans for layoffs", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "View full sizeUAB Hospital North Pavilion (The Birmingham News/Bernard Troncale)&nbsp; BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Citing \"profound shifts in healthcare,\" the University of Alabama at Birmingham has informed UAB Medicine employees there will be no annual merit raises coming in January. \"We...", "title": "UAB Medicine workers won't get raises, no current plans for layoffs", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/06/uab_medicine_workers_wont_get.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/uab-hospital-north-pavillion-f37103c3822284c3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "View full sizeUAB Hospital North Pavilion (The Birmingham News/Bernard Troncale)&nbsp; BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Citing \"profound shifts in healthcare,\" the University of Alabama at Birmingham has informed UAB Medicine employees there will be no annual merit raises coming in January. \"We...", "title": "UAB Medicine workers won't get raises, no current plans for layoffs", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/spotnews/photo/uab-hospital-north-pavillion-f37103c3822284c3.jpg", "creator": "@MikeOliverAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, June 27, 2014,  4:08 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, June 27, 2014,  3:11 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Citing \"profound shifts in healthcare,\" the University of Alabama at Birmingham has informed UAB Medicine employees there will be no annual merit raises coming in January. \"We wanted to notify you as early as possible so that you can take this information into account in your own financial planning,\" according to an emailed letter dated June 23.
