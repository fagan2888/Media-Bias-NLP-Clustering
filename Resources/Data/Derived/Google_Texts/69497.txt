A little-noticed provision in the Affordable Care Act could have a big impact on companies with 100 workers or less in 2016. The law changes the definition of small group health plans to include all companies of that size, bringing them under more requirements for benefits that must be covered as well as rules limiting premium differences based on age and gender. Currently companies with 51 to 100 employees can buy plans in the large group market, which has less stringent regulations.

That means that many companies in the 51-100 size group with younger, healthier employees are likely to face higher premiums, while companies in that size group with older, sicker employees will pay less, according to an issue brief released March 3 by the American Academy of Actuaries.

Further, the brief said, that could push companies with younger, healthier employees to self-insure, which would allow them to escape many of the ACA’s more costly requirements. If the small group market loses plans with healthier enrollees, the result could be higher premiums for companies with 50 employees or less, it said.

“Additional benefit and cost-sharing requirements could increase the comprehensiveness of coverage, and could also reduce plan-design flexibility and increase premiums,” it said.
