The 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy‘s assassination takes place Friday and the nation’s interest in his death has waned little in the past half-century.

President Obama plans to mark the anniversary by laying a wreath on Kennedy’s grave and commemorating his creation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, The Hill reported.

Michelle Obama will accompany the president, as will President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The wreath-laying ceremony will take place on Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery and Obama is also scheduled to present the Medal of Freedom to its 2013 recipients, which include Bill Clinton, according to the report.

Founding Fathers ‘turning in their graves’

America remains gripped by the events that took place in Dealey Plaza on Nov. 22, 1963.



National Geographic Channel set a network viewership record Sunday night with its premiere of original movie “Killing Kennedy,” according to Variety. The film is based on the book of the same name, written by Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly.

The hashtag #killingkennedy also trended worldwide Sunday night on Twitter, Variety added, becoming the No. 1-trending topic in the U.S.

The timing of the anniversary is fortuitous for Obama in that it may be the one event that can distract from the glaring national spotlight that’s illuminating the unmitigated disaster that has come to define the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.

The Associated Press also reported that Obama will deliver a speech honoring Kennedy’s legacy of service Wednesday evening at the Smithsonian American History Museum.
