Ted Cruz cut loose in an appearance on Glen Beck\u2019s radio show Tuesday, belittling Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump as a child of privilege who grew up to be a wannabe mobster, and claiming there is now \u201ca consistent pattern ... of Donald and his henchmen pushing for violence.\u201d\n\nThe attack on Trump came just days after the billionaire\u2019s newly hired convention manager, Paul Manafort, accused Cruz of using \u201cGestapo tactics\u201d to sway delegates to the Republican nominating convention in Cleveland this summer.\n\nRelated: Trump Names Some Surprising Picks for VP\n\nIn his retaliatory remarks, Cruz cited a fictional purveyor of violence rather than historical ones.\n\n\u201cDonald needs to understand that he\u2019s not Michael Corleone,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI understand that Donald has had some very shady business deals with people that are currently in prison. Mobsters. But the presidency should not be La Cosa Nostra ... Donald Trump keeps hiring people with records of dirty tricks, lies and threats of violence.\u201d\n\nCruz blasted Trump for appearing to support violence at his own rallies, predicting riots if he is denied the nomination.\n\n\u201cDonald needs to stop threatening the voters. He needs to stop threatening the delegates. He is not a mobster.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Cruz and Trump Voters Will Tear the GOP Apart\n\nCriticizing Trump\u2019s past comments that appeared to advocate violence against protesters at his rallies, Cruz added, \u201cNo politician has the right to threaten violence against American citizens. Even lefty numbskulls are American citizens and you don\u2019t threaten violence against them.\u201d\n\nThe Texas senator, who still trails Trump in both pledged delegates and in national opinion polls of GOP voters, suggested that Trump\u2019s history of wealth and privilege has left him detached from reality as other people experience it.\n\n\u201cDonald has been surrounded by sycophants his entire business career,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was born into great wealth and privilege ... at every stage, when he told a joke, everyone in the room laughed. Whether it was funny or not, you had to laugh.\u201d\n\nHe also added a dig at one of his former competitors, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has since endorsed Trump.\n\nRelated: Why Paul Ryan Will Dodge the GOP Presidential Snake Pit\n\n\u201cLook at the humiliation he inflicts on people like Chris Christie,\u201d Cruz said, adding that the New Jersey governor is \u201ca good man\u201d whom he personally likes. Yet, Cruz plainly enjoyed commenting on the \u201cservility\u201d of Christie in Trump\u2019s presence and his new tendency to address the frontrunner as \u201cMr. Trump\u201d instead of \u201cDonald.\u201d\n\n\u201cChris Christie right now is trapped in his own private hell,\u201d he said, discussing a widely remarked-on press conference in which Christie was forced to stand behind Trump as the billionaire delivered a rambling speech. \u201cWhen Chris was standing behind Trump holding his jacket, the look in his eyes, you could see the screaming.\u201d\n\nAs he has done in the past, Cruz continued to claim that he is confident that the GOP nomination will not be decided until the convention and that his superior organization will give him the advantage he needs to win there in July.\n\nHe even suggested that Trump, who has run a very lean campaign, may never have really expected to be president.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a real chance that this was a lark, this was \u2018Let\u2019s get some publicity, let\u2019s have some fun\u2019\u201d Cruz said, adding that when he began to have some success, \u201cI think he was a surprised as anybody.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Texas Sen.
