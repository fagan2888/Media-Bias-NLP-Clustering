No insurance companies means no ObamaCare.\n\nIn 2014, the White House tried to avert that disaster by promising insurers a taxpayer-funded bailout, but public outrage and quick action by Sen.

Unfortunately, once again, a big part of that money pot belongs to the public.\n\nPresident Obama doesn\u2019t seem to care. On Feb. 12, the administration announced that the money will be handed out to insurers \u2014 a whopping $7.7 billion this year alone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just expensive: That huge handout to the insurance industry is also illegal.\n\nThis is money you and everyone else who already has insurance are forced to pay, called a reinsurance fee. You pay the fee whether you buy your own plan or get covered at work, even if your employer self-insures. You may be clueless about it, but the fee is buried in your premium or taken out of your compensation.\n\nThe text of the Affordable Care Act is clear as a bell on what this money can be used for.\n\nSome of these annual fees \u2014 adding up to billions a year \u2014 belong to the public, not the insurance companies.

So now they\u2019re trying it again.\n\nAnyone in the corporate world who misused funds that way would be headed to prison. This rogue administration is going to any length \u2014 including running afoul of the law \u2014 to keep insurers hooked into ObamaCare.\n\nIn the words of University of Houston law professor Seth Chandler, who tried to call attention to the crime several months ago, this is \u201can illegal diversion of funds . . . to enrich insurers.\u201d Last year alone, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas got $549 million of these reinsurance funds, while Anthem Blue Cross of California got $401 million.\n\nHow did this fly under the radar last year? Because no one \u2014 especially members of Congress \u2014 has read the law. Insurance companies weren\u2019t about to object to getting more money than the law allows.\n\nPlus, the announcements of these payments were buried in mind-numbing federal agency releases. The latest such disclosure came late last Friday \u2014 heading into a holiday weekend.\n\nThis week, a few health scholars took notice, including Galen Institute senior fellow Doug Badger. He says the illegal maneuver is \u201cdesigned to keep a sinking ship from hitting rock bottom.\u201d\n\nObamaCare was sold on lies: You can keep your health plan if you like it. And keep your doctor if you like your doctor. Then, once it was passed, the administration resorted to a long string of lawless executive actions to keep an unworkable scheme going, despite the damage being done to employers, doctors and consumers.\n\nThe administration\u2019s diversion of public funds to its insurance-company cronies is just the latest defiance of the law.\n\nThe president has illegally delayed the employer mandate repeatedly. He\u2019s handing out free ObamaCare plans to illegal immigrants. Statutory deadlines are routinely ignored, and funds are slyly shifted from one program to another \u2014 the law be damned.\n\nUltimately, ObamaCare is imperiling not only our health and our nation\u2019s economic growth, but even our nation\u2019s most precious asset \u2014 the rule of law.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is the author of \u201cBeating Obamacare\u201d and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration will tell any lie and break any law to prevent the president\u2019s signature health-care program from collapsing. \nInsurance companies such as UnitedHealthcare and Aetna are", "title": "Obama is looting the Treasury to pay off insurers", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/man-obamacare.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-10075376\"}", "sailthru.tags": "bailouts,health-insurance,obamacare,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-21 20:00:51", "sailthru.title": "Obama is looting the Treasury to pay off\u00a0insurers", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/man-obamacare.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "The Obama administration will tell any lie and break any law to prevent the president\u2019s signature health-care program from collapsing. \r\n\r\nInsurance companies such as UnitedHealthcare and Aetna are losing billions trying to sell ObamaCare plans, and the risk is they\u2019ll drop out at the end of 2016.
