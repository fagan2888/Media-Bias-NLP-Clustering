The Boys and Girls Club cooled off Thursday with tasty treats from Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.

AKA promotes healthy eating with creative methods using their Alpha Care Summer Youth Program.

They taught club members how to make smoothies using a bicycle. The bike is lifted off the ground so the kids can peddle it and power an attached blender.

"Because they eat so much junk food and fast food and they don't really understand that there are simple little things at home that they can just do using yogurt and fruit, either fresh food or frozen food, in order to make really healthy snacks," said AKA's Manola Erby.

The youth program is a partnership between Alcorn State University and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.
