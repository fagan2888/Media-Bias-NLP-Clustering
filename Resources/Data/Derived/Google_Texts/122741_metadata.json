(Photo: Submitted photo)\n\nThe descendant of a Louisiana tradition bearer will perform for this week\u2019s Music and Market concert.\n\nSarah Jayde Williams, granddaughter of the late Hadley J. Castille, learned well from that Cajun fiddle master. She and her band, The Sharecroppers, will deliver their distinctive blend of country swing starting Friday evening at the farmers market pavilion in Opelousas.\n\nWilliams is a regular on the roots music circuit in Acadiana. The Opelousas native has played Festivals Acadiens et Cr\u00e9oles and Festival International de Louisiane and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival as well as music clubs throughout the region.\n\nAs she has throughout her musical life, Williams surrounds herself with family and friends in her band. It includes her uncle Blake Castille on guitar, Phil Caelin on bass, Lee Tedrow on steel guitar and Danny Kimbal on drums.\n\nThe band\u2019s repertoire includes country music that influenced the sound of swamp pop, sung in English and French \u2014 a mix as tasty as this week\u2019s featured farm product, mustard greens. Williams has just released her debut recording, \"Special Edition Cajun & Texas Swing.\"\n\nMusic and Market coordinator Patrice Melnick said, \u201cI love her style,\u201d that combines the two varieties of Southern music. \u201cThey blend together really well.\u201d\n\nThe concert series calendar in print and online list Friday\u2019s as the final event of the season. But wait \u2014 there\u2019s more.\n\nLeroy Thomas, \u201cThe Jewel of the Bayou,\u201d will perform May 29. He\u2019d been scheduled to play at Le Vieux Village in Opelousas on April 23, but rain washed out that appearance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make up for the rainy day,\u201d Melnick said.\n\nMany organizations help this free concert series happen each year. They include the City of Opelousas, Bodemuller the Printer, Cleco, Delta Media, Tobacco Free Living, Louisiana Cultural Economy Foundation, Louisiana Lottery, the Jazz and Heritage Foundation, LSU AgCenter, and ZydecoOnline.com\n\nFor more information or to find out about vendor opportunities, call 337-948-6263 or visit cityofopelousas.com.\n\nWant to go?\n\nMusic and Market takes place 5:30-8:30 p.m. Friday; the music begins at 6:00 p.m. Concert-goers are welcome to bring lawn chairs to the farmers market at 828 E.
