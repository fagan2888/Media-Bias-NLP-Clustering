Facing the stage, the crowd listened to multiple state officials before Clinton spoke.\n\nU.S. Rep. Michael Capuano of the 7th district of Massachusetts told the crowd that Clinton\u2019s strength is unparalleled by any other candidate in the presidential race.\n\n\u201cI have never seen anyone who\u2019s had more sticks and more stones and stood up so tall and so true than Hillary Clinton,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cWe have a combination here of someone who\u2019s qualified, someone who\u2019s tested, someone who can win and someone who knows how to get things done in Washington.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Ed Markey said Clinton would bring the country fairness and security.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make it more fair, more just, more educated,\u201d Markey said. \u201cWhen guns are on the streets of this country killing our young people, we have more work to do. Hillary Clinton will make sure the NRA stands for \u2018not relevant anymore.\u2019 When women only make 77 cents to the dollar, when black women make 65 cents, when Latinas only make 59 cents on the dollar \u2026 Hillary Clinton will fight for you.\u201d\n\nChants of \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cH-R-C\u201d were heard throughout the meeting house as attendees waited for Clinton to speak.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey spoke to the crowd about why people should vote for Clinton on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf you care about our rights for health care, workers\u2019 rights and the environment, you know what you have to do,\u201d Healey said. \u201cIf you care about ending gun violence and ending the heroin and opioid epidemic, you know what you have to do. And if you care about tearing down those barriers \u2014 economic, social, cultural \u2014 to create opportunities for all, there is one person we know who will deliver, and that\u2019s Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nBoston Mayor Martin Walsh said Clinton would only win Massachusetts Tuesday if residents do their part.\n\n\u201cWhen we leave here today, don\u2019t [go] home and get on with your life, but get involved in the campaign,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThat means if you haven\u2019t knocked on a door, you haven\u2019t made a phone call, go in your phone book, knock on your neighbors\u2019 doors and let them know what\u2019s at stake in this election to make sure we win our state tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers when Walsh introduced Clinton to the crowd.\n\nClinton said one thing she would fight to protect if she were to win the presidency would be the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have been trying to repeal it \u2014 they\u2019ve now voted to repeal it 63 times,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut, you know, they never tell you what they would replace it with. So if you have a pre-existing condition, man, it\u2019s going to be hard to get insurance. [If] you\u2019re a woman, we\u2019re going to pay more for our health care then men. If you\u2019re a young person, no guarantee you could be on your parents policy until you\u2019re 26.\u201d\n\nClinton said that as president, she would work to make college tuition more affordable for middle-class families.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a public college or university, you will not have to borrow a dime,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBorrow free tuition, and we will work to get the cost down so everyone can afford it. I am not going to ask you to pay taxes to send Donald Trump\u2019s kid for free to college.\u201d\n\nSeveral attendees expressed their support for Clinton and why they intend to vote for her.\n\nSterl Carpenter, a junior at The University of Rhode Island and president of the College Democrats of Rhode Island, said he supports Clinton because she can relate to young people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting Hillary because I think she is the best candidate for all Americans, including young people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she has the most pragmatic and achievable plan at making college affordable and making that dream a reality for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nGrace Fleming, 58, of Hyde Park, said she would vote for Clinton because Clinton is the most qualified to be president.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s very qualified to be president, and she\u2019s far better qualified than Mr. Trump, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cI think she has a lot of experience, and I think she\u2019d do well domestically as well as internationally.\u201d\n\nDavid Freedman, 34, of Brighton, said he would vote for Clinton because her foreign policy stance is better than all of the presidential candidates, especially Trump.\n\n\u201cI think she will be a good politician,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cI think [Clinton] would win against Trump. Donald Trump[\u2018s] foreign policy scares me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A crowd gathered inside the Old South Meeting House Monday afternoon to support Hillary Clinton before Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary in Massachusetts.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Free Press", "description": "A crowd gathered inside the Old South Meeting House Monday afternoon to support Hillary Clinton before Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary in Massachusetts.", "title": "Hillary Clinton rallies support in Boston before Super Tuesday - The Daily Free Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/MG_2983.jpg", "height": 1067}, "url": "http://dailyfreepress.com/2016/03/01/hillary-clinton-rallies-support-in-boston-on-the-eve-of-super-tuesday/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A crowd gathered inside the Old South Meeting House Monday afternoon to support Hillary Clinton before Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary in Massachusetts.", "creator": "@dailyfreepress", "image": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/MG_2983.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton rallies support in Boston before Super Tuesday - The Daily Free Press", "site": "@dailyfreepress", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-DFP_Lettering_Final-07-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyfreepress/", "section": "City", "tag": "super tuesday", "published_time": "2016-03-01T03:18:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton will make sure the NRA stands for \u2018not relevant anymore.\u2019 When women only make 77 cents to the dollar, when black women make 65 cents, when Latinas only make 59 cents on the dollar \u2026 Hillary Clinton will fight for you.\u201dChants of \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cH-R-C\u201d were heard throughout the meeting house as attendees waited for Clinton to speak.\nGALLERY: Hillary Rally Before Super TuesdayA crowd of nearly 500 gathered inside the Old South Meeting House Monday afternoon to support former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton before Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary in Massachusetts.\n\u201cI have never seen anyone who\u2019s had more sticks and more stones and stood up so tall and so true than Hillary Clinton,\u201d Capuano said.\n\u201cI think [Clinton] would win against Trump.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey spoke to the crowd about why people should vote for Clinton on Tuesday."}
