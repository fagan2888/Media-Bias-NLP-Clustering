First of all, it reflects activity from Q1, which ended in March. Second, the bulk of the more recent data has been positive.\n\n\"If GDP were truly so weak, we would not expect aggregate hours worked to climb 3.7% annualized through May, jobless claims to remain near cycle lows, consumer confidence to hit a cycle high, industrial production to climb 5.0% at an annual rate over the first five months of the year, core capital goods orders to be up 5.8%, ISM to be above 55, and vehicle sales to hit their strongest annualized selling pace for the year,\" said Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta. \"GDP is the outlier in these data points. I will roll my eyes and move on. Most of the data we just mentioned is consistent with underlying growth over 3.0%.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Sam Ro", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare.", "creator": "bySamRo", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/what-crushed-gdp-2014-6", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/534bd12e6da8114f21f97344-506-253/this-is-precisely-what-crushed-gdp.jpg", "title": "This Is Precisely What Crushed GDP", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "GDP, Sam Ro,", "description": "Healthcare.", "author": "Sam Ro", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-25", "sailthru.title": "This Is Precisely What Crushed GDP", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/534bd100ecad04d35116b735-50-50/this-is-precisely-what-crushed-gdp.jpg", "news_keywords": "GDP, Sam Ro,", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/534bd100ecad04d35116b735/this-is-precisely-what-crushed-gdp.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-06-25", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/sam-ro"}, "sailthru.description": "Healthcare.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Healthcare.", "title": "This Is Precisely What Crushed GDP", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/what-crushed-gdp-2014-6", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/534bd12e6da8114f21f97344-1190-625/this-is-precisely-what-crushed-gdp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "This Is Precisely What Crushed GDP", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/534bd100ecad04d35116b735/this-is-precisely-what-crushed-gdp.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf16\"", "article_summary": "Pretty much everyone was stunned to see Q1 GDP growth slashed to -2.9% from an earlier estimate of -1.0%.\nAccording to the BEA, healthcare spending went from adding 1.01 percentage points to subtracting 0.16 from the headline GDP growth number.\n\"Net trade also contributed, taking 1.5 percentage points off growth compared with 1.0 percentage points previously,\" said Capital Economics' Paul Dales.\n\"GDP is the outlier in these data points.\nThe revision largely boils down to one thing: healthcare spending."}
