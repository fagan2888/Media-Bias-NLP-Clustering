Within the first five minutes, the recently divorced Jenner revealed to Diane Sawyer that he has struggled with his gender identity since he was a child, but knows for sure that he is a woman.\n\n\"I would say I've always been confused about my gender identity since I was this big,\" Jenner said. \"I look at it this way. Bruce, always telling a lie. He's lived a lie his whole life about who he is. And I can't do that any longer.\"\n\nWhen asked if he is a woman, Jenner responded, \"Yes, for all intents and purposes. I am a woman.\"\n\nJenner intimated that he is finally walking in his truth as a transgender woman and feels better than ever. Four of his biological children appeared during the interview in a show of support for their dad. Of his stepchildren, Kim Kardashian has been the most supportive, Jenner said. And, when asked why he's coming forward now, at the age of 65, his answer was simple.\n\n\"All of us deserve the right to be loved for who we are,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bruce, jenner, speaks, candidly, about, gender, identity, all, us, deserve, right, be, loved, who", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "On Friday night, Olympic champion Bruce Jenner revealed that he is a transgender woman.", "title": "'All Of Us Deserve The Right To Be Loved For Who We Are' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/bruce-jenner-speaks-candidly-about-gender-identity-all-us-deserve-right-be-loved-who-330748", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/25/bruce-jenner-speaks-candidly-about-gender-identity-all-us-deserve-be-loved-who-we-are.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Friday night, Olympic champion Bruce Jenner revealed that he is a transgender woman.", "title": "'All Of Us Deserve The Right To Be Loved For Who We Are' [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/bruce-jenner-speaks-candidly-about-gender-identity-all-us-deserve-right-be-loved-who-330748", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/25/bruce-jenner-speaks-candidly-about-gender-identity-all-us-deserve-be-loved-who-we-are.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/25/bruce-jenner-speaks-candidly-about-gender-identity-all-us-deserve-be-loved-who-we-are.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-25T13:48:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-25T14:14:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "On Friday night, Olympic champion Bruce Jenner revealed that he is a transgender woman."}, "article_summary": "\"All of us deserve the right to be loved for who we are,\" he said.\nOn Friday night, ABC's 20/20 aired a much-awaited interview with Olympic champion and reality television star Bruce Jenner.\n\"I would say I've always been confused about my gender identity since I was this big,\" Jenner said.\nWhen asked if he is a woman, Jenner responded, \"Yes, for all intents and purposes.\nAnd, when asked why he's coming forward now, at the age of 65, his answer was simple."}
