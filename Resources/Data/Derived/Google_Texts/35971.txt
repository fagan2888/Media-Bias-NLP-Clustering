President Obama is using your dad’s favorite invention of 2014: The selfie stick.

But the President wasn’t mugging for vanity’s sake. Rather, Obama created a millennial-friendly video with Buzzfeed as a way to get young Americans to sign up for health insurance ahead of the latest Obamacare enrollment deadline.

This isn’t the first time the President has used humor to advertise the Affordable Care Act. Last year, Obama worked with Funny or Die on the hilarious and very viral video Between Two Ferns.
