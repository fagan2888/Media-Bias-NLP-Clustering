When it comes to the network\u2019s cable and online programming there are now but two overarching rules in place.\n\n1) Take every opportunity to bash Obamacare.\n\n2) When covering anything else, see Rule #1.\n\nAnecdotal evidence of Fox News\u2019s willingness to obsess over Obamacare to the detriment of other big news is aplenty, as I documented after sitting through six hours of Election Night coverage earlier this month. Ironically, the network\u2019s fixation on the President\u2019s healthcare reform law that night caused it to be late to the game in adopting the mainstream media\u2019s McAulliffe-almost-lost-because-of-Obamacare meme.

So much so that Fox\u2019s Obamacare coverage now even eclipses cataclysmic worldwide tragedies like Typhoon Haiyan. Just how dramatically out of whack Fox\u2019s news judgment is was quantified by Pew Research study last week. In tracking 20 hours of programming across five days in mid-November, Pew found Fox News devoted nearly eight hours\u2014almost 40% of its entire newshole\u2014to just one issue: Obamacare. As for covering the aftermath of one of the worst natural disasters in decades, Fox News devoted just six minutes of airtime\u2014the equivalent of two commercial breaks. (Even opinion-heavy MSNBC spent 41 minutes covering Haiyan, and just over three hours on Obamacare.)\n\nTo be sure, Obamacare is a big story and some critical media coverage of the botched Healthcare.gov rollout is certainly warranted, as are questions about the president\u2019s \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep\u201d broken promise. But fair-minded accountability journalism is not what Roger Ailes is trying to achieve with his network\u2019s rabid focus on Obamacare. It\u2019s not the quantity of Fox News\u2019s coverage that\u2019s problematic; it\u2019s the quality. Or should I say lack thereof. When taken as whole, Fox\u2019s news products have clearly metastasized into a toxic media mass of one-sided hyperbole, willful misinformation, and outright anti-Obamacare propaganda.

In the Medicaid story from above, for instance, the writer stokes fears of Obamacare by citing a flawed, oft-debunked study that suggests that Medicaid patients die twice as often as those with private insurance. (Here\u2019s why that\u2019s wrong.) And my favorite wingnut-special column from above throws everything but the socialized communal kitchen sink at the reader, whether it\u2019s tired canards like \u201cChicago-style corruption\u201d and \u201creplac[ing] free markets\u201d or actual falsehoods like Obamacare is ballooning healthcare costs (nope), and the law has ignited a wave of businesses hiring part-time workers (sorry). Ad Policy\n\nIn the past week, however, Fox News\u2019s radically dishonest coverage has moved beyond to surreal to the absurd. Now so blinded by its outrage over the healthcare reform law, the network\u2019s programming can no longer see anything else as but a reflection of Obamacare. Of course, the Iran nuclear deal was the big news over this past weekend, but even above and beyond the network\u2019s standard bellicose blovation [a sample chyron: \u201cSucker\u2019s Deal\u201d], Fox News is there to remind viewers that it\u2019s all just a transparent attempt at distraction.\n\nThere was half-term Gov. Sarah Palin on Fox News Sunday singing this same song to host Chris Wallace about Senator Harry Reid\u2019s exercising of the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d But when, in the midst of his obsequiousness, Wallace actually pointed out to Palin that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will give healthcare to 30-million uninsured Americans while the latest GOP plan would only cover three million, Palin\u2019s misdirection-as-response was the very definition of tinfoil-hat chutzpah. First, she dismissed the CBO\u2019s numbers as unreliable and then had the temerity to call it a \u201csad state of affairs\u201d that \u201ca normal American\u201d such as herself has to be so cynical about government. And, for that matter, why hasn\u2019t Obama ever proved that his FEMA re-education camps don\u2019t exist? Probably because if he did, it\u2019d all be part of grand scheme to\u2026you guessed it\u2026distract from Obamacare\u2019s failures.\n\nSure, Fox\u2019s lukewarm embrace of Obama conspiracies is nothing new. But still, it\u2019s a wake-up call to our discourse when former President Bush spokesperson and U.S. foreign policy history buff Dana Perino prefaces a question about the timing of the Iran deal to conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer with the always responsible phrase: \u201cI\u2019m not the biggest conspiracy theorist, but\u2026\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019ll no doubt be shocked, shocked to learn, Krauthammer agreed with her implied suggestion that this whole diplomatic initiative with Iran was little more than a panicked put-on by the White House. And who could argue with his logic, particularly since he does such a fine job of it himself: \u201cThey clearly were in a hurry, though they probably would have gotten here with or without the collapse of Obamacare, but it sure gave them an extra incentive to get in a hurry because they need any distraction, any distraction possible for a government in collapse.\u201d So, not even credit given for being an efficient appeaser? Tough room.\n\nOK, so what? Fox News long ago\u2014like since its first day on the air\u2014cast aside any pretensions about objectivity to promote its owner's and president\u2019s political preferences. And Obama\u2019s presence in the White House has only turned that latent animosity up to 11. But when a network so fully walls itself off from impartiality and honesty, it really does matter, particularly when one political party is so in thrall to their propaganda that it bases its dogma on it.\n\nCase in point, only minutes after the nuclear deal with Iran was reached on Friday night, Republican Senator John Cornyn was Tweeting this: \u201cAmazing what [White House] will do to distract from [Obama]care.\u201d And as the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent noted, Republicans\u2014just like before the 2012 election and during the government shutdown last month\u2014are again cocooning themselves inside a parallel universe where the Obama-is-doomed storylines on Fox are pre-destined to occur and unprecedented obstruction of the government is a winning strategy. In the long run, they\u2019ll be sorely disappointed once again, but thanks to Fox News, our nation will have to suffer through Republicans making the same momentous mistakes once more.\n\nContact me directly at reedfrichardson (at) gmail dot com.\n\nI\u2019m on Twitter here\u2014(at)reedfrich.\n\nEditor's note: To contact Eric Alterman, use this form.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Alterman, Reed Richardson", "description": "Alter-reviews 1) Hot Tuna Live X2 2) The Ramones Box Set 3) The Animals Box Set 4) Rock operas (sort of) by The Cowboy Junkies and a collaboration of Stephen King, John Mellencamp and T.

I\u2019ve got two box sets I want to let you know about in times for Thanksgiving. The first is an appropriately minimalist Ramones six-cd box of their first six records, nothing more, nothing less. The last Ramones box set was just the opposite, with fancy packaging, a comic-book history and a ton of songs on each cd. I had it for years but I never listened to it. When I bought the Ramones first cd on my first day of work at \u201cRecord World\u201d in August 1976, I thought it was a rip-off because it was only 28 minutes. Now I see that was part of their genius. This box is how they short be heard; in short, eplosive spurts\u2014like an orgasm... or a punch in the face. It\u2019s called Ramones: The Sire Years, and it\u2019s got no extras and not even a booklet. Just six cds... The Animals-The Mickie Most Years & More is a five CD set of the earliest years of the band during which time they charted eleven singles in this country in just two years, including \"The House of the Rising Sun\" \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" etc. Fifty years later, we\u2019ve got their first four American albums\u2014the first three produced by Mickie Most\u2014The Animals, The Animals on Tour, Animal Tracks, and Animalization in their original mono versions, now newly remastered from the original tapes. And tons of bonus tracks, including their first release ever, the I Just Wanna Make Love to You EP that came out on the Graphic Sound label in 1963 (later reissued by Decca in 1965 as In the Beginning There Was Early Animals), four tracks previously unreleased in the U.S., three single versions (including \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" and \"It's My Life\"), four alternate versions (three in stereo) of such tracks as \"Talkin' 'Bout You\" and \"Don't Bring Me Down,\" and one U.K.-only track (\"Roadrunner).\" Packaging is okay. Today\u2019s the release date. Be the first on your block. It ain\u2019t cheap, though.

And tons of bonus tracks, including their first release ever, the I Just Wanna Make Love to You EP that came out on the Graphic Sound label in 1963 (later reissued by Decca in 1965 as In the Beginning There Was Early Animals), four tracks previously unreleased in the U.S., three single versions (including \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" and \"It's My Life\"), four alternate versions (three in stereo) of such tracks as \"Talkin' 'Bout You\" and \"Don't Bring Me Down,\" and one U.K.-only track (\"Roadrunner).\" Packaging is okay. Today\u2019s the release date. Be the first on your block. It ain\u2019t cheap, though. I also want to give a mention to a marvelously ambitous release by one of my favorite bands, The Cowboy Junkies. \u201cThe Kennedy Suite\u201d is a rock opera, song cycle, post-modern musical that tells the story of the JFK assassination through the fragmented narratives of a series of characters, each of whom experiences the tragedy from their own intensely personal perspective. The recording is a collaboration that combines the original work of Toronto composer and lyricist Scott Garbe as arranged, recorded and produced by the Cowboys along with Andy Maize and Josh Finlayson of Skydiggers. It could have been a catastrophe but it\u2019s not at all. The music holds up too. Margo Timmins has one my favorite voice on earth and this rewards repeated listenings. And while we\u2019re on this topic, I don\u2019t know if I ever recommended the wonderful collaboration between Stephen King, John Mellencamp and T. Bone Burnett, T Bone Burnett for the Southern gothic supernatural musical Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, featuring performances by Elvis Costello, Rosanne Cash, Sheryl Crow, Neko Case, Taj Mahal, Ryan Bingham, Will Dailey and Kris Kristofferson, along with actors Matthew McConaughey, Samantha Mathis and Meg Ryan. It\u2019s also a digital book, which is, of course, best read with the music on. Read all about it here. It\u2019s a wonderful meeting of many minds. Now here\u2019s Reed: Fox News: Now the Anti-Obamacare Propaganda Channel by Reed Richardson The evolution hasn\u2019t been overnight, but if you spend any time watching Fox News nowadays the endstate is unmistakable. When it comes to the network\u2019s cable and online programming there are now but two overarching rules in place. 1) Take every opportunity to bash Obamacare. 2) When covering anything else, see Rule #1. Anecdotal evidence of Fox News\u2019s willingness to obsess over Obamacare to the detriment of other big news is aplenty, as I documented after sitting through six hours of Election Night coverage earlier this month. Ironically, the network\u2019s fixation on the President\u2019s healthcare reform law that night caused it to be late to the game in adopting the mainstream media\u2019s McAulliffe-almost-lost-because-of-Obamacare meme. (Which was total bunk.) But the most damning proof of this now singular devotion to all-Obamacare, all-the-time coverage comes in statistical form. A quick term search on FoxNews.com, for example, offers up a revealing pattern on the number of stories posted there for the past year/month/week/day: Obamacare\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1698\u00a0 427\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18 NSA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 716\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 92\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 Benghazi\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 792\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 IRS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 503\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5 Budget deficit\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 467\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0 As each of these much-touted-by-the-right-wing \u201cscandals\u201d have withered and died on the media vine without bearing fruit, the alleged horrors of Obamacare have been planted by Fox News to take their place. So much so that Fox\u2019s Obamacare coverage now even eclipses cataclysmic worldwide tragedies like Typhoon Haiyan. Just how dramatically out of whack Fox\u2019s news judgment is was quantified by Pew Research study last week. In tracking 20 hours of programming across five days in mid-November, Pew found Fox News devoted nearly eight hours\u2014almost 40% of its entire newshole\u2014to just one issue: Obamacare. As for covering the aftermath of one of the worst natural disasters in decades, Fox News devoted\u00a0just six minutes of airtime\u2014the equivalent of two commercial breaks. (Even opinion-heavy MSNBC spent 41 minutes covering Haiyan, and just over three hours on Obamacare.) To be sure, Obamacare is a big story and some critical media coverage of the botched Healthcare.gov rollout is certainly warranted, as are questions about the president\u2019s \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep\u201d broken promise. But fair-minded accountability journalism is not what Roger Ailes is trying to achieve with his network\u2019s rabid focus on Obamacare. It\u2019s not the quantity of Fox News\u2019s coverage that\u2019s problematic; it\u2019s the quality. Or should I say lack thereof. When taken as whole, Fox\u2019s news products have clearly metastasized into a toxic media mass of one-sided hyperbole, willful misinformation, and outright anti-Obamacare propaganda. Consider these \u201cfair and balanced\u201d headlines\u2014some \u201cnews,\u201d some opinion\u2014 from just the past few days: \u201cObamaCare: A Doctor\u2019s Nightmare\u201d \u201cObamaCare Slams Smokers with Sky-High Premium Costs\u201d \u201cUnions Given \u2018Special\u2019 ObamaCare Deal\u201d \u201cObamcare Forcing People into Medicaid\u201d \u201cHow Should GOP Attack ObamaCare?\u201d \u201cHow ObamaCare Has Diminished the President\u201d \u201cDog Has Bone to Pick with ObamaCare\u201d Or my personal nominee in the could-have-run-on-Free-Republic category: \u201cObamacare\u2019s Arrogance, Corruption, and Abuse is Just Beginning\u201d But buried below the rampant bias evident in these headlines are even more misleading talking points. In the Medicaid story from above, for instance, the writer stokes fears of Obamacare by citing a flawed, oft-debunked study that suggests that Medicaid patients die twice as often as those with private insurance. (Here\u2019s why that\u2019s wrong.) And my favorite wingnut-special column from above throws everything but the socialized communal kitchen sink at the reader, whether it\u2019s tired canards like \u201cChicago-style corruption\u201d and \u201creplac[ing] free markets\u201d or actual falsehoods like Obamacare is ballooning healthcare costs (nope), and the law has ignited a wave of businesses hiring part-time workers (sorry). In the past week, however, Fox News\u2019s radically dishonest coverage has moved beyond to surreal to the absurd. Now so blinded by its outrage over the healthcare reform law, the network\u2019s programming can no longer see anything else as but a reflection of Obamacare. Of course, the Iran nuclear deal was the big news over this past weekend, but even above and beyond the network\u2019s standard bellicose blovation [a sample chyron: \u201cSucker\u2019s Deal\u201d], Fox News is there to remind viewers that it\u2019s all just a transparent attempt at distraction. There was half-term Gov. Sarah Palin on Fox News Sunday singing this same song to host Chris Wallace about Senator Harry Reid\u2019s exercising of the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d But when, in the midst of his obsequiousness, Wallace actually pointed out to Palin that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will give healthcare to 30-million uninsured Americans while the latest GOP plan would only cover three million, Palin\u2019s misdirection-as-response was the very definition of tinfoil-hat chutzpah. First, she dismissed the CBO\u2019s numbers as unreliable and then had the temerity to call it a \u201csad state of affairs\u201d that \u201ca normal American\u201d such as herself has to be so cynical about government. And, for that matter, why hasn\u2019t Obama ever proved that his FEMA re-education camps don\u2019t exist? Probably because if he did, it\u2019d all be part of grand scheme to\u2026you guessed it\u2026distract from Obamacare\u2019s failures. Sure, Fox\u2019s lukewarm embrace of Obama conspiracies is nothing new. But still, it\u2019s a wake-up call to our discourse when former President Bush spokesperson and U.S. foreign policy history buff Dana Perino prefaces a question about the timing of the Iran deal to conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer with the always responsible phrase: \u201cI\u2019m not the biggest conspiracy theorist, but\u2026\u201d As you\u2019ll no doubt be shocked, shocked to learn, Krauthammer agreed with her implied suggestion that this whole diplomatic initiative with Iran was little more than a panicked put-on by the White House. And who could argue with his logic, particularly since he does such a fine job of it himself: \u201cThey clearly were in a hurry, though they probably would have gotten here with or without the collapse of Obamacare, but it sure gave them an extra incentive to get in a hurry because they need any distraction, any distraction possible for a government in collapse.\u201d So, not even credit given for being an efficient appeaser? Tough room. OK, so what? Fox News long ago\u2014like since its first day on the air\u2014cast aside any pretensions about objectivity to promote its owner's and president\u2019s political preferences. And Obama\u2019s presence in the White House has only turned that latent animosity up to 11. But when a network so fully walls itself off from impartiality and honesty, it really does matter, particularly when one political party is so in thrall to their propaganda that it bases its dogma on it. Case in point, only minutes after the nuclear deal with Iran was reached on Friday night, Republican Senator John Cornyn was Tweeting this: \u201cAmazing what [White House] will do to distract from [Obama]care.\u201d And as the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent noted, Republicans\u2014just like before the 2012 election and during the government shutdown last month\u2014are again cocooning themselves inside a parallel universe where the Obama-is-doomed storylines on Fox are pre-destined to occur and unprecedented obstruction of the government is a winning strategy. In the long run, they\u2019ll be sorely disappointed once again, but thanks to Fox News, our nation will have to suffer through Republicans making the same momentous mistakes once more.

Both nights, morevoer, they were joined by musical ..great idea. In recent years, the extra guitarist has been G.E. Smith, and they had some incadescent moments. Campbell, however, plays more instruments and can sing a little bit and is married to someone who can really, really sing. The prettiness of her voice (face too, I might add) gave the band an entirely new dimension. I loved the version of \u201cSugaree\u201d they did\u2014something that would have been impossible, I think with just Jorma on vocals\u2014and of course, \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d was a real treat\u2014if over too soon. Jack and Jorma have not lost a step in the half-century or so of their fruitful association, but lately I\u2019ve been concerned that nobody gives amazing versitile Barry Mitterhoff the props he deserves. Eric Diaz on drums deserves a mention too, but Mitterhoff is amazing and together with the Campbells, it\u2019s an amazing ensemble. See them if you get the chance. I\u2019ve got two box sets I want to let you know about in times for Thanksgiving. The first is an appropriately minimalist Ramones six-cd box of their first six records, nothing more, nothing less. The last Ramones box set was just the opposite, with fancy packaging, a comic-book history and a ton of songs on each cd. I had it for years but I never listened to it. When I bought the Ramones first cd on my first day of work at \u201cRecord World\u201d in August 1976, I thought it was a rip-off because it was only 28 minutes. Now I see that was part of their genius. This box is how they short be heard; in short, eplosive spurts\u2014like an orgasm... or a punch in the face. It\u2019s called Ramones: The Sire Years, and it\u2019s got no extras and not even a booklet. Just six cds...

In the long run, they\u2019ll be sorely disappointed once again, but thanks to Fox News, our nation will have to suffer through Republicans making the same momentous mistakes once more.
