(AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File) (Photo: AP)\n\nDENVER - A new plan for government-run health care that covers everyone is coming from a surprising corner: Colorado, a politically moderate swing state where Republicans and Democrats often share control of state government.\n\nUniversal coverage proposals \u2014 known as \u201csingle-payer\u201d \u2014 have failed time and again in the United States. Left-leaning Vermont recently pursued such a system, only to abandon it as too expensive. President Obama\u2019s health care law doesn\u2019t cover everyone and has sparked enormous political backlash.\n\nIf the idea hasn\u2019t worked in states that embrace Canadian-style, government-run health care, what are the chances it will fly in a moderate state that has the nation\u2019s toughest restrictions on raising taxes?\n\nIt\u2019s a long shot, supporters concede. But they\u2019ve gotten the question onto 2016 ballots and hope that dissatisfaction on both sides with the current federal health law will make Colorado the first state to set up universal health care.\n\n\u201cI think we should take a picture of us throwing a bunch of cash down the toilet, because that\u2019s what we have right now,\u201d said Shelley Cohen of Denver, an advocate who handed out flyers about the plan at a recent meeting in a Denver church fellowship hall. About two dozen people came to hear details.\n\nThe plan would work like this: There would be a new, $25 billion-a-year tax taken out of paychecks, similar to how Medicare is funded. That money would then go to an elected board of trustees, which would act as an enormous insurance company and reimburse doctors.\n\nThe ColoradoCare tax would raise enough to cover everyone, even people who don\u2019t work or aren\u2019t legally in the country. It\u2019s not exactly a \u201csingle-payer\u201d plan, because Medicare and the military health care system would remain intact. But co-payments and deductibles would go away.\n\nAnd so would most insurers. A brochure explaining the plan touts, \u201cIt is assumed that residents and Colorado businesses will choose to discontinue purchasing other insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nThe campaign projects ColoradoCare would run annual surpluses of $2 billion, based mostly on trimming administrative costs from insurers and doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nSupporters insist voters are so soured on insurance companies and complicated insurance exchanges that they are ready to try a radical new way of providing health care.\n\n\u201cWe will save not millions but billions,\u201d said Jeanne Nicholson, a retired nurse and former Democratic state senator who is touring the state leading workshops on ColoradoCare.\n\nEdmund F. Haislmaier, a health policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he\u2019s skeptical Colorado\u2019s plan will win public support. The price tag is so eye-popping \u2014 almost doubling the size of Colorado\u2019s overall budget overnight \u2014 that even health-reform fatigue may not carry the campaign, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can write the opposition campaign now. \u2018Do you want your health care to look like the Post Office or DMV?\u2019 The average person kind of gets that,\u201d Haislmaier said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about forking over an extra 10 cents a dollar on top of all your taxes, people aren\u2019t going to like it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a recent campaign to raise Colorado income taxes to shore up the state\u2019s struggling public school system lost badly, despite almost universal acceptance that schools are underfunded. The 2013 schools income tax question would have raised taxes $950 million a year, a fraction of the ColoradoCare tax, but failed nearly 2-to-1.\n\nEven supporters of single-payer health care have questions about ColoradoCare.\n\nAt the Denver meeting, one physician asked about the elected board of trustees that would set premiums and decide what to pay doctors for their services.\n\n\u201cThis board is absolutely going to control the money, and special interests are going to control the board,\u201d warned Dr. Vince Markovchick, professor emeritus of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine.\n\nOthers asked about abortion services \u2014 how could a government-controlled health system pay for them? The question raised the specter of ethical concerns about lots of medical services, from gender transition to fertility treatments to erectile dysfunction medicine. Shouldn\u2019t those services be left to the private sector?\n\nNicholson said that covered services would be determined by the elected board of trustees. She conceded that a board controlled by insurers \u201ccould undermine all our efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though this is going to be hard and there are going to be challenges, that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try,\u201d Nicholson concluded.\n\nColoradoCare supporters say they\u2019ve learned from Vermont\u2019s mistakes \u2014 such as trying to take over Medicare, instead of leaving care for people over 65 to the federal government. And the Colorado backers insist they won\u2019t set brute-force price controls on doctors in order to keep costs manageable, which could drive doctors out of business.\n\n\u201cDoctors are leaving now, because they\u2019re at the bottom of the food chain with insurers. Doctors who can afford to retire are retiring,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Irene Aguilar, a physician who is ColoradoCare\u2019s chief supporter in the Legislature.\n\nShe didn\u2019t guess how much it would cost to run a campaign to persuade voters to approve ColoradoCare. Win or lose, the question will be an economic boost, she joked.\n\n\u201cThis will be a great economic driver for our state because of all the opposition money that\u2019s going to pour into Colorado,\u201d Aguilar said with a grin.\n\nMore information: http://coloradocareyes.com/\n\nFull text of the initiative can be found here: http://coloradocareyes.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ColoradoCare_Full_Initiative.pdf\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
