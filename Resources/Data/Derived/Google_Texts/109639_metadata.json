That expiration will leave a $1.1 billion hole in the Medi-Cal budget \u2014 a deficit that was the central reason the governor in June convened the special session on health care.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disappointing that the health plans could not come together to support this proposal and the Republican legislators have refused to consider any tax adjustments at all,\u201d Diana Dooley, director of the state Health and Human Services agency, said in a written statement.\n\n\u201cWithout additional revenue,\u201d Dooley said, \u201cthere will be no alternative to reductions in our health care spending, jeopardizing the significant gains we have made through our implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIn July, federal officials made it clear it would not allow the current MCO tax formula California uses. With the current tax, only managed care organizations participating in Medi-Cal are taxed. California gets $1.1 billion in federal matching dollars on that money and then the MCOs are reimbursed through Medi-Cal services they provide. Federal officials said if California wants to continue taxing managed care organizations the state must tax all of them.\n\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with the MCOs that don\u2019t participate in Medi-Cal. The first proposal had the non-Medi-Cal MCOs footing a $680 million bill, then that number dropped to $320 million. The state sweetened that offer by adding significant tax cuts for those affected health plans, dropping the financial hit on non-Medi-Cal MCOs to roughly $118 million.\n\nBut even with the tax cut offset, that\u2019s still a new tax of $118 million on the health plans that don\u2019t participate in Medi-Cal.\n\nCharles Bacchi, president and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, said funding for Medi-Cal is important but he wants to wait until a new MCO tax solution can be hammered out.\n\n\u201cThroughout the year, health plans have worked constructively with all parties so we do not lose critical funding for Medi-Cal, while preventing significant imbalance in the health care marketplace and minimizing the impact on premiums. It has been a difficult task,\u201d Bacchi said in a statement.\n\nHe said the Legislature still has time at the start of the year to figure out a better funding strategy, since the current MCO tax doesn\u2019t expire until June 2016.\n\nDooley said the time to act is now.\n\n\u201cWe did everything we could to make this work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe put a good plan on the table.\u201d\n\nDooley hopes legislators can still help broker a deal with the health plans, even though the regular session won\u2019t meet again until Jan. 4 \u2014 in part because this item is part of the special session, which didn\u2019t adjourn when the regular session did.\n\n\u201cWith the special session still open,\u201d Dooley said, \u201cit is now up to the plans which refused to endorse this proposal, and the Republicans who refused to consider it, to stop drawing lines and start putting solutions on the table.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The California Legislature has finished its business for 2015 without replacing a tax on managed care organizations.
