The clock counts down while the announcer eggs on each opponent. The buzzer goes off, and the two very dissimilar machines take flight. A crowd of dozens has gathered in this San Francisco warehouse to watch this week\u2019s Game of Drones.\n\nIt all started three years ago when two self-proclaimed robotics geeks decided to turn their drone-fighting hobby into a business.\u201cOn Friday nights we would gather, and build stuff, and one thing led to another and then ultimately we were crashing our creations into each other, and that just became a lot of fun,\u201d said co-founder Eli D\u2019Elia.Game of Drones sells recreational unmanned aerial vehicles \u2014 commonly referred to as UAVs \u2014 but they\u2019re not quite like the sinister-looking military drones that dominate public perception. Founded by D\u2019Elia and Marque Cornblatt, the company manufactures, sells, hosts and promotes all things drone-related. Its signature model, \u201cHiro\u201d is colorful, affordable, and most importantly, built to take a beating.While the company started in 2011 to sell its combat-proof drones to like-minded enthusiasts, its patrons are anything but homogenous. From cattle herding to racing, the world recreational drone play is ever expanding and the growing attendance at events, like the weekly drone fights, point to the trend.\u201cThe first time we did it, it was just us, and by the second or third time it was fifty or sixty people,\u201d said Wayne de Geere, a drone enthusiast who is building his own drone with his son from scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the drone version of the Homebrew Computer Club,\u201d a reference to the tech meet-up of amateur computer developers in the 1970s that helped spark the personal computer revolution.It\u2019s an eclectic mix. At the drone fight, ages ranged from 8 to well over 60. \u201cRemember there are no age limits,\u201d the referee announced during one of several high-energy matches. Some attendees were seasoned fighters. Others were tinkerers. Some were there to quietly explore if the technology could be used in their business. Even reality television star-turned television host, Audrina Patridge, was there to film the event.While the negative media coverage of government and military drones has some people drawing their blinds, members and friends of Game of Drones \u2014 the name, a take-off of the violent HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 gather with enthusiasm and UAVs in-hand.Mike Campo, an experienced real estate broker, says he likes the technology because it\u2019s both complex and accessible. \u201cI like to try drones myself, I do aerial photography,\u201d Campo said. \u201cYou can basically send it up, and let it stay there and take a picture.\u201dThe younger crowd is just as enthusiastic. Wayne de Geere\u2019s 8-year-old son, Deane, whose feet barely brush the floor as they swing from the folding chair he sits in, said it\u2019s the action that\u2019s drawn him to the sport. \u201cI like that there\u2019s a lot of destruction,\u201d he said with the confidence of someone twice his age, \u201cI\u2019m building my own.\u201dFourteen-year-old Kyle Ettinger has already won a number of fights with his DIY-drone. It\u2019s a relatively colossal piece of equipment, complete with a sturdy wood frame and a netting to entangle his opponents.Ettinger\u2019s interest in the drone world began when he was working at a local hobby store. He said the moment he saw the impressive piece of technology he thought to himself, \u201cI just had to have one, so I went out and bought one, and I\u2019ve been loving drones ever since.\u201dAnd his dad couldn\u2019t be prouder. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate about it,\u201d said Gary Ettinger, Kyle\u2019s dad, with a glowing smile. \u201cWhen he\u2019s passionate about something he\u2019s going to be learning something. It\u2019s all positive; it\u2019s just amazing.\u201dIt\u2019s clear that the technology is no longer reserved for CIA operations and Syfy channel B-movies. A simple Google shopping search yields mini models priced as low as $20 from sellers like Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and just under $400 from Brookstone.D\u2019Elia says the phenomenon isn\u2019t confined to the U.S. by any means. A good portion of his sales are international, with customers ordering from as far away as Australia. And D\u2019Elia says the international market is growing even faster than the U.S. market.He thinks the negative press and public perception about drones in the United States is undercutting domestic sales potential. Just last year, the San Jose community was up in arms after discovering the San Jose Police Department had quietly acquired its own UAV .Still, he feels the interest in the technology will soon outweigh the public\u2019s fear. And the positive uses of drones go far beyond policing or surveillance. \u201cThe drone space is where computers were in the early \u201990s,\u201d D\u2019Elia said, adding that drones are well on their way to being widely used in almost every facet of life.\u201cWe\u2019re going to push ahead and innovate on every level,\u201d D\u2019Elia added. \u201cI\u2019m in competition with the rest of the world, and like it or not America is going to catch up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "From Friday night fights to aerial photography, recreational unmanned aerial vehicles are being used more and more for recreation.", "title": "Recreational drone industry taking off - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Hiro.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-27T16:28:03+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/01/15/recreational-drone-industry/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "UAVs", "published_time": "2015-01-15T10:57:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T16:28:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Friday night fights to aerial photography, recreational unmanned aerial vehicles are being used more and more for recreation.", "title": "Recreational drone industry taking off - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Hiro.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc9a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen he\u2019s passionate about something he\u2019s going to be learning something.\nIt\u2019s a relatively colossal piece of equipment, complete with a sturdy wood frame and a netting to entangle his opponents.Ettinger\u2019s interest in the drone world began when he was working at a local hobby store.\nA crowd of dozens has gathered in this San Francisco warehouse to watch this week\u2019s Game of Drones.\n\u201cI\u2019m in competition with the rest of the world, and like it or not America is going to catch up.\u201d\nAt the drone fight, ages ranged from 8 to well over 60."}
