Two Walton County residents are facing charges of manufacturing methamphetamine after two separate search warrants revealed equipment in their home.

37-year-old Keith Bay Lewis the second and 31-year-old Justin Colt Bray were initially being investigated for stolen property.

Walton County Sheriff's office investigators secured a search warrant for a Defuniak home at 118 Toledo Avenue after investigators heard reports of the stolen property being concealed there.

When investigators found traces of items used in meth manufacturing, they secured a second search warrant.

Along with a small amount of finished product methamphetamine, investigators also found ingredients and paraphernalia.

Lewis and bray are already facing multiple narcotics charges, but could face more.

The stolen property investigation is still on-going.
