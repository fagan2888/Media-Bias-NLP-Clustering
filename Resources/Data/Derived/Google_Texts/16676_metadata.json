Under the law, monetary penalties may be levied against individuals who do not carry insurance, or against businesses that employ 50 or more people and do not provide insurance.\n\n\n\nThe online enrollment period to apply for health insurance opened Oct. 1 and ends March 31, 2014. On Jan. 1, 2014, coverage for all insurance plans will begin. There are protections and provisions in the law for Native Americans.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Anyone eligible for Indian Health Service care is exempt from any penalty for being uninsured.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Federally recognized tribal citizens who wish to sign up for health insurance can do so at any time and do not have to adhere to the open enrollment period.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Individuals who earn less than $34,470 per year, or those with a family of four earning less than $70,650, can sign up and pay no out-of-pocket expense anywhere they get care.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Cherokee citizens can already enroll in Medicaid or Medicare at any Cherokee Nation Health Center. Assistance will be available soon for help enrolling in an ACA health insurance marketplace. Cherokee Nation Health Services is in the process of being trained and certified to assist.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 To find organizations by county that provide assistance signing up for an ACA plan, call 877-836-2111 or 918-295-1284 or visit www.211oklahomahelpline.org\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough our uninsured citizens do have access to excellent health care in our tribal health centers and are exempt under the new law, we still encourage them to sign up for Medicaid or through a health insurance marketplace,\u201d Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker said. \u201cEach visit to a Cherokee Nation health center or contract health visit can then be billed to insurance, which means more resources for the tribe as a whole.\u201d\n\n\n\nTribal citizens referred to non-Cherokee Nation health centers for specialized treatment may also get appointments sooner if they are enrolled in Medicare or through a health insurance marketplace.\n\n\n\nAbout 130,000 patients use Cherokee Nation\u2019s W.W. Hastings Hospital or its eight health centers. Of those, an estimated 46,000 do not have private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. The Cherokee Nation health system saw more than one million patient visits last year. The Cherokee Nation is funded by the federal government at about half its actual health care operational need. Remaining costs are billed to third-party insurers for patients with private insurance or Medicare or Medicaid. Remaining costs are paid out of pocket by the tribe.\n\n\n\nFor general information on the Affordable Care Act, visit www.tribalhealthcare.org or www.healthcare.gov or call Cherokee Nation Health Services Special Projects Officer Connie Dunavin at 918-772-4088 or 453-5657.\n\n\n\nCompleting an application will show citizens their eligibility status.
