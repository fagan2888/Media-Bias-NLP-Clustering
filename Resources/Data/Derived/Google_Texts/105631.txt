Iran celebrated its 37th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution with a parade mocking the capture of the 10 U.S. sailors, and by releasing images of one of the detained Americans with a face full of tears during his ordeal.

The reenactment took place on a parade float, using Iranians to act out both captives and armed captors roles.

This is just another action in a series of events that includes the capture and humiliation of American prisoners, an Iranian drone being flown over a US aircraft carrier, and on Wednesday, video of the U.S. sailors in tears.
