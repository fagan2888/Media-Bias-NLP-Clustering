For his blazing start and domination on both ends of the court, he\u2019s The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Few players have been hotter than Davis, who averaged 25.3 points 10.3 rebounds, 4.3 blocks and 2.8 steals per game in four games and shot 64.2 percent from the field. New Orleans won three of those four games, and Davis was among the NBA leaders in plus/minus at plus-11.\n\nBackground: Davis was squarely on the radar before the season, identified by many as a potential breakout star. And he\u2019s living up to expectations, perhaps even exceeding them. He is quickly making his case as the NBA\u2019s best power forward, leading a team trying to make the playoffs out of the league\u2019s toughest division, the Southwest.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: The beauty of Davis\u2019 game is how effortless it appears. The former Kentucky star runs the court and hits jump shots like a guard. Defensively, Davis blocks shots of the man he\u2019s guarding as well as on his \u201chelp side.\u201d He is setting a new standard for how that position is to be played at a time when older players who have dominated the position, such as Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett, are riding off into the sunset of their careers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Anthony Davis,NBA,spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Several players are off to great starts, and that list certainly includes New Orleans center Anthony Davis.", "title": "Anthony Davis: Spotlight on New Orleans power forward", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/15/anthony-davis-spotlight-new-orleans-power-forward/12068/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/Anthony-Davis.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Several players are off to great starts, and that list certainly includes New Orleans center Anthony Davis.", "title": "Anthony Davis: Spotlight on New Orleans power forward", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/11/15/anthony-davis-spotlight-new-orleans-power-forward/12068/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/11/Anthony-Davis.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Several players are off to great starts, and that list certainly includes New Orleans center Anthony Davis."}, "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Anthony Davis, PF, New OrleansWhen: Several players are off to great starts, and that list certainly includes New Orleans center Anthony Davis.\nNew Orleans won three of those four games, and Davis was among the NBA leaders in plus/minus at plus-11.\nDempsey\u2019s take: The beauty of Davis\u2019 game is how effortless it appears.\nHe is quickly making his case as the NBA\u2019s best power forward, leading a team trying to make the playoffs out of the league\u2019s toughest division, the Southwest.\nFor his blazing start and domination on both ends of the court, he\u2019s The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week."}
