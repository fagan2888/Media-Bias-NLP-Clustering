It\u2019s what the neoconservatives have wanted. It\u2019s what the vast majority of those on the stage want. They still want regime change. They want it in Syria. They wanted it in Iraq. They want it in Libya. It has not worked.\u201d\n\nPaul continued:\n\n\u201cOut of regime change you get chaos. From the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam. So we get this profession of, oh, my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism, and yet they\u2019re the problem because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos.\u201d\n\nPaul was right, of course, but that didn\u2019t stop the other candidates from beating the drums of war until their elbows ached.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarly Fiorina said: \u201cOne of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class \u2014 Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d\n\n(PolitiFact rated the assertion that all five generals left as a result of being frank with the president as \u201cmostly false.\u201d This woman has such a hard time just sticking to the truth.)\n\nIt has been said that this Republican cycle is dominated by fear and frustration among Republican voters who are not satisfied with national politicians and are becoming increasingly afraid on a number of fronts.\n\nThe anger I agree with completely, but I prefer another way of phrasing \u2014 or possibly explaining \u2014 the fear: overwhelming insecurity.\n\nI would posit that most of the issues that get traction in these debates, and indeed have gotten traction among Republican voters this cycle, have to do with a tremendous insecurity about power and safety \u2014 terrorism, the economy, immigration, gun rights, refugees, exploding drug addiction among white youth, policing, all of it.\n\nWe live in an America that is changing in dramatic demographic ways right before people\u2019s eyes. Many of our largest cities are already majority-minority or soon will be. The electoral map, altered by this growing number of minority voters, makes it increasingly difficult for Republicans to win the presidency, even as they enjoy overwhelming successes on the state and legislative levels.\n\nIndeed, Marco Rubio\u2019s failed attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform as a member of the Gang of Eight may prove to be an Achilles\u2019 heel for his campaign.\n\nWhen Rubio suggested that the too-calculating-to-be-trusted Ted Cruz had a record of being somewhat reasonable on some areas of immigration, Cruz summoned the bad juju of every used car salesman who ever lived, and gleefully shot back:\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that Marco wants to raise confusion, it is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty bill. And you know, there was one commentator that put it this way that, for Marco to suggest our record\u2019s the same is like suggesting \u2018the fireman and the arsonist have the same record because they are both at the scene of the fire.\u2019 He was fighting to grant amnesty and not to secure the border, I was fighting to secure the border.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCruz is still playing frenemy to the real estate developer, waiting for him to slip and fall, waiting for the chance to attract his supporters. But Cruz and Rubio are appealing to different wings of the party, so theirs can be a bare-knuckled brawl.\n\nJeb Bush even sought to link the immigration insecurity to the drug addiction insecurity, saying: \u201cClearly, we need to secure the border. Coming here legally needs to be a lot easier than coming here illegally. If you don\u2019t have that, you don\u2019t have the rule of law. We now have a national security consideration, public health issues, we have an epidemic of heroin overdoses in all places in this country because of the ease of bringing heroin in. We have to secure the border.\u201d\n\nThis, I am sure, plays well among Republican voters who have made their insecurities readily apparent to pollsters.\n\nFor instance, the Pew Research Center on Tuesday published a piece, \u201cFive Facts About Republicans and National Security,\u201d that included the following observations:\n\n1. For Republicans, international concerns now dominate.\n\n2. Republicans broadly support an aggressive approach toward the Islamic State and global terrorism.\n\n3. Republicans are more concerned than Democrats about a number of overseas security threats.\n\n4. In September, Republicans opposed the United States decision to accept more refugees.\n\n5. Most Republicans associate Islam with violence.\n\nWant to understand why the Republican primary session \u2014 including last night\u2019s debate \u2014 seems like such an absurdity to those of us who feel grounded in the belief that smart solutions can be arrived at, solutions that don\u2019t involve bombing Middle Eastern countries until we can determine whether \u201csand can glow in the dark\u201d?
