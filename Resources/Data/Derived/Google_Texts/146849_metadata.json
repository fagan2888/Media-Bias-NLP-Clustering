Three months later, an unrelated group of students gave a presentation on TED during a staff development event where students taught teachers.\n\nWhen those students found out that Truong had applied for a permit to host a TEDx conference, a planning committee was formed. Because none of the students had ever attended one of the conferences, senior Brittany Lee entered a contest to win tickets to the annual TEDx conference at Orange Coast College in September. She won two tickets to the event, which served as inspiration and a blueprint for Fountain Valley's TEDx.\n\nThe biggest obstacle the group faced was finding interesting speakers who would be willing to come speak at the school. The students reached out unsuccessfully to apparel manufacturer and Fountain Valley alum Bob Hurley.\n\nThe team tapped contacts they had through family and friends and eventually secured four speakers: Bill Phillips, chief technical officer of NeoSync Inc. in Newport Beach; Jin Yi, CEO of Newport Brain Research Laboratory Inc.; Sabastian Huynh, CEO of Minus Zero in Irvine; and Anna S. Lau, associate professor of psychology at UCLA.\n\nTED rules allow only 100 attendees at local events, unless the host has attended a full-blown TED conference. Parents and teachers showed up, but the sold-out audience was mostly students who paid $5 to attend the event on a Friday night.\n\n\u2014 Jordan England-Nelson\n\nNew ventures\n\nFieldConnect Inc., a company in Irvine that makes software for mobile workforces, is looking to hire salespeople with experience selling software or mobile technology and developers with Web technology experience to support its expansion.
