They rarely include shockers or attempts to wholly redefine a candidate. Not so for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 his announcement address at Miami Dade College this week was an extreme makeover that included passages that likely had America doing a double take.\n\nTo start, Bush slammed politicians for being too close to what he called Washington\u2019s \u201cswarms of lobbyists.\u201d Yet, Bush has relied on that multibillion-dollar influence industry to bankroll his political campaigns.\n\nThe New York Times reports that during his campaigns for Florida governor, \u201cBush received at least $237,000 from hundreds of lobbyists, lawyers, political consultants and others in the capital.\u201d In his presidential run, the Times also notes, he has already held \u201cseven private fundraisers and meet-and-greets in the Washington area,\u201d proof that \u201che seems to have mastered a skill that is crucial in this city: tapping into the money-raising clout of the K Street lobbyists.\u201d The Washington Post followed up with a lengthy list of lobbyists now working to help Bush win the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nBush also slammed \u201cpampered elites\u201d and insisted he is \u201cnot just another member of the club.\u201d Those lines, of course, came from the millionaire grandson of a senator, son of a president and brother of another president. Later in the speech, in fact, Bush actually highlighted part of that biography, noting that he is \u201ca guy who met his first president on the day he was born and his second on the day he was brought home from the hospital.\u201d\n\nBush highlighted education, which he considers one of his signature causes when he was governor of Florida. But in his presidential campaign speech, he veered away from his own record, insisting he believes that \u201cevery school should have high standards, and the federal government should have nothing to do with setting them.\u201d That declaration came from the same politician who has been an outspoken supporter of his brother\u2019s No Child Left Behind Act, which included a host of controversial federal education mandates. Additionally, Bush has been a strong supporter of Common Core education standards, which have been pushed \u2014 and financially incentivized \u2014 by the federal government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former governor is trying to rebrand himself as some kind of Washington maverick.
