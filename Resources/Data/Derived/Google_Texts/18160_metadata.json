Particularly disappointing was the decision to block the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to limit power plant emissions.\n\nOf all the problems facing the United States and the rest of the world, continuing to pollute the planet must rank at or near the top of the list. Long after there is peace in the Middle East, and the Islamic State is defeated, and poverty and genocide are distant memories, climate change, caused mainly by humankind\u2019s pollution and overpopulation, will take a horrible and devastating toll on planet Earth.\n\nPresident Obama has outlined a definitive, unilateral plan to curb America\u2019s pollution, and the Supreme Court and Congress should wholeheartedly support it.\n\nHENRY A. LOWENSTEIN\n\nNew York\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThis is a win for the Everyman. Yes, we should be addressing climate change and pollution, but with consideration to all the costs we\u2019ve been asked to front. The solution to our environmental problems shouldn\u2019t be extremes of either tens of billions paid for by me and you, or no action at all. Instead, this problem requires a carefully charted course of change, and it requires the development of alternatives that can effectively function on our power grid. Entrepreneurs, start your engines!\n\nPAUL CHANDLER\n\nNew York\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn using cost assessment to overrule the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s restrictions on coal plant emissions, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling reflected the lament of the novelist Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote: \u201cThe good Earth \u2014 we could have saved it, but we were too damn cheap and lazy.\u201d\n\nBRUCE WATSON\n\nLeverett, Mass.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act subsidies. We\u2019ll all need health insurance now that the same court expects us to endure a toxic atmosphere. Apparently the court\u2019s majority opinion on the cost-benefit ratio works like this: We bear the costs, while power companies and mining concerns get to enjoy the benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nROBERT BRONSTEIN\n\nNew York", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150701032104, "twitter": {"description": "Readers react to a decision blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation.", "title": "Supreme Court Ruling, on Toxic Emissions From Coal Plants", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/opinion/supreme-court-ruling-on-toxic-emissions-from-coal-plants.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003771493"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/opinion/01LcoalWeb/01LcoalWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/opinion/supreme-court-ruling-on-toxic-emissions-from-coal-plants.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003771493", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/opinion/supreme-court-ruling-on-toxic-emissions-from-coal-plants.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Justices\u2019 Ruling on Toxic Emissions", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 1, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Environmental Protection Agency", "keywords": "Supreme Court (US),Environmental Protection Agency,Coal,Environment", "news_keywords": "Coal,Environment", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/opinion/01LcoalWeb/01LcoalWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers react to a decision blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/opinion/01LcoalWeb/01LcoalWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Readers react to a decision blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-07-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Environment", "published": "2015-07-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "01Lcoal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150701093756, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/opinion/supreme-court-ruling-on-toxic-emissions-from-coal-plants.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/01/opinion/01LcoalWeb/01LcoalWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers react to a decision blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation.", "title": "Supreme Court Ruling, on Toxic Emissions From Coal Plants"}, "pdate": 20150701, "des": "Environment", "articleid": 100000003771493, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Supreme Court Ruling, on Toxic Emissions From Coal Plants", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ec9\"", "article_summary": "President Obama has outlined a definitive, unilateral plan to curb America\u2019s pollution, and the Supreme Court and Congress should wholeheartedly support it.\nParticularly disappointing was the decision to block the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to limit power plant emissions.\nTo the Editor:It\u2019s a good thing the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act subsidies.\nWe\u2019ll all need health insurance now that the same court expects us to endure a toxic atmosphere.\nYes, we should be addressing climate change and pollution, but with consideration to all the costs we\u2019ve been asked to front."}
