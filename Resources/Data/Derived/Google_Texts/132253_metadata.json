Patients generally have the option to choose where they get treated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act is shrinking hospital margins and adding pressure on marketing teams to help generate incremental patients.\n\nFathom has seen a recent increase in the number of healthcare advertisers using PPC to drive more patients. This trend is reflected broadly in the U.S. healthcare and pharma industry. In fact, according to eMarketer, digital ad spending in that category will increase to $1.47 billion within three years (by 2017).\n\nKnowing the attention health systems pay to competition, Fathom decided to perform a competitive study\u2014\u201cHealth Systems & Paid Search: A Study of Service-Line Competition\u201d \u2014using a research tool called The Search Monitor. It allows you to survey keywords, search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.) and a location. The basic package offers scans of the search-engine results pages every four hours.\n\nHow can \u201cspying\u201d work to a health system\u2019s advantage? By determining which competitors\u2019 ads are listed for particular keywords, how often, and their average position. In hospital terms, it allows Fathom to tell clients which service lines their competitors are promoting and estimate how much they are spending in order to bring sharper strategy to their online marketing campaigns.\n\nOne of the most important competitive metrics that Fathom\u2019s health-system clients want to know is what their own impression share is vs. their main competitor(s). Impression share is basically how often ads are showing up vs. the number of searches for the keywords bid on. Impression share\u2014found within Google AdWords\u2014is either limited by budget or rank (average position). The Search Monitor allows advertisers to see keyword rank relative to frequency, which not only shows how often a health system and its competitors show up, but also reveals on average where each ranks!\n\nThe tool also allows systems to see their \u201cBiggest Threats by Market Share\u201d at the level of each service line or even keyword. This information is especially important, allowing the tracking of market share week over week to see who\u2019s spending more or less and gaining or losing market share. The technology also provides a report of \u201cNewest Threats by Market Share\u201d to better keep track of who\u2019s gaining traction and taking away incremental patients by increasing visibility.\n\nIn addition to spy technology tools, simple keyword searches can determine what competitors are bidding on, as well as analyses of ad copy and landing pages. Important questions to ask are:\n\nDoes the competition have multiple variations of ads for different service lines and keywords? Are they testing ads? Do they have the searched keyword in the ad copy? What is the call-to-action? Is the competition using ad extensions, such as sitelinks, call extensions, review extensions, and location extensions? What is the experience like from a mobile device? Are they promoting the same service lines on mobile? Do they have a responsive or mobile landing page? Are the competitors sending all ads to a homepage (seen all too often!). Are they using custom PPC landing pages or just sending users to a related page on their regular website? Is there a clear call-to-action, and is it consistent with the call-to-action on the landing page?\n\nTo learn more about the competitive study, see: \u201cHealth Systems & Paid Search: A Study of Service-Line Competition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Regardless of differences among health systems, one similarity is certain: They all want to know what their competitors are doing online and how they can do it better.\r\nMuch of the reason for the concern about competition is the fact that two or three health systems are typically situated within a 10-20 mile radius of each other.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Regardless of differences among health systems, one similarity is certain: They all want to know what their competitors are doing online and how they can do it better.\r\nMuch of the reason for the concern about competition is the fact that two or three health systems are typically situated within a 10-20 mile radius of each other.", "title": "How health systems can gain a competitive advantage in paid search", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Fathom_HEALTHCARE_Logo-Primary-Horizontal.png", "updated_time": "2014-06-03T15:19:44-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2014/06/health-systems-can-gain-competitive-advantage-paid-search/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Fathom_HEALTHCARE_Logo-Primary-Horizontal.png", "description": "Regardless of differences among health systems, one similarity is certain: They all want to know what their competitors are doing online and how they can do it better.\r\nMuch of the reason for the concern about competition is the fact that two or three health systems are typically situated within a 10-20 mile radius of each other.", "card": "summary", "title": "How health systems can gain a competitive advantage in paid search - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,, MedCity News", "article": {"section": "MedCitizens", "published_time": "2014-06-04T06:00:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T15:19:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Knowing the attention health systems pay to competition, Fathom decided to perform a competitive study\u2014\u201cHealth Systems & Paid Search: A Study of Service-Line Competition\u201d \u2014using a research tool called The Search Monitor.\nTo learn more about the competitive study, see: \u201cHealth Systems & Paid Search: A Study of Service-Line Competition.\u201d\nThis information is especially important, allowing the tracking of market share week over week to see who\u2019s spending more or less and gaining or losing market share.\nHow can \u201cspying\u201d work to a health system\u2019s advantage?\nBy determining which competitors\u2019 ads are listed for particular keywords, how often, and their average position."}
