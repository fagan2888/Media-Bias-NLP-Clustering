The hotel building being on fire was big news this morning, it\u2019s a big loss. But it completely left everybody\u2019s mind when we heard about Daniel,\u201d said local councillor Tracey Kings. \u201cEveryone is so overwhelmingly sad.\u201d\n\nMr Howard, also an electrical contractor, was \u201ccommunity-minded\u201d and \u201cbig-hearted\u201d, known for being generous at many fundraising events of the central western NSW town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had recently sung a Beyonce song with several friends at an event to support a young couple whose daughter had perished in a fire, she said.\n\nAnd a couple of years earlier, he had lent his unpolished vocals at an It Takes Two contest to raise funds to restore a vandalised cemetery.\n\n\u201cDaniel was the non-singer, but he gave it his best. He was a lot of fun,\u201d Ms Kings said. \u201cHe was in every way possible a good bloke.\u201d\n\nHe recently got engaged, she added. His Howie\u2019s Electrical business was a sponsor of the Cobar Camels Rugby Club.\n\nPolice have set up a crime scene at the New Occidental Hotel, which they say \"sustained extensive damage\". The second firefighter is being treated for a broken arm at Cobar Hospital.\n\nInvestigations are continuing into the cause of the fire, and police have appealed to the public for help.\n\n\"Police would like to speak with a man who was seen filming the fire on a camera. It\u2019s believed the footage could assist with the investigation,\" a statement reads.\n\nDetectives are preparing a report for the coroner. WorkCover has also been notified about the incident.\n\nMinister for Emergency Services Stuart Ayres paid tribute, saying Mr Howard had selflessly dedicated his life to the safety of his community as a firefighter.\n\n\"Daniel was doing what we ask firefighters to do every day, day in, day out \u2013 to run into buildings that are on fire, not to run out of them, to call on people and to help people when they\u2019re in their darkest hour and their time of need,\" he told Nine News.\n\nMr Howard had stayed at home this weekend, because there was no one else on call, Mr Ayers revealed.\n\n\"Three people owe their lives to the response from Daniel and his team today who may have lost their lives had Daniel not chosen to stay on call.\"\n\nFire & Rescue NSW Commissioner Greg Mullins said the death of Mr Howard was a loss to the entire firefighting community.\n\n\"He lost his life protecting other people in his community and on behalf of all members of Fire & Rescue NSW I extend our deepest sympathies to firefighters, family and friends.\"\n\nCrews were called to the inn at 8am following reports the building was alight. Ten people who had been inside the building were accounted for. About an hour later, the wall collapsed onto the two officers.\n\nCobar mayor Lilliane Brady called Mr Howard a \"gorgeous young man, a beautiful and brave one that I felt honoured to know.\" His death was a \"big loss... he was a real asset to the community.\"\n\nLinda Carter, a former councillor and manager of Cobar's RSL club, which sits opposite the New Occidental, said the fire took hold of the entire pub within 20 minutes.\n\n\"It was just starting when I arrived at work this morning, at about five to eight. There were two cleaners from the club banging on the windows to get people out.\n\n\"You couldn't see a block ahead, the smoke was so thick and the smell ... it was a really old building, full of timber. It was one of the original pubs.\"\n\nThe pub, she said, was the first sight visitors would see when they entered the town and had recently undergone a refurbishment.\n\n\"It's a sad day. It's an iconic part of the history of Cobar gone,\" she said.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Minmi Fire Station said it was a \"tragic day\".\n\n\"Our deepest thoughts and sympathies go out to Daniel's family, friends and colleagues. Another firefighter was injured during the fire, here's hoping he makes a full recovery,\" the post reads.\n\nGlenbrook Fire Station extended its \"deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of our comrade, who paid the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\nA large part of the Cobar's main street has had its electricity cut off and is closed for business.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The officer is believed to have suffered a cardiac arrest when a wall collapsed in a fire at the Occidental Hotel in Cobar on Sunday morning.", "title": "Fireman dies while fighting Cobar blaze", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/fireman-dies-while-fighting-cobar-blaze-20140817-1051ex.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "title": "Fireman dies while fighting Cobar blaze", "description": "The officer is believed to have suffered a cardiac arrest when a wall collapsed in a fire at the Occidental Hotel in Cobar on Sunday morning.", "card": "summary", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The officer is believed to have suffered a cardiac arrest when a wall collapsed in a fire at the Occidental Hotel in Cobar on Sunday morning."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a04\"", "article_summary": "Mr Howard had stayed at home this weekend, because there was no one else on call, Mr Ayers revealed.\nPolice have set up a crime scene at the New Occidental Hotel, which they say \"sustained extensive damage\".\nCobar mayor Lilliane Brady called Mr Howard a \"gorgeous young man, a beautiful and brave one that I felt honoured to know.\"\nThe hotel building being on fire was big news this morning, it\u2019s a big loss.\nThe close-knit community of Cobar is \u201cshell-shocked\u201d after a much-respected firefighter died while tackling a blaze at a hotel on Sunday morning."}
