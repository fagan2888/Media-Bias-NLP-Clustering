Conservative political commentator and former Florida Congressman Allen West has made his gun rights stance permanent with a new tattoo.

Aces High Tattoo shop posted the evidence on Instagram, with Mr. West showing off a “Molon Lab” tattoo on his right forearm, the Daily Caller reported Friday.

The Greek phrase is popular among second amendment supporters for its expression of defiance. It is believed that when the Persian King Xerxes demanded Sparta’s King Leonidas and his army to lay down their weapons at the battle of Thermopylae, Leonidas replied, “Molon Labe,” which translates “Come and take [them].”

The phrase was also popular motto during the Texas revolution and is now touted on t-shirts for gun rights activists.

This is not the first time Mr. West has drawn comparisons between modern politics and the popular Greek legend.

In a video posted on Youtube, Mr. West compares the epic battle to the conservative struggle against Obamacare, calling for a modern day Leonidas to rise up in the Republican party.
