A natural introvert not drawn to controversy or given to making bold statements, he\u2019s the kind of person who is happiest in the background. He lives alone in a modest house on a quiet street in a small town in East Northamptonshire. He doesn\u2019t want to be any more specific than that about the location. \u201cIf someone found out where I lived,\u201d he explains, \u201cthey could burn my house down.\u201d\n\nWhy should such an understated figure, someone who describes himself as a \u201cnobody\u201d, speak as if he\u2019s in a witness protection programme? The answer is that six years ago he decided to declare that he no longer accepted the fundamental tenets of Islam. He stopped being a believing Muslim and became instead an apostate. It sounds quaintly anachronistic, but it\u2019s not a term to be lightly adopted.\n\nLast week the hacking to death in Bangladesh of the blogger Ananta Bijoy Das was a brutal reminder of the risks atheists face in some Muslim-majority countries. And in an era in which British Islamic extremists travel thousands of miles to kill those they deem unbelievers, an apostate\u2019s concern for his or her security at home is perhaps understandable.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m scared,\u201d agrees Nasreen (not her real name) a feisty 29-year-old asset manager from east London who has been a semi-closeted apostate for nine years. \u201cI\u2019m not so worried about the loonies because it\u2019s almost normal now to get threats. What worries me is that they go back to my parents and damage them, because that\u2019s not unheard of.\u201d\n\nThe danger is confirmed by Imtiaz Shams, an energetic 26-year-old who runs a group called Faith to Faithless, which aims to help Muslim nonbelievers speak out about their difficult situations. Shams has a visible presence on YouTube and has organised several events at universities. \u201cI am at physical risk because I do videos,\u201d says Shams. \u201cI don\u2019t like putting myself in the firing line, but I had to because no one else is willing to do it.\u201d\n\nAs real as the potential for violence might be, it\u2019s not what keeps many doubting British Muslims from leaving their religion. As Simon Cottee, author of a new book The Apostates: When Muslims Leave Islam, says: \u201cIn the western context, the biggest risk ex-Muslims face is not the baying mob, but the loneliness and isolation of ostracism from loved ones. It is stigma and rejection that causes so many ex-Muslims to conceal their apostasy.\u201d\n\nLike the gay liberation movement of a previous generation, Muslim apostates have to fight for the right to be recognised while knowing that recognition brings shame, rejection, intimidation and, very often, family expulsion.\n\nVali comes from a strictly religious Indian-heritage family. He was born in Kenya and moved with his parents and six siblings to England when he was 14. As outsiders, his family stayed close \u2013 \u201cI always knew if I wanted anything they\u2019d be there for me,\u201d he says.\n\nHis father is an imam who follows the puritanical Deobandi scholastic tradition of Islam that has influence over a third of Britain\u2019s mosques. All through his teenage years, when adolescents typically rebel, and even at university, Vali dutifully followed his father\u2019s faith. Occasionally some of what he calls the more \u201cbarbaric punishments\u201d found in sharia law troubled him, but he put his discomfort to one side. \u201cI would just think, if God wants it, fine.\u201d\n\nIt was when he left his home in Leicester to work in Cambridge that he first encountered an intellectual challenge to his worldview. He found himself working alongside non-Muslims and atheists, and inevitably questions of faith arose.Initially he began researching criticism of Islam online and in the books of people such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens as a means of defending his faith. But in the process the suspicion took root that his opponents had the stronger arguments.\n\nNevertheless, he kept his reservations to himself when he returned to live in Leicester, where an arranged marriage awaited him. \u201cShe was very religious from a religious family,\u201d he says, still pained by the memory. But he couldn\u2019t go through with it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to lie and carry on with a marriage knowing that I didn\u2019t believe in God.\u201d\n\nHis decision went down very badly. His family would have forgiven him, though, as long as he remained a Muslim. That\u2019s all they really asked. And it was the one thing he couldn\u2019t do. He was perfectly happy to be a cultural Muslim, take part in celebrations and observe traditions, but he couldn\u2019t pretend a faith he didn\u2019t possess.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nasreen: \u2018I\u2019ve had bouts of clinical depression. The thing is, Islam teaches you to grow up with a lack of identity. Without the collective, you\u2019re lost.\u2019 Photograph: Andy Hall/Observer\n\n\u201cThis idea of belief,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t make yourself believe what you don\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nSo he confessed his atheism to his horrified family. One of his brothers reminded him that the penalty sharia law stipulates for apostasy is capital punishment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he would have any qualms about me being killed,\u201d says Vali, although he emphasises that he doesn\u2019t believe anyone from his family would seek to do him physical harm or encourage others to do so. Instead he was ousted from the family. He was disowned.\n\nThere has been a great deal of public debate in recent years about what drives young Muslims towards radicalisation. It\u2019s an urgent subject of study in various disciplines of academia, has spawned a library of books, and is the focus of well-funded government programmes.\n\nWhat is much less known about, and far less discussed, is the plight of young Muslims going in the opposite direction \u2013 those who not only turn away from radicalisation but from Islam itself.\n\nAlthough it is fraught with human drama \u2013 existential crisis, philosophical doubt, family rupture, violent threats, communal expulsion, depression, and all manner of other problems \u2013 the apostate\u2019s journey elicits remarkably little media interest or civic concern. According to Cottee, there is not \u201ca single sociological study\u2026 on the issue of apostasy from Islam\u201d.\n\nNo one knows what numbers are involved, few understand the psychological difficulties individuals confront, or the social pressures they are compelled to resist. As with many other areas of communal discourse, insiders are reluctant to talk about it, and outsiders are either too incurious or sensitive to ask.\n\nIn this sense the struggle of ex-Muslims is markedly different from that of early gay rights campaigners. Where gays and lesbians could draw support from other progressive movements, ex-Muslims are further marginalised by what Cottee calls \u201cthe contested status of Islam\u201d in western societies.\n\nTo raise the subject of apostasy is to risk demonising an embattled minority. Some will see it, almost by definition, as Islamophobic or even racist. To be a \u201cMuslim\u201d in 21st-century Britain is no longer simply about religious affiliation; it also suggests membership of a cultural entity that receives far more than its fair share of scare stories and alarmist reporting. So it\u2019s vital to be aware of the discrimination that many Muslims encounter. But what of the minority within the minority who have to deal with fear, guilt, shame and isolation? Must they remain invisible as a mark of religious respect?\n\nVali has seen his mother just once for a few minutes four years ago. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to touch me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe thought her God would be angry with her if she treated me kindly.\u201d\n\nWhat saved him from isolation was the Council of ex-Muslims of Britain, an association set up in 2007 by the Iranian-born secularist Maryam Namazie that campaigns to end \u201creligious intimidation and threats\u201d. The CEMB assists about 350 people a year, \u201cthe majority of whom\u201d says Namazie, \u201chave faced threats for having left Islam \u2013 either by their families or by Islamists.\u201d\n\nShe believes this number represents just the tip of the problem because the consequences of coming out deter many more from doing so. Many of the cases the CEMB deals with concern forced marriages, which Namazie says have been used to control those seeking to leave Islam.\n\nFor Vali, CEMB provided the reassurance of shared experience. \u201cThat was great. You just knew that you weren\u2019t alone. Before, I didn\u2019t know how many people there were out there, what sort of people, how they were thinking. I\u2019ve probably [now] met 100 ex-Muslims and I keep hearing stories of depression. I can understand it.\u201d\n\nIt is the same mental and emotional struggle Cottee observed when researching his book. \u201cThe majority of ex-Muslims I interviewed said they were profoundly lonely and isolated, and they related this directly to their apostasy and the secrecy and shame attached to it,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of those was 22-year-old Irtaza Hussain, originally from Pakistan, who hanged himself in September 2013. He had written on the CEMB forum: \u201cI hate how I am completely alienated from society and will never find a way to fit in.\u201d\n\nOf course it\u2019s an unfortunate truth that there are young men from all walks of life who feel alienated, and some take their own lives for a variety of reasons. Yet it\u2019s also true that Hussain felt trapped and lost between two worlds \u2013 the one he was attempting to leave and the one he couldn\u2019t find a way to enter. If anything, it\u2019s a predicament young Muslim women more often find themselves in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult for women,\u201d says Nasreen. \u201cYou\u2019re much more visible as a woman. You\u2019re conditioned to behave in a certain way with a headscarf. I mean, you\u2019re not going to go to a pub with a headscarf, are you? You\u2019re not going to stay out late with a headscarf. It\u2019s a form of control.\u201d\n\nHer family was not particularly religious \u2013 \u201ccultural Muslims who prayed and would want you to dress modestly\u201d \u2013 but her sister was scouted at university by Hizb ut-Tahrir, a proselytising Islamist group. The then 15-year-old Nasreen soon followed her sister. \u201cI felt empowered as a teenager. It was this kind of pseudo-intellectualism. Spiritual religion gets a bit boring as a kid, so I liked the idea of politics too. It felt like a social movement and I was excited by that.\u201d\n\nIt was immediately after 9/11 and she turned up at school demanding to wear a long black dress instead of the school uniform. \u201cI said if you don\u2019t let me, you\u2019re breaching my freedom of expression as a Muslim, and they accepted it.\u201d\n\nShe loved the sense of rebellion her pronounced Muslim identity conferred. That was largely the extent of the politics. When she looked at Islamic countries, she didn\u2019t care about human rights atrocities. \u201cThere were women wearing scarves, that was what was important.\u201d\n\nBut slowly she began to address the rhetoric and assumptions that she\u2019d been filled with. \u201cI didn\u2019t have an epiphany,\u201d she says. Most apostates don\u2019t. Instead it\u2019s usually a long and often painful process of questioning. At first she tried to crush her doubts. \u201cI was scared. What was wrong with me? Why do I have these feelings and thoughts, they\u2019re so haram [forbidden].\u201d\n\nShe felt unable to speak to those closest to her, and was too ashamed to consult an imam. Like Vali, she researched online and the more she read, the more difficult it became to maintain her Islamic beliefs. But losing her religion has exacted a toll.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had bouts of clinical depression,\u201d Nasreen says. \u201cThe thing is, Islam teaches you to grow up with low self-esteem and lack of self-identity. Without the collective, you\u2019re lost. You\u2019ve been taught to feel guilty and people-pleasing as a woman, and you do that from a very young age. I kept thinking, \u2018Why do I want to wear short skirts? That\u2019s so disgusting!\u2019 No, it\u2019s not disgusting. It took me a long time to appreciate my sexuality and my femininity. There was a lot of stress. I lost my friends. You\u2019re very lonely and you\u2019re ostracised.\u201d\n\nHowever, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell her parents. And nine years later, she still hasn\u2019t informed them. Her compromise has been to let them know she doesn\u2019t pray or wear a headscarf. That\u2019s been problematic enough \u2013 her parents, like many Muslims, have become more religious over the past decade or so.\n\nShe blames the ghettoisation of multiculturalism and identity politics for this shift, the tendency to view individuals as members of separate cultural blocks. Or as Namazie puts it: \u201cThe problem with multiculturalism \u2013 not as a lived experience but as a social policy that divides and segregates communities \u2013 is that the \u201cMuslim community\u201d is seen to be homogenous. Therefore dissenters and freethinkers are deemed invisible because the \u2018authentic\u2019 Muslim is veiled, pro-sharia and pro-Islamist.\u201d\n\nOne success of the Islamist movement in Britain has been to define the cultural identity primarily in terms of religion.\n\n\u201cWe went from a Bengali to a Muslim community. It\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re suffering a second colonisation, the Arabisation of Asian cultures. Even my brother wears long Arab dresses.\u201d As a consequence, she thinks Muslims have been encouraged to police other Muslims.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a couple of examples,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other day I ordered some food online \u2013 pork buns \u2013 and afterwards a guy called me up from the company and he said \u2018Nasreen, do you know it\u2019s not halal?\u2019 I said yes, I\u2019m not a Muslim, but afterwards I wish I\u2019d said \u2018Who are you to police what I\u2019m eating? How dare you call me up to remind me.\u2019 But that\u2019s how people think: you\u2019re a Muslim, you\u2019ve got a Muslim name.\u201d\n\nShe took a degree in anthropology at the University of London. \u201cAnd I started to do my dissertation on ex-Muslim identity. My supervisor was this Muslim guy and he told me that it was rubbish, there\u2019s no academic purpose to it.\u201d\n\nShe had to complain to get another supervisor, who was very supportive, and, undaunted, continued with the research. \u201cI succeeded in completing an original piece of empirical research on the ex-Muslim reality,\u201d she says. \u201cI even went on to achieve a special award for this very dissertation. I felt quite vindicated by that.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, she detects a strong reluctance at universities to confront the concerted efforts by Islamist groups to lay claim to Muslim students. Not only are Islamic societies often run by extremists, with groups like the Islamic Education and Research Academy seeking to impose gender segregation, but the terms of academic discourse tend to endorse their brand of grievance politics.\n\n\u201cGo to your average sociology class,\u201d says Nasreen, \u201cand it\u2019s very much about making Muslims victims of Islamophobia \u2013 a terminology I disagree with. It\u2019s anti-Muslim bigotry. I dislike Islam \u2013 that\u2019s OK, it\u2019s an ideology, but I don\u2019t dislike Muslims. They are two different things.\u201d\n\nShe believes there needs to be secular spaces within Muslim communities. \u201cWomen within minority communities suffer massively because their only recourse is to go to some religious person, whether for counselling or any issue.\u201d\n\nShams, who seems remarkably self-possessed for his young age, agrees that there are particular gender issues that afflict disillusioned Muslims. To this end he has tried to link up with feminist societies at universities. \u201cBut there\u2019s a real problem in this country,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to touch anything to do with leaving Islam. Especially in universities, where the politics are insane.\u201d\n\nHe has a point. In recent times the National Union of Students have refused to condemn Isis on the grounds that this would justify Islamophobia. Shams believes that this kind of gesture and the NUS decision last month to lobby alongside Cage, the militant Islamic prisoners pressure group, undermines the position of dissenting Muslims. \u201cWhat it does is to say to reformists and secularists, you\u2019re not really Muslims.\u201d\n\nShams has set about combatting the intimidating atmosphere for nonbelieving Muslims on campuses by holding several Faith to Faithless meetings in universities around the country. The idea is to enable ex-Muslims to speak about their experiences publicly. The events, which can be seen on YouTube, have been tense as Islamists have staged protests, but they feature heart-rending tales of familial rejection and suicidal thoughts that have at least stimulated debate.\n\nShams comes from a Bangladeshi background but grew up in Saudi Arabia. He says that in many ways he found the ex-pat compound in which he and his family lived in Saudi Arabia more progressive than Britain. \u201cIt was when my mother came here that she got really radicalised.\u201d\n\nHe believes Muslims face an identity crisis.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who we are. There\u2019s a feeling of insecurity as a brown person, often for good reason. I went to school in a really white school. My nickname was \u201cTerrorist\u201d. The kids didn\u2019t know better. I grew up in that narrative. I was very religious. I believed there was a caliphate and we should fight for that. I had a strong sense of justice. One of the things that people do not understand about radicals is that they\u2019re often guided by a sense of justice.\u201d\n\nHe lost faith because his sense of justice could not be reconciled with the manner in which he was taught to believe other religions were bad.\n\n\u201cAt 20, I actually thought I was the only Muslim atheist in the world. You just don\u2019t know about it. I didn\u2019t know you could leave. There\u2019s not a concept of it. It\u2019s hard to explain. It\u2019s like knowing the world is round but you can\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nFully aware of the mental stress so many dissenting Muslims suffer, he has been working to get appropriate therapy for those going through the emotional dislocation of leaving Islam.\n\n\u201cOne ex-Muslim I know went to get therapy from a white female therapist and in the end she referred him to a Muslim support network.\u201d\n\nToo often, he believes, non-Muslims are unable or unwilling to see beyond the religious identity of Muslims. They are increasingly trained to understand religious needs but are frequently flummoxed by those who reject those needs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a secular or atheist Jew,\u201d says Shams, \u201cno one is going to say you\u2019re not allowed to say anything about your community. Of course you are. But with Muslims it\u2019s different \u2013 white people think you\u2019re not really Muslim. That\u2019s exasperating.\u201d\n\nIt certainly seems perverse that while there is no taboo on the discussion of Islamic radicalisation, the mention of Islamic apostates still occasions widespread discomfort. We can publicly accept that there are Muslims that are so estranged from western society that they prefer to live as fundamentalists, but have far more trouble recognising that there are Muslims who are so estranged from their religion that they prefer to live as freethinkers.\n\nNasreen, Vali and Shams all agreed that it will only be by bringing greater attention to Muslim apostates in British society that their predicament will improve. It would also help, they say, if they could rely on the progressive support that was once the right of freethinkers in this country.\n\n\u201cAttitudes need to change,\u201d says Cottee. \u201cThere has to be a greater openness around the whole issue. And the demonisation of apostates as \u2018sell outs\u2019 and \u2018native informants\u2019, which can be heard among both liberal-leftists and reactionary Muslims, needs to stop. People leave Islam. They have reasons for this, good, bad or whatever. It is a human right to change your mind. Deal with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Ex-Muslims who dare to speak out are often cut off by their families and fear for their lives.
