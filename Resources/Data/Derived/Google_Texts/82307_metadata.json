The FDA noted that these drugs can be harmful to the kidneys or heart, and may also lead to death if they are abused or misused.\n\n\u201cConstipation may not be a subject for polite conversation, but it\u2019s a condition that bothers many of us on occasion,\u201d the FDA states in a press release titled, \u201cUse Certain Laxatives with Caution.\u201d In its announcement, the FDA continued, \u201cConsumers and healthcare professionals should always read the Drug Facts label for [over-the-counter] sodium phosphate drugs and use these products as recommended on the label, and not exceed the labeled dose.\u201d\n\nIf a person takes more than the recommended dose of laxatives, this could not only lead to severe dehydration, but it can also change the levels of electrolytes in the blood and become harmful to organs. Typically laxatives, which can be taken both orally and rectally, soften the stool in the bowel by drawing water there \u2014 this particular class of laxatives is called saline laxatives and incorporates sodium phosphate.\n\nUsing these drugs in higher doses than prescribed \u2014 even just one single dose higher, or more than one dose per day \u2014 could lead to severe dehydration and death. \u201cThe bottom line is that these products are safe for otherwise healthy adults and older children for whom dosing instructions are provided on the Drug Facts label as long as they follow these dosing instructions and don\u2019t take the product more often, or in greater amounts, than the label instructs,\u201d Dr. Mona Khurana said in the FDA press release. Khurana is a medical officer in the Division of Nonprescription Regulation Development. \u201cIt is not possible to determine the precise rate of these events as no one knows how many individuals who take these medications may experience side effects. Not everybody who develops problems in association with sodium phosphate use reports to the FDA.\u201d In the report, the FDA noted that there were 54 cases of adverse side effects, with 13 people who died, after they took doses higher than prescribed.\n\nSome people even attempt to use laxatives as a way to lose weight, though this is a form of laxative abuse and can be dangerous. The illusion that \u201claxatives are effective for weight control is a myth,\u201d the National Eating Disorders Association says. Most food and calories are already absorbed by the time laxatives can get to work to expel waste, and thus the assumed \u201cweight loss\u201d is actually just water loss that will be replenished the next time you drink water.\n\nThe FDA suggests that people who are over the age of 55, or who are dehydrated, have kidney disease, bowel obstruction, or are using kidney medication, may be at the highest risk for complications from taking too high a dose. If you take these laxatives, pay attention to any symptoms, including dehydration, dry mouth, lightheadedness, and drowsiness. Kidney problems caused by sodium phosphate laxatives can cause decreased urine production and swelling of the legs. The FDA urges that if any of these symptoms occur, make sure to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Also, Khurana cautions caregivers to refrain from providing laxatives to children under the age of 2.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda laxatives, over-the-counter laxatives, consumers, constipation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA released new information cautioning consumers about over-the-counter laxatives, citing several deaths from misuse.", "title": "Over-The-Counter Laxatives: Why They Can Be Dangerous And Deadly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-cautions-consumers-over-counter-laxatives-13-deaths-misuse-reported-266874", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/10/stomach-pain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA released new information cautioning consumers about over-the-counter laxatives, citing several deaths from misuse.", "title": "Over-The-Counter Laxatives: Why They Can Be Dangerous And Deadly", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-cautions-consumers-over-counter-laxatives-13-deaths-misuse-reported-266874", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/10/stomach-pain.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/10/stomach-pain.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-10T17:16:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-10T17:16:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA released new information cautioning consumers about over-the-counter laxatives, citing several deaths from misuse."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabc7\"", "article_summary": "Kidney problems caused by sodium phosphate laxatives can cause decreased urine production and swelling of the legs.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety announcement this week that warns consumers of the dangers of over-the-counter sodium phosphate drugs, or certain kinds of laxatives, used to treat constipation.\nTypically laxatives, which can be taken both orally and rectally, soften the stool in the bowel by drawing water there \u2014 this particular class of laxatives is called saline laxatives and incorporates sodium phosphate.\nIf you don\u2019t read the over-the-counter laxative information and follow instructions properly before taking doses, you may be in trouble.\nThe FDA urges that if any of these symptoms occur, make sure to seek medical attention as soon as possible."}
