Nearly half of those polled, 45 percent, called the state of moral values in the U.S. \u201cpoor,\u201d while 34 percent said they are \u201conly fair.\u201d\n\nJust 19 percent rated American morals as either \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d and only 22 percent say the state of moral values is getting better.\n\nUnsurprisingly perhaps, social conservatives have consistently been most likely to tell pollsters that the nation\u2019s moral values are deteriorating, but the latest Gallup findings showed an uptick from 2014 to 2015 among social moderates and social liberals who believe moral values are regressing.\n\nRelated: How U.S. Morals Stack Up Against the World\n\nGallup also found that Americans\u2019 views of the moral acceptability of a number of key issues has been shifting to the left since 2001.

The change coincides with a sharp increase in support for same-sex marriage.\n\nSex between unmarried people has also become more acceptable, as has having babies outside of marriage. Polygamy and divorce are also now acceptable to a greater portion of the population than in 2001. On the other hand, the views of married men and women having an affair haven\u2019t changed much, with just 8 percent of Americans saying it\u2019s morally tolerable.\n\nHowever, respondents to the poll about the current and future state of moral values weren\u2019t necessarily responding with those charged social and political issues in mind. In many cases, Gallup suggests, their views of the moral direction of the country were rooted in something much more basic: \u201cThat is, their views have less to do with greater acceptance of same-sex marriage or having babies out of wedlock and other hot-button issues, and more to do with matters of basic civility and respect for each other,\u201d Gallup\u2019s Justin McCarthy wrote.\n\nClearly, the Golden Rule is still the bedrock of our moral code: Love thy neighbor as thyself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ask anyone about the state of moral values in the U.S. and you\u2019re likely to get a response along the lines of, \u201cwe\u2019re going to hell.\u201d", "title": "Most Americans Think Our Morals Are Going To Hell", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/03/Most-Americans-Think-Our-Morals-Are-Going-Hell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04152014_Satan_angel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/03/Most-Americans-Think-Our-Morals-Are-Going-Hell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04152014_Satan_angel.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ask anyone about the state of moral values in the U.S. and you\u2019re likely to get a response along the lines of, \u201cwe\u2019re going to hell.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5edb\"", "article_summary": "Nearly half of those polled, 45 percent, called the state of moral values in the U.S. \u201cpoor,\u201d while 34 percent said they are \u201conly fair.\u201dJust 19 percent rated American morals as either \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d and only 22 percent say the state of moral values is getting better.\nRelated: How U.S. Morals Stack Up Against the WorldGallup also found that Americans\u2019 views of the moral acceptability of a number of key issues has been shifting to the left since 2001.\nHowever, respondents to the poll about the current and future state of moral values weren\u2019t necessarily responding with those charged social and political issues in mind.\nOn the other hand, the views of married men and women having an affair haven\u2019t changed much, with just 8 percent of Americans saying it\u2019s morally tolerable.\nClearly, the Golden Rule is still the bedrock of our moral code: Love thy neighbor as thyself."}
