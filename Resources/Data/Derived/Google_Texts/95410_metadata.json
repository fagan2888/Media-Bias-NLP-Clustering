Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia might be some of the Senate\u2019s most influential members in the new Congress. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nSome of the most influential senators in the new Congress are neither in the majority nor among the longest-serving. They don\u2019t show up on the Sunday-morning talk shows, and they aren\u2019t talking about running for president in 2016.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re a pack of Democrats from mostly smaller, rural states who are inclined to work with Republicans on legislation President Obama doesn\u2019t support. They may even be willing to help the GOP override his vetoes.\n\nSome of them support building the Keystone XL oil pipeline and are expected to be active as the Senate begins to debate the issue this week. Others want Congress to pass tougher sanctions against Iran, and all are open to making changes to Obama\u2019s health-care law. All three issues have drawn veto threats from the White House in recent days.\n\nOne of the biggest unanswered questions about the week-old Congress is whether the new Republican majority will be able to overcome Capitol Hill\u2019s culture of stifling partisanship and cultivate enough Democratic support to challenge Obama.\n\nThese moderate Democrats say they will cooperate if Republicans don\u2019t use the Senate floor to score political points \u2014 as Democrats have done over the past several years. They have big expectations for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who will need to keep his larger conference unified while sustaining his promise to allow a more open and nonpartisan debate process.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who is firmly planted in the middle of both parties, said he\u2019ll support bills \u201cthat both Republicans and Democrats who sit down and talk to each other think will make things better for us. I think you\u2019ll see that extreme legislation \u2014 whether right or left \u2014 is going to go nowhere.\u201d\n\nThe moderates\u2019 influence could get an early test this week as the Senate begins debating the Keystone pipeline again. Despite an Obama veto threat, the House voted Friday to authorize the long-delayed project, with the support of 28 moderate Democrats. McConnell has promised a Keystone debate of several days, with time set aside to debate proposed amendments from both parties. Passage of those amendments likely will rest with moderate Democrats.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any particular issue that cries out for bipartisanship \u2014 all of the issues do,\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who strongly supports the Keystone project. \u201cThe challenges that we will have is making sure that we don\u2019t once again spiral into the thinking that it\u2019s okay to delay decisions, that it\u2019s okay not to do the work of the Senate.\u201d\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) spent his first eight years in the Senate confined to the minority and sounded envious of the new influence of some Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the majority and you\u2019re rank-and-file, you\u2019re taken for granted,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the minority, if you\u2019re somewhat interested in advancing our nation, you actually end up being paid far more attention than if you\u2019re in the majority.\u201d\n\nWorking with moderate Democrats will be critical for Republicans as they retake control of Congress, Corker said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be getting a report card very quickly from the American people regarding how we are able to legislate.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and his leadership team plan to give the moderates time and space to work with Republicans on some issues, especially since many of them ran on a promise to do so.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Reid won\u2019t play hardball. He warned last week that \u201cany attempt to erode protections for working American families . . . will be met with a swift and unified Democratic opposition.\u201d\n\nConversations with more than a dozen senators and senior aides in both parties revealed that several moderate Democrats are likely targets as Republicans begin work on their early legislative priorities.\n\nThree names came up in every conversation: Donnelly, Heitkamp and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a former governor who got his first taste of high-stakes dealmaking during the 2013 gun-control debate. The next mentioned most are a trio of former governors, Sens. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), who are from states that expect their lawmakers to negotiate with the other side.\n\nFrom there, other Democrats are \u201cgettable\u201d \u2014 a term used by many senators and aides \u2014 on a variety of issues. Sens. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), Robert P. Casey Jr. (Pa.), Christopher A. Coons (Del.), Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) were all mentioned as amenable to working on energy, economic, national security and tax issues.\n\nSo is Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), who earned credit for working with House and Senate Republicans last year on tedious government management bills. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) is also expected to stand with GOP hard-liners against Obama\u2019s overtures to Cuba.\n\n\u201cThere will be a group of about 15 Democrats who are willing to work with [Republicans] on any given issue,\u201d Kaine predicted in an interview. He is eager to work with the GOP on authorizing military action against the Islamic State and to revamp presidential war powers.\n\nFifteen is an encouraging number to Republicans, who now have 54 seats. If every Republican agrees on a piece of legislation, they will need to find at least six Democrats to help a bill clear the chamber\u2019s arcane procedural hurdles and pass. If a few Republicans peel away \u2014 which is likely given the inflexibly conservative views of some GOP senators \u2014 McConnell might need to rely on even more Democrats. Sixty-seven senators will be needed if Republicans want to override an Obama veto.\n\nThe White House has said that Obama also opposes a bill co-sponsored by Donnelly and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would change the Affordable Care Act\u2019s definition of \u201cfull-time employment\u201d back to 40 hours per week.\n\nDonnelly dismissed Obama\u2019s veto threat: \u201cIn Indiana and every other state, 40 hours is full time. It\u2019s just the way things are in America.\u201d\n\nHe said he wants to fix the health-care law, not repeal it: \u201cHow do you explain to somebody with diabetes or arthritis or a heart condition who\u2019s received health care for the first time in their life maybe that we\u2019re going to take it away from them? I don\u2019t want anything to do with that.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp predicted that the Keystone plan will pass in the Senate but that it will take longer to find senators willing to override Obama\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cThis first go-round we\u2019re not going to have 67,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have something in the neighborhood of 63. So we\u2019ll need to find four more votes. The question will be, would members be willing to reconsider a \u2018no\u2019 vote based on other priorities? That\u2019s the art of legislating.\u201d\n\nManchin, who was elected to the Senate in 2010, said he\u2019s eager to cut new deals in the next two years, because \u201cthe first four years wasn\u2019t that exciting.\u201d He confirmed that he\u2019s thought about running for governor again in 2016, but if the dealmaking intensifies, \u201cit makes it much more attractive for me to stay here and keep fighting the fight.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp did not deny that she is also thinking about running for governor in 2016, but she added, \u201cWhen I feel like we\u2019re making timely, effective decisions, that\u2019s when there\u2019s going to be job satisfaction.\u201d\n\nKing is staunchly opposed to the Keystone project. \u201cIt\u2019s not the role of Congress to be issuing building permits,\u201d he said. But he wants to work with Republicans on other energy issues and proposals to revamp the student loan system and cybersecurity policy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like this is an auction process where I\u2019m saying I\u2019m for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think and hope that I\u2019ve already established a reputation as someone who listens and tries to go for what\u2019s sensible.\u201d\n\nAs the chamber convened last week, virtually every senator seemed to have a bipartisan idea. Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) introduced a bill to crack down on animal poachers. Shaheen and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) unveiled a new version of their long-sought energy-efficiency legislation. Klobuchar and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced plans for legislation that would permit Americans to import prescription drugs from Canada.\n\nThose are exactly the kinds of ideas and partnerships that bring the moderates a renewed sense of optimism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some venting on both sides, but if that can be done in a way that doesn\u2019t lead to everybody going back to their foxholes, that would be really good for the country and for Democrats as well,\u201d Warner said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s restart season,\u201d he added. \u201cTrying to figure out ways to get to \u2018yes\u2019 is kind of an exciting opportunity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On some issues the GOP majority may have enough Democratic support to challenge the president.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "On some issues the GOP majority may have enough Democratic support to challenge the president.", "title": "Who are the most powerful in the Senate?
