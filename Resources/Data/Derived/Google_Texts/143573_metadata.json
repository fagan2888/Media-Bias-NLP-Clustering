King and more cheers than tears marked a family-and-friends memorial of the late blues great\u2019s life and legacy Saturday in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cB.B. was energetic, Amen?\u201d said Pastor Pamela Myrtis Mason to open the service that drew more than 350 to the Palm Mortuary chapel.\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d they said.\n\nKing\u2019s closed casket lay framed by floral arrangements, two of his guitars named Lucille and a tapestry showing him in eyes-clenched reverie picking a note from a section of the guitar frets dubbed by followers the \u201cB.B. King Box.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put your hands together for the King of the Blues, B.B. King!\u201d the pastor said.\n\nAs the applause ended, granddaughter Landra Williams dubbed him \u201cthe backbone of our family King.\u201d\n\nMore than 10 of King\u2019s 35 grandchildren and eight of the blues icon\u2019s 11 surviving adult children spoke during a two-hour service that was distinct for its intimacy and notable for its lack of acrimony.\n\nSeveral sang a capella versions of King classics. From Claudette King Robinson, it was, \u201c(Someone Really Loves You) Guess Who?\u201d\n\nWilliams, who lives in Houston, remembered her grandfather calling every woman in the family \u201cpretty girl,\u201d and spoiling them all, while making himself their confidant and protector.\n\n\u201cTo everyone else, he was a legend,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for us, he was love.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s generosity was recalled by grandson Leonard King Jr., who remembered being onstage when people praising the B.B. King show got a prideful earful from his grandfather about his kin.\n\n\u201cHis humility was almost as legendary as his music,\u201d the grandson said.\n\nRock guitarists Carlos Santana and Richie Sambora attended, although Santana left early.\n\n\u201cBuddy Guy and B.B. let me into the blues,\u201d said Sambora, longtime band member of Bon Jovi. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. He made me family.\u201d\n\nOther music notables are expected to attend memorials in coming days in Memphis, Tenn., and King\u2019s hometown of Indianola, Miss. The spirit of B.B. King will be in the air again on Sunday at the previously scheduled 35th annual B.B. King Homecoming Festival in Indianola.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "B.B.
