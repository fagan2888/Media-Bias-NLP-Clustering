Lafley, president and CEO, told analysts on Friday during its fourth quarter conference call.\n\n\n\nOver the next 12 to 24 months, P&G will \u201charvest, partner, discontinue or divest\u201d 90 to 100 brands, whose sales have been declining 3% per year over the past three years. Profits have been declining 16%.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe strategic narrowing and refocusing of the brand portfolio will have a number of significant benefits mutually reinforcing. Seventy to 80 brands will bring clarity, focus and prioritization and simplicity to a smaller, more integrated, better coordinated organization,\u201d Lafley said.\n\n\n\nAt least one industry observer viewed the moved as \u201ca long-term positive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile it seems like a sea change given P&G will only be left with 70 to 80 brands, these divested brands represent only 10% of sales and 5% of profits, and P&G had already indicated it would divest up to 10% of sales,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian in a research note. \u201cStill, we view this move as a positive, as it will result in simplification for P&G when completed over the next 12 to 24 months, and a higher growth/higher margin portfolio as the remaining brands have outgrown P&G\u2019s portfolio by 100 bps on the top-line and 100 bps in pre-tax margins over the last three years.\u201d\n\n\n\nMohsenian noted that P&G is divesting a broader portfolio of brands than expected and that, while other companies could buy some brands, most potential divested brands are small and declining, which could limit the interest.\n\n\n\nIn looking to Euromonitor\u2019s data, leading brands that will remain in P&G\u2019s portfolio, according to Mohsenian, include Tide, Gillette, Olay, Crest, Pantene and Pampers.\n\n\n\nAs Lafley told analysts, the remaining 70 to 80 core brands are leaders in their industry category or segment, with 23 of them bringing in sales of $1 billion to $10 billion, another 14 with sales of $0.5 billion to $1 billion, and the remaining 30 to 40 with strong brand equities in sales of $100 million to $500 million.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese brands are well positioned with consumers and customers and well-positioned competitively. These brands have strong equities in differentiated products and a track record of growth and value creation driven by product innovation and brand preference,\u201d said Lafley. \u201cThese brands are core strategic and have very real potential to grow and deliver meaningful value creation.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/08-2014/Business_Growth_Strategy_mainimage.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Antoinette Alexander", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/08-2014/Business_Growth_Strategy_mainimage.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "P&G to trim brand portfolio to focus on core brands"}, "twitter": {"description": "Procter & Gamble will trim its brand portfolio to focus on 70 to 80 of its largest and best performing brands.", "title": "P&G to trim brand portfolio to focus on core brands", "url": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/pg-trim-brand-portfolio-focus-70-80-core-brands", "image": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2014-08/Business_Growth_Strategy_mainimage.jpg", "site": "@drugstorenews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-04 01:01:00", "sailthru.title": "P&G to trim brand portfolio to focus on core brands", "google-site-verification": "qD-DLdnS9RBbjYJ-MITi4cSvUByohsoX4WClEJJuv7I", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2014-08/Business_Growth_Strategy_mainimage.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5cd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe strategic narrowing and refocusing of the brand portfolio will have a number of significant benefits mutually reinforcing.\nSeventy to 80 brands will bring clarity, focus and prioritization and simplicity to a smaller, more integrated, better coordinated organization,\u201d Lafley said.\nCINCINNATI \u2014 In a move to streamline and simplify Procter & Gamble\u2019s business and brand portfolio, the company will trim its brand portfolio to focus on 70 to 80 of its largest and best performing brands, A.G.
