A back to school bash for West Lauderdale students was held at West Lauderdale Elementary.

Sunday, parents had the opportunity to get to know the school and the teachers who will be teaching their children. School officials say this is a way for the kids to have fun and be excited for the new school year.

"It's a back to school bash this year because out PTO had a great idea to add some extra elements," Asst. Principal Lisa Shelly says.

"We just wanted to get the kids excited about coming back to school. We got a DJ and we have booths setup in the cafeteria for shopping, as well as bouncy houses, food and face painting. It's lots of fun for the kids," PTO Vice President Madeline Kennedy says.

The bash included music, face painting and bouncy houses. School for these youngsters starts back August 5th.
