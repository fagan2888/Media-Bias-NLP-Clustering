A 28-year-old Denver man has been charged with vehicular homicide and drunken driving in connection with the deaths on Tuesday of a man and a woman in a chain-reaction traffic accident.

Joshua Lee Calhoun turned himself in at Aurora police headquarters at 8 p.m. Friday.

Stephanie M. Windsor, 44, of Denver, and Michael L. Ingman, 58, of Edgewater, were killed in the three-vehicle crash on Tower Road and East 22nd Avenue at 1:55 a.m. Tuesday.

Windsor was driving a Ford Escort north on Tower Road near East Colfax Avenue while following her boyfriend’s car after leaving a bar.

Calhoun had also just left a bar and was driving a GMC Yukon at a “high rate of speed” going in the same direction and rear-ended the Escort, forcing it to spin off the road.

The GMC then careened into the southbound lanes and collided with Ingman’s Ford pickup, forcing the truck off the road as well.

Windsor and Ingman were both pronounced dead at the scene. Calhoun was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries.
