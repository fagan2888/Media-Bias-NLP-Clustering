MIAMI — Forward Danilo Gallinari was held out of the Nuggets’ starting lineup Friday against the Heat after injuring his foot the night before in Houston.

Interim coach Melvin Hunt said before the game that Gallinari would be available if needed, “but he’s banged up pretty good.”

With the 6-foot-10 forward hurt, 20-year-old rookie Jusuf Nurkic started at center against fellow 7-footer Hassan Whiteside and Kenneth Faried shifted over to power forward.

Gallinari, who had scored in double figures in 14 of his past 15 games, was just starting to look comfortable after returning from knee surgery Jan. 23.

Hunt said it’s not definite that Gallinari will rest for the second game of the remaining three back-to-backs, but “we’re just going to be cautious.”
