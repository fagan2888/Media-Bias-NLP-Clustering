In order to achieve that goal, however, she may have to defeat a slate of Democratic challengers who are even older than she is.\n\nThat sounds hard to believe, but it\u2019s true. In addition to Clinton, the 2016 Democratic field could include: California governor Jerry Brown, Vice President Joe Biden (the presumed frontrunner), and Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn such a scenario, Brown would be the oldest Democrat in the race; he\u2019ll be 78 in 2016. Biden will be 73. Sanders will be 75. Hillary, who will be 69 on Election Day, would be younger by comparison. If Elizabeth Warren decides to run, she would be the youngest Democrat, thought not by much. Warren will be 67 in 2016.\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are also very old. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will be 76 years old in 2016. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid will be 77.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/11/hilarious_hillary_could_be_the_youngest_democrat_seeking_nomination_in_2016.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-11/193466_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Hilarious: Hillary could be the youngest Democrat seeking nomination in 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bc3\"", "article_summary": "In such a scenario, Brown would be the oldest Democrat in the race; he\u2019ll be 78 in 2016.\nIn addition to Clinton, the 2016 Democratic field could include: California governor Jerry Brown, Vice President Joe Biden (the presumed frontrunner), and Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will be 76 years old in 2016.\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid will be 77.\nGrandmother Hillary Clinton, 67, is vying to become one of the oldest world leaders in history."}
