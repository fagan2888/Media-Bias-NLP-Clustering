GOP presidential candidate and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry says states should be coming up with their own health plans instead of being force-fed the Affordable Care Act."My point is, allow these states to come up with the programs and give people choice, don't force them. Let people pick and choose," Perry said Friday on Newsmax TV.

Asked on "The Steve Malzberg Show," whether Republican lawmakers should have put together an alternative to the Affordable Care Act if the Supreme Court rules health insurance subsidies in 34 states are illegal, Perry said:"Part of this goes back to a philosophical disagreement that all decisions need to be made in Washington, D.C. … We didn't expand Medicaid. I said we don’t want to be expanding a broken system. The president himself in 2009 said Medicaid is broken. I agreed with him then, I agree with him today, it's still broken. I don't know whether he thinks it's still broken but it is."The point is these states are where you have to either believe in the Tenth Amendment or you don't. I am a believer in the Tenth Amendment, the states, you block grant these states, they'll come up with a host of different ideas. What will work in Connecticut may not work in Oklahoma."Allow these governors, these legislators working with their healthcare professionals in those states to come up with the vast array. A lot of different choices. I mean, why should we force people to buy insurance? This ought to be an issue of access to healthcare."Perry said that in the case of Texas, where he acted as the 47th governor from 2000 to 2015, the Lone Star State expanded access to healthcare by passing massive tort reform."There's 35,000 more physicians licensed to practice medicine in Texas in 2013 than there was in 2003," he said.
