My spine is a mess, and my back hurts from time to time. I have tinnitus and some hearing loss in one ear. I was treated for breast cancer 16 years ago. I take a statin to lower a cholesterol level that defied conservative measures of diet and exercise. And I constantly have to practice remembering people\u2019s names.\n\nSo, at nearly 74, how healthy am I? Well,\n\nI also walk 3 miles and swim 3 /4 of a mile nearly every day. I have taken over most of the chores my late husband once did. I shovel and sweep my walk, cook most meals, and care for an active puppy who is walked four times a day and runs free in the park every morning.\n\nI have yet to retire and still work part-time writing a weekly column \u2014 although I have resisted the temptation to write another book, choosing instead to enjoy more theater, opera, concerts and grandchildren, and to train the puppy to be a therapy dog.\n\nAll of which invites the question of how one defines health.\n\nIn 1948, the World Health Organization described health as \u201ca stage of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d By that definition, I and millions of Americans like me across the age spectrum would flunk, leaving \u201cmost of us unhealthy most of the time,\u201d as Richard Smith noted in the BMJ blog in 2008.\n\nBut disease patterns have changed since 1948. Most people, like me, are aging with chronic ailments and disabilities, yet they continue to function independently. The old definition of health \u201cminimizes the role of the human capacity to cope autonomously with life\u2019s ever changing physical, emotional, and social challenges,\u201d wrote Machteld Huber and her colleagues in BMJ in 2011. And the definition fails to recognize that people are able to \u201cto function with fulfillment and a feeling of well-being\u201d even when they have a chronic disease or disability, they wrote.\n\nHuber and her colleagues went on to note that the ability to continue to participate in society might be more important than measured gains in health. The ability to cope with life\u2019s ailments might be a more important and realistic measure of health than complete recovery.\n\nWhich leads to a sober reassessment of all we do to find and treat health problems or head them off at the pass. The widespread belief that medicine today has the potential to prevent most health problems or detect them early enough for a cure has succeeded in \u201cmedicalizing\u201d modern life and raising the costs of medical care to unsustainable levels.\n\nIt has also prompted Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School, to write \u201cLess Medicine, More Health: 7 Assumptions That Drive Too Much Medical Care.\u201d\n\nWelch submits that too many people are being tested for too many things, being subjected to treatments they do not need and, in the process, being exposed to procedures that may do more harm than good.\n\nWelch suggests focusing on reducing big risks and ignoring those that are average or lower.\n\n\u201cMany health risks you hear about are exaggerated,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInterventions to reduce average risks can create as many problems as they solve.\u201d\n\nAnother assumption, that it is always better to fix a problem than to manage it, has fostered a different epidemic: the ballooning and stenting of every coronary vessel found to have a partial blockage in patients with stable angina. However, as a randomized clinical trial showed, patients treated with medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol were no more likely to suffer a heart attack or die than those who underwent an angioplasty.\n\nOnly when symptoms of cardiac pain persist is a more invasive procedure justified, Welch said.\n\nPerhaps Welch\u2019s most controversial \u201cassumption\u201d is that detecting a potential health problem early is better than waiting until it produces symptoms.\n\nThe value of screening people without symptoms is perhaps the most hotly debated issue in modern medicine. Should every woman over 40 have an annual mammogram? Should every man over 45 get an annual PSA test for prostate cancer?\n\nIt makes intuitive sense that early cancer detection and treatment are lifesaving. But what if the cancer would never have become a threat to life? To this day, I don\u2019t know if my cancer would have been deadly had I not had surgery and eight weeks of radiation. But once I knew it was there, I had little choice but to treat it.\n\nWelch submits that sometimes early diagnosis does little more than turn people into patients for more years.\n\n\u201cAction,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis not reliably the \u2018right\u2019 choice.\u201d The problem, of course, is knowing when it is safe to just monitor a disease and treat only if it progresses.\n\nSo, if not modern medical care, what really determines how healthy people are? The WHO now recognizes that the following factors can have as big an effect, or bigger, on our health as access to and use of health care services:\n\n\u25a0 Income, social status and education, the higher the healthier.\n\n\u25a0 Physical environment\u2014 safe water, clean air, wholesome workplaces, safe homes and well-designed communities.\n\n\u25a0 Social support networks, including family, friends and community.\n\n\u25a0 Genetics, which influences life span and the risk of developing certain diseases.\n\n\u25a0 Sex: men and women face different health risks at different ages.\n\n\u25a0 Personal behavior and coping skills, including smoking, drinking, eating, physical activity and dealing with stress.\n\n\u201cOne of the keys to health is not to obsess about it,\u201d Welch said. \u201cA lot of medical care doesn\u2019t help people. We need to be more cautious about being medicalized when we\u2019re well. We need to think about options and not necessarily jump to the most aggressive one, which can have the most side effects.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/hfbrody10.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "So, if not modern medical care, what really determines how healthy people are?\nIt makes intuitive sense that early cancer detection and treatment are lifesaving.\n\u201cA lot of medical care doesn\u2019t help people.\n\u25a0 Sex: men and women face different health risks at different ages.\nWhen asked on a medical form to evaluate my overall health, I invariably check \u201chealthy.\u201d But I sometimes wonder how accurate that is."}
