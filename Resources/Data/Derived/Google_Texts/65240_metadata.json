She was one of 12 women and one man who took the stage at Charleston Music Hall in a \u201cListen to Your Mother\u201d show last Sunday.\n\nMotherhood is messy. Motherhood is hard. And our relationships with our mothers are typically more complex than what\u2019s inside a Mother\u2019s Day card.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why \u201cListen to Your Mother\u201d has resonated with so many audiences across the country. Started in Madison, Wis., in 2010, \u201cListen to Your Mother\u201d features live readings of true stories \u201cabout mothering, being mothered and how that shapes us,\u201d as producer Angie Mizzel put it. This year, Charleston was one of 39 cities to host the show in the two weeks leading up to Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nEleven women and one man \u2014 all locals \u2014 read their stories out loud Sunday before a packed house of more than 300 people at the Charleston Music Hall for the city\u2019s second annual production of the show.\n\nThe stories they shared were less \u201cChicken Soup for the Soul\u201d and more David Foster Wallace meets Joan Didion. They\u2019re edgier, more thought-provoking and occasionally irreverent. \u201cI think that comes from the readers\u2019 vulnerability and honesty,\u201d Mizzell said, \u201cAnd maybe sharing aspects of motherhood that aren\u2019t always portrayed.\u201d\n\nLike addiction. Sickness. Suicide. The everyday, un-Hallmark struggles of being a mother. When the cast read their essays on stage, the audience laughed, cried and nodded along.\n\n\u201cThis way of telling stories reminds us that we\u2019re more alike than we\u2019re different,\u201d Mizzell said. \u201cStories bring people together, even in the way they didn\u2019t expect.\u201d\n\nHere are excerpts from six of them:\n\n\u2018The Cock-A-Roach\u2019\n\nBy Dede Kennedy\n\nShe started yelling my name frantically. Frantically is how we operate, my mother and I. Like my Uncle John Vitagliano says, \u201cWhether you wreck the car or can\u2019t find a pencil, the reaction is the same.\u201d Frantic.\n\nShe sounded like she was buying letters from Vanna White on \u201cWheel of Fortune.\u201d My body tensed and my anger grew as I tried not to scream at her to stop screaming. Because your screaming is going to wake up the kids and they\u2019ll start screaming and we\u2019ll all be screaming!\n\nYou see, my mama\u2019s mind is changing, becoming fuzzy and confused. Her emotions are erratic these days. One minute she\u2019s peaceful and singing, the next she\u2019s furious with me because she can\u2019t find her lipstick. Her body is giving out and she is in constant pain because of \u201cold people issues\u201d that I am way more familiar with than I should be. Her emotions and health are not my fault, but somehow I feel responsible. And since she and I are the last surviving members of our immediate family, I\u2019m the easiest one for her to blame. And she\u2019s the easiest one for me to blame too.\n\nI think it\u2019s just a case of the reality of life caring for an elderly parent. And not simply a parent but a mother! A mother and a daughter. With issues. Codependency Issues. Enmeshment issues. Mama adopted me when I was five months old. She loved me like I was born from her flesh, raised me. Never deserted me, even in the darkest depths of my alcoholism. She never let me go, even when I claimed she didn\u2019t love me and she wasn\u2019t my real mother. She never left me. I will never leave her.\n\nl l l\u2018Unconventional Mother\u2019\n\nBy Kris Harper and her daughter Betsy Harper\n\nKris: I have three children, boy-girl-boy. They are all great kids, but they are so different. You know, as a parent, you try to treat your children equally. But sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work out that way. They have different needs, and you want to be there for them whenever and however they need you. Sometimes one is just more needy than the others and you do what you have to do.\n\nBetsy: She forgot about me on the first day of kindergarten.\n\nKris: I didn\u2019t forget \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know what time to pick her up. There is a huge difference!\n\nBetsy: It\u2019s the first day of kindergarten. If there\u2019s a time to get the logistics right for your kids, this would be one of them. I started the first day of my formal education in a.m. kindergarten, p.m. kindergarten, my brother\u2019s third grade classroom and the principal\u2019s office.\n\nKris: I\u2019m sure I made a wonderful first impression on her teacher. But I didn\u2019t forget her. We had just moved to the area and I didn\u2019t know what time to pick her up.\n\nBetsy: She also forgot about me once in high school.\n\nKris: Yup, that time I did forget her.\n\n\u2018Perspective\u2019 By Kate Berrio\n\nI would like to know why I had to explain the words \u201csurgery\u201d and \u201ccancer\u201d to my kids. I would like to know why my husband still thinks I am being overly dramatic. I would like to know why the biopsy said \u201cnegative\u201d but the pathology came back with the word \u201ccarcinoma\u201d and I can\u2019t stop replaying that moment in my mind.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the \u201cwhys\u201d ...\n\nWhy are there women who lose babies before they have the chance to be born? And others who give birth, but then can\u2019t stay healthy enough themselves to keep the baby?\n\nWhy does my son experience the world as too bright and too loud? Such that we sent headphones to school for music time (he\u2019s that kid, crap) and I have to mix a bright blue pill into a dollop of ice cream each morning. Who would know to buy the right shirts that aren\u2019t too close to his neck for him if I died? Why am I, lately, thinking so much about the possibility of dying and what would happen to all of them? Would they be fine? Would he re-marry? Would she be a better mommy than me?\n\nHow is it that one in four children in South Carolina face hunger as a regular, daily struggle? Does that mean that five of the children I chaperoned on the kindergarten class trip are always hungry or scared to go home fearing an empty tummy?\n\nShould I start sending extra lunch boxes to school? What happens on the days we have delayed opening and there\u2019s no breakfast for them?\n\nIs it OK to sometimes prefer to sleep snuggled next to my babies rather than my husband? To feel like the sweet little boy breathing is the salve that my soul needs to wake up and be ready to do it all again tomorrow?\n\nWhen will I finally feel like I know what I\u2019m doing? That I\u2019m not fooling them all? That I am not some great imposter of a parent, friend, employee, woman, runner, writer?\n\nAre you still there, God? I know. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nBut it\u2019s a lot because being a Mom sometimes feels like skydiving with a parachute on your back that you\u2019re only pretty sure will open but you have to smile and say \u201cIt\u2019s okay! Of course it will open!\u201d to everyone who asks you.\n\nIt\u2019s a great balancing act and these past several months have slammed me in the face with waves of perspective. Brought me to the brink and back. But, always back.\n\n\u2018My Mother\u2019s Hands\u2019 By Amy Maciariello\n\nWe had been here on more than one occasion, and I knew how this night was going to go. So I did all that I knew how to do in that moment: I began to rub her back \u2014 back and forth \u2014 there in the quiet of the night.\n\nIn that moment, I saw it \u2014 the age! When did this happen?\n\nI mean, the stark contrast between the size of my seemingly gigantic hand and her petite and delicate frame. The fine wrinkles of my once youthful skin that were exaggerated by the shadows in the room. The thin skin as it moved about my hand seeming less and less attached these days. The various scars placed precariously about, showing the years of wear and tear. The battered fingernails long since forgotten by their owner. The trials. The years. The history. The kindness being transferred. The love pouring out.\n\nAnd in that moment, I really saw it \u2014 my mother\u2019s hands. I saw the many times she had done this for me and my brother and sister, the many times she comforted us through broken hearts, through upset stomachs, even through death.\n\nI saw them wrapped tight around my shoulders as I sat in the middle of an empty house falling apart over the end of my marriage.\n\nI saw them white knuckled in my sister\u2019s hand as the nurses worked desperately to bring life to our newest addition.\n\nI saw them as I imagined my mom, touching my brother\u2019s pale face for the very last time.\n\nAnd then I felt it. I felt the power of my mother and her mother and hers, coming through these hands, and felt the healing touch that only a mother can feel. I saw the joy, the love, the sorrow, the guilt, the hurt \u2014 I saw it all. And I saw beauty. And I saw strength.\n\nAnd I saw my hands. My own mothering hands.\n\n\u2018Letters To My Love\u2019 By Philicia Baugh\n\nDear Mr. South Carolina Driver\u2019s License Holder,\n\nKeep your eyes on the road. Never text and drive and always offer your mother a ride to church. As I gaze at you from this passenger seat, I say, \u201cJob well done.\u201d Not to you boy, to me! I taught you to stand up and pee, to tie your shoes and to divide by the number three. I taught you about the birds and the stingers on the bees in the parking lot of Baskin-Robbins over a game of brain freeze. We conquered those IEPs screaming, \u201cDyslexia ain\u2019t got nothing on me.\u201d Don\u2019t repeat that. The grammar is terrible. We got married, added two siblings, then divorced. I finished my master\u2019s degree, started my Ph.D. and found the women that couldn\u2019t exist at 15. We made life work because we worked hard at being a family \u2014 you and me. I had you before I had a driver\u2019s license. I had you before I had any dreams. I had you before I had me. While I raised you, you raised me. I am so thankful for you \u201cZiggy.\u201d\n\nDear Isaiah,\n\nI tell you I love you every day because so often we see tomorrow is not guaranteed. Recently, my mother told me I was the mother she always wanted to be. After I cried a little, my heart shifted to you. You help me make this single parenting thing look easy then secretly wipe my tears when we knew no one is looking. You\u2019ve always blossomed no matter where I planted you. I am the best me because I was blessed with the \u201cperfect you.\u201d As your 18th birthday draws near, I stand here to say: May you never go hungry. May you never be cold. I will always love you. I put that on my soul.\n\nl l l\u2018Your Love Was Enough\u2019By Reggie Davis\n\nWhen I was 22 and had not heard you say you loved me for many years, they told me you where found dead, probably from some of the bad choices you had made in your life.\n\nI felt a little uncomfortable at your funeral because I did not recognize you lying there, so I did not feel the need to cry, until I saw my uncle crying.\n\nYes, it took seeing your brother, the successful gangster of the family, who always reminded me how much you loved and cared for everyone in the family, to once again remember how much you told me you loved me, so I cried for you too.\n\nWhat I really want to say to you, Mom, is I have never doubted your love for me because I understand now.\n\nSee, some mothers are not intentionally bad moms. They are just too sick to be good moms.\n\nMom, I hope you are proud of me. Like you, I love helping people and I have worked as a paramedic for over 30 years, helping people during very difficult times in their own lives.\n\nI have been in recovery for 30 years, married to my best friend for 34 years. You would have loved her because she is the best mom in the world, at least in my opinion.\n\nWe have two beautiful adult children, who grow up in a drama-free home and never experienced my alcoholism because I found recovery before they were born.\n\nI have had the opportunity to help thousands of people break or suppress their own family curses by working through some of their own hurts, habits and hang-ups.\n\nYes, Mom, I\u2019m OK with the good and bad I inherited from you because I know you really did love me and I love you.\n\nSo for some of us, a mother love is all she\u2019s able to give, and love is enough.\n\nReach Deanna Pan at 937-5764.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Local writers share their stories on challenges, triumphs of motherhood, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values, Angie Mizzell,Charleston Music Hall,Listen to Your Mother,Mother's Day", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Motherhood is messy.
