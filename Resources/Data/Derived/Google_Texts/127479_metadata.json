Working age (20-64) population deaths attributed to alcohol from 2006-2010: \u2022 New Mexico, 16.4 percent \u2022 Alaska, 15.9 percent \u2022 Colorado, 14.2 percent \u2022 Arizona, 13.4 percent \u2022 Wyoming, 13.4 percent Deaths linked to alcohol per 100,000 people, age-adjusted, from 2006-2010: \u2022 New Mexico, 51.2 per 100,000 \u2022 Alaska, 41.1 per 100,000 \u2022 Montana, 37.7 per 100,000 \u2022 Wyoming, 37.5 per 100,000 \u2022 Arizona, 37.2 per 100,000\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona was tied for the fourth-highest rate of alcohol-related deaths among its working-age population from 2006 to 2010, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.\n\nThe June report said 13.4 percent of all deaths to working-age residents were attributable to alcohol for that period, up slightly from 13.1 percent during the five years prior.\n\nThe 2006-2010 rate for the state was well above the national average of 9.8 percent for the period, and tied with Wyoming for fourth-worst, behind only New Mexico, Alaska and Colorado.\n\nThe same CDC study said Arizona ranked fifth in the nation for the rate of alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people in the overall population, when the population is adjusted to parallel the nation\u2019s age. Only Alaska, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming had higher overall rates.\n\nThe study looked at 54 different alcohol-attributed causes of death, including everything from liver disease to falls and accidents to suicide.\n\nMandy Stahre, one of the co-authors of the report, cited several possible reasons that one state might perform worse than another, including poverty, alcohol-enforcement policies and religious views toward alcohol.\n\nStahre, an epidemiologist for the Washington State Department of Health, also said there is a \u201cregionality\u201d to the findings that includes the fact that many troubled states are largely rural.\n\n\u201cWhen dealing with a state like Arizona or New Mexico, you got some areas that are just very rural,\u201d Stahre said. \u201cAccess to care can be a huge issue.\u201d\n\nNot everyone has a trauma center or hospital nearby to go to after a vehicle crash or serious accident, she said.\n\nBut Deni Carise, who has worked in substance-abuse treatment for more than 25 years, said there are no easy answers to why alcohol-related deaths are a problem in Arizona.\n\nCarise is chief clinic advisor for Sierra Tucson, a treatment facility for addiction. She speculates that one possible reason for high numbers of alcohol-related deaths \u2013 in Arizona and in other states \u2013 is the fact that alcoholics and their families have no voice in their communities.\n\n\u201cWhen your family member is an addict or an alcoholic it\u2019s shameful to admit that,\u201d Carise said.\n\nAnd for people in recovery, she said, being open about their struggles with addiction can cost them their jobs, lessen their likelihood of even getting a job and affect their ability to get life insurance.\n\nWhile there is no one cause, Carise said, there are \u201ca hundred ways\u201d that alcoholism can affect a community: a drain on health-care resources, an overlap of alcohol addiction and homelessness, and children more likely to end up in foster care, among other effects.\n\nReducing the amount of alcohol-related deaths and getting help for people with substance-abuse problems is something everyone should care about, she said, because \u201cit affects them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we let people get into an addiction and continue an addiction in their alcoholism, the community loses that way,\u201d Carise said.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services is working to prevent alcoholism before it even starts, said the department\u2019s Cory Nelson, by focusing efforts on the state\u2019s youth.\n\nNelson, the deputy director at the Division of Behavioral Health Services, said the goal is to prevent risks that could lead to excessive drinking and alcohol-related deaths down the road.\n\n\u201cThe youth are one of our great targets because of the significant long-term impacts you can have,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWhereas you have a little less time to work with the adult population.\u201d\n\nHe said alcohol-attributable deaths could be reduced if they were addressed as a public health issue like other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nFor those ailments, he said, there is \u201canywhere between a 70 percent to an 85 percent treatment or screening rate.\u201d But when you look at substance-abuse disorders, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at about an 18 to 20 percent screening rate,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nDespite the problems now, Carise holds out hopes for the future.\n\n\u201cThere is more medication being developed, more types of treatments being delivered and more treatment programs opening,\u201d said Carise, who also thinks expanded services could come under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe new benefits will provide \u201cmore options for people that are still suffering,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/07/11-alcohol-store-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona was tied for the fourth-highest rate of alcohol-related deaths among its working-age population from 2006 to 2010, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
