During namaste, a person\u2019s head is slightly bowed and the hands are pressed together, palms touching, fingers pointed skyward and thumbs touching the chest.\n\nNamaste often is performed at the end of yoga practice.\n\nAsked about being the chief guest at Monday\u2019s celebration, Obama said: \u201cIt is a great honor. We are so grateful for the extraordinary hospitality.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s wife, Michelle, accompanied him to India.\n\n___\n\nIn between hours of meetings, Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi strolled through the neatly trimmed garden of Hyderabad House, the state guesthouse.\n\nThe two walked past ponds of lotus flowers before sitting down beneath a canopy for tea time. Modi poured.\n\nBoth sat with elbows on their knees, sipping from white cups. They appeared relaxed and smiled as they chatted and gestured.\n\nWhile Americans love their coffee, Obama seems to have similar feelings about tea.\n\nHe\u2019s often seen in public carrying the hot stuff in a paper travel cup embossed with the White House seal.\n\n___\n\nObama also paid his respects at the site where India\u2019s independence icon, Mahatma Gandhi, was cremated.\n\nHe walked in his socks, no shoes, to a walled courtyard at the Raj Ghat, and laid a large white wreath at the site. He also shoveled dirt and poured a pitcher of water around a sapling that was planted in his honor at the memorial, as has been done for U.S. presidents before him who have made the same visit.\n\nObama signed the guest book and quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his inscription.\n\n\u201cWhat Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said then remains true today \u2014 the spirit of Gandhi is very much alive in India today. And it remains a great gift to the world. May we always live in his spirit of love and peace \u2014 among all people and nations,\u201d Obama wrote.\n\n___\n\nA senior member of India\u2019s cabinet usually is on hand to greet visiting heads of state, such as Obama, when they arrive in India.\n\nThe foreign ministry had said that\u2019s how it would go when Obama and his wife, Michelle, arrived at Palam Air Base, and it appeared that Power Minister Piyush Goyal would have the honor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Obama\u2019s presidential \u2018namaste\u2019", "author": "Julie Pace and Muneeza Naqvi", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Obama\u2019s presidential \u2018namaste\u2019", "title": "WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Obama\u2019s presidential \u2018namaste\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/25/white_house_notebook_obamas_presidential_namaste/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/india-us-obama.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Obama\u2019s presidential \u2018namaste\u2019", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/india-us-obama.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "title": "WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Obama\u2019s presidential \u2018namaste\u2019", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Obama\u2019s presidential \u2018namaste\u2019", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddad7\"", "article_summary": "After arriving at Rashtrapati Bhawan, the presidential palace, for an elaborate welcome ceremony, Obama clasped his hands in the traditional \u201cnamaste\u201d greeting.\nHe\u2019s often seen in public carrying the hot stuff in a paper travel cup embossed with the White House seal.\nDuring namaste, a person\u2019s head is slightly bowed and the hands are pressed together, palms touching, fingers pointed skyward and thumbs touching the chest.\n\u201cWhat Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said then remains true today \u2014 the spirit of Gandhi is very much alive in India today.\n___In between hours of meetings, Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi strolled through the neatly trimmed garden of Hyderabad House, the state guesthouse."}
