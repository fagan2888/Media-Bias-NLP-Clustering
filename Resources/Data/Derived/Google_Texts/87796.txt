LOS ANGELES — The skies off the Hawaiian island of Kauai will be a stand-in for Mars as NASA prepares to launch a saucer-shaped vehicle in an experimental flight designed to land heavy loads on the red planet.

For decades, robotic landers and rovers have hitched a ride to Earth’s planetary neighbor using the same parachute design. But NASA needs a bigger and stronger parachute if it wants to send astronauts there.

Weather permitting, the space agency will conduct a test flight Tuesday high in Earth’s atmosphere that’s supposed to simulate the thin Martian air.

Cameras rigged aboard the vehicle will capture the action as it accelerates to four times the speed of sound and falls back to Earth. Viewers with an Internet connection can follow along live.

Engineers cautioned that they may not succeed on the first try.

“As long as I get data, I’ll be very happy,” said project manager Mark Adler of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Landing has always been “one of the big technology challenges for a human Mars mission,” American University space policy professor Howard McCurdy said in an e-mail.

With plans to land heavier spacecraft and eventually humans, NASA needed a heftier solution. So it designed a supersonic parachute that’s 110 feet in diameter — twice as big as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover in 2012. It’s so gigantic that it can’t fit into the wind tunnels that NASA typically uses to test parachutes.

NASA plans more test flights next year before deciding whether to use the new parachute on a future Mars mission.
