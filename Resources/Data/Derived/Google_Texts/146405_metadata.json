From liberals, she got death threats; from conservatives, she got props.\n\n@HollyRFisher ATTENTION LIBERALS: do NOT look at this picture. Your head will most likely explode. #HobbyLobby #UniteBlue http://t.co/uAIZji25vS | |\n\nFisher blew up on social media, and media outlets, including Fox News, courted her for interviews. Since then, she has launched Twitter rants about everything from Obamacare to same-sex marriage. On Thursday, she had a new whipping boy.\n\nWith fast-food strikes in more than 100 cities aimed at boosting the minimum wage to $15 an hour, people are lighting up Twitter with their opinions on the movement. Some think it\u2019s a well-deserved raise for working-class people, while others argue that if businesses have to pay their workers more, they\u2019ll simply increase their prices.\n\nBut Fisher, a military wife and mom, has taken an economic debate and turned it into a screed. The gist of her tweets: Fast-food workers don\u2019t deserve a wage increase. Fisher sent a blitz of tweets (@HollyRFisher) to her 50,000 followers during the protests\u2014with many of her remarks focusing on fast-food workers themselves, calling them whiny and lazy, and telling them just to work harder.\n\n@HollyRFisher It would be amazing if we could all pack Happy Meals for a living and still be rich, but this isn't Fairyland. #economics #StrikeFastFood | |\n\n@HollyRFisher Kinda looking forward to the day when I can order my quarter pounder w/cheese on a machine that doesn't roll its eyes at me. #StrikeFastFood | |\n\n@HollyRFisher Imagine a world where all the folks who cry for more entitlements put as much effort into trying harder as they do whining. #StrikeFastFood | |\n\n@HollyRFisher \"I don't want to try harder to better myself, I just want to cry until someone gives me more.\" - #StrikeFastFood participants everywhere | |\n\n@HollyRFisher Mcdonald's tastes best when all the workers are outside crying. #StrikeFastFood | |\n\nBut again, this isn\u2019t out of character for Fisher.\n\n@HollyRFisher Biggest complaint I'm getting about my #HobbyLobby pic is there's no gun, bible, or flag.
