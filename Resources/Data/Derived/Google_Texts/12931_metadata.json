John Kasich in the national spotlight, one Ohio University professor is more enthralled by the governor\u2019s unique Medicaid decisions central to the Buckeye State.\n\nDaniel Skinner, an assistant professor of health policy at OU\u2019s Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine at Dublin, contributed an article to the bi-monthly, national Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law that chronicles Kasich\u2019s embracement of Medicaid expansion in 2012 and his subsequent reform of it during its reauthorization this past year.\n\nThe piece is part of a series the publication runs called Reports from the States.\n\nColleen Grogan, a professor at the University of Chicago and editor of the journal, said the journal is not only focused on health policy but also investigating the subject\u2019s history and background which shaped its current form.\n\n\u201cThere are big political issues on the table and states are deciding on how to best (adapt) to them,\u201d Grogan said.\n\nSkinner said he wrote the piece to \u201ctell the tale of Medicaid expansion in Ohio\u201d and give national readers a perspective on the inner workings of the state.\n\nHe argues in the essay that Kasich finds himself in a limited cadre of Republican governors \u2014 along with Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan and, to a lesser extent, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana \u2014 who expanded Medicaid in their states despite their party\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as \u201cObamaCare.\u201d\n\nDespite Kasich\u2019s acceptance of federally granted monies through the Controlling Board, a committee outside of the legislature that could allocate funds, the Ohio governor would later reform the Medicaid expansion he originally initiated, placing him in an uncommon position that blurs party lines.\n\nAnd, because Ohio functions as a swing state and the political atmosphere isn\u2019t heavily skewed to one party, Kasich had more political freedom in his stances than governors in states that more closely adhere to party lines, Skinner\u2019s essay maintained.\n\n\u201cWhat I think makes Kasich a very interesting figure is that he appears to have carved out a space for him to say \u2018Look, I'm willing to take on my own party and do what I think is right,\u2019\u201d Skinner said, \u201cas well as having many positions that his party generally finds acceptable.\u201d\n\nHe said the expansion of Medicaid helped to insure 100 percent of residents below the federal poverty level along with 38 percent of residents that land just above it. Prior to the expansion, only the bottom 90 percent of individuals below the federal poverty level could qualify.\n\n\u201cWhen you start adjusting those numbers, what you're doing is moving people on and off Medicaid and access to healthcare,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cOver 50 percent of kids born in Ohio are born on Medicaid. So, it plays a hugely important role in child health.\u201d\n\nSince it is typically thought as a governor\u2019s job to bring in as much money to the state as possible, Kasich finds himself in a situation that a senator or congressman would not face, Skinner said.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a good reason to not take federal money,\u201d Grogan said. \u201cSo Republican governors have found themselves in a quandary.\u201d\n\nGrogan also said the ongoing state implementations of the Affordable Care Act, which includes Medicaid, is a subject often covered by the journal.\n\nSkinner also has a political and rhetorical background and has written about subjects such as reproductive health.\n\n\u201cI am extremely proud of the work being done by our Dublin faculty,\u201d Dr. William Burke, dean of HCOM\u2019s Dublin campus, said.\n\n@LukeFurmanOU\n\nlf491413@ohio.edu", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "medicaid,hcom,john kasich,daniel skinner,news,local", "og": {"site_name": "The Post", "description": "Dr. Daniel Skinner of HCOM\u2019s Dublin branch was recently published online in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law chronicling Governor John Kasich\u2019s expansion and reform of healthcare in Ohio.", "title": "OU HCOM Professor chronicles Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion and reform in national journal", "url": "http://www.thepostathens.com/news/ou-hcom-professor-chronicles-kasich-s-medicaid-expansion-and-reform/article_f44fec2c-7901-11e5-a536-1bf92e982f95.html", "image": {"width": 473, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thepostathens.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/1e/71e47c4c-7917-11e5-9d66-e3435f85eae0/5629768867984.image.jpg?resize=473%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thepost", "card": "summary"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "d1995ea7a6d9aa520d043d39c542df9d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1395412247351333}, "keywords": "medicaid,hcom,john kasich,daniel skinner,news,local", "description": "Dr. Daniel Skinner of HCOM\u2019s Dublin branch was recently published online in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law chronicling Governor John Kasich\u2019s expansion and reform of healthcare in Ohio."}, "article_summary": "John Kasich in the national spotlight, one Ohio University professor is more enthralled by the governor\u2019s unique Medicaid decisions central to the Buckeye State.\nSkinner said he wrote the piece to \u201ctell the tale of Medicaid expansion in Ohio\u201d and give national readers a perspective on the inner workings of the state.\nDaniel Skinner, an assistant professor of health policy at OU\u2019s Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine at Dublin, contributed an article to the bi-monthly, national Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law that chronicles Kasich\u2019s embracement of Medicaid expansion in 2012 and his subsequent reform of it during its reauthorization this past year.\n\u201cWhen you start adjusting those numbers, what you're doing is moving people on and off Medicaid and access to healthcare,\u201d Skinner said.\n\u201cThere are big political issues on the table and states are deciding on how to best (adapt) to them,\u201d Grogan said."}
