Prior to working at the White House, Fowler worked for Sen. Max Baucus (D-MO) as the Chief Health and Welfare Counsel for the Senate Finance Committee \u2013 the committee responsible for authoring Obamacare. After the bill was enacted, Baucus publicly thanked Fowler, stating, \u201cI wish to single out one person, and that one person is sitting next to me. Her name is Liz Fowler. Liz Fowler is my chief health counsel. Liz Fowler has put my health care team together\u2026 She put together the White Paper last November-2008-the 87-page document which became the basis, the foundation, the blueprint from which almost all health care measures in all bills on both sides of the aisle came.\u201d Gruber met a \u201cpowerful\u201d White House official involved in implementing Obamacare \u2014 Early the next morning and the day of the lecture, Gruber had a meeting, according to White House records, with Jeanne Lambrew. As Scott Gotlieb wrote in a Forbes March 2013 op-ed titled \u201cWho\u2019s In Charge Of Implementing Obamacare And Why It Matters,\u201d \u201cThe people drafting and reviewing the regulations are mostly centered in the White House and its Domestic Policy Council\u2013and they mostly work for Jeanne Lambrew.\u201d Of note, according to a Frontiers of Freedom article dated October 10, 2013, titled \u201cWhite House and IRS Exchanged Confidential Taxpayer Information,\u201d Lambrew, who is also involved in the IRS Tea Party targeting scandal, stated: \u201cIngram attempted to counsel the White House on a lawsuit from religious organizations opposing Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate. Email exchanges involving Ingram and White House officials\u2013including White House health policy advisor Ellen Montz and deputy assistant to the president for health policy Jeanne Lambrew\u2013contained confidential taxpayer information, according to Oversight.\u201d It should be noted that according to White House records, Gruber had not been in the White House in almost 6 months prior to these two meetings and did not come again for another 6 months. White House report highlights focus on establishing state exchanges \u2014 Later that morning, the White House released a report promoting the fact that \u201cUnder the health reform law, States have the first opportunity to set up and manage an Exchange, and States are taking action. Today, we released a new report which finds 28 States have taken important steps toward establishing their own Exchanges.\u201d The nine page report begins, \u201cIn the nearly two years since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, all States have taken some action to implement health reform.\u201d The report goes on to provide a positive progress report from ten states with quotes from each state\u2019s legislators expressing their commitment and the benefits to establishing an exchange in their state. Clearly, this was put out as a carrot by the White House to encourage states that had not acted as aggressively to create their own exchanges. On January 18th, Gruber provides the \u201cstick\u201d \u2014 Later that day, after Gruber\u2019s two White House meetings and after the White House\u2019s distribution of its encouraging state exchange status report, Gruber made his \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nThe timing of these events raises a key question: Is it a coincidence that the only times Gruber visited the White House in a year were the day before and the day of his \u201cmistake\u201d? Furthermore, this \u201coff-the-cuff\u201d statement, which a second video and several of Gruber\u2019s publications, revealed it was not simply an errant \u201ctypo\u201d that took place on the same day the White House released its encouraging state exchange status report.\n\nThis \u201ccoincidence,\u201d coupled with all the other evidence that has surfaced over the last two weeks is growing increasingly more problematic for the White House. More information is sure to emerge. This is another step towards Oblimination \u2013 the reversal of Obama\u2019s failed policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare Architect Met with Obamacare Author the Afternoon Before His 'Typo'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obamacare Architect Met with Obamacare Author the Afternoon Before His 'Typo'", "title": "Obamacare Architect Met with Obamacare Author the Afternoon Before His 'Typo' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Obamacare/jonathan-gruber-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/08/11/obamacare-architect-met-with-obamacare-author-the-afternoon-before-his-typo/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare Architect Met with Obamacare Author the Afternoon Before His 'Typo'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Obamacare/jonathan-gruber-ap.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Architect Met with Obamacare Author the Afternoon Before His 'Typo' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Senate, White House,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-08-11T14:29:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This \u201ccoincidence,\u201d coupled with all the other evidence that has surfaced over the last two weeks is growing increasingly more problematic for the White House.\nPrior to working at the White House, Fowler worked for Sen.
