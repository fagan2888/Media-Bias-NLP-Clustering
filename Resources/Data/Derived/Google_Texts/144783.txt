HUNTSVILLE, AL- Tax season is well under way. And, under the Affordable Care Act, tax filers can face a penalty if they don't have health insurance.

"The misconception in the community is if you don't file a tax return you won't owe," said CEO of TaxCorp Vern Gohanna.

The official numbers from the IRS- aren't in yet. But Gohanna says, according to surveys, last year a large number of people didn't file their taxes because of the affordable care act penalty.

"If you don't have insurance for the year 2015 the penalty is $325 per adult and $162.50 per child under the age of 18," explained Gohanna.

Gohanna says the penalty is small potatoes compared to the mess you will find yourself in for not filing your taxes.

"You'll have a 25% penalty tacked onto to your balance plus the interest rate which is currently 3 percent interest on any unpaid balances with the IRS," said Gohanna.

Earlier this week, Turbotax released information that shows nearly three in four people without health insurance were eligible for exemptions to the Affordable Care Act penalty. Gohanna says the best option is to contact a tax preparer who can walk you through the exemptions so you don't find yourself in trouble with the IRS.

"We will walk you through the marketplace, see what you qualify for, what it would cost. If there's an exemption we can print off the exemption, attach it to your federal form and when we file there will be no penalty," said Gohanna.
