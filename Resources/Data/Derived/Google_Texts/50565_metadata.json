A lobbying vacuum in D.C.?\n\nHistory has names for its different eras. In the lobbying world of Washington, it seems, there\u2019s Before Obamacare and After Obamacare. And now, with all the suspense gone from the fight over the Affordable Care Act, K Street is about to get a whole new power elite in the deep-pocketed world of Big Pharma and health care.\n\nSo much top talent has fled that, according to my POLITICO colleague Erin Mershon, the executive search firm Korn Ferry found itself in the very strange \u2014 and uncomfortable \u2014 position of doing simultaneous searches for CEOs of two bitterly battling lobbies: America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKorn Ferry vice chairman Nels Olson told The KGB File that there was no conflict of interest involved because the firm was careful to keep the two searches cordoned off from each other. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two completely separate teams executing these assignments,\u201d he says. Still, AHIP and PhARMA have taken opposite positions on drug pricing and coverage, and delivering better executive talent to one lobby or the other could give it the edge in future debates. Korn Ferry tries to stay out of such policy issues, Olson says.\n\nSome of the pressure was relieved Wednesday when it was announced that former Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner had been hired as AHIP\u2019s new CEO, replacing Karen Ignagni, who left to take over a big New York-based insurer. Even so the vacuum continues: Along with Ignagni\u2019s departure have come a slew of others, Mershon says, including top pharmaceutical lobbyist John Castellani; American Hospital Association CEO Rich Umbdenstock; and Ralph Neas, head of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the fight over Obamacare is done necessarily. But it does seem like the industry is hitting pause before a new generation of lobbyists deals with the 2016 election.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "K Street is about to get a whole new power elite.", "title": "A lobbying vacuum in D.C.?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/a-lobbying-vacuum-in-dc-120187.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/15/150715_kgb_marilyn_tavenner_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "KGB File,Obamacare,Karen Ignagni,K Street,Nels Olson,Lobbying,Affordable Care Act,Rich Umbdenstock,Ralp Neas,Health Care,Lobbyists,Marilyn Tavenner,Erin Mershon,Medicaid,medicare", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "K Street is about to get a whole new power elite.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd665\"", "article_summary": "A lobbying vacuum in D.C.?\nIn the lobbying world of Washington, it seems, there\u2019s Before Obamacare and After Obamacare.\nBut it does seem like the industry is hitting pause before a new generation of lobbyists deals with the 2016 election.\nFormer Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner had been hired as AHIP\u2019s new CEO.\nEven so the vacuum continues: Along with Ignagni\u2019s departure have come a slew of others, Mershon says, including top pharmaceutical lobbyist John Castellani; American Hospital Association CEO Rich Umbdenstock; and Ralph Neas, head of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association."}
