Mike Huckabee sounded off on the \u201cpolitical class\u201d as he hammered things like bailing out Wall Street banks at the same time people in Iowa are being \u201cpunished\u201d with big taxes and burdensome regulations.\n\n\u201cCritics say I\u2019m a \u2018populist,\u2019 but the truth is I\u2019m a nationalist,\u201d Mr. Huckabee wrote in a piece for the Des Moines Register. \u201cI put America and its workers first.\u201d\n\nMr. Huckabee, a potential 2016 GOP presidential contender who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses, goes on to write that Washington\u2019s failure to secure the border has flooded the country with illegal immigrants undercutting American workers and Washington\u2019s attempts to address rising health care and education costs have just made both more expensive.\n\n\u201cUnlike many in the Washington political class, I actually know a thing or two about poverty,\u201d Mr. Huckabee wrote. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican not because I grew up rich. I\u2019m a Republican because I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me.\u201d\n\nThe allusion to growing up without wealth echoes recent comments from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who said last month at a gathering of National Religious Broadcasters that \u201cunlike some out there, I didn\u2019t inherit fame or fortune from my family.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Walker said the line wasn\u2019t a slight at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the son and brother of two former U.S. presidents who could be a chief rival of both men in the race for the Republican nomination for president in 2016.\n\nMr. Huckabee went on to call for abolishing the IRS, securing the border, repealing Obamacare, and championing the country\u2019s \u201cfarmers, manufacturers, and energy producers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy giving a hand up rather than a handout, we can help each American earn their maximum wage, put our country on a path to balanced budgets and ensure greater prosperity for all,\u201d Mr. Huckabee wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a new opinion piece, former Arkansas Gov.
