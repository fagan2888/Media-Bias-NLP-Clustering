There is all this talk now about analytics, about digital health, health-care delivery. I have [portfolio company CEOs doing information-technology] who ask me, \u2018Should I be going to JP Morgan?,\u2019 and I say \u2018Yes, you have to be here.\u2019 A few years ago I might have said no.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s conference not only saw a fireside talk from Acting National Coordinator of Health I.T. Jacob Reider, but presentations from electronic health-record providers like Practice Fusion Inc. and athenahealth Inc.\n\nThe conference also featured a standing-room-only panel discussion with startup digital-health companies like medical-information network ShareCare Inc., \u201cdigital medicines\u201d company Proteus Digital Health Inc. and big-data analytics company Kyruus Inc., joined by health IT investors Qualcomm Ventures and Thrive Capital. It was the first year digital health had gotten such prominent billing at the conference. JP Morgan organizers declined to comment about trends in conference attendance in recent years.\n\nOne provision of federal health reforms ties hospitals\u2019 reimbursement for treatment more closely to patient outcomes than to the volume of patients treated.\n\nFeeling more scrutiny, health-care providers now have an immediate need for the types of software and big-data products that can help them track treatment efficacy and patient progress over large populations of people, Dr. Yeshwant said.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of products always made good sense,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there was no real financial incentive. Now there is. If you\u2019re not doing this, you\u2019re going to disappear.\u201d\n\nMore of a gradual change than an overnight transition, the \u201coutcome-based medicine\u201d provision of health-care reform has drawn a number of new players to the JP Morgan conference, including all of the country\u2019s top health insurance companies and a range of IT providers who want to do business with them and with hospitals, Dr. Yeshwant said.\n\n\u201cMany of these people come because they want to be near the conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are not changing abruptly, but these changes are very big. A lot of people feel the need to be near all of it.\u201d\n\nGoogle Ventures is backing a number of health information-technology companies, including genomic analysis company Foundation Medicine Inc., big data company DNANexus Inc. and consumer-genetics company 23andMe Inc.\n\nWrite to Timothy Hay at timothy.hay@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Attendance at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference is changing, along with the country's health-care delivery", "title": "Google Ventures Says JP Morgan Health Conference Changing With the Times", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/01/16/google-ventures-says-jp-morgan-health-conference-changing-with-the-times/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/media/Krishnayeshwant_D_20140115165942.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Google Ventures Says JP Morgan Health Conference Changing With the Times", "description": "Attendance at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference is changing, along with the country's health-care delivery", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Timothy Hay", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Venture Capital Dispatch Blog", "page.subsection": "Venture Capital Dispatch", "article.summary": "Attendance at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference is changing, along with the country's health-care delivery", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-01-16T21:39:07-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/01/16/google-ventures-says-jp-morgan-health-conference-changing-with-the-times/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-VCDB-13856", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Attendance at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference is changing, along with the country's health-care delivery", "title": "Google Ventures Says JP Morgan Health Conference Changing With the Times", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/01/16/google-ventures-says-jp-morgan-health-conference-changing-with-the-times/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Venture Capital Dispatch", "article.id": "BL-VCDB-13856", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-16T21:39:07-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb64\"", "article_summary": "There is all this talk now about analytics, about digital health, health-care delivery.\nJP Morgan organizers declined to comment about trends in conference attendance in recent years.\nIt was the first year digital health had gotten such prominent billing at the conference.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coming to this for five years,\u201d said Krishna Yeshwant, a general partner at Google Ventures, which backs a range of health- and health-information startups.\nGoogle Ventures Krishna YeshwantBut it\u2019s a different world today, one where new laws and new digital technologies are upending the way health care is delivered."}
