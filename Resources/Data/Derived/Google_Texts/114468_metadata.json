That\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been in the more than 70 years the government has been collecting these data.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about a change in the number of pregnancies, not in the decision of what to do about them, since there was no increase in abortions. The decline was spread across all racial and ethnic groups, all ages and across nearly all states. In fact, except for a small bump from 2005 to 2007, the teen birth rate has steadily fallen since the early 1990s.\n\nThe reason? Teens are using more contraceptives that are increasingly effective, experts say. They\u2019ve also been putting off sex until a bit later.\n\nThe original decline was triggered decades ago by the AIDS scare, which brought condoms out from behind drug store counters and greatly increased their use. In the past few years, it accelerated, as teens shifted to more reliable methods such as the pill or IUD. Condoms do help, but they\u2019re often used improperly, or not at all.\n\nThe teen birth rate in America is still far too high \u2014 three times higher than every other developed country. But these data show we\u2019re on the right track, and should keep pushing sex education in school and the use of contraceptives.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support parental fears that this somehow leads teens to have more sex \u2014 a scare tactic that surfaced once again when New York City decided to hand out emergency contraceptive pills in school, and the federal government refused to allow them to be sold over the counter to girls 16 and younger.\n\nThe wider use of birth control and delay in teen sex are occurring simultaneously. And showing great results.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Good news on teen births: Editorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Good news on teen births: Editorial\", \"link\": \"http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2013/09/decline_in_teen_births_shows_w.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_editorial_page/photo/teenjpg-10313bb38cb27796.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11237474\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-14T09:59:25Z\", \"author\": \"Star-Ledger Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"@njvoices\",\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "Contraceptives don't cause teenagers to have more sex.
