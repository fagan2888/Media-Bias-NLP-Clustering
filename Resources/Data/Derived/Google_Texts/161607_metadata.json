He has already anticipated the onslaught of last-minute rules by agency heads and White House policy officials desperate to bolster their legacies.\n\nThese rules, known as \u201cmidnight regulations,\u201d are typically submitted to OIRA in the waning days of an administration with hopes for a speedy review, and Shelanski is determined to have none of it.\n\n\u201cMy over-arching priority for this year, with a year left in the administration, is to make sure that we maintain an orderly regulatory process that makes sure that the highest priority rules go forward first,\u201d Shelanski told Bloomberg BNA on Jan. 21.\n\n\u201cSo that if this administration runs out of time, the rules that don't get done by this administration are those that are relatively lower priorities for the agencies, for the president and for the president's policy councils,\u201d Shelanski said. His agency is part of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nEarly Warning\n\nFederal agencies were warned in a Dec. 17, 2015, memorandum that they would not be permitted to rush significant regulations through in the waning days of the Obama administration (See previous story, 01/25/16).\n\n\u201cThere will not be a big package of surprise regulations at the end of this administration, if I have anything to say about it,\u201d Shelanski said.\n\nOIRA must review all significant regulations before they can be finalized, and the memo said it would not rush the process. All priority regulations must be completed and submitted no later than this summer if agencies want their regulations finalized before Obama leaves office.\n\nIf the rules are late and the review process runs into hurdles, because of interagency disputes or problems that OIRA discovers with the underlying rule, \u201cwe're not going to sweep those under the carpet in the interest of time,\u201d Shelanski said.\n\nExpecting Some Late Entries\n\nStill, Shelanski knows that some agencies will try to send in rules late. \u201cLook, it's human nature,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Cabinet secretaries are all passionate about the missions of their agencies, Shelanski said. And as they see their tenures coming to a close, they all want to achieve their missions, he said.\n\n\u201cAnd that is a natural thing and frankly, it's commendable\u2014these are the kinds of people we want in office, people who care about getting the job done,\u201d Shelanski said.\n\nOIRA wants the job done, but it is often a \u201cfilter\u201d or an enforcer of standards that can slow that process down\u2014to the benefit of the American public and transparency, Shelanski said.\n\nAnd in the end, OIRA has the full support of the White House for this, he said.\n\nWrapping Up Agenda\n\nAmit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, said the administration will be trying to wrap up its regulatory agenda this year.\n\nThere are some big-ticket items still left for it to do, including some rulemakings that date from the administration's first term, Narang said. These include Dodd-Frank financial regulations, rules implementing tobacco legislation from 2009, and pipeline safety rules, among others.\n\n\u201cNow, just to be clear, these regulations have been in the pipeline for a long time, and I hope that folks keep that in mind as we start hearing rhetoric about midnight regulations and Obama rushing rulemakings,\u201d he said.\n\nNo Model of Efficiency\n\nThe regulatory process is no model of efficiency, particularly for the most important rulemakings that benefit the public the most, Narang said.\n\nIt is not unusual now to see big-ticket rulemakings take an entire presidential term, Narang said. \u201cThe process is not built for speed,\u201d he said. There are a lot of procedural, analytical and legal requirements that agencies have to comply with.\n\nAnd in an era of reduced or stagnant funding, it is not surprising that agencies take a long time, perhaps longer than many in the public health and safety community would like, Narang said.\n\nBut it is not really the agency's fault, Narang said. Congress has layered on many analytical and procedural requirements for agencies and done nothing to streamline or reduce those requirements, he said.\n\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\nRegulation, Not Legislation\n\nSally Katzen, senior adviser at the Podesta Group and former administrator of OIRA in the Clinton administration, said that in the last year of this administration, there probably is not going to be a lot of legislation.\n\n\u201cTo the extent [Obama] wants a legacy, and every president does, it's going to have to come from his administration rather than from legislation, from the executive branch rather than from Congress,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd if past is precedent, there will be a significant effort this year on regulations, Katzen said. \u201cHaving said that, I would also say that the warnings of a tsunami [of regulations] are clearly overstated.\u201d\n\nMission: Mostly Accomplished\n\nActually, much of what Obama set out to achieve through regulation has been accomplished, Katzen said. The president's signature issue is health care, and the Department of Health and Human Services already has issued important implementing regulations, she said.\n\nWith respect to climate change\u2014another priority\u2014the air office at the Environmental Protection Agency has finished much of its work as well, Katzen said.\n\nOn the other hand, the Department of Labor is pressing hard on a number of regulations that it hopes to finish this year, Katzen said.\n\nAnother potential source of new regulation will be the Department of Transportation, she said. DOT regulators are working on, among other things, drones and driverless cars, which could be the stuff of a lasting legacy, Katzen said. And even if those don't go out the door as final rules this year, a lot of progress will be made on them that Obama's successor may find compelling, she said.\n\nTime Is Running Out\n\nBut time is running out, Katzen said, to do a lot of new things, let alone finish everything in the pipeline.\n\nTo cement priorities or strengthen accomplishments, a regulation should be completed by this spring\u2014otherwise it runs the risk of falling under the Congressional Review Act, she said. That law gives Congress 60 days to vote to nullify a new rule and could be used to invalidate last-minute regulations should Republicans win control of the White House and Congress in November.\n\nStill, agencies know that not all late-filed regulations will be set aside, even if a Republican succeeds Obama, Katzen said. In 2009, Democrats had control of the White House, the Senate and the House and yet they did not set aside any regulations from the administration of former President George W. Bush, Katzen said.\n\nRather, Congress was focused on the economic meltdown that was occurring in 2009 and trying to confirm Obama's executive appointees, she said.\n\nElection Year Challenge\n\nA second major challenge Shelanski faces this year is the political rhetoric coming from Republican presidential candidates and business-backed advocacy groups.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said this administration is on a \u201cregulatory tear\u201d and has put fighting regulations at the top of its list of priorities for 2016 (See previous story, 01/15/16).\n\n\u201cThat kind of rhetoric is just to be expected,\u201d Shelanski said. \u201cIt helps sometimes to come down to facts.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of rules that the federal government issues each year are minor, ministerial rules like Medicare payment schedules and hunting quotas under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, he said.\n\nThe rules that underlie a lot of the rhetoric end up boiling down to a small handful, Shelanski said. And it is far better to talk about specific rules and their costs and benefits than make blanket statements about a regulatory \u201ctsunami,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that this administration has done a lot of rulemaking, because there have simply been vast areas of urgent public need that Congress has not acted on,\u201d Shelanski said.\n\nCongressional Inaction Seen\n\nSo working within the law and the limits of the regulatory authority that executive branch agencies have, the president has tried to address a lot of public policy problems through regulation, Shelanski said.\n\nThe job of OIRA has been to ensure that those rules are as efficient as possible and consistent with the president's overriding objective of growing the economy and growing jobs, Shelanski said.\n\nThere's a bit of a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the rhetoric of job-killing, economy-stagnating regulations and a report showing 292,000 new jobs created in December 2015 and an unemployment rate holding at 5 percent, Shelanski said.\n\n\u201cWe have an economy that's crawled out of a terrible recession to steady growth, to job creation and to incredibly low levels of unemployment,\u201d Shelanski said. \u201cThat does not fit factually with the story that you hear from a lot of these groups,\u201d he said.\n\nNeglecting Benefits\n\nNo one denies that in specific circumstances, specific rules are going to hurt specific businesses and it's easy to go out and find a business here or there that is harmed by a rule, Shelanski said.\n\nTo the extent possible, it is OIRA's obligation to try to prevent those harms, Shelanski said. \u201cThere are costs to regulation and this president is seriously attuned to those costs and wants to avoid them,\u201d he said.\n\nRules are not designed for the sake of hurting anybody or imposing costs, but to achieve benefits, Shelanski said.\n\n\u201cAnd at least through the first six years of this administration, we have over $200 billion in net benefits identified from our regulatory programs,\u201d he said.\n\nChamber Raises Objections\n\nBill Kovacs, senior vice president of Environment, Technology and Regulatory Affairs at the Chamber, said the organization recognizes the need for smart regulations to ensure workplace safety and protect public health.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the government is not being honest about the benefits they are calculating,\u201d Kovacs said in an e-mail to Bloomberg BNA.\n\nMore than any other agency, EPA has been writing rules with \u201castronomical\u201d costs, and large supposed benefits, Kovacs said. But EPA is denying the public basic information about the real benefits of these regulations, he said.\n\nAlmost all of the benefits from these EPA rules come from purely incidental reductions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions, Kovacs said. He said 97.2 percent of benefits from rules finalized between 2000 and 2013 come from reduced PM2.5.\n\nHowever, PM2.5 levels in the U.S. are significantly below EPA and World Heath Organization standards, and EPA cannot demonstrate that further reductions will deliver real health benefits, Kovacs said.\n\n\u201cThe public deserves to know whether costly regulations that could mean real harm for local economies have real benefits,\u201d Kovacs said. \u201cThis is why we are pushing for more transparency in the rulemaking process,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nDaniel Perez, policy analyst at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, said the 2015 fall unified regulatory agenda listed 76 economically significant rules in the final stage (See previous story, 11/20/15).\n\nSo at a bare minimum, assuming there is no midnight spike, the administration has said there are 76 economically significant rules\u2014or rules with an economic impact of $100 million or more annually\u2014that are going out this year, Pe\u0301rez said.\n\nBy comparison, the Clinton administration's 1999 agenda listed 30 such rules, and the Bush administration's 2007 agenda listed 49 such rules, Pe\u0301rez said.\n\nNo Final Tally\n\nHistorically, what's listed in the agenda, at least looking at Bush and former President Bill Clinton, doesn't fully account for the finally tally, Perez said.\n\nWhere the Clinton administration listed 30 rules, that was only 41 percent of the total number that actually ended up being published, Pe\u0301rez said. The Bush administration estimated a little better, with its 49 listed rules ending up as 65 percent of the total for the year, he said.\n\nSo, it is reasonable to assume the Obama administration's list of 76 rules will be only a percentage of the final rules published this year, Pe\u0301rez said.\n\nQuicker Pace\n\nCompared to the previous two administrations, the Obama administration has issued more economically significant regulations: averaging 4.6 per month compared to 3.8 per month, Perez said.\n\nObama's biggest year for economically significant rules was 2010, with 74 regulations. That spike had to do with rules implementing the Affordable Care Act, he said. Forty-five regulations were issued in 2009 and 53 in 2011, Perez said.\n\nAnd, even though the ACA was enacted in 2010, it still requires more regulations, Pe\u0301rez said. \u201cSo you'll see ACA rules this year that need to be rolled out to keep cementing the act,\u201d he said.\n\nAgency's Focus\n\nThe benefits that OIRA brings to the American public are twofold: quality control and consistency in the regulatory process, Shelanski said.\n\nOIRA's job is to ensure that agencies have rules that are well-grounded in science and evidence, tailored to achieve their objectives and transparent to the American public about what they are based on, what they will achieve and what they will cost, Shelanski said.\n\nThat oversight is aimed at driving agencies to do higher-quality analysis, research and engagement with the public in the development of their rules, he said.\n\n\u201cDoes it sometimes mean that you can't do as many rules as you would like? Yes it does,\u201d Shelanski said. But, he said, the American public is better off because costs are reduced and benefits are maximized through that process.\n\nRecord Is Better\n\nThe review process also improves the record, so stakeholders who do wish to seek accountability in the courts have a well-developed record on which to do it, Shelanski said. And, he said, it helps agencies when they go to defend a rule a court, knowing that they have had to show a rigorous basis and record of evidence for their rule to OIRA.\n\nBecause of statutes that Congress has enacted over the decades, there are areas of overlapping jurisdiction and missions that can criss-cross, Shelanski said.\n\nSo, one agency's rules can have an effect on another agency's mission, Shelanski said. To ensure that rules do not lead to interagency tensions, or to contradictions and duplications with existing rules, an office is needed to coordinate interagency review of rules before they come out, he said.\n\nShelanski's parting thoughts on the year were this: The regulatory plan and agenda are public, people can see what OIRA is doing, and OIRA doesn't want surprises.\n\n\u201cAnd if there's one thing I want to make sure is that we continue that ethic of sound analysis and no surprises and transparency right through to the very last day,\u201d he said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Cheryl Bolen in Washington at cbolen@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Heather Rothman at hrothman@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/oira-wish-2016-n57982066769/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs\r\n(OIRA) Administrator Howard Shelanski has a deceptively simple wish for 2016: to maintain regular order and finalize the administration's top regulatory priorities under standard procedures.", "title": "OIRA Wish for 2016: An Orderly Regulatory Process"}, "csrf-token": "A5luB7xj1JxX6NeAtLaMNEgw4BHXPI-qrV99Xv0ebeBVUJef0OcGeU_Fsk99Wf0Pb2IBfquBWN3ZXT9MgniRPbIoYXndDp2H3J6YWy1xNPA1:ogt9XkWD1i_osYSMkZR_VUcxV_WFGvK24DkHcZ4DUchC0aXlIkIXBuojkw9Ivnf7WAisYUoh-b-iWD880YFnZB4ATukZOz3vSKodSbWLoXo1", "description": "Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs\r\n(OIRA) Administrator Howard Shelanski has a deceptively simple wish for 2016: to maintain regular order and finalize the administration's top regulatory priorities under standard procedures", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Agency's FocusThe benefits that OIRA brings to the American public are twofold: quality control and consistency in the regulatory process, Shelanski said.\nThese include Dodd-Frank financial regulations, rules implementing tobacco legislation from 2009, and pipeline safety rules, among others.\nNo Model of EfficiencyThe regulatory process is no model of efficiency, particularly for the most important rulemakings that benefit the public the most, Narang said.\nThe Cabinet secretaries are all passionate about the missions of their agencies, Shelanski said.\nBy comparison, the Clinton administration's 1999 agenda listed 30 such rules, and the Bush administration's 2007 agenda listed 49 such rules, Pe\u0301rez said."}
