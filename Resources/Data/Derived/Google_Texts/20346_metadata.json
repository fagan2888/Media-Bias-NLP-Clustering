All mighty.\n\nGranted, the four-game sample size is small, but the Avs (9-13-1) are in position to build on any positives they can find.\n\n\u201cWe played only four games but when you\u2019re playing well against a teams in our division, this is something I\u2019m very happy about,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cWe need to continue to do that.\u201d\n\nFourth-line center Chris Wagner scored the eventual game-winning goal early in the third period to give Colorado \u2014 which led 3-0 before the game was 26 minutes old \u2014 a 4-2 lead. It was Wagner\u2019s second goal in as many games; he has played six with the Avs since being claimed off waivers from Anaheim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming along, for sure,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nThe Jets made it interesting late, getting a Jacob Trouba goal at 10:54 of the third period to come within 4-3. The puck slipped past goaltender Semyon Varlamov after it hit Avs forward Cody McLeod and changed direction.\n\nBut right wing Matt Duchene iced it with an empty-net goal during the final minute. Duchene had two assists for a three-point night. He has 16 points in his last nine games.\n\n\u201cI like what I\u2019m seeing. I like the resilence of our guys, the compete level tonight,\u201d Roy said.\n\nWinnipeg, which lost at home to Colorado 4-1 last Monday, was playing its third game in four days. The Avs improved to 3-6-1 at home. They became the NHL\u2019s last team to win three games at home.\n\nBlake Comeau, Gabe Landeskog and Carl Soderberg accounted for Colorado\u2019s first three goals.\n\nThe Jets (11-12-2) received a fortunate bounce to get within 3-1. Trouba\u2019s shot from the point caromed off teammate Andrew Ladd and behind Varlamov at 9:05 of the second period. Less than two minutes later, the Avs looked to re-establish their three-goal lead on their first power play, but an offensive passing sequence on the half wall between defenseman Nick Holden and forward Mikhail Grigorenko went bad and the turnover led to Blake Wheeler\u2019s short-handed goal off a 2-on-2 rush.\n\nColorado took its 3-0 lead at 5:55 of the second period. Duchene\u2019s slick area pass from the Jets\u2019 blue line sprang Soderberg for a breakaway, and Soderberg made a nice goal-mouth move for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nIt was 2-0 after the first period. Comeau\u2019s caused turnover and unassisted breakaway goal opened the scoring, and Lan- deskog doubled the lead by burying a Duchene rebound from the low slot.\n\nThe Avs depart Sunday for their road trip that begins Monday in New York against the Islanders.\n\nColorado is 6-7 on the road this season.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or Twitter: @MikeChambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Center Chris Wagner\u2019s third-period goal propels Avs to 5-3 win", "title": "Center Chris Wagner\u2019s third-period goal propels Avs to 5-3 win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/center-chris-wagners-third-period-goal-propels-avs-to-5-3-win/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128__Colorado-Avalanchep1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128__Colorado-Avalanchep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T22:40:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:22:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Trouba\u2019s shot from the point caromed off teammate Andrew Ladd and behind Varlamov at 9:05 of the second period.\nIt was Wagner\u2019s second goal in as many games; he has played six with the Avs since being claimed off waivers from Anaheim.\nColorado took its 3-0 lead at 5:55 of the second period.\nThe Jets made it interesting late, getting a Jacob Trouba goal at 10:54 of the third period to come within 4-3.\nGranted, the four-game sample size is small, but the Avs (9-13-1) are in position to build on any positives they can find."}
