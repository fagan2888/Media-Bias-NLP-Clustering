Wagoner County does have a sales tax that helps to pay for fire service, but it can't be used to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Vehicles, the stations, the equipment the guys wear, their training, it pays for our insurance, our fuel,\" Disler said. \"We can't use any part of it for salary or benefits.\"\n\nThe treasury department has now announced what volunteer fire departments have hoped to hear.\n\n\"I'm pretty relieved,\" Disler said.\n\nThose departments and ambulance companies will be exempt from the health care coverage mandate.\n\n\"If they didn't change it, we were going to start pulling up tent stakes probably about October,\" Disler said.\n\nOne of the reasons the Treasury Department's ruling is such a huge relief, is because more than 70 percent of fire departments across the country are volunteer departments.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "There is now a solution to an unintended consequence of President Obama's employer health care mandate that would have forced most volunteer fire departments to close their doors.", "author": "Craig Day", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24450059/rural-oklahoma-fire-departments-no-longer-hurt-by-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24450059_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "There is now a solution to an unintended consequence of President Obama's employer health care mandate that would have forced most volunteer fire departments to close their doors.", "title": "Rural Oklahoma Fire Departments No Longer Threatened By Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24450059_SA.jpg", "description": "There is now a solution to an unintended consequence of President Obama's employer health care mandate that would have forced most volunteer fire departments to close their doors.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rural Oklahoma Fire Departments No Longer Threatened By Affordable Care Act"}, "wnreadableurl": "rural-oklahoma-fire-departments-no-longer-hurt-by-affordable-care-act", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/01/14", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a44\"", "article_summary": "\"It would have closed down I'm sure most of the volunteer departments across the country,\" Disler said.\nOne of the reasons the Treasury Department's ruling is such a huge relief, is because more than 70 percent of fire departments across the country are volunteer departments.\nSince the Affordable Care Act went into effect, rural fire chiefs nationwide have been worried.\nWagoner County does have a sales tax that helps to pay for fire service, but it can't be used to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\nThose departments and ambulance companies will be exempt from the health care coverage mandate."}
