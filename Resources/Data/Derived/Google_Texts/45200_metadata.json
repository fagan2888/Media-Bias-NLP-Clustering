Despite the nearly year-long closures, the owners of both companies plan to reopen the mental health agencies.\n\nThe Maine Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Division of Audit was notified in September 2013 that the Office of the Inspector General in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was investigating a credible allegation of fraud against the two companies. The department suspended the payments the companies had billed MaineCare, Maine\u2019s version of Medicaid, as required by the federal Affordable Care Act, according to Maine DHHS spokesman John Martins.\n\nThe investigations into the two companies were separate, Martins said, but they appear to have been connected because the owner of AngleZ was previously a co-owner of Umbrella.\n\nFollowing an email on July 2 from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Maine, the department restored $59,462.12 in payments to AngleZ and $42,905.56 in payments to Umbrella for services billed in August and September of 2013, according to Martins.\n\nThe email, which Martins provided to the Kennebec Journal, said the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office was declining to \u201cpursue a federal affirmative civil enforcement action against AngleZ and Umbrella because, when comparing the available remedies and the likelihood of success and recovery, it appears that the matter is best pursued by the state of Maine.\u201d\n\nMartins said in an email Wednesday that he couldn\u2019t comment on what action the state may or may not take. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office began an investigation into Umbrella, which had offices in Augusta, Damariscotta and Wiscasset, in early 2013 for allegations of billing for inappropriate services, billing for services not provided and billing for services that were not documented or sufficiently documented, according to the hearing record for AngleZ\u2019s appeal. Then in June 2013, the inspector general\u2019s office began its investigation into AngleZ, according to the hearing record.\n\nThe owner of AngleZ, Annalee Morris, co-owned Umbrella with Marjorie Averill before leaving in 2012 to start AngleZ, which had offices in Augusta and Winthrop.\n\nAn attorney for AngleZ brought the issue to Kennebec County Superior Court in June, appealing the department\u2019s final ruling that confirmed its decision to suspend the payment. The attorney, Jay McCloskey of McCloskey, Mina & Cunniff, LLC in Portland, filed a motion Aug. 8 to withdraw the appeal.\n\nMcCloskey, speaking by phone for his client, said there was no evidence of fraud and the state shouldn\u2019t have suspended the payments, effectively putting the company out of business. He said he doesn\u2019t fault the agency for investigating the allegations, but he doesn\u2019t think anyone wanted the case to go in front of a judge.\n\n\u201cWhatever caused the investigation, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. The idea is you\u2019ve got to do the work to determine if there\u2019s any truth to the allegations, especially if you\u2019re putting someone out of business,\u201d McCloskey said.\n\nHe said the state has been working with Morris to help her reopen her business.\n\nAverill also denied the fraud allegations against her company, Umbrella Mental Health Services.\n\n\u201cThey have to do what they have to do, but it was not something that was ultimately investigated or substantiated before they shut the office down,\u201d Averill said of the state\u2019s actions. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make an allegation. It\u2019s another thing to take out a whole company.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s applied for a license with the state to open a new company, the Umbrella Agency, in Damariscotta, and she\u2019s happy the investigation is over.\n\n\u201cI just really still want to focus on moving forward,\u201d Averill said.\n\nPaul Koenig \u2014 621-5663\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @paul_koenig", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state restored MaineCare payments to Augusta-area Umbrella Mental Health and AngleZ Behavioral Health in July, a year after suspending payments.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The state restored MaineCare payments to Augusta-area Umbrella Mental Health and AngleZ Behavioral Health in July, a year after suspending payments.", "title": "MaineCare payments restored to mental health agencies accused of fraud - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cm-icon-blackForSharing.png", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/09/01/mainecare-payments-restored-to-mental-health-agencies-accused-of-fraud/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cm-icon-blackForSharing.png", "description": "The state restored MaineCare payments to Augusta-area Umbrella Mental Health and AngleZ Behavioral Health in July, a year after suspending payments.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "MaineCare payments restored to mental health agencies accused of fraud - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Healthcare", "published_time": "2014-09-01T18:08:22-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce72\"", "article_summary": "Averill also denied the fraud allegations against her company, Umbrella Mental Health Services.\nDespite the nearly year-long closures, the owners of both companies plan to reopen the mental health agencies.\nTwo central Maine mental health agencies that saw their MaineCare payments suspended by the state a year ago for allegations of fraudulent billing had the payments restored in July after federal investigators declined to pursue further action.\nThe payment suspensions forced the two companies, Umbrella Mental Health Services and AngleZ Behavioral Health Services, to shutter, leaving around 500 clients in the Kennebec and Lincoln counties region without MaineCare-funded services and more than 100 people without jobs.\nThe department suspended the payments the companies had billed MaineCare, Maine\u2019s version of Medicaid, as required by the federal Affordable Care Act, according to Maine DHHS spokesman John Martins."}
