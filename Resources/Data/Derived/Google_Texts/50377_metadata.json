Unfortunately, her father, Tim Warren, a former Memphis police officer, was killed in the line of duty in July of 2011.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, Tim Warren, one of Memphis\u2019 finest police officers fell in the line of duty responding to a domestic incident at a downtown Memphis hotel,\u201d the Memphis Police Department posted to their Facebook and website of the incident that cost Officer Warren his life. \u201cWarren\u2019s life was taken while he was attempting to keep our city and the citizens of Memphis safe. His family and fellow officers will never forget his ultimate sacrifice.\u201d\n\nFour years after his murder, Officer Warren\u2019s widow was dejected when her daughter received the dance invitation. She decided to contact her friends about the situation.\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s widow reached out to Taylor Amen, a MPD officer\u2019s wife, and Donna Kirk, a widow of a Memphis firefighter and the founder of Our Fallen Heroes Foundation and explained the circumstance,\u201d Memphis P.D. also wrote on Facebook.\n\nSix officers from Memphis P.D. then volunteered their time to escort young Jewel to the dance.\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s daughter was treated to a trip to [the salon and spa for children] Sweet and Sassy, she received long stem roses from each officer, and was even able to catch a ride in a classic 1972 Cutlass Supreme,\u201d Memphis P.D. wrote.\n\nSeveral members of the community also donated boutonnieres for the officers and additional floral arrangements to make the night especially memorable for Jewel. Local photographer Amanda Swain volunteered to capture the night\u2019s events on film.\n\n\u201cThat night was truly an honor for all those involved. I had to hold back my own tears,\u201d Swain said via email. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the pain the Warren family still endures. But Jewel\u2019s smile that night for just a moment made all well within our high crime city. The officers were just as thrilled to be there as Jewel. It will go down as a night to remember forever.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On September 4th, a group of six police officers in Memphis, Tennessee responded to a different kind of call for help.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On September 4th, a group of six police officers in Memphis, Tennessee responded to a different kind of call for help.", "title": "Fallen Cop's Colleagues Step in to Take Daughter to Dance", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10623793_889460397800987_5192104326384810723_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T21:43:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1inQmEx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On September 4th, a group of six police officers in Memphis, Tennessee responded to a different kind of call for help.", "title": "Fallen Cop's Colleagues Step in to Take Daughter to Dance", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/10623793_889460397800987_5192104326384810723_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage & Family", "published_time": "2015-09-18T15:50:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T21:43:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd61f\"", "article_summary": "His family and fellow officers will never forget his ultimate sacrifice.\u201dFour years after his murder, Officer Warren\u2019s widow was dejected when her daughter received the dance invitation.\nJewel Warren, an eight-year-old native of Memphis, was invited to a \u201cFather-Daughter\u201d dance at school.\nSix officers from Memphis P.D.\nUnfortunately, her father, Tim Warren, a former Memphis police officer, was killed in the line of duty in July of 2011.\nOn September 4, a group of six police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, responded to a different kind of call for help."}
