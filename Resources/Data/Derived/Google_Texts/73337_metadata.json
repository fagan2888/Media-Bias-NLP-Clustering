Cydni Scruggs, formerly of Plano, Texas, is suing the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain and the company\u2019s cherry supplier due to a heart attack she suffered as a result of biting into a cherry that had not been \u201cproperly de-pitted.\u201d\n\nScruggs, now a resident of Parker, Colo., is seeking damages between $200,000 and $1 million after biting into a maraschino cherry that caused her to fracture two teeth below the gum line. Sometime after her run in with the cherry pit, Scruggs developed a gum infection and sepsis that led to her eventual heart attack. In addition to Chick-fil-A, a lawsuit filed in Dallas County's 44th State District Court on Dec. 1 also named Dell\u2019s Maraschino Cherries Co. Inc. in New York as a defendant.\n\n\"Defendant Dell's Maraschino Cherries, as a producer, supplier, and distributor of maraschino cherries to restaurants or food establishments throughout the United States, including Texas, failed to use that degree of care that would be used by a marschino cherry de-pitting owner or company of ordinary prudence under the same or similar circumstances,\" the petition states.\n\nAlthough Scruggs\u2019s claim that trouble with her tooth led to a heart attack may seem outlandish, there is truth to it. Evidence has shown that poor dental hygiene can lead to heart complications by allowing bacteria into our bloodstream. As bacteria from the mouth makes its way through our body, it eventually reaches our heart valves where it can cause an infection. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, people with periodontal disease have an increased risk for heart disease.\n\nThe relationship between sepsis and a heart attack is well-defined by the American Heart Association. Sepsis, the body\u2019s inflammatory response to an infection that can be life-threatening by itself, can hinder blood flow to vital organs, including the brain, kidneys, and heart. When organs do not receive proper blood flow, they fail and go into what\u2019s known as septic shock.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chick, fil, a, milkshake, heart, attack", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Colorado woman is suing Chick-fil-A over claims that one of the restaurant chain's milkshakes caused her to suffer a heart attack.", "title": "Lawsuit: Chik-Fil-A Milkshake May Have Caused Woman's Heart Attack", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chik-fil-milkshake-leads-heart-attack-woman-sues-restaurant-chain-and-supplier-over-313414", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/chick-fil.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Colorado woman is suing Chick-fil-A over claims that one of the restaurant chain's milkshakes caused her to suffer a heart attack.", "title": "Lawsuit: Chik-Fil-A Milkshake May Have Caused Woman's Heart Attack", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chik-fil-milkshake-leads-heart-attack-woman-sues-restaurant-chain-and-supplier-over-313414", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/chick-fil.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/chick-fil.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-08T12:02:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T12:02:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Colorado woman is suing Chick-fil-A over claims that one of the restaurant chain's milkshakes caused her to suffer a heart attack."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf39f\"", "article_summary": "Although Scruggs\u2019s claim that trouble with her tooth led to a heart attack may seem outlandish, there is truth to it.\nThe relationship between sepsis and a heart attack is well-defined by the American Heart Association.\nSometime after her run in with the cherry pit, Scruggs developed a gum infection and sepsis that led to her eventual heart attack.\nIn addition to Chick-fil-A, a lawsuit filed in Dallas County's 44th State District Court on Dec. 1 also named Dell\u2019s Maraschino Cherries Co.
