Tyco Picks Up Retail Data Provider ShopperTrak, Following Footfall Deal

The target boasts clients such as Crate and Barrel and Harry & David

Security company Tyco International plc (NYSE: TYC) is purchasing privately-held retail data tracker company ShopperTrak for $175 million in cash.

The target, headquartered in Chicago, provides data that measures customer traffic as well as other consumer behavior for more than 1,200 retailers, including Crate and Barrel and Harry & David. ShopperTrak has about $75 million in annual revenue.

“The ShopperTrak acquisition will enable us to help retailers effectively improve the shopper’s experience, thus enhancing their revenues and profitability,” says Tyco vice president Girish Rishi. ShopperTrak follows up Tyco’s recent purchase of Footfall, a retail analytics and consulting firm. Both deals come as retail sales and consumer spending are showing signs of increasing, according to the Commerce Department.

In another recent similar deal, private equity firm Summit Partners is investing in retail software company Mi9 Retail. Mi9 provides software that measures data, such as shopping behavior, inventory management and sales per product.
