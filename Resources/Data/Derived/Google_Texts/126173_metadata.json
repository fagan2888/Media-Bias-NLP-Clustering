Nonprofits\u2019 Dismay, Attorney General Weighs in on Obamacare\n\nOct. 1 Enrollment Launch Is This Week\n\n\n\nWednesday, September 25, 2013 By Porter Barron Jr. Wednesday, September 25, 2013\n\nLast week, S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson joined 12 of his fellow Republican state attorneys general on Capitol Hill to warn Congress about what they say are insufficient privacy and security safeguards in the enrollment process of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.Meanwhile, in Columbia, several nonprofit community groups with grant support from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have been racing to prepare to assist the public in that enrollment process, which is scheduled to begin nationwide on Oct. 1.With less time and resources than any of the grant recipients would have preferred, they are harried and anxious, as they, like most Americans, do not know exactly what to expect on Oct. 1.One of the most crucial services these groups will provide is helping consumers learn whether they qualify for health care subsidies, based on their income levels.So it was with dismay that they heard of Wilson\u2019s Sept. 18 testimony on Capitol Hill and subsequent Twitter posts, in which he derided Obamacare and, in particular, the volunteers and staff who are preparing to assist consumers with enrollment. Under the new health care law, they are known as navigators, assisters or certified application counselors \u2014 three classifications with minor differences among them.\u201cWhile groups like the Girl Scouts require employees to complete background checks, there are no such requirements for Navigators,\u201d Wilson told Congress.Then he took to Twitter: \u201c#Navigators will handle your personal data without a background check, screening, or proper training.\u201dShortly thereafter, he followed with, \u201cIt is more difficult to help the Girl Scouts sell boxes of cookies than it is to be a HHS #Navigator.\u201dThen: \u201cIt only takes 20 hours of training to be a #Navigator. Most states require over 40 hours of training for a driver\u2019s license.\u201dWanda Pearson of Columbia\u2019s Cooperative Ministries took exception to those statements: \u201cOur navigator program will not operate that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe requirement is that everyone we hire as a navigator will have a satisfactory background screening. That will mean no criminal convictions in South Carolina or anywhere else that we can detect, no history of any type of moral turpitude; and they don\u2019t handle personal information.\u201dHowever, Wilson has a point: It\u2019s not clear whether the new law mandates background checks for navigators. The Department of Health and Human Services has not responded to Free Times\u2019 questions about such a provision.Still, local navigators say they will protect consumers.Pearson says that navigators will provide consumers with personal computing devices with which to enter their own information, and that navigators who attempt to access that information should be reported. Federal law mandates that anyone found guilty of abusing personal information used in the enrollment process will face fines up $25,000.As for training, Pearson says, \u201cThe navigator training is really up to the individual. The projection was that it would take the average person 20 hours to complete it. It could take you less; it could take you longer. As far as the comparison to the driver\u2019s license, I don\u2019t know how valid that is. It\u2019s a whole different skill set.\u201dYork Glover of Eau Claire Cooperative Health Center, which received a federal grant to train certified application counselors, sees Wilson\u2019s comments as part of a Republican effort to hamstring Obamacare at every turn for political purposes.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to deter people from enrolling, period,\u201d he says.\u201cIt could be an uneasy process, but if you had to do it by yourself, you\u2019d have a lot of people who would be less inclined to do it,\u201d Glover says. \u201cSo if I can set up a system to help someone through the process, then I assure a better success rate, but if you make those folks seem unsafe, then you have a whole lot of people who won\u2019t get enrolled and you can then say, \u2018See, this was a big waste of time.\u2019\u201dIndeed, Obamacare opponents have stymied navigator programs in multiple GOP-controlled states. At least four nonprofits have returned their federal grants, saying that state-level restrictions prevented them from fulfilling the grants\u2019 requirements, according to a report by USA Today.Asked to explain the disconnect between his Capitol Hill testimony and Twitter posts and the work that nonprofits are doing in South Carolina, Wilson\u2019s office replied: \u201cAttorney General Wilson\u2019s testimony did not criticize individual Navigator grant recipients. It addressed the existing law, not specific organizations and entities, by highlighting security risks associated with federal regulations that don\u2019t require background checks and invite identify theft scams.\u201dIn related statements, Wilson described the data hub \u2014 through which consumers\u2019 personal information will pass for verification purposes \u2014 as \u201ca con-man\u2019s all-you-can-eat buffet overflowing with a gold mine of sensitive information.\u201dAsked how the attorney general had reached such a frightful conclusion, his office replied, \u201cA rapid response mechanism to respond to data breaches is no substitute for the Administration\u2019s refusal to impose appropriate security safeguards at the outset. Remember Benjamin Franklin\u2019s advice: An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure.\u201dFor their part, the feds say they are implementing tested cyber-security measures that have been used successfully in administering other federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid, government grants and mortgages. They say they are focusing on front-end and back-end security and are \u201cready to take action against any entity that engages in fraudulent activities.\u201dDespite dismissing Wilson\u2019s stated concerns as propaganda, the local nonprofit workers say that they have serious concerns about what is coming on Oct. 1.\u201cOur biggest concern is that people will not be able to distinguish the legitimate navigators from the ones who are just purporting to be navigators,\u201d Cooperative Ministries\u2019 Pearson says.\u201cWe want people to understand that a genuine navigator will not ask for your personal information,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will not attempt to copy it. They will not attempt to print it or to keep possession of it in any way. If anyone asks you for that, then chances are they are a [health insurance] agent/broker or a conman.\u201d\n\nPrinter-friendly version\n\nLet us know what you think: Email editor@free-times.com.\n\nMore news\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.free-times.com/news/092513-to-sc-nonprofits-dismay-attorney-general-weighs-in-on-obamacare", "image": "http://www.free-times.com/images/site/facebook_icon.jpg", "site_name": "Free Times", "title": "To S.C.
