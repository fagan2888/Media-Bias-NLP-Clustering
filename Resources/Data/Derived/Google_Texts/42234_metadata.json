That\u2019s when he tried to push desperately needed entitlement reform through the U.S. Congress, when he fought to cut wasteful military spending and when he railed against the evils of corporate cronyism.\n\nThese days? Kasich has become a \u201cgo along to get along\u201d establishment politician \u2013 supporting tax swaps, \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d (a.k.a. dependency incentivizing under a different name) and the Medicaid expansion accompanying Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe John Kasich of the 1990s was a perfect fit for the Tea Party GOP of today,\u201d reporter W. James Antle III wrote for The Daily Beast last fall. \u201cIn fact, he might have been well suited to mediate the disputes between libertarians, religious conservatives and national-security hawks now roiling the party. So why does he instead sound like Jeb Bush or even Jon Huntsman, whose rhetoric was practically designed to distract voters from his past conservative accomplishments?\u201d\n\nExactly \u2026\n\nWell, except it\u2019s not just rhetoric. Kasich did a 180-degree U-turn on policy and ideology \u2026 in the wrong direction.\n\nCurrently, Kasich is pimping a tax swap in Ohio that would shift the state\u2019s revenues from income to consumption-based taxes. It\u2019s billed as a net tax cut of $500 million \u2013 but Ohio takes in nearly $30 billion in tax revenue a year. Oh, and Kasich\u2019s \u201ccut\u201d is far less than the $800 million surplus Ohio had last year.\n\nThe impact of Kasich\u2019s plan on small businesses? Eh \u2026 ninety percent of them would save less than a dollar a day. Which isn\u2019t much. And certainly not enough to stimulate hiring.\n\nDon\u2019t get us wrong, we like tax cuts \u2026 but Kasich\u2019s plan isn\u2019t a cut, it\u2019s a shift. He\u2019s not serious about cutting taxes because he no longer fundamentally believes in cutting government.\n\nIs that a \u201chawkish\u201d message?\n\nWe think not \u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/02/12/john-kasich-coming-sc/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kasich-599x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "John Kasich Making Palmetto State Swing"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9d6\"", "article_summary": "|| By FITSNEWS || Fiscally liberal Ohio governor John Kasich is heading to South Carolina \u2026 his first testing of the presidential waters in an early-voting state.\nIt\u2019s billed as a net tax cut of $500 million \u2013 but Ohio takes in nearly $30 billion in tax revenue a year.\nOf course Costa also refers to Kasich as advancing a \u201chawkish brand of fiscal politics,\u201d so what does he know?\nOh, and Kasich\u2019s \u201ccut\u201d is far less than the $800 million surplus Ohio had last year.\nCurrently, Kasich is pimping a tax swap in Ohio that would shift the state\u2019s revenues from income to consumption-based taxes."}
