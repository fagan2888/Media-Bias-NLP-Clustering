Good Old Games, a digital store that caters to the nostalgic PC gamer. It\u2019s offering a bundle of games for free to government workers who can prove that they\u2019ve been furloughed (that same bundle is $25 for everyone else).\n\nFive of the games \u2014 the most famous of which is probably Alpha Centauri, Sid Meier\u2019s futuristic pseudo-sequel to Civilization \u2014 feature politics in some way, which GOG is characterizing as a \u201cquick lesson in civic government.\u201d In a nod to the Obamacare/Affordable Care Act, the bundle also includes a hospital simulator, Theme Hospital.\n\n\u201cFinally, for reasons entirely unrelated to who may or may not have been involved in shutting down the U.S. Government,\u201d GOG wrote in its announcement of the bundle, the games from the Redneck Rampage series are in there, too.\n\nFurloughed workers who want the bundle are asked to email GOG with a picture of themselves holding their furlough letters.
