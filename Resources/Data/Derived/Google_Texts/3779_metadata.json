The school district and law enforcement hope the message hits home.\n\nA frantic father called for his daughter when he arrived on the scene of an accident.\n\nVideo: Mock crash shows students dangers of drinking, driving\n\nThe chaplain tried to hold him back as crews cover up Jazymn's body. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThis accident is a fake example, meant to show the Papillion-La Vista School District and local public safety agencies the kind of powerful message this fake crash can show. A message meant to speak to these high school students so that they don\u2019t drink and drive.\n\nA Papillion-La Vista senior said the message came across loud and clear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d convince all my friends, everyone, everywhere, don\u2019t drink and drive and don\u2019t text and drive,\u201d said a senior at Papillion-La Vista High School.\n\nJazymn Yates, a Drama Club student at Papillion-La Vista High School, played the deceased daughter in the faux crash with her father, Brendon Yates. Although Friday\u2019s example was just an act, Yates said he knows exactly how it feels to lose a loved one.\n\n\u201cIt was very heavy, only because my wife and I have already suffered the loss of a child in real life,\u201d said Yates, who lost his own son six years ago.\n\nYates hopes the mock crash is a lesson learned for anyone thinking about getting behind the wheel drunk.\n\n\u201cI pray no parents have to grieve or deal with this type of loss in any way, loss of a child in any way is hard,\u201d Yates said.\n\nProm is this weekend for Papillion-La Vista High School students so the timing of the mock crash is essential. The Papillion Police and Fire Department, Sarpy County Sheriff and CHI Midlands Hospital all helped make this event possible.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 17:45:01 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Jobeth Devera", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "The powerful lesson for some Papillion-La Vista High School students comes with a realistic approach Friday.", "title": "Students get hard lesson on drinking, driving dangers", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/students-get-hard-lesson-on-drinking-driving-dangers/32428828", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/32429450/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/4627iyz/-/faux-crash-PNG.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/students-get-hard-lesson-on-drinking-driving-dangers/32428828", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/32428828", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/32428828", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/32428828"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "description": "The powerful lesson for some Papillion-La Vista High School students comes with a realistic approach Friday.", "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/32428828", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/32428828", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/JobethDeveraNews"}, "keywords": "drinking and driving, prom, Papillion-La Vista High School,", "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "news_keywords": "drinking and driving, prom, Papillion-La Vista High School,"}, "article_summary": "The powerful lesson for some Papillion-La Vista High School students came with a realistic approach Friday.\nVideo: Mock crash shows students dangers of drinking, drivingThe chaplain tried to hold him back as crews cover up Jazymn's body.\nProm is this weekend for Papillion-La Vista High School students so the timing of the mock crash is essential.\nA message meant to speak to these high school students so that they don\u2019t drink and drive.\n\u201cI\u2019d convince all my friends, everyone, everywhere, don\u2019t drink and drive and don\u2019t text and drive,\u201d said a senior at Papillion-La Vista High School."}
