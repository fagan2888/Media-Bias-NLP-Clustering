John Hickenlooper and Sen. Mark Udall, who are in tough races this fall.\n\nIn June, Deputy Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert ruled that the group would need to disclose the movie\u2019s financiers under state campaign laws. The organization contended it deserved the same free-speech protections as traditional media and liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore.\n\nCitizens United president David N. Bossie said the organization is fighting on the same principles that won before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010 after the Federal Election Commission deemed a movie about Hillary Clinton to be \u201celectioneering communication.\u201d\n\nBossie said the group would fight the case as far as they needed to, and the group will argue the federal decision should supersede state election laws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in the movie \u2018The Blues Brothers,\u2019 \u201d Bossie said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the band back together.\u201d\n\nCitizens United is using the same lawyer as in the first round of redefining campaign finance laws, Ted Olson, who has argued numerous cases before the high court and represented George W. Bush in Bush vs. Gore to end the 2000 recount. Bush picked Olson for U.S. solicitor general during his first term.\n\nIn the Colorado suit, Citizens United claims the U.S. and Colorado constitutions prevent the government from discriminating the free-speech rights based on the identity of the speaker, and disclosing exactly who is speaking \u2014 in the form of funding \u2014 is a violation.\n\n\u201cWe filed this lawsuit to vindicate Citizens United\u2019s First Amendment right to engage in political expression and media activities on the same terms as other media entities,\u201d Olson said.\n\n\u201cColorado\u2019s campaign-finance laws impose burdensome reporting and disclosure requirements on Citizens United and other speakers engaged in political discourse in the weeks preceding an election, unless the speakers happen to own a newspaper, magazine or radio or television station.\u201d\n\nGessler\u2019s spokesman Rich Coolidge said the office referred to the office\u2019s earlier statement about the decision, in which Staiert stated the \u201cforthcoming documentary is an electioneering communication,\u201d which would require disclosure.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s campaign invoked the film in a fundraising appeal last month, in which Hickenlooper said Citizens United had \u201ca penchant for mudslinging.\u201d\n\nHis campaign spokesman, Eddie Stern, said that the governor would not do the same in response.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, the governor promised to run a positive campaign and he honored that promise,\u201d Stern said. \u201cHe\u2019s promised to do it again in 2014, even in the face of negative campaigning against him.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Citizens United suing Colorado over \u201cRocky Mountain Heist\u201d funders", "title": "Citizens United suing Colorado over \u201cRocky Mountain Heist\u201d funders", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/14/citizens-united-suing-colorado-over-rocky-mountain-heist-funders/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-14T16:52:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T16:52:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0320\"", "article_summary": "In June, Deputy Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert ruled that the group would need to disclose the movie\u2019s financiers under state campaign laws.\nCitizens United filed a lawsuit against Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler in federal court in Denver Thursday, the first step in a legal fight that could rewrite the ways states handle election disclosures.\nIn the Colorado suit, Citizens United claims the U.S. and Colorado constitutions prevent the government from discriminating the free-speech rights based on the identity of the speaker, and disclosing exactly who is speaking \u2014 in the form of funding \u2014 is a violation.\nHickenlooper\u2019s campaign invoked the film in a fundraising appeal last month, in which Hickenlooper said Citizens United had \u201ca penchant for mudslinging.\u201dHis campaign spokesman, Eddie Stern, said that the governor would not do the same in response.\n\u201cIn 2010, the governor promised to run a positive campaign and he honored that promise,\u201d Stern said."}
