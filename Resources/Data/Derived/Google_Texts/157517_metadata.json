I\u2019ve said all along that this time I need to be cautious and do what\u2019s best for my long-term health and career.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, playing Augusta next week wouldn\u2019t be the right decision.\u201d\n\nWoods said he at least plans to attend the Champions Dinner on Tuesday night \u201cand see a lot of friends.\u201d Masters champion Jordan Spieth has said he will serve Texas barbecue.\n\nIt will be the second social event in two months for Woods. He also showed up at the home of Jack Nicklaus in late February when Nicklaus hosted Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III, the vice captains \u2014 Woods is one of them \u2014 and prospective players.\n\nWoods first missed the Masters in 2014, when he had back surgery a week earlier. He returned in June after the U.S. Open, took three more months off at the end of the year to get fit, and then ran into trouble with his back again last year.\n\nWoods tied for 10th in the Wyndham Championship in August, only to announce a month later that he had a second back surgery. He had a third back surgery on Oct. 28 that left his future more uncertain than ever.\n\nHis statement Friday night, however, indicated progress without mentioning how much or when he might be back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely making progress, and I\u2019m really happy with how far I\u2019ve come,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut I still have no timetable to return to competitive golf.\u201d\n\nWoods has said all along that he will not rush back. He turned 40 on Dec. 30, and his last victory was at the Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Woods will not play in the Masters next week as he continues to recover from two surgeries on his back, but will be in attendance for the annual Champions Dinner on Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Woods will not play in the Masters next week as he continues to recover from two surgeries on his back, but will be in attendance for the annual Champions Dinner on Tuesday.", "title": "Tiger Woods, citing recovery from injury, will not play in Masters", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/2/tiger-woods-masters-will-not-play-recovery-injury/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/02/AP_895592475862.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/02/AP_895592475862.jpg", "description": "Woods will not play in the Masters next week as he continues to recover from two surgeries on his back, but will be in attendance for the annual Champions Dinner on Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tiger Woods, citing recovery from injury, will not play in Masters"}, "Author": "Doug Ferguson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tiger Woods"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAfter assessing the present condition of my back, and consulting with my medical team, I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s prudent to miss this year\u2019s Masters,\u201d Woods said on his website.\nTiger Woods is going to Augusta National next week \u2014 to eat, not play.\nWoods first missed the Masters in 2014, when he had back surgery a week earlier.\nIt will be the second time in the past three years that the four-time champion has not played the Masters.\nWoods tied for 10th in the Wyndham Championship in August, only to announce a month later that he had a second back surgery."}
