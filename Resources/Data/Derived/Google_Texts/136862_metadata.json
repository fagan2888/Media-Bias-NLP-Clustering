Oregon\u2019s health insurance exchange has been one of the country\u2019s most troubled. President Obama\u2019s approval rating has fallen below 50 percent. Sen. Jeff Merkley, a liberal Democrat first elected on Obama\u2019s coattails in 2008, is not terribly well known.\n\nAnd in Monica Wehby, Republicans have a fresh-faced, female challenger who they believe matches the moment: a pediatric neurosurgeon and political outsider who rails against the Affordable Care Act but is relatively moderate on social issues.\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t need Oregon in order to win back the Senate this year. But they do need to make inroads in blue states such as this one to compete for the White House in 2016. To expand its reach beyond older white men in the Deep South and the Midwest, the GOP must persuade voters to switch sides for candidates like Wehby.\n\n\u201cUnless we conservatives learn how to compete and start winning in swing and blue states, we will never govern America,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist.\n\nMathematically, Republicans can pick up the six seats they need to gain control of the Senate by winning only in states that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried in 2012. Still, they are trying to expand the playing field to include seven states Obama won: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon and Virginia.\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nRepublican officials are particularly optimistic about Iowa, where Rep. Bruce Braley, the presumptive Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, could be vulnerable, and about Colorado and New Hampshire, where Republicans recruited top-tier challengers to take on first-term Democratic incumbents.\n\nHere in Oregon, Wehby has drawn praise from national GOP luminaries and attracted notice with a moving television ad about how she saved a newborn with spinal problems. She also has a catchy slogan: \u201cKeep your doctor, change your senator.\u201d\n\nBut Wehby has gotten off to a rocky start in her general-election campaign. After police reports detailing domestic disturbances involving her ex-husband and an ex-boyfriend surfaced two weeks ago, she largely hid from the media and has struggled to regain her footing.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s shadow\n\nThe bigger problem for Wehby, however, may be the GOP brand itself. She is campaigning as a different kind of Republican, with softer edges and a libertarian streak. But she has had difficulty distinguishing her candidacy from her party\u2019s more strident national agenda.\n\n\u201cThe Republican brand is in a sad state across the country, but particularly so in places like Oregon,\u201d Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin said. \u201cThere are a host of things that Republicans are routinely for that very frequently become deal-breakers for voters.\u201d He cited restrictions on women\u2019s access to abortion and contraception as examples.\n\nFor Democrats, the key to winning the Senate majority in 2006 and keeping it ever since has been ideological flexibility. Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mark Begich of Alaska got elected by carefully tailoring their campaigns to their deep-red states and rejecting liberal orthodoxy on some issues.\n\nWehby is attempting to adopt a similar strategy. A political newcomer with no voting record, she has taken stances on hot-button social issues that are out of step with the GOP base but designed to appeal to moderate voters.\n\nOn abortion, she has said that she is personally pro-life but that it is a choice that should not involve the federal government. On same-sex marriage, she has said only that it is a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d and \u201cnot a government decision.\u201d And on immigration, she has said that she opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants but that she wants to provide them a path to legal status.\n\n\u201cVoting completely with one party or the other is not representative of Oregon because we\u2019re a purple state,\u201d Wehby told the Oregonian. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go and rubber-stamp things.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed, however, she could not cite a specific policy disagreement with a majority of Senate Republicans.\n\nA populist Democrat\n\nThat could spell trouble for Wehby. Merkley has begun running a populist campaign, casting her as another Republican in the mold of Romney, who was characterized by Democrats as an out-of-touch plutocrat.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post at his Portland campaign headquarters, Merkley listed pocketbook issues such as pay equity, raising the minimum wage and expanding unemployment insurance as areas where he and Wehby disagree.\n\n\u201cShe has said she couldn\u2019t think of one thing she differed from the national Republican agenda on,\u201d Merkley said. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay. [The] national Republican agenda is all about helping the best off get better off, and it\u2019s the opposite of my fight for working families.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there are a lot of senators who live in a working-class community, but I do. . . . There are two foreclosed homes on my street.\u201d\n\nMerkley lives in a multi-ethnic neighborhood on the eastern edge of Portland. Wehby lives in a well-to-do Portland suburb and, according to a police report, drives a Mercedes.\n\nThe next day, Merkley brought Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to Portland for a campaign fundraiser and rally, where she whipped up a crowd of 1,000 people with fiery attacks on big banks, chief executives, lobbyists and Republican lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe game is rigged, and it\u2019s up to us to change it,\u201d Warren said. With Merkley at her side, Warren called this fall\u2019s campaign \u201ca fight over values.\u201d\n\nAt the rally, Jean Eilers, 73, a retired union organizer, said she worries that Wehby could come on strong against Merkley.\n\n\u201cShe makes me nervous,\u201d Eilers said. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman and she\u2019s a doctor, and she has a calmer tone. But once you see who\u2019s supporting her, it will be clear to people in Oregon what she\u2019s really about.\u201d\n\nMajor GOP super PACs have not yet spent much money in Oregon, although a group called New Republican aired TV and radio ads on Wehby\u2019s behalf during the primary, calling her an \u201cindependent conservative.\u201d\n\nAlex Castellanos, a leading GOP strategist who founded New Republican, characterized Wehby as the type of candidate Republicans need to champion.\n\n\u201cIf we remain what we are now \u2014 the party of \u2018No,\u2019 the party more interested in telling you what you can\u2019t do and what you can\u2019t be \u2014 and we can\u2019t win in a place like Oregon, we\u2019ll be a party that\u2019s left behind,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless we expand our playing field and offer an optimistic vision of how we take people to a better place, there isn\u2019t enough map for us.\u201d\n\nWehby declined The Post\u2019s request for an interview. She also has refused to speak with most in-state media since May 16, when news broke of a 2013 police report in which her ex-boyfriend, Andrew Miller, accused her of stalking him. The police report, which the Oregonian said was first obtained by a state Democratic Party researcher before Politico reported on it, roiled Wehby\u2019s campaign leading up to the May 20 primary.\n\nIn two separate episodes that were later reported by the Oregonian, Wehby\u2019s now ex-husband, Jim Grant, also called police in 2007 and 2009 complaining that she had been harassing him.\n\nWehby\u2019s Washington-based consultants and operatives with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) have been helping her manage the scandals. Last week, Wehby held a few small public events, but they were in rural parts of the state and her campaign did not announce them until an hour beforehand, making it logistically impossible for Portland-based reporters to cover her appearances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of a rookie candidate,\u201d said Jim Moore, a political scientist at Pacific University. \u201cNow it\u2019s basically up to her to learn how to respond to those stories and to move on and put together a strong candidacy.\u201d\n\nMerkley, in his interview with The Post, refused to comment on Wehby\u2019s personal life but criticized her for dodging the media.\n\n\u201cI do strongly believe that if you are running for office, citizens have a right to absolutely hear your response to the issues that are before us,\u201d Merkley said, noting that Wehby had declined to debate her GOP primary opponents.\n\nAn \u2018unwinnable\u2019 state?\n\nDemocratic officials contend that Oregon has become \u201cunwinnable\u201d for Republicans. Although for much of the last century it was represented by two Republican senators, Oregon has not elected a Republican statewide since then-Sen. Gordon Smith in 2002.\n\nBut GOP officials believe that Merkley is vulnerable this year. They say the problems in implementing Cover Oregon, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, could weigh him down. And they argue that Merkley\u2019s recent achievements \u2014 pushing filibuster reform, preventing Lawrence H. Summers from being nominated to chair the Federal Reserve Board and opposing military action in Syria \u2014 are not motivating issues for most voters.\n\nWith the right independent-minded candidate, GOP operatives think they can reverse the trend in Oregon.\n\n\u201cThe path to victory starts with a vulnerable incumbent, and that\u2019s exactly what Sen. Jeff Merkley is,\u201d said Kevin McLaughlin, an NRSC consultant who has advised Wehby. \u201cThen, Republicans have to nominate someone who gives you a chance to capitalize on that vulnerable incumbent \u2014 like a moderate woman who is a Washington outsider who also happens to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can the party expand its reach in a blue state?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Can the party expand its reach in a blue state?", "title": "Can Republicans expand their reach in blue states?
