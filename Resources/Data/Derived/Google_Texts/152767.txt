COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.—The Black Forest Fire/Rescue Protection District has released a 2,000-page report that the board says fully exonerates the fire chief from allegations of unprofessional behavior or misconduct.

According to the Colorado Springs Gazette ( http://tinyurl.com/ovgc72w), the report released Friday outlines findings of an independent investigation that was prompted by a dispute between Fire Chief Bob Harvey and El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa over management of the fire.

The report found that no one could have stopped the fire that started June 11 and burned more than 18,000 acres, destroyed 488 homes and killed two people.

The report also found that firefighting resources were diverted to protect the home of an El Paso County employee while other nearby homes burned.

Maketa on Friday afternoon criticized the report’s findings.
