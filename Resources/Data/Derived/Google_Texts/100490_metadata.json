Some had traveled from nearby states and slept in cars at the muddied fairgrounds. Others came on foot from miles away.\n\nAll had unmet medical needs \u2014 and the most urgent was dental.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOn this morning, they were willing to suffer a little bit longer, if it meant some relief from their pain at the sprawling clinic rising here.\n\nFounded in 1985, Remote Area Medical \u2014 known as RAM \u2014 is an all-volunteer organization that provides free health care to some of the most remote and medically underserved areas in the United States and the world. It offers a portfolio of health care services, including dental care, and all its events are supported through donations or partnerships with other charitable organizations.\n\nThe care was free for the 2,292 patients seen over the course of three days. The medical equivalent of winning the lottery in a region where health care is often a gamble and dental care is often out of reach. This time, few were turned away.\n\n( WATCH: 12 significant statements on Obamacare)\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where it is in the United States \u2014 it can be California or it can be here \u2014 65 percent of the patients that walk through the door are for dental care,\u201d RAM founder Stan Brock said during an interview with POLITICO. \u201cAnd about the same percentage are here for vision and eyeglasses. In other words, they need both.\u201d\n\nBut both they can\u2019t have, at least not during the same three-day event now in its 14th year in Wise County. They must pick, and about half, more than 1,000, elect for dental care. In the future, some may have many of their health care needs taken care of under the new health law \u2014 although some could still be left out if they live in states that aren\u2019t choosing to expand Medicaid to low-income adults.\n\nBut conversations with several of the waiting patients here indicated they didn\u2019t know too much about the president\u2019s health law, the Affordable Care Act, or what it might mean for them and their families. But for those here with toothaches, it may not make much of a difference. The new health law may cover a lot of services, but most adult dental care won\u2019t be part of it.\n\nAs the gates opened precisely at 5:30 a.m., the crowd filtered in according to pre-assigned numbers. The grounds cultivated for vegetables and livestock were transformed into a military-style surgical hospital, complete with a small army of surgeons, physicians and volunteers. Open-sided tents protected dozens of dental chairs placed neatly in rows. PVC pipe snaking along the edge of tents and tarp-lined shelter carried the mixed remains of cleanser, spit and blood. The smell of antiseptic \u2014 not farm \u2014 filled the morning air. Nervous student volunteers insist it is a sterile enough environment.\n\n( WATCH: What Obama said on health care and why it mattered)\n\nThe waiting patients, many clearly in pain, did not seem to notice the austere conditions. By the end of the three days, 3,926 adult teeth would be extracted, and an additional 70 from children. Some 1,635 cavities would be filled. As patients walked away, relieved of pain, their smiles pierced through mouths crammed with bloodstained gauze.\n\n\u201cAll these years later, people are still losing teeth in these mountains,\u201d said Carole Pratt, a volunteer dentist for Mission of Mercy, which partners with RAM here at Wise.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to have seen the Affordable Care Act include dentistry for adults, but it didn\u2019t,\u201d said Pratt. And state cutbacks mean public health dentists are vanishing across the country. Pratt said that 70 dental chairs are going unused not far from Wise County Fairgrounds because public dentists are not available to provide needed care.\n\n\u201cCharity is not a solution long term,\u201d said American Dental Association President Robert Faiella, who was volunteering at the fairgrounds. But charity is what many dentists offer, pro bono care without state reimbursement, he said. \u201cMost dentists do it silently because they feel the need to do the right thing,\u201d Faiella said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Remote Area Medical is an organization that provides free health care to underserved areas.", "title": "Pulling teeth in Appalachia", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/appalachian-medical-outreach-97175.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care (1558),Tim Kaine (196),Affordable Care Act (437)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Remote Area Medical is an organization that provides free health care to underserved areas.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1795\"", "article_summary": "It offers a portfolio of health care services, including dental care, and all its events are supported through donations or partnerships with other charitable organizations.\nThe medical equivalent of winning the lottery in a region where health care is often a gamble and dental care is often out of reach.\nPulling teeth in AppalachiaWISE COUNTY, Va. \u2014 The patients gathered before an Appalachian sunrise.\nThey must pick, and about half, more than 1,000, elect for dental care.\nThe new health law may cover a lot of services, but most adult dental care won\u2019t be part of it."}
