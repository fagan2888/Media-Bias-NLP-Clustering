Franklin Graham. (Phto: BGEA)\n\nBecause of his promotion of gay issues, President Barack Obama opened the \u201cfloodgates of acceptance\u201d of \u201csexual immorality,\u201d said Rev. Franklin Graham, who added that the rainbow, a sign given from God after the flood in the Old Testament, is conversely shown in Revelation as preceding \u201cthe unstoppable wrath\u201d that will fall on \u201call who rebel against Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201c[U]nder the zealous gay/lesbian activism of President Obama -- who in his first term actually opposed same-sex marriage -- the floodgates of acceptance of this practice of sexual immorality were opened wide,\u201d said Rev. Graham in his commentary for the September issue of Decision magazine.\n\n\u201cNever, though, would I have dreamed that our president would light up the White House with the vivid, bright rainbow colors of the gay movement,\u201d said the reverend, son of pastor Billy Graham. \u201cIt was a deliberate, measured step by the president to flaunt and celebrate a disastrous [Supreme Court] ruling that blatantly defies God\u2019s moral law.\u201d\n\nThe evening of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling (5-4) that homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d was a constitutional right, the White House was illuminated with the colors of the rainbow, which is the symbol for the homosexual movement.\n\nAs for the rainbow in the book of Genesis, Rev. Graham explained that, \u201cThe rainbow came after the iniquity of man had become such a stench in God\u2019s nostrils that God acted to cleanse the earth, sparing only Noah and his family. At Christ\u2019s return, the earth, the heavens and mankind will come under the intense judgment of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the rainbow appears in the Book of Revelation, it precedes the impending, unstoppable wrath that will come upon all who rebel against Christ,\u201d said Rev. Graham, who oversees the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.\n\nThe White House, illuminated in gay rainbow colors to celebrate the Supreme Court's ruling that homosexual \"marriage\" is a civil right. (AP)\n\nRev. Graham continued, \u201cThe Apostle John writes: \u2018Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over the head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire\u2019 (Revelation 10:1).\u201d\n\n\u201cUnprecedented woes of God\u2019s end-time judgment have commenced, as Almighty God prepares a new Heaven and a new Earth where righteousness reigns and sin is forever banished,\u201d said Rev. Graham.\n\nThe immorality and depravity of contemporary society mirrors that of dying Rome, said the reverend.\n\n\u201cI cannot overstate what a dangerous era we have now entered,\u201d he said. \u201cImmorality and depraved debauchery are not only endorsed by courts and political leaders, but these are joyfully celebrated. God\u2019s standards are mocked and ridiculed in the process, and the battle lines are clearly drawn for decades to come between a decadent, defiant culture and believers who are committed to the truth of the Gospel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttempts to throw off biblical morality never result in the freedoms anticipated,\u201d said Rev. Graham. \u201cThe end is always increasing enslavement to immorality, a consequence that ultimately can lead to the demise of a civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestructive behavior of every kind is gradually unleashed, ushering in increasing lawlessness and corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realize the horror that awaits a people who rebel and reject God\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nIn addition to running the BGEA, evangelist Franklin Graham is the president of the international Christian relief group Samaritan\u2019s Purse. Rev. Graham, 62, is married and has five children. He regularly preaches in the United States and around the globe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "...", "title": "Rev.
