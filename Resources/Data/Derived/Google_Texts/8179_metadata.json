All three are part of CHS.\n\nRepresentatives from the three Tennessee hospitals did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.\n\nThe Brentwood-based CHS, which has 199 hospitals in 29 states, according to its website, did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe Post\u2019s study reports that half of the 50 hospitals on the list are affiliated with CHS, in such states as Alabama, Florida and Virginia.\n\nAccording to various media accounts, CHS officials were allegedly so upset with the Tennessee Legislature\u2019s failure to expand Medicaid under Obamacare this year they discontinued plans to expand operations in Williamson County.\n\nCHS officials, according to the Nashville Business Journal, could have been retaliating against Williamson County legislators who opposed Republican Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s proposed expansion of Medicaid, also known as Insure Tennessee.\n\nAccording to the Nashville Banner, CHS was a part of the Coalition For A Healthy Tennessee\u2019s unsuccessful lobbying efforts to pass the proposed law.\n\nCoalition spokesman Joe Hall referred all questions on the matter to the Tennessee Hospital Association, which also lobbied for the bill.\n\nTHA spokesman Joe Burchfield said the three hospitals in Jackson, Morristown and Dyersburg were not affiliated with his organization.\n\nThe Post identified the Nashville-based Hospital Corporation of America as having 14 hospitals that also overcharged the uninsured, although none were in Tennessee. HCA, according to the Banner, was also involved in efforts to expand Medicaid in Tennessee.\n\nOfficials with CHA, HCA and other health-care corporations whose hospitals made the list reportedly told the newspaper they offer large discounts to uninsured people.\n\nHCA spokesman Ed Fishbough said Wednesday the amount patients pay for hospital services is more strongly tied to the types of coverage they have.\n\n\u201cGovernment programs like Medicare and Medicaid determine how much they reimburse hospitals, and insurance plans negotiate rates,\u201d Fishbough said.\n\nThe Post said CHS did not own several of the hospitals that made the list at the time the study was done, but didn\u2019t specify which ones or when the report was completed.\n\nUPDATE: After the deadline for this article had passed, officials with CMS and Lakeway Regional Hospital submitted responses to Tennessee Watchdog via email.\n\nCHA spokeswoman Tomi Galin said CHS chose to locate in Antioch due to \u201ca business decision based on the cost of the land\u201d and \u201cavailability of qualified employees.\u201d\n\nAs for the price gouging alleged in the Washington Post article, Galin said the study was done on data that is three years old.\n\n\u201cOne-third of the CHS-affiliated hospitals on this list were acquired from HMA two years after the reporting period.\u201d\n\nShe also repeated what the Post said about the hospital offering discounts to the uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe support pricing transparency, but a hospital\u2019s charges, and its charge-to-cost ratio, are not relevant measures of what consumers, insurers or the government pay for services. Medicare and Medicaid determine the rates they will pay for our services, and those rates don\u2019t always cover the cost of providing care.\u201d\n\nLakeway Regional spokeswoman Melanie Burgess, meanwhile, said hospital charges vary from hospital to hospital due to \u201ca unique mix of payers, patients and services.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the hospital provided $18 million in charity and uncompensated care to the area\u2019s most in-need residents,\u201d Burgess said in an emailed statement.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
