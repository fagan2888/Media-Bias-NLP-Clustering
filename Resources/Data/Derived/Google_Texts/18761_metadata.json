Republicans disagree, and say costs are still rising even as many are receiving health coverage that is worse than what they had before the law was passed.\n\nThe CBO report seems to take the side of Republicans by saying healthcare costs will continue to rise. It says that increase, combined with new federal subsidies for healthcare under Obamacare, will put new financial burdens on the government that will lead to more debt.\n\n\u201cThe pressures stemming from an aging population, rising health care costs, and an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance would cause spending for some of the largest federal programs to increase relative to GDP,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\u201cFederal spending for Social Security and the government\u2019s major health care programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and subsidies for health insurance purchased through the exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 would rise sharply, to a total of 14 percent of GDP by 2039, twice the 7 percent average seen over the past 40 years,\u201d it added. \u201cThat boost in spending is expected to occur because of the aging of the population, growth in per capita spending on health care, and an expansion of federal health care programs.\u201d\n\nCBO projects that this growth will make spending on federal health programs a major component of federal spending in 2039, when it\u2019s estimated that the national debt will equal 100 percent of U.S. GDP.\n\nWhile spending in other areas will remain relatively flat, another component that is expected to increase dramatically is interest payments on the national debt.\n\n\u201cCBO expects interest rates to rebound in coming years from their current unusually low levels, raising the government\u2019s interest payments,\u201d CBO said. \u201cThat additional spending would contribute to larger budget deficits \u2014 equaling close to 4 percent of GDP \u2014 toward the end of the 10-year period spanned by the baseline,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cAltogether, deficits during that 2015\u20132024 period would total about $7.6 trillion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 23, "twitter": {"description": "The Congressional Budget Office released a report Tuesday that says rising healthcare costs and expensive federal subsidies under Obamacare will both contribute to rising federal budget deficits over the next decade.
