× Take-and-bake-pizza: State will now collect 5% sales tax on every sale

MADISON (AP) — The sales tax is now on the menu at take-and-bake pizzerias in Wisconsin.

The Wisconsin State Journal reports the extra expense for pizza-lovers will be $2.7 million a year as the state collects 5 percent for every sale.

The change results from a ruling by the national Streamlines Sales Tax Governing Board. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue had asked the board whether Papa Murphy’s should charge the sales tax on itspizzas, which are assembled at stores but baked at home.

The board decided that take-and-bake pizzas count as prepared foods, which are not exempt from Wisconsin’s sales tax.

Papa Murphy’s says it has 91 stores in Wisconsin.

Proposals at the Legislature to support Papa Murphy’s and Kwik-Trip convenience stores by exempting take-and-bake pizzas failed to pass.
