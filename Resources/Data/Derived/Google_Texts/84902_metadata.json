One dating website is hoping you\u2019ll avoid the \u201cObama-drama\u201d and get a sugar daddy to cover your health insurance instead.\n\nSeekingArrangement.com, a dating website that connects attractive young women with wealthy older men, is marketing its services on the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act. In a YouTube video released Monday, the site informs viewers that their parents and their employment aren\u2019t the only way to get health insurance. And the site takes direct shots at HealthCare.gov, too.\n\n\u201cWhy settle for a horrible government site that doesn\u2019t work?\u201d the video narrator asks, as a frustrated man chucks his computer on the ground.\n\nAnd what are the benefits SeekingArrangement offers that Obamacare doesn\u2019t? Site users won\u2019t have to settle for a bare bones insurance plan, get to choose their own plans and won\u2019t get screwed \u2014 by the government.\n\nIn the beginning of this year, SeekingArrangment reported that sugar baby enrollment on the site was up considerably, especially among college students looking to pay off their debt.\n\nWatch the video. Caution: It\u2019s a little NSFW.\n\n(h/t BuzzFeed)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Worried about paying for health insurance now that Obamacare has been implemented?
