Still, That\u2019s a pretty big problem for a facial recognition system that the FBI has said is supposed to be faster and more accurate than police lineups.\n\nShahar Belkin, CTO of FST Biometrics, told The Verge that the problem with the FBI\u2019s system is mainly the quality of the pictures the government is using. These systems typically require photos with people facing forward \u201cno more than 15 degrees off the center axis.\u201d Mug shots, for example, will work, but if the FBI is using the system to identify criminals through surveillance cameras, it\u2019s going to be more difficult to get an accurate read out.\n\nPeople have raised concerns about the program\u2019s accuracy for years. In 2010, a government auditor reported that the FBI\u2019s facial recognition technology could fail up to 20 percent of the time, The National Journal reported.\n\nAnd inaccuracies aren\u2019t the only problems critics have with the FBI\u2019s new technology.\n\nJust last month at least 30 civil rights groups sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder asking the Justice Department to do an audit of the FBI\u2019s facial-recognition database. They said the program poses privacy risks to American citizens and expressed concern over whether it has been properly vetted.\n\n\"The capacity of the FBI to collect and retain information, even on innocent Americans, has grown exponentially,\" the letter said. \"It is essential for the American public to have a complete picture of all the programs and authorities the FBI uses to track our daily lives, and an understanding of how those programs affect our civil rights and civil liberties.\"\n\nFBI Director James Comey told Congress last month that the agency will not be collecting and storing photos of average citizens.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The technology used to help tag your friends in Facebook photos is more accurate than", "title": "FBI\u2019s Billion Dollar Facial Recognition Falls Short of Facebook\u2019s", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/11/FBI-s-Billion-Dollar-Facial-Recognition-Falls-Short-Facebook-s", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/facial-recognition-markers-640x353.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/11/FBI-s-Billion-Dollar-Facial-Recognition-Falls-Short-Facebook-s", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/facial-recognition-markers-640x353.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The technology used to help tag your friends in Facebook photos is more accurate than", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2010, a government auditor reported that the FBI\u2019s facial recognition technology could fail up to 20 percent of the time, The National Journal reported.\nTo be sure, the experts stress caution when comparing Facebook\u2019s database of 250 billion photos to the FBI\u2019s database of 50 million.\nRelated: Federal IT Flaws Go Well Beyond ObamacareThe FBI\u2019s system matched a suspect\u2019s photo with the wrong name about one in seven times.\nThe technology used to help tag your friends in Facebook photos is more accurate than the FBI\u2019s new billion dollar facial recognition system that\u2019s supposed to help track down bad guys.\nShahar Belkin, CTO of FST Biometrics, told The Verge that the problem with the FBI\u2019s system is mainly the quality of the pictures the government is using."}
