Monica's Dad, CC BY 2.0\n\nWhen former San Diego Charger, Junior Seau, killed himself in 2012, sports fans across the nation were rocked by the news. Now, his family says that the NFL\u2019s $760 million concussion settlement doesn\u2019t provide enough for families like Seau\u2019s, who found out after his death that Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) caused by taking hard hits to the head during his NFL career. They believe that his CTE caused him to commit suicide.\n\nIn a court proceeding, according to Reuters, the family argues that the settlement doesn\u2019t take into account the needs of the survivors of NFL players who died as a result of the injuries they sustained while on the field. \"Mr. Seau's children have their own claims for the wrong the NFL did to them. His children are not suing for their father's pain and suffering, they are suing for their own,\" the attorneys wrote, according to Reuters.\n\nCTE is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain that is usually found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma, according to Boston University\u2019s Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. The trauma \u2014 in athletes, usually concussions \u2014 causes brain tissue to degenerate, which then triggers the buildup of a protein called tau. The buildup of tau, over time, has been linked to symptoms like memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, and progressive dementia. Former NFL stars like Tony Dorsett and Leonard Marshall have contributed to research on early CTE diagnosis, hoping to get treatment for what they describe as sometimes unbearable symptoms.\n\nConcussions and head injuries remain a challenge for the NFL, even for players currently in the league. According to The Wire:\n\nOn the field, this year\u2019s NFL postseason has been marred by a slew of head injuries. Nine different players suffered concussions in the first five playoff games, including three members of the Kansas City Chiefs in one game. David Bakhtiari and Keenan Lewis, two of those nine players, refused to leave the sideline and were later cited by the league for violating concussion protocol during playoff games, a violation that carries no consequence for the players or their teams.\n\nIn August, the NFL awarded a $765 million settlement to 18,000 retired football players who suffered concussion-related brain injuries. Each former football player that has been diagnosed with a brain condition since retiring would get $5 million, Reuters reports. Family members of deceased players, on the other hand, would receive only a few thousand dollars. Earlier this month, Judge Anita Brody rejected the NFL\u2019s settlement offer, allowing for negotiations to continue on a higher settlement amount for all parties involved. The Seau family has asked Brody to take their objections into consideration as she decides on the appropriate settlement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "junior seau, nfl concussion settlement, football, concussions in football, traumatic brain injury,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Former NFL superstar Junior Seau's family says that the proposed NFL concussion settlement doesn't provide enough for survivors of players who died from injuries sustained on the field.", "title": "Should The NFL's Concussion Settlement Give More Money To Deceased Players' Families?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/junior-seaus-family-says-760m-nfl-concussion-settlement-isnt-enough-players-children-matter-too", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/4084734655af41b6ce79z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former NFL superstar Junior Seau's family says that the proposed NFL concussion settlement doesn't provide enough for survivors of players who died from injuries sustained on the field.", "title": "Should The NFL's Concussion Settlement Give More Money To Deceased Players' Families?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/junior-seaus-family-says-760m-nfl-concussion-settlement-isnt-enough-players-children-matter-too", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/4084734655af41b6ce79z.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/25/4084734655af41b6ce79z.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-25T18:45:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T18:45:34-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Former NFL superstar Junior Seau's family says that the proposed NFL concussion settlement doesn't provide enough for survivors of players who died from injuries sustained on the field."}, "article_summary": "Former NFL superstar Junior Seau's family says that the proposed NFL concussion settlement doesn't provide enough for survivors of players who died as a result of injuries sustained on the field.\nIn August, the NFL awarded a $765 million settlement to 18,000 retired football players who suffered concussion-related brain injuries.\nThe Seau family has asked Brody to take their objections into consideration as she decides on the appropriate settlement.\nNow, his family says that the NFL\u2019s $760 million concussion settlement doesn\u2019t provide enough for families like Seau\u2019s, who found out after his death that Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) caused by taking hard hits to the head during his NFL career.\nEarlier this month, Judge Anita Brody rejected the NFL\u2019s settlement offer, allowing for negotiations to continue on a higher settlement amount for all parties involved."}
