As the deadline nears, House and Senate negotiators hope to reach a compromise soon, although McCarthy suggested lawmakers could use one extra week until Dec. 18. (A stopgap measure would be needed to keep the government open in the interim.)\n\nThe desire by Republicans not to shut down the government over the emotionally-charged abortion issue was seconded by Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a staunch abortion opponent who acknowledged Monday that a successful effort to defund Planned Parenthood won\u2019t happen on this bill or is likely anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThis has been an ongoing issue for years now,\u201d the freshman Republican senator said. \u201cIt has to be addressed and it might take years to get that done.\u201d\n\nThe effort to strip Medicaid reimbursements to the organization became a must-do for conservatives this fall after videos released by an anti-abortion group earlier this year featured officials from Planned Parenthood discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he would stand with Planned Parenthood and prevent GOP efforts to defund it. He also warned Republican leaders against using caustic language that he suggested could lead to violence against abortion clinics.\n\n\u201cWe as leaders must be mindful of our words and actions,\u201d Reid said on the Senate floor. Monday \u201cWhipping people into a frenzy of hate and anger while providing easy access to firearms has proven disastrous to our country.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration is warning Republicans not to include controversial policy provisions in the government funding bill.\n\n\u201cI say with some confidence the newly elected Speaker of the House doesn\u2019t want to preside over a government shutdown six weeks into his tenure,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a briefing in Paris.\n\nLankford said the shooting was unlikely to impact the debate this week on defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cObviously the Planned Parenthood folks want to rise up and say we wouldn\u2019t have a shooting if it wasn\u2019t for the mean folks who are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood. I don\u2019t think that plays well, quite frankly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be like saying we have complaints about education reform in America so there are school shootings. The two are not connected.\u201d\n\nReconciliation vote coming up\n\nSenate Republicans are taking other steps this week that could ease the pressure to defund Planned Parenthood in the government spending bill. They hope to pass a separate budget bill for next year \u2014 called reconciliation \u2014 that can be approved on just 51 votes instead of the usual 60 required for major bills in the Senate.\n\nSenate Republicans emerged from their reconciliation bill meeting in the Capitol upbeat they will have the 51 votes to pass the package, which would repeal more parts of Obamacare than the House did as well as defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nA vote on that measure is expected by the end of the week, according to Senate GOP aides. While President Obama is sure to veto the bill, Republicans would consider its passage a major accomplishment, one they would tout on the campaign trail.\n\nThere has been some question as to whether Senate GOP leaders can get the 51 votes they need because of opposition from some conservatives \u2014 like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, both presidential candidates who want a broader Obamacare repeal \u2014 and some moderates who favor abortion rights like Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom are up for re-election in swing states.\n\nOne of the holdouts on the Obamacare question was Sen. Mike Lee or Utah. He said afterward he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the more robust Senate language.\n\nThat was relief to Sen. John Cornyn, the GOP whip in charge of counting votes, who said, \u201cIf he\u2019s encouraged than I\u2019m encouraged.\u201d\n\nSenate GOP aides say pressure has been high from the anti-abortion community to approve the reconciliation bill and they anticipate getting enough support to pass it.\n\nDebate on reconciliation is set to begin formally Wednesday and conclude Thursday, per several aides and senators.\n\nObamacare, climate change riders\n\nMcCarthy didn\u2019t rule out that Planned Parenthood language could be added in some fashion to the government funding bill saying, \u201cI expect there to be a healthy debate on every place the government spends money and that\u2019s the way democracy works.\u201d\n\nHe made it clear the spending bill would include some mix of policy riders, but declined to describe which ones.\n\nMany conservative Republicans argue the spending bill is their main leverage with the administration, and are floating adding provisions to block implementation of climate change rules, Obamacare, and other Democratic priorities. House Speaker Paul Ryan has not signaled yet which of these he wants to press as negotiators on both sides try to hammer out a deal.\n\nMcCarthy also said that after the terror attacks in Paris, \u201csecurity is becoming the top issue\u201d that he hears about from GOP colleagues.\n\nThe No. 2 House GOP leader touted the veto-proof margin on legislation that passed the House before Thanksgiving that would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to certify any refugees from Iraq and Syria don\u2019t pose a security threat. He suggested that refugee measure could be added to the government funding legislation, saying, \u201cthat bill needs to pass and become law whichever way it can.\u201d\n\nBefore the end of the year, congressional leaders also hope to pass a long-term compromise highway bill, a rewrite of the unpopular No Child Left Behind law, and a series of tax break extensions.\n\nOn Monday night negotiators to the highway bill and, separately, the No Child Left Behind measure, were in the final stages of their talks and gathering signatures from conference committee members, with hopes of releasing their final language Monday night or Tuesday.
