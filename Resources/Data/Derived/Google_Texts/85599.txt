If you ever wanted to see an asteroid in the night sky, then circle Monday night on your calendar. From 6:30 until 11:45 p.m., asteroid 2004 BL-8-6 will be seen in the eastern sky near Jupiter. No need to worry about a collision, this large space rock will be about 3 times farther from us than the moon. If you are an amateur astronomer then you are going to need a telescope with at least a 4 inch lens.

This asteroid will look like faint, slow moving star. You'll be able to see the asteroid moving near Jupiter and the constellation Cancer. Even NASA will be observing this event. Very little is known about 2004 BL86 but they will use radar technology to try to get detailed images of the asteroid.

This flyby will the closest by any known asteroid this large until Asteroid 1999 AN10 flies by in 2027. And the forecast looks great that evening with expected afternoon highs in the 40s and 50s. So happy hunting!
