A Panama City Man accused of first degree murder on Christmas Day last year is now in custody.

32 year old former state prison inmate Stephen Trusty was caught without incident Friday during a traffic stop in Marion County.

Panama City Police considered him a person of interest in the death of a 56 year old man found shot in front of his home, Wilbert Angelo Faison.

About 1 a-m on Christmas Day, police say they responded to gun shots being fired in front of 511 east 13th street.

There they found Faison wounded he was later pronounced dead in the hospital.

Police have been searching for Trusty for months.

The Panama City and Gainesville divisions of the U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force received information this past week that suggested trusty was hiding in the Gainesville area.

Friday, they watched as he left in his black Ford Explorer towards Marion County.

The MCSO Aviation Unit, patrol deputies and a K-9 unit helped pull him over and make the arrest.

Trusty was taken to the Marion County Jail, where he was booked on the warrant from Bay County.
