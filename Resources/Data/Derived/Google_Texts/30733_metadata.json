That\u2019s equal to 73% of what the CBO expects the exchange subsidies and the Medicaid expansion will cost in that year.\n\nBy comparison, planned Medicare spending cuts will cover only 24% of ObamaCare\u2019s subsidy costs in 2016.\n\nNo one believes these Medicare cuts \u2014 which involve mainly payment cuts to doctors and hospitals \u2014 will happen. Medicare\u2019s board of trustees, the Government Accountability Office and Medicare\u2019s chief actuary have all warned they are unrealistic and unsustainable over the long term.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the CBO has already sharply downgraded ObamaCare\u2019s ability to reduce Medicare spending. Its latest report trims expected Medicare cuts over the next four years by 33% from its initial forecast.\n\nTax revenues, likewise, are coming in lower than expected, and whereas the CBO had expected ObamaCare\u2019s tax hikes to raise $371 billion from 2016 to 2019, it now thinks they will bring in $289 billion.\n\nAs a result, despite the fact that ObamaCare\u2019s insurance subsidies are costing less than the CBO expected, ObamaCare\u2019s financial future is far worse than promised.\n\nBack in 2010, for example, the CBO forecast ObamaCare would run a small surplus of $13 billion in 2019. Now it expects ObamaCare to run a $22 billion deficit that year.\n\nAnd instead of $124 billion in overall deficit reduction in ObamaCare\u2019s first 10 years, the CBO\u2019s updated projections show it will produce a $34 billion increase from 2010 to 2019. (Nearly two years ago IBD predicted this would happen.)\n\nDespite President Obama\u2019s repeated claims that ObamaCare would cut the deficit by \u201cmore than $1 trillion\u201d in its second decade (2020 to 2029), this too is wildly off the mark. According to the CBO, ObamaCare is on track to cut the deficit by just $240 billion over the first six of those years (assuming all those Medicare cuts take place), making anything like $1 trillion an impossibility.\n\nEven the CBO admits that this is unlikely, because the forecast is \u201cbased in large part on projections of the law\u2019s effects, which are themselves highly uncertain.\u201d And so ObamaCare \u201ccould in fact\u201d hike deficits \u201cover that period.\u201d\n\nSince ObamaCare has already produced deficits where surpluses are supposed to be, it\u2019s a good bet it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anyone who thinks ObamaCare will cut the deficit over the next decade should look at Page 11 of the latest Congressional Budget Office report.
