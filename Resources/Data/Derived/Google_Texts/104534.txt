Nancy Pelosi can’t party with the beautiful people.

The House minority leader might boast a Botox-smooth 75-year-old face, but the decades were clearly wearing on her during a weekend at the Hamptons, where guests two and three generations younger were carousing the night away.

According to the New York Post’s inestimable Page 6, Pelosi was kept up late by poolside partiers at The Capri hotel.

“You could definitely hear the music in the rooms,” a source told Page 6. “They tell you when you book it could be loud. The party was pretty happening. Girls were dancing on tables for a bit and techno music was blaring.”

Even worse for the grande dame of Obamacare, she couldn’t get a table at the hotel’s restaurant because she didn’t make reservations.

Pelosi was forced to dine in her room instead. (Her staff didn’t have the same luxury. Some of her entourage — including security — had to eat at a nearby McDonald’s, the Post reports.)

Who says Democrats don’t understand the problems of the people?

Social media users weren’t sympathetic.

@Mediaite this is kind of like her tenure in gov’t – she never plans or looks ahead and the country is the worse for it. @NancyPelosi — Journalism Judge (@JournalismJudge) July 13, 20

Some even suggested alternative accommodations for the San Francisco liberal.

It’s closed now. But it’s the thought that counts.
