It's actually up a little bit since opening year which is a really good sign for a casino,\" says Sonny Johnson, CEO of Pearl River Resort.\n\nThe casino employees around 160 people, but with the recent boom in business since adding table games that number is expected to rise to about 210 employees.\n\n\"We are actually increasing our payroll by about 50 people so we are bringing in a lot of new jobs to the area. Of course, in turn that relates to more money spent at gas stations, restaurants, and hotels here in the area. It is a big economic boost to the sandersville area,\" says Johnson.\n\nSonny Johnson, CEO of Pearl River Resort says it not only contributes to Sandersville, but it also provides resources to the tribe.\n\n\"It's a big contributor to Pearl River Resort up north and it does quite a bit for the tribe. It's a big job creator for the tribe and contributes significantly to our overall income base,\" says Johnson.\n\nJohnson says it's important to add new amenities to the casino so it continues to thrive.\n\n\"We just brought in the table games product and we are going to increase that offering in the coming months. Also, I'm looking at doing some nice new dress up amenities. New carpet, slot bases and things of that nature to bring a more modern feel to the property,\" says Johnson.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Bok Homa Casino celebrated their 5th anniversary.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Bok Homa Casino celebrated their 5th anniversary.", "title": "Bok Homa Casino Celebrates 5th Anniversary", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Bok-Homa-Casino-Celebrates-5th-Anniversary-363041141.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FED/FDB/FEDFDB6684684AFE8B73C0113105F8C2", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/64B/874/64B8743D0763415AB348303BC9D55A74.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Bok Homa Casino celebrated their 5th anniversary.", "title": "Bok Homa Casino Celebrates 5th Anniversary", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Bok-Homa-Casino-Celebrates-5th-Anniversary-363041141.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/casino23.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Bok Homa Casino Celebrates 5th Anniversary", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bok Homa Casino Celebrates 5th"}, "article_summary": "Cutting of the cake and people gathered around to celebrate the 5th anniversary of Bok Homa Casino.\nIt's actually up a little bit since opening year which is a really good sign for a casino,\" says Sonny Johnson, CEO of Pearl River Resort.\n\"It's a big contributor to Pearl River Resort up north and it does quite a bit for the tribe.\nSonny Johnson, CEO of Pearl River Resort says it not only contributes to Sandersville, but it also provides resources to the tribe.\nIt is a big economic boost to the sandersville area,\" says Johnson."}
