Increasingly, that\u2019s the approach taken by employers who are offering financial incentives for workers to take part in wellness programs that incorporate screenings that measure blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index, among other things.\n\nThe controversial programs are under fire from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed suit against Honeywell International in October charging, among other things, that the company\u2019s wellness program isn\u2019t voluntary. It\u2019s the third lawsuit filed by the EEOC in 2014 that takes aim at wellness programs and it highlights a lack of clarity in the standards these programs must meet in order to comply with both the 2010 health law and the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nHoneywell, based in Morristown, N.J., recently got a reprieve when a federal district court judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order preventing the company from proceeding with its wellness program incentives next year. But the issue is far from resolved, and the EEOC is continuing its investigations. Meanwhile, business leaders are criticizing the EEOC action, including a recent letter from the Business Roundtable to administration officials expressing \u201cstrong disappointment\u201d in the agency\u2019s actions.\n\nIn the Honeywell wellness program, employees and their spouses are asked to get blood drawn to test their cholesterol, glucose and nicotine use, as well as have their body mass index and blood pressure measured. If an employee refuses, he\u2019s subject to a $500 surcharge on health insurance and could lose up to $1,500 in Honeywell contributions to his health savings account. He and his spouse are also each subject to a $1,000 tobacco surcharge. That means the worker and his spouse could face a combined $4,000 in potential financial penalties.\n\n\u201cUnder the [Americans with Disabilities Act], medical testing of this nature has to be voluntary,\u201d the EEOC said in a press release announcing its request for an injunction. \u201cThe employer cannot require it or penalize employees who decide not to go through with it.\u201d\n\nHoneywell sees the situation differently. \u201cWellness is a win-win,\u201d says Kevin Covert, vice president and deputy general counsel for human resources at Honeywell. In time, the company expects to see lower claims costs while workers avoid health problems. Sixty-one percent of employees who participated in the company\u2019s screening last year reduced at least one health risk, he says.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Cost and Quality,Insurance,Insuring Your Health,Syndicate", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "The lawsuits brought by the commission, which have raised complaints from business leaders, highlight the lack of clarity in the standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act.", "title": "EEOC Takes Aim At Wellness Programs Increasingly Offered By Employers", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20141202/eeoc-takes-aim-at-wellness-programs-increasingly-offered-by-employers", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "The lawsuits brought by the commission, which have raised complaints from business leaders, highlight the lack of clarity in the standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "Increasingly, that\u2019s the approach taken by employers who are offering financial incentives for workers to take part in wellness programs that incorporate screenings that measure blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass index, among other things.\nThe controversial programs are under fire from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed suit against Honeywell International in October charging, among other things, that the company\u2019s wellness program isn\u2019t voluntary.\nIn the Honeywell wellness program, employees and their spouses are asked to get blood drawn to test their cholesterol, glucose and nicotine use, as well as have their body mass index and blood pressure measured.\nIt\u2019s the third lawsuit filed by the EEOC in 2014 that takes aim at wellness programs and it highlights a lack of clarity in the standards these programs must meet in order to comply with both the 2010 health law and the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.\nSixty-one percent of employees who participated in the company\u2019s screening last year reduced at least one health risk, he says."}
