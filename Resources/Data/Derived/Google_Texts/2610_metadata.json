Yet, he added, the new health care law \"is having a devastating impact. ... Something has to be done.\" | Read the full story | Related: Who will take the blame? | No resolution in sight | A government shutdown looks like this |Government shutdown coverage\n\n\n\nOberlin sued\n\nOhioans for Concealed Carry sued Oberlin on Tuesday, claiming the new law City Council passed last month involving the possession of guns in parks violates state statute.\n\nSuccess with glitches\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services acknowledged there were bumps in the roll-out of online exchanges designed help tens of millions of uninsured Americans buy health insurance.\n\nBobby Thompson trial\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were selected for the trial of Bobby Thompson.

Coach Rob Chudzinski told NFL Network at halftime that he feared Hoyer might have torn ligaments in the knee, which could end his season.\n\nAfter the game, Chudzinski said that Hoyer's injury was a sprain, and that he'll have an MRI on Friday. He would not elaborate on his halftime remarks that he feared torn ligaments.\n\nBut the never-say-die Browns put on a thrilling performance in Hoyer's absence, pulling away with Brandon Weeden at quarterback for the victory, their third straight. It improved the Browns to 3-2 and all alone in first in the AFC North -- at least for a few days. | Read the full story | Related: Jim Brown honored | Hoyer out for season with torn ACL\n\n\n\nMishandled case\n\nClaims that police botched sex crimes investigations are rolled into one civil case set for trial next year.

That's an aggressive schedule for an undertaking that involves three historic buildings and carries, if you include the new Cuyahoga County headquarters at East Ninth and Prospect Avenue, a $250 million price tag.\n\nA painful vacancy at one of downtown Cleveland's key corners, the complex -- which Geis recently started calling \"The 9\" -- could become a hub of activity, teeming with renters, shoppers and visitors. If the Geis Cos. are successful, the project won't just pay off for its investors. It will shore up a long-troubled intersection and help bolster the case for remaking other vacant or near-empty buildings nearby.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "week-in-review", "title": "U.S. government shuts down, Westlake vs. Cleveland water fight, shock jock indicted, Ameritrust complex makeover plans: Week In Review", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"U.S. government shuts down, Westlake vs. Cleveland water fight, shock jock indicted, Ameritrust complex makeover plans: Week In Review  \", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/10/westlake_vs_cleveland_water_fi.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain-dealer/photo/2013/10/13522080-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11367674\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-05T15:07:41Z\", \"author\": \"cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"week-in-review\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/photo/2013/10/13522080-small.jpg", "creator": "@clevelanddotcom", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Westlake and Cleveland go toe-to-toe over water services, Steelyard Commons to begin second, phases of construction, the United States government shuts down, Obamacare launches, the Indians are eliminated from the playoffs, shock jock \"Rover\" is indicted, West Side Market vendors' battle with the City of Cleveland over parking continues, and plans are announced for an Ameritrust complex makeover."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, October 14, 2013, 11:32 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/photo/2013/10/13522080-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"clevestaff\", \"author_nickname\": \"cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"1826839\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Metro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Westlake and Cleveland go toe-to-toe over water services, Steelyard Commons to begin second, phases of construction, the United States government shuts down, Obamacare launches, the Indians are eliminated from the playoffs, shock jock \"Rover\" is indicted, West Side Market vendors' battle with the City of Cleveland over parking continues, and plans are announced for an Ameritrust complex makeover.", "title": "U.S. government shuts down, Westlake vs. Cleveland water fight, shock jock indicted, Ameritrust complex makeover plans: Week In Review", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/10/westlake_vs_cleveland_water_fi.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, October 05, 2013, 11:00 AM", "article_author": "cleveland.com", "Description": "Westlake and Cleveland go toe-to-toe over water services, Steelyard Commons to begin second, phases of construction, the United States government shuts down, Obamacare launches, the Indians are eliminated from the playoffs, shock jock \"Rover\" is indicted, West Side Market vendors' battle with the City of Cleveland over parking continues, and plans are announced for an Ameritrust complex makeover."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7da8\"", "article_summary": "MONDAYWestlake residents and businesses to face steep fees for city's defection from Cleveland Water DepartmentWestlake residents likely will soon get slammed with an extra $291 on each quarterly water bill for the next five years to cover the cost of the suburb\u2019s defection from the Cleveland Water Department.\nObamacare FAQOn Tuesday, the roughly 1.7 million Ohioans who lack insurance could begin purchasing it through the government-operated marketplace.\nYet, vendors are still resisting a city of Cleveland plan to alleviate parking issues because they believe the city plan will hurt them more than help.\nDeveloper Greg Geis hopes to wrap up financing deals in November and push for an opening just a year later.\nIt will shore up a long-troubled intersection and help bolster the case for remaking other vacant or near-empty buildings nearby."}
