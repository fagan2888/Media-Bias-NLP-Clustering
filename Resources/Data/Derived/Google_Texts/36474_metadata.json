If you\u2019ve seen more people with doughnuts in hand than usual, it\u2019s not because they\u2019ve become the new best kept weight-loss secret \u2014 although that would be sweet \u2014 but because it\u2019s National Doughnut Day! Every first Friday in the month of June, most doughnut shops all across America give out free doughnuts (with no purchase necessary) to celebrate the Salvation Army workers, or \u201cDonut Lassies\u2019\u201d who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I. Celebrate this D-Day by having your doughnut and eating it, too, visiting these five locations without breaking your diet.\n\n1. Krispy Kreme\n\nAll hail the king of doughnut shops. This best-known national brand is handing out doughnuts today with no strings attached. You can take your pick of their extensive variety of doughnuts with no purchase necessary. Consider yourself lucky if you live by any Krispy Kreme location in the U.S., and indulge in a freshly made batch.\n\nHealthy option: Opt for their original glazed doughnut at just 190 calories. Not a fan of glaze? Their traditional cake doughnut is 190 calories, too.\n\n2. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\n\nKnown as America\u2019s fuel, with their tagline, \u201cAmerica Runs On Dunkin',\u201d this popular doughnut chain is participating on National Doughnut Day, but there\u2019s a catch. Each customer is eligible for a free doughnut, but with the purchase of any beverage. The company also notes this is \u201cwhile supplies last.\u201d A doughnut chain can really run out of doughnuts? Go figure.\n\nHealthy option: Choose the sugared cocoa \u201cdonut\u201d at only 200 calories.\n\n3. Tim Hortons\n\nNothing is more Canadian than celebrating National Doughnut Day in America than giving out free doughnuts on Friday. The Canadian business is offering one free \u201cdonut\u201d per guest, with any purchase made in any of their 800 restaurants in the U.S. There is also an official rule you must follow \u2014 customers must say, \u201cHappy National Donut Day.\u201d\n\nHealthy option: Select either the blueberry bloom donut, blueberry donut, or strawberry donut, all 230 calories each.\n\n4. Cumberland Farms\n\nThis minimart chain with more than 500 locations, mostly along the East Coast, is giving out one free donut per customer buying a coffee \u2014 either hot or iced \u2014 or a \u201cChill Zone\u201d beverage, such as a Slushie, all day today. These doughnuts are pretty high in calories, so consume at your own risk, especially if you\u2019re buying a coffee or getting a \u201cChill Zone\u201d beverage.\n\nHealthy option: Grab the old fashion donut coming in at just 240 calories.\n\n5. LaMar\u2019s Donuts\n\nThis Kansas City-based chain \u2014 with a couple dozen location in six states \u2014 is offering doughnuts with their policy, \u201cany donut with a hole, no purchase necessary.\u201d The company is encouraging people to make donations to the Salvation Army. After all, they did start the Donut Day tradition.\n\nHealthy option: Munch on Ray\u2019s original glazed at just 220 calories.\n\nRemember: These are the best lowest-calorie options found at these locations, meaning the least harmful to your health. Moderation is key in consumption.
