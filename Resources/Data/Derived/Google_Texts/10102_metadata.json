Pat Quinn and Republican challenger Bruce Rauner sharply clashed Tuesday night over who could better improve the lives of African Americans during a South Side debate focused on education, crime, jobs and taxes.\n\nRauner is trying to make gains among black voters who historically cast Democratic ballots in large numbers in Illinois. The idea come Nov. 4 is to get one-fifth of the Chicago vote, an essential element for Republican success statewide.\n\n\u201cGov. Quinn in my opinion is taking the African American vote for granted,\u201d said Rauner, going so far to say that the Democratic governor \u201ccould have and should have\u201d made Stephanie Neely, the black city treasurer of Chicago, his running mate but threw her \u201coff his ticket\u201d in favor of former Chicago Public Schools chief Paul Vallas.\n\n\u201cAfrican-American families are suffering in Illinois \u2014 brutally high unemployment, deteriorating schools, lack of proper social services and rampant cronyism and corruption that\u2019s taking away job opportunities from African Americans,\u201d Rauner said.\n\nBut Quinn, who is trying to keep his base of black support intact, contended Rauner had failed to hire any African Americans to top executive posts at the equity investment firm the Republican formerly chaired.\n\nQuinn said he has a diverse cabinet in his administration and has opened up more state contracts for bidding by African-American owned businesses.\n\nThe exchange came during a one-hour forum held at the DuSable Museum of African American History sponsored by the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council, an advocacy group for African American business owners and corporate executives. Broadcast on CBS-2 Chicago and WVON-Radio (AM-1690), the event was aimed at getting the candidates to address issues involving the African-American community, though many of the issues have statewide resonance.\n\nGov. Quinn in my opinion is taking the African American vote for granted. \u2014 Bruce Rauner\n\nQuinn mocked Rauner, a wealthy equity investor from Winnetka, for vowing to use his business moxie to grow the Illinois economy. \u201cAll my opponent does is grow his bank account and that hurts everyone,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nRauner lashed back at Quinn\u2019s negative advertising campaign against the Republican. \u201cI cannot keep up with the baloney and lies that you spread,\u201d Rauner said. \u201cYou can\u2019t run on the truth. The truth is you\u2019re the worst governor in America.\u201d\n\nThe two sharply differed on the issue of gun control and its relationship to crime.\n\nAsked if he supported a ban on so-called assault weapons, Rauner did not directly answer, instead saying \u201cthe most important thing we can do with guns is to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of criminals and (the) mentally ill.\u201d Crime in the black community was a result of a \u201clack of opportunity\u201d caused by Democratic failures to improve education and create jobs, he said.\n\nAll my opponent does is grow his bank account and that hurts everyone. \u2014 Gov. Pat Quinn\n\nBut Quinn said he supported an assault weapons ban as well as a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines \u2014 something unlikely to win approval in the General Assembly.\n\nThe Democrat charged that Rauner\u2019s support of lowering state income tax rates to their 2010 levels is \u201cextreme, radical way\u201d of budgeting that will cost the state billions in tax revenues \u2014 much of it for education. Quinn wants to make permanent the state income tax increase Democrats passed and he signed after the 2010 election \u2014 but refused to say directly if he would push for it, win or lose, in the post-election, lame-duck session. The bulk of the tax hike is scheduled to roll back on Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cI understand how important education is to our jobs,\u201d said the governor, who added that \u201cto have good jobs, you need a good education and that\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to.\u201d\n\nRauner has said he would increase school funding, but it\u2019s unclear how he would do so while cutting taxes. He also expressed support for giving parents \u201coptions\u201d to public schools, including charter schools, vouchers and scholarships.\n\nQuinn repeatedly cited his support for issues backed by hometown President Barack Obama, including the Affordable Care Act and a push for a higher minimum wage, as a way to enlist support among black voters. Obama made one fundraising visit for Quinn and is scheduled to appear at a rally on Sunday at Chicago State University, the governor said after the debate.\n\nRauner has said he would not have expanded subsidized health care coverage for the poor under what\u2019s known as Obamacare.\n\nThe minimum wage issue surfaced again, with Rauner questioning why Quinn and fellow Democrats haven\u2019t raised it since Quinn became governor in 2009.\n\nAsked why he had not used Democratic majorities in the House and Senate to increase the state\u2019s $8.25 an hour minimum wage to $10, Quinn cited the passage of Obamacare in noting \u201cthe president makes it very clear that we have to build from grassroots up\u201d to gain the votes for passage.\n\nQuinn promised he would sign a state minimum wage increase by the end of the year, anticipating a non-binding referendum on the issue on next month\u2019s ballot will be overwhelmingly supported.\n\nRauner early in his campaign advocated a rollback of the state\u2019s minimum wage rate to the lower $7.25-an-hour federal rate. Under fire from his GOP primary rivals, Rauner said he could support an increase in the federal rate or a boost in Illinois\u2019 rate accompanied by pro-business reforms. He promised to sign a state hike if lawmakers approved changes to help business involving lawsuits, workers\u2019 compensation and lowered taxes.\n\n\u201cThe minimum wage is a very important issue but what we need to focus on is maximum income, maximum opportunity for every family,\u201d Rauner said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Quinn, Rauner clash over African-American vote during debate", "Description": "Democratic Gov.
