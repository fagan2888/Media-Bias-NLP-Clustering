Even in the best of times, the songs tend to grate as the season chugs along. Add in a family death, job loss, illness or some other personal loss and they\u2019re downright vexatious.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Over the Rhine, the Ohio-based duo with the angel-voiced singers and virtuoso musicianship, is a study in seasonal sorrow. But they present a more, let\u2019s say realistic, view of the winter holidays than many other artists.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in the music business 25 years, it\u2019s important to play music you believe in,\u201d said Linford Detweiler, who, with Karin Bergquist, is the folk duo Over the Rhine, named for the Ohio area from which the two hail. \u201cWe feel we represent \u2018Reality Christmas.\u2019 In fact, we cornered the market. It\u2019s important to remember that the holidays are not an easy time of year for many people.\u201d\n\nThe majority of the nine tracks on the album were written by Mr. Detweiler and/or Ms. Bergquist, occasionally with other co-writers. A notable exception is their heartfelt cover of Merle Haggard\u2019s classic \u201cIf We Make It Through December.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the sorrowful points in Mr. Haggard\u2019s song, the tunes on Over the Rhine\u2019s latest release cover topics ranging from the perils of traveling to family holiday gatherings (\u201cBlood Oranges in the Snow\u201d) to the death of a parent (\u201cMy Father\u2019s Body\u201d) to the commercial offerings that stir extra sorrow into already sad seasons (\u201cFirst Snowfall\u201d).\n\nBut for all the melancholy of the songs, there are bright spots, including \u201cNew Year\u2019s Song,\u201d that includes the lyrics: \u201cLet\u2019s stay home and play old records/Our future\u2019s bright, our past is checkered/What do you say we lift a glass/Toast the ghost of another year past.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to scoff at an album that doesn\u2019t embrace the holy, jolly tones of traditional seasonal offerings, but Over the Rhine\u2019s \u201cReality Christmas\u201d is akin to a luxurious salve for those of us \u2014 likely many of us \u2014 that think we\u2019re alone as we review failed opportunities and losses during this supposedly joyous season.\n\nAnd those that attend the duo\u2019s concerts, as I did in Nashville, may well feel a swelling kinship with both artists as they interject wry humor and commentary into their sets.\n\n\u201cWe try to write songs that are about the important parts of all of our lives,\u201d said Ms. Bergquist as she and Mr. Detweiler sipped beverages and discussed their holiday music while sitting in a Nashville hotel restaurant. \u201cWe hope they find we express feelings and thoughts that they haven\u2019t heard articulated before.\u201d\n\nOver the Rhine with special guest Carolina Chocolate Drops\u2019 Dom Flemons, Tickets, $25-$28, 8 p.m., Wednesday, Dec. 5, The Barns at Wolf Trap, 1635 Trap Road, Vienna, Va. 1-877-WOLFTRAP; www.wolftrap.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the Rhine, the Ohio-based duo with the angel-voiced singers and virtuoso musicianship presents a more, let's say realistic, view of the winter holidays than many other artists.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Over the Rhine, the Ohio-based duo with the angel-voiced singers and virtuoso musicianship presents a more, let\u2019s say realistic, view of the winter holidays than many other artists.", "title": "COUNTRY TIMES: Over the Rhine offers \u2018Reality Christmas\u2019 music", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/1/country-times-over-the-rhine-offers-reality-christ/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/01/121_2014_overtherhinecolor2-8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/01/121_2014_overtherhinecolor2-8201.jpg", "description": "Over the Rhine, the Ohio-based duo with the angel-voiced singers and virtuoso musicianship presents a more, let's say realistic, view of the winter holidays than many other artists.", "card": "summary", "title": "COUNTRY TIMES: Over the Rhine offers \u2018Reality Christmas\u2019 m"}, "Author": "Nancy Dunham \u2014 Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Karin Bergquist, Linford Detweiler"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s not to say that Over the Rhine, the Ohio-based duo with the angel-voiced singers and virtuoso musicianship, is a study in seasonal sorrow.\nEven in the best of times, the songs tend to grate as the season chugs along.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:Martina McBride, Darius Rucker and Lady Antebellum are just a few of the country artists that have put their own perky marks on classic holiday tunes.\n\u201cWe feel we represent \u2018Reality Christmas.\u2019 In fact, we cornered the market.\nAdd in a family death, job loss, illness or some other personal loss and they\u2019re downright vexatious."}
