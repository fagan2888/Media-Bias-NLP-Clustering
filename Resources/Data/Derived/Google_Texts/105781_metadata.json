The capital markets \u2013 low interest rates and strong valuations \u2013 are creating favorable conditions for those considering selling or divesting assets.\"\n\nIn the KPMG M&A Outlook survey of 738 U.S.-based finance officers and M&A professionals covering a variety of industries, one-third said pharmaceuticals/biotechnology will be the most active industry for mergers and acquisitions in 2015, trailing only technology companies (47 percent). In addition, 27 percent saw healthcare providers as being ripe for consolidation, trailing only technology, pharmaceuticals and the oil & gas industry.\n\nLarge cash reserves and available credit are the biggest factors driving M&A overall and healthcare is no exception, according to KPMG survey respondents, who work as senior management at companies in an array of industries or as advisors in those sectors, including energy, consumer products, technology, manufacturing and financial services.\n\nAmong payers and providers, the biggest driver for M&A in 2015 is the response to the Affordable Care Act. Consolidation of core businesses and competition was also seen as a driver for M&A. Among pharmaceutical companies, the biggest drivers of M&A are patent expirations for many leading drugs and the need to hone product portfolios to build \"franchises in key treatment categories.\"\n\nThe biggest hurdle to healthcare transactions next year is the identification of suitable targets and regulatory factors, among the providers and payers, the survey said.\n\nDue diligence issues\n\nDespite an apparent eagerness to do deals, due diligence issues still arise, according to the survey. The assessment or volatility of future revenue streams was a larger issue for healthcare companies (58 percent) versus all industries (51 percent) and the cultural/HR assessment was a bigger factor for healthcare companies (32 percent) than industry averages (28 percent). While the quality of earnings was the third leading due diligence issue in the healthcare sector, it trailed the industry average for all sectors at 29 percent, compared with 42 percent.\n\n\"Mergers and acquisitions are never easy for everyone involved. Executing effectively on due diligence \u2013 while negotiating a favorable yet mutually acceptable set of transaction terms \u2013 is just the beginning of a successful acquisition process,\" Baker said. \"Managing the various stakeholders of ownership, employees, customers and vendors during an integration process can be daunting and, if not executed on properly, can destroy the very benefits the transaction was modeled on generating. Fundamentally, merging two companies can create tremendous upheaval affecting governance, finances, IT, operations, tax and human resources. It is imperative that the process is managed to make the transaction smoother and less disruptive.\"\n\nKPMG assists buyers and sellers among providers, payers, pharmaceutical firms, medical device makers, as well as investors, with a wide breadth of services, differentiated products and experience to help clients identify, evaluate and successfully implement growth strategies, including transactions, in today's market.\n\nAbout the 2015 M&A Outlook Survey\n\nIn collaboration with the Research practice unit of SourceMedia, the publisher of Mergers & Acquisitions, KPMG LLP surveyed 738 M&A professionals in September 2014.
