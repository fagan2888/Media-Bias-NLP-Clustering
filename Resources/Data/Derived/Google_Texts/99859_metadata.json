He privately dined with his nemesis, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who had berated him for mounting a filibuster over Obamacare funding that led to a 16-day government shutdown. And Cruz even allowed the Senate to leave early for its Martin Luther King Jr. Day recess by dropping demands for what would have been another futile attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: \u2018Clean\u2019 Debt Ceiling Bill Squeaks by House\n\nBut it was back to business as usual on Wednesday when Cruz temporarily blocked a final vote on a House-passed bill to raise the debt ceiling through March 2015 in a market-rattling performance. In so doing, he forced a dozen Republicans \u2013 including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn of Texas, the number two Republican -- to cast politically hazardous votes to break the gridlock and pass legislation.\n\nNobody likes to vote to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limits, because opponents can so easily point to them as evidence of profligate government spending. The national debt is now in excess of $17.2 trillion, and unless Congress approved new borrowing authority, the Treasury said it would begin defaulting on its obligations by the end of February.\n\nThe House on Tuesday approved a new debt ceiling bill after Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) gave up on efforts to add GOP demands to the legislation and stood back while the Democrats provided most of the votes for passage.\n\nRelated: The GOP Debt Ceiling Vote: Surrender or Strategy?\n\nAfter days of political drama over the debt ceiling in the House, many assumed the final vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate would be pro-forma. Instead, the Senate was trapped in an hour-long standoff precipitated by Cruz before Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) could amass 67 Democratic and Republican votes that were needed to cut off debate and proceed to the final vote.\n\n\u201cIt was painful to watch,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA) said after the final vote.\n\nAccording to an account by The Washington Post, \u201cAll the political unrest that has roiled the Republican Party in recent years\u2014the establishment vs. conservative outsiders who threaten incumbent Republicans with primary challenges from the right\u2014was on full display.\u201d\n\nAs he has repeatedly done before, the freshman Cruz placed himself in the thick of the debate by foiling a parliamentary agreement that McConnell and Reid had concocted that would have allowed a simple majority \u2013 meaning all the Democrats \u2013 to approve the new debt ceiling.\n\nRelated: GOP Completely Unleashes on Ted Cruz\n\nCruz objected \u2013 infuriating his Republican colleagues who wanted to move ahead with the inevitable, approve the bill and clear out of town before a heavy snow storm hit the East Coast. After the dust settled and the bill was finally approved on a party line vote of 55 to 43, Cruz thumbed his nose at McConnell and the other Republicans who had allowed the bill to come to a final vote.\n\n\u201cToday was a classic victory for Washington establishment interests, and the people who lost today are the American people,\u201d Cruz told reporters after the vote. He said he didn\u2019t regret forcing 12 Republicans \u2013 including McConnell and Cornyn -- into a vote that could hurt them with conservative voters in the upcoming GOP primaries.\n\nCruz also refused to say whether he supported McConnell\u2019s continued leadership of the Senate Republican conference. \u201cThat is ultimately a decision . . . for the voters of Kentucky,\u201d he said before slipping away in an elevator.\n\nRepublicans who have grown weary with Cruz\u2019s grandstanding had one more thing to hold against him by the end of the day.\n\n\u201cThere was no endgame there,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN). \u201cThere was no stated outcome by anyone other than a clean debt ceiling. We can put the country through two weeks of turmoil, or we can get this vote done.\u201d\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After battling with Senate Republicans for much of 2013, Sen.
