The case of a Connecticut family forced to pay a fee to be used to fund others\u2019 elective surgical abortions or face fines under Obamacare is the latest demonstration that the law is a Rube Goldberg machine of impenetrable statutory language designed to confuse.\n\nBarth and Abbie Bracy are pro-life Catholics living in Connecticut with their four children. Last fall, like millions of Americans, the family was informed that their health insurance plan was being cancelled \u201cdue to requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d But Good News! If they wanted to avoid thousands of dollars in fines over the next few years and provide for their family\u2019s healthcare they could just purchase a plan on the Connecticut exchange \u2013 the vaunted model of how an Obamacare exchange is supposed to function. But when the Bracy family investigated their options they couldn\u2019t find any plan that didn\u2019t both cover elective abortions and require a surcharge solely for that purpose.\n\nAs Executive Director of Rhode Island Right to Life, Barth has long warned that some exchanges may offer no plans without elective abortion and that Obamacare secrecy clauses forbid insurers or exchanges from telling customers the truth. Now it is personal.\n\nThere are no known abortion free plans on the Connecticut exchange. For the Bracys and every other consumer buying plans in Connecticut, this means that in order to buy an Obamacare-compliant exchange plan they will be required to pay a separate surcharge that the insurer must use solely to pay for abortions. There are indications that people seeking coverage on the exchanges in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wyoming may face the same dilemma. And every exchange (and insurer) is forbidden to answer the very basic questions of many prospective customers: (1) Does this plan cover abortion? And (2) How much would I be paying for others\u2019 abortions?\n\nThe abortion surcharge is the centerpiece of Obamacare defenders\u2019 claims that the law doesn\u2019t allow taxpayer funding of abortion. While federal subsidies offset the cost for much of the premiums for many Obamacare plans, the insurer must calculate the actuarial value of abortion in the plan and charge a separate surcharge to the insured. That abortion surcharge must be kept in a separate account and used exclusively to pay for abortions. However, the insurer is prohibited from ever disclosing how much the abortion surcharge is. They separate it out behind the curtain, but the customer whose money it is cannot be told how much of their premium goes into the abortion account and how much pays for everything else they actually want coverage for.\n\nAnd all of that deception comes after the exchange and the insurers are prohibited by law from telling a customer up front whether the plan even includes abortion at all.\n\nIt has been a successful deception. When Dr. James Dobson recently warned about abortion surcharges he was told by a Fox News interviewer \u201cthat didn\u2019t become law.\u201d The confusion is understandable. Even Supreme Court Justices and the Solicitor General have spoken about the possibility of compelled surgical abortion funding as a hypothetical under Obamacare instead of the current reality that it is.\n\nWhat could possibly be the purpose of such an intentionally confusing morass?\n\nObamacare would not be law today if subsidies directly paid for elective surgical abortions. Americans overwhelmingly oppose taxpayer funding of elective abortion. So instead, the law required that anyone with a plan that includes abortion must pay a special surcharge to be used to pay for abortions. But knowing that not only pro-lifers but even others who simply don\u2019t plan to have an abortion wouldn\u2019t willingly pick a plan charging this surcharge over plans without this extra fee, Obamacare\u2019s architects, including the abortionists themselves, wanted it all kept secret.\n\nBut while abortionists will profit, consumers on both sides of the abortion debate are hurt. Both women looking for an abortion-covering plan and pro-lifers looking to avoid paying for those same abortions are denied the information they seek. The Guttmacher Institute and NPR have both highlighted this problem from the perspective of women looking for abortion plans.\n\nBut our \u201cleaders\u201d have decided to keep us in the dark for our greater good. Nancy Pelosi famously said of Obamacare that we had to \u201cpass it to find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d She has been rightly pilloried for such a distorted view of how lawmaking is supposed to work. But it turns out that wasn\u2019t even honest.\n\nPelosi\u2019s intent was a promise that there would be time for detailed reading of the enormous bill after it passed. But that\u2019s cold comfort when the law is crafted specifically to ensure that we do NOT find out what\u2019s in it.\n\nLike so many other aspects of the law, the abortion surcharge for Obamacare exchange plans and the related secrecy provisions are like a shell game in which fundamental freedoms are the hidden ball.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 04 Jun 2014 06:26:18 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Like other aspects of the law, the abortion surcharge for Obamacare exchange plans are like a shell game in which fundamental freedoms are the hidden ball.", "title": "You Can't Keep Your Plan And You Have To Pay For Others' Abortions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_121241122.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/06/04/no-you-cant-keep-your-plan-and-yes-you-have-to-pay-for-other-peoples-abortions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Like other aspects of the law, the abortion surcharge for Obamacare exchange plans are like a shell game in which fundamental freedoms are the hidden ball.", "creator": "@CaseyMattox_", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_121241122.jpg"}, "title": "You Can't Keep Your Plan And You Have To Pay For Others' Abortions", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Abortion", "tag": "Abortion,Barth and Abbie Bracy,insurance exchanges,Obamacare,PPACA", "published_time": "2014-06-04T06:26:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Like other aspects of the law, the abortion surcharge for Obamacare exchange plans are like a shell game in which fundamental freedoms are the hidden ball."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a71\"", "article_summary": "So instead, the law required that anyone with a plan that includes abortion must pay a special surcharge to be used to pay for abortions.\nThat abortion surcharge must be kept in a separate account and used exclusively to pay for abortions.\nBut when the Bracy family investigated their options they couldn\u2019t find any plan that didn\u2019t both cover elective abortions and require a surcharge solely for that purpose.\nFor the Bracys and every other consumer buying plans in Connecticut, this means that in order to buy an Obamacare-compliant exchange plan they will be required to pay a separate surcharge that the insurer must use solely to pay for abortions.\nThe Guttmacher Institute and NPR have both highlighted this problem from the perspective of women looking for abortion plans."}
