Following up on last year’s bit that went viral, “Obamacare By Morning,” artists Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley delved into politics again at Wednesday’s Country Music Awards to explain why the Democratic Party lost control of the U.S. Senate.

And the crowd loved it!

The country music superstars started out by taking a jab at a “feisty nurse in Maine,” a reference to the nurse who refused to be quarantined after treating victims of Ebola in West Africa

“Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine — what part of ‘stay inside’ don’t you understand?” they sang.

The superstars then took a swipe at Taylor Swift, who let it be known recently that she was foregoing country music in favor of pop music.

“Why isn’t our government doing something about this?” Paisley asked. “I’ll be the first one to say it: President Obama does not care about Post-Partum Taylor Swift Disorder.”

“I’m pretty sure that’s why the Democrats lost the Senate,” Underwood quipped.

Based on the audience’s reaction, if this singing thing doesn’t pan out, Underwood and Paisley should give comedy a try.

But then, that was evident with the popularity of last year’s hilarious spoof on the disastrous rollout of the Obamacare website.

“I started signing up last Thursday and I’m almost done,” Underwood said then, before she and Paisley started singing “Obamacare By Morning” to the tune of country music legend George Strait’s “Amarillo By Morning.”
