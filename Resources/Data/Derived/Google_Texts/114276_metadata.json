Barely two hours after President Barack Obama\u2019s dramatic announcement Wednesday in Washington, both MLB and its players\u2019 union acknowledged as much in statements.\n\n\u201cWe will keep our clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to Cuba,\u201d MLB said.\n\n\u201cWe remain hopeful that today\u2019s announcement will lead to further positive developments,\u201d the union said.\n\nLet\u2019s hope so, considering how few positive developments have occurred before now. There were 25 Cuban-born players in the big leagues this past season, the best of which is arguably Los Angeles Dodgers star Yasiel Puig. The story of how he finally got there, after four failed attempts to leave Cuba, involved a boat trip, a detour where he was held hostage in a Mexican motel room, repeated extortion threats and crossing the U.S. border illegally.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Florida businessman Gilberto Suarez pleaded guilty for his role in the conspiracy to smuggle Puig out in return for a sizable cut of his multimillion-dollar salary.\n\nSuarez was the second man this year to enter a guilty plea related to the smuggling of a Cuban baseball player into the U.S. Last month, 41-year-old Eliezer Lazo was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison for conspiring to smuggle 1,000 Cubans, among them Texas Rangers outfielder Leonys Martin. Sadly, stories like Puig\u2019s unsavory and sometimes life-threatening journey differs from so many others only in the details.\n\nCuba has been turning out world-class athletes \u2014 and not just ballplayers \u2014 for more than a century. But since the 1959 revolution, most have stayed put.\n\nTrack stars and multiple medalists such as Alberto Juantorena and Javier Sotomayor took star turns on the Olympic stage, but never reaped rewards that were commensurate with their talents. So, too, did heavyweights Teofilo Stevenson and Felix Savon, two of only three boxers to win gold medals at three Olympics and considered among the greatest amateurs ever. But neither turned pro.\n\nStevenson was so smooth that a fight against Muhammad Ali was often hyped and loudly debated when both were near their prime, but never came off. And some boxing observers think Savon, who succeeded Stevenson, was definitely the better of the two.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Column: Thaw in US-Cuba relations warms up MLB", "title": "Column: Thaw in US-Cuba relations warms up MLB", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Column: Thaw in US-Cuba relations warms up MLB", "title": "Column: Thaw in US-Cuba relations warms up MLB", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/18/column_thaw_in_us_cuba_relations_warms_up_mlb/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/mlb-cuba-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Column: Thaw in US-Cuba relations warms up MLB", "title": "Column: Thaw in US-Cuba relations warms up MLB", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/mlb-cuba-baseball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Litke", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1955\"", "article_summary": "Barely two hours after President Barack Obama\u2019s dramatic announcement Wednesday in Washington, both MLB and its players\u2019 union acknowledged as much in statements.\nOn Tuesday, South Florida businessman Gilberto Suarez pleaded guilty for his role in the conspiracy to smuggle Puig out in return for a sizable cut of his multimillion-dollar salary.\nAnd some boxing observers think Savon, who succeeded Stevenson, was definitely the better of the two.\nThere were 25 Cuban-born players in the big leagues this past season, the best of which is arguably Los Angeles Dodgers star Yasiel Puig.\n\u201cWe will keep our clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to Cuba,\u201d MLB said."}
