In 2015, CMS raised the payout rate from 80% to 100% after insurers' contributions exceeded reinsurance payments the year prior, according to a CMS memo.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs part of the reinsurance program, insurers and self-funded plans contribute funds to a pool, which the federal government then pays out to the health plans with members that had medical claims exceeding $45,000 but were less than $250,000. For the 2014 benefit year, CMS paid out $7.9 billion.\n\nThe CMS has collected $5.5 billion for reinsurance so far this year, and is scheduled to collect another $1 billion by November. About $1.7 billion in unused reinsurance contributions will be carried over from the 2015 benefit year, though $500 million in operating expenses is legally required to go to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe payouts will be much needed for some insurers, like Blue Cross Blue Shield, that have reported significant financial losses, which they attribute to the ACA, Healthcare Dive previously reported.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nModern Healthcare: CMS readies $7.7 billion for ACA reinsurance payouts", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ana Mulero", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/15/a9/15a96bbce29f1f6ff6e922ab17900e6c.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "CMS to pay $7.7B for ACA reinsurance payouts", "pub_date": "feb 16, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-16T09:13:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Tuesday, February 16, 2016, 09:13 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-02-03T09:13:00", "teaser": "<p>The money&nbsp;will certainly&nbsp;be needed for&nbsp;ACA plan carriers&nbsp;that took on&nbsp;a large number of high-cost members.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-02-16", "sailthru.description": "The money\u00a0will certainly\u00a0be needed for\u00a0ACA plan carriers\u00a0that took on\u00a0a large number of high-cost members.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "The money\u00a0will certainly\u00a0be needed for\u00a0ACA plan carriers\u00a0that took on\u00a0a large number of high-cost members.", "title": "CMS to pay $7.7B for ACA reinsurance payouts", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cms-to-pay-77b-for-aca-reinsurance-payouts/413947/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/pay2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/34/84/34848163b190d4c81ff881eaf5a6be86.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingModern Healthcare: CMS readies $7.7 billion for ACA reinsurance payouts\nDive Brief:Last week, the CMS released a memo that said they expect to pay a total of $7.7 billion this year in Medicare reinsurance payouts, reflecting data from the 2015 benefit year.\nThe CMS has collected $5.5 billion for reinsurance so far this year, and is scheduled to collect another $1 billion by November.\nIn 2015, CMS raised the payout rate from 80% to 100% after insurers' contributions exceeded reinsurance payments the year prior, according to a CMS memo.\nUnder the Medicare reinsurance program, the money would go to insurers that sold plans on ACA exchanges last year and enrolled a large number of high-cost members, Modern Healthcare reports."}
