To fund anything, in this case Obamacare, first approval is required by the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that does not happen taxpayer money cannot be spent. The people, through their representatives to Congress, have determined, after a three-year closer scrutiny of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), that it does not protect the patient, is not affordable and is not even workable; hence in the interests of the vast majority of the people needs to be defunded.\u201d\n\nWhen the United States Supreme Court ruled on Obamacare in 2012, Chief Justice Roberts stance on Obamacare coincides with the intent of the U.S. Constitution, explained by Pease, and the powers between the House and Senate.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Obamacare cannot be implemented and is not considered the law of the land, contrary to Democrat claims.\n\nBubba Atkinson of the Independent Journal Review, citing conservative blogger, I.M. Citizen, wrote, \u201cChief Justice Roberts actually ruled the mandate, relative to the commerce clause, was unconstitutional. That is how the Democrats got Obama-care going in the first place. This is critical. His ruling means Congress can\u2019t compel American citizens to purchase anything, ever. The notion is now officially and forever, unconstitutional. As it should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext, he stated that, because Congress doesn\u2019t have the ability to mandate, it must, to fund Obama-care, rely on its power to tax. Therefore, the mechanism that funds Obama-care is a tax,\u201d said Atkinson. \u201cHe struck down as unconstitutional, the Obama-care idea that the federal government can bully states into complying by yanking their existing medicaid funding. Liberals, through Obama-care, basically said to the states \u2014 \u201ccomply with Obama-care or we will stop existing funding.\u201d Roberts ruled that is a no-no.\u201d\n\nWhen the House attached Obamacare to the legislation in funding the government, it made a mistake in doing so and the funding of Obamacare should have been separate, thereby giving the Senate no power in denying the Houses\u2019 request to defund Obamacare.\n\nPease said, \u201cHouse opposition to funding Obamacare would have been far more powerful if made a \u201cstand alone\u201d bill not attached to general funding, but it is not. \u201cStand alone,\u201d having no other parts, would have left the Senate no wiggle or compromise room once it went to them, nor would there be for the Joint Conference Committee thereafter that reconciles any differences between the two houses. There would be nothing to reconcile, Obamacare is merely defunded.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, the intent of the Founding Fathers was to give the people, through their House of Representatives, the power collectively to say no to any proposed federal tax, which she is decidedly doing.\u201d\n\n[Edited for clarity] If Obamacare is removed from the government budget, presented, and voted on as a separate bill, Obamacare can be defunded by the House. If that is the case, then the Senate and the President can vote yes or no and if the vote is no, then the Obamacare bill can sit in the House with no funding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the House passed legislation to defund ObamaCare but would keep the government running through mid-December, the Senate, led by Senate Majority Leader, Sen", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/obamacare-can-be-defunded-without-senate-approval", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/58/2b/582bb57592a741c9c0b7eb898e784edf.jpg?itok=k-emQzp2", "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare can be defunded without Senate approval"}, "twitter": {"description": "When the House passed legislation to defund ObamaCare but would keep the government running through mid-December, the Senate, led by Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) stated that they", "creator": "@PCGOPExaminer", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/58/2b/582bb57592a741c9c0b7eb898e784edf.jpg?itok=k-emQzp2", "title": "Obamacare can be defunded without Senate approval", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-10-02T13:01:18-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government Topics, Obamacare, Government, Harold Pease, House, Constitution", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd870f\"", "article_summary": "When the House passed legislation to defund ObamaCare but would keep the government running through mid-December, the Senate, led by Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) stated that they would not budge on Obamacare and the legislation was defeated.\nTo fund anything, in this case Obamacare, first approval is required by the House of Representatives.\u201d\u201cIf that does not happen taxpayer money cannot be spent.\nPease said, \u201cHouse opposition to funding Obamacare would have been far more powerful if made a \u201cstand alone\u201d bill not attached to general funding, but it is not.\n\u201cHe struck down as unconstitutional, the Obama-care idea that the federal government can bully states into complying by yanking their existing medicaid funding.\nLiberals, through Obama-care, basically said to the states \u2014 \u201ccomply with Obama-care or we will stop existing funding.\u201d Roberts ruled that is a no-no.\u201dWhen the House attached Obamacare to the legislation in funding the government, it made a mistake in doing so and the funding of Obamacare should have been separate, thereby giving the Senate no power in denying the Houses\u2019 request to defund Obamacare."}
