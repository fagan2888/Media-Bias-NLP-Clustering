Christopher Testani for The Wall Street Journal, Food Styling by Heather Meldrom, Prop Styling by Stephanie Hanes\n\n\"I'M VERY CAREFUL about buying fish,\" said Meeru Dhalwala. \"I don't want my karma affected by the fact that we have messed up the oceans.\" For her first Slow Food Fast contribution, Ms. Dhalwala has selected halibut, which is sustainably caught in the Pacific Northwest, where she has three restaurants. Rubbed with ancho chili and cayenne, the flaky white fish is steamed and topped with a cauliflower curry enriched with yogurt.\n\nThe Chef: Meeru Dhalwala ENLARGE Meeru Dhalwala Illustration by Michael Hoeweler for The Wall Street Journal Her Restaurants: Vij's and Rangoli, both in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Shanik in Seattle, Wash. What She's Known For: Raising the bar for Indian cooking in North America with impeccably sourced ingredients and creative takes on classic dishes.\n\nLike many of Ms. Dhalwala's recipes, this one is rooted in the culinary traditions of India, where she was born, but it does not reference any particular region. \"I'm not afraid to blur boundaries and break rules,\" the chef said. \"My mother would never have mixed fish and dairy, for example. But I find that a little a bit of yogurt adds a nice tartness.\"\n\nThat's not to say this recipe is imprecise when it comes to technique. \"You must massage the oil into the fish so the spices really stick,\" Ms. Dhalwala advised. \"That is very important.\" When preparing the curry, take the time to fry the spices and build a base of flavor before adding the yogurt and cauliflower. \"Spices must be cooked in oil or butter. It wakes them up,\" Ms. Dhalwala said. \"With Indian cooking you can't be afraid of oil, and you can't be afraid of spices.\" In this case, the result is a dish that more than does justice to all of its ingredients.\n\n\u2014Kitty Greenwald\n\nChili-Rubbed Halibut With Cauliflower Curry\n\nTotal Time: 35 minutes Serves: 4-6\n\n3 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil, plus \u2153 cup\n\n2 teaspoons salt\n\n2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons ground ancho chili or red pepper flakes\n\n1\u00bd pounds boneless halibut or sablefish, skin on, cut into 2\u00bd -inch dice\n\n1\u00bd cups finely sliced red onions\n\n1 tablespoon peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger\n\n\u2154 cup canned tomato pur\u00e9e\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons ground turmeric\n\n1\u00bd tablespoons ground cumin\n\n3 pieces whole star anise\n\n\u2153 cup full-fat plain yogurt, plus extra for garnish (optional)\n\n2 cups water\n\n1 medium head cauliflower, cut into individual florets\n\nCilantro leaves, for garnish\n\nChopped scallions, for garnish\n\nNaan bread or cooked basmati rice, for serving\n\n1.
