BOULDER — After focusing primarily on individual drills during the first two practices, Colorado mixed in more team drills Monday that resulted in a more physically demanding session.

Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre was pleased with the way his players “pushed through it.” Players wore shoulder pads so there was some hitting above the waist. The first practice in full pads is Thursday.

“I thought our players competed well today, they got after it,” MacIntyre said. “We did a lot more aggressive team work. It taxed them a little bit. But I was pleased with the way they competed.”

MacIntyre praised the leadership of CU’s seniors, including cornerback Greg Henderson and safety Jered Bell.

“I put a lot on the seniors, to make sure they are (setting an example by) doing the right things, and if they see a young player in the locker room who’s down (emotionally), they go over and talk to him,” MacIntyre said. “Those two guys are good at that, they really do. They’re real personable. They’re just quiet by nature.”

Sophomore linebacker Addison Gillam, a team captain, sat out the morning practice with a virus. MacIntyre said Gillam lost five pounds on Sunday and then three more overnight. “We took him back (to the training room) to get fluids,” the coach said.

Bell dinged an elbow but MacIntyre did not believe it to be serious.
