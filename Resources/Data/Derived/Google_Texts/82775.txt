Boeing Co.’s $95 billion of orders for its planned 777X jetliners ensures healthy demand for the planned new model when it starts deliveries in 2020. But first Boeing needs to keep its production lines churning for six years building the current version of the jet.

Car dealers often have year-end sales to clear old models from their lots before the next year’s crop arrives. For Boeing, the challenge is a bit different: it needs to keep customers buying the old models for several years to generate revenue while the new model is designed, produced and gets up to speed.

At the end of October, Boeing held 326 orders for the current 777s. It’s currently building about 100 a year. So to keep production levels where they are today over the rest of the decade, it would need about 300 more orders.

Each 777-300ER, its largest twin-engine jetliner–and the most popular version of the current 777–generates $166 million in revenue for Boeing, according to aviation consultancy AVITAS. It is the backbone of Boeing’s commercial profitability. The jet has a list price of $320 million, before discounts.

The current jet is built on a moving assembly line in Everett, Wash., that is widely considered one of the most efficient factories in the world. That efficiency, built up over two decades, has allowed Boeing to sell the 386-seat 777-300ERs more aggressively, while still maintaining a strong profit margin.

Plane makers call the gap between when they announce a new version of a jetliner and when they stop producing its predecessor the “production bridge.” Boeing has faced a similar issue with its 737 Max, a new version of its popular single-aisle that is due in 2017.

Airlines historically have seized on the ability to negotiate good prices for the end-of-the-line models during the production bridge. Low cost European carrier Ryanair, for example, negotiated a sizable deal this year on 175 current generation 737s, which stretch through to 2019, and are seen as some of the last of the current generation to be delivered.

Boeing has received 42 orders in 2013 for the current generation 777, enough for about five months of production, but its 100-per-year output continues to burn through its backlog.

“We aren’t sharing any details of the [777 production bridge] plan yet,” a Boeing spokesman said in an emailed statement.

One tactic Boeing has used to cross the production bridge for the 737 Max has been to pair some of its large deals for the Max with smaller orders for current 737s. But the initial orders for the 777X announced on Sunday from Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways didn’t include orders for older 777s. Indeed, Emirates is ordering the new planes to replace its older existing 777s and grow further.

The Middle East carriers are expanding aggressively. Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group aviation consultancy, says that adds to the difficulties for Boeing, in that those Middle East carriers “are taking traffic away from the folks who would be natural candidates for 777 bridge orders.” Mr. Aboulafia says the current 777 production rate is going to be hard to maintain.

Possible customers for the existing 777 could include current 777 operators, Turkish Airlines, listed as Turk Hava Yollari, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Singapore Airlines Ltd., Korean Air Lines Co., American Airlines parent AMR Corp. and All Nippon Holdings Inc.

Complicating things further for Boeing is that Airbus’s direct competitor to the 777-300ER, the A350-1000, is due in 2017 and touts 25% better fuel efficiency than Boeing’s current model. Many of Boeing’s current 777 customers have opted for the new Airbus model in the second half of the decade, making it potentially harder for Boeing to capture new orders during that period. Airbus is a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.

With the larger sizing of its A350, Airbus has avoided the need for a similar production bridge on its smaller twin-engine A330, but also has no natural successor. It recently launched a shorter-range version of the A330 that seats around 400, and another that extends its range. The A330, which is slightly smaller than the 777, is able to sell at steep discounts, often touting prices that the European airplane maker claims makes them cheaper to operate than the competing 787 Dreamliner, even with Boeing’s touted 20% better fuel efficiency.
