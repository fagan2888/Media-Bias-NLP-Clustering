That was nearly twice the rate of states that have not fully implemented the law.\n\nPercentage of adults ages 19-64 who had medical bill problems or medical debt in the previous year\n\nThe increases in coverage also are improving access, other research indicates.\n\nA study of billing data published last month by researchers at Quest Diagnostics found that the number of Medicaid patients with newly identified diabetes surged 23% from 2013 to 2014 in states that expanded their programs, while there was virtually no increase in states that declined to expand coverage.\n\nCommonwealth Fund researchers looked at patients' own descriptions of their healthcare experiences in a 2014 national survey that the fund conducted on health insurance coverage.\n\nThe problems in Texas and Florida, which have among the highest rates of uninsured in the country, were widespread.\n\nMore than 40% of residents of the two states reported that they did not go to the doctor when they were sick, didn't fill a prescription, didn't see a needed specialist or skipped a recommended test or treatment in the previous year.\n\nThe same proportion reported they had been unable to pay a medical bill, had been contacted by a collection agency over a medical bill, had had to change their way of life to pay bills or had medical debt.\n\nBy contrast, just 31% of Californians and 30% of New Yorkers reported the same access problems. Even fewer said they had the same struggles with medical bills.\n\nResearchers noted that a variety of factors may help explain these differences.\n\nInsurance policies in Florida and Texas tend to have higher cost-sharing requirements, for example, which probably feed consumers' billing challenges in those states.\n\nInsured Californians and New Yorkers were half as likely as insured Texans and Floridians to report having health plans with deductibles that were at least 5% of their income, according to another survey. People with higher deductibles are more likely to report not getting needed care.\n\nBut the large differences in insurance coverage between the states probably explains much of the disparities in access, said Sara Collins, a Commonwealth Fund vice president and one of the study's authors.\n\nThirty percent of working-age Texans and 21% of working-age Floridians were uninsured in 2014, according to the study. By contrast, 17% of working-age Californians and 12% of working-age New Yorkers were without coverage last year.\n\n\"We know that increasing coverage improves people's ability to get access to medical coverage,\" Collins said.\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Four largest states have sharp disparities in access to healthcare", "date": "2015-04-10", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The national divide over the Affordable Care Act is beginning to affect Americans' access to medical care and perhaps even their ability to pay medical bills, a new study of the country's four largest states suggests.", "title": "Four largest states have sharp disparities in access to healthcare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-obamacare-states-disparity-20150410-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552719c3/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-states-disparity-20150410", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare, Affordable Care Act, Commonwealth Fund, Medicaid, California, Florida, New York, Texas", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83259545", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "healthcare, Affordable Care Act, Commonwealth Fund, Medicaid, California, Florida, New York, Texas", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The national divide over the Affordable Care Act is beginning to affect Americans' access to medical care and perhaps even their ability to pay medical bills, a new study of the country's four largest states suggests.
