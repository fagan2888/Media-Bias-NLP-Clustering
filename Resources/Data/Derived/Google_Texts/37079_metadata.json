Howard County does not charge a specific ambulance fee but has a separate tax for fire department and rescue services.\n\nBaltimore City has charged for ambulance rides since 1989.\n\n\"Across the country, it's become a standard and accepted procedure for fire departments to seek reimbursement from insurers and from Medicare and Medicaid,\" said Elise Armacost, a county Fire Department spokeswoman.\n\n\"We were out of step with just about everybody else on this issue,\" she said.\n\nBaltimore County's fire service includes career and volunteer stations. In recent years, the Baltimore County Volunteer Firemen's Association has advocated changing the ambulance policy, arguing that the county was turning away millions in revenue from insurance payouts by not charging a fee. Ambulance service costs are now paid through the county's general fund.\n\nArmacost said county officials still believe emergency medical care is a fundamental service to taxpayers. Patients who live in the county but who don't have insurance \u2014 or whose insurance companies refuse to pay \u2014 will not be charged, officials said. Bills will be sent directly to insurance companies after a patient has been treated.\n\n\"No county resident will pay one penny out of his or her own pocket for ambulance service,\" county fire Chief John J. Hohman said in a statement Monday.\n\nNoncounty residents, however, will be billed if their insurance doesn't cover the ambulance fee.\n\nIn a statement, County Executive Kevin Kamenetz said with more people having insurance because of the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 and more insurance companies willing to pay the ambulance fees directly \u2014 it makes sense for the county to begin billing insurance companies.\n\n\"It is only fair to our citizens and our EMS providers that we bring ourselves in line with this now accepted practice and try to recoup some of these transport costs from insurers,\" Kamenetz said in a statement.\n\nNeither Hohman nor Kamenetz were available Monday for additional comment.\n\nBaltimore County Councilman Julian Jones \u2014 a Woodstock Democrat who is a division chief in Anne Arundel County's Fire Department \u2014 said he was initially opposed to ambulance fees but has changed his mind as he's seen county after county adopt them.\n\nIn Anne Arundel, for example, fees were raised last year from $500 to $700 and $750.\n\n\"When these first started, I was against it. I thought taxpayer dollars paid for the services,\" Jones said. \"I didn't want people afraid to call 911.\"\n\nBut he said the fees are more palatable because insurance companies usually pay them and because most counties engage in \"soft billing\" \u2014 not pursuing collection from people who can't pay.\n\n\"Everybody around us is collecting these fees, so now it becomes a thing of Baltimore County leaving somewhere around $26 million on the table,\" Jones said.\n\nJones said insurance companies already factor in ambulance fees when calculating rates because most jurisdictions charge them, and he doesn't expect residents' insurance premiums to go up because of the policy change.\n\nHe said he wouldn't support the proposal if he \"thought for one minute that insurance companies would raise their rates.\"\n\nThe County Council must approve the two-year contract with a vendor that will process the payments, in exchange for 4 percent to 4.75 percent of the money collected. Council members will discuss the contract at a July 28 work session, with a vote scheduled for Aug. 3. The fees are scheduled to go into effect Sept. 1.\n\nThe county responds to about 85,000 calls requiring ambulance service each year, according to county officials.\n\nMoney collected from fees will go into the county's general fund, with some directed to volunteer fire companies to help pay for the cost of providing emergency medical and ambulance service. Details have not been worked out, Armacost said.\n\nA report issued in a December by a consultant hired by the volunteer firemen's association suggested that charging ambulance fees could raise more than $35 million based on a $1,000 fee collected from two-thirds of all ambulance trips.\n\nJohn McDowell, president of the volunteer fireman's association, said he was \"pleasantly surprised\" when he learned a few weeks ago the county decided to charge the fees, and is glad volunteer stations will get at least some of the money.\n\n\"It goes a long way to helping the volunteers put more medics on the street,\" he said.\n\nThe report also described financial and staffing issues at several volunteer stations, and suggested closing some stations and merging others.\n\nBaltimore Sun researcher Paul McCardell contributed to this article.\n\npwood@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/pwoodreporter", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Baltimore County to charge for ambulance rides; change could raise $26M annually", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "Baltimore County plans to begin charging fees for ambulance rides \u2014 reversing a policy that for years has set the county apart from nearly every other jurisdiction in Maryland and many across the country.", "title": "Baltimore County to charge for ambulance rides; change could raise $26M annually", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-county/towson/bs-md-co-ambulance-fees-20150720-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ad30c0/turbine/bs-md-co-ambulance-fees-20150720", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Baltimore County Fire Department, ambulance, EMS", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/84034878", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-20", "Description": "Baltimore County's Fire Department will start charging for taking people to the hospital by ambulance -- a fee that will be collected from a patient's insurance company.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Baltimore County Fire Department, ambulance, EMS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a45\"", "article_summary": "Howard County does not charge a specific ambulance fee but has a separate tax for fire department and rescue services.\nThe county responds to about 85,000 calls requiring ambulance service each year, according to county officials.\nThe report also described financial and staffing issues at several volunteer stations, and suggested closing some stations and merging others.\nHe said he wouldn't support the proposal if he \"thought for one minute that insurance companies would raise their rates.\"\n\"No county resident will pay one penny out of his or her own pocket for ambulance service,\" county fire Chief John J.
