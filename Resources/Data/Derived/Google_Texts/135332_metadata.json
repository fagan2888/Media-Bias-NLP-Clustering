At the same time, hospitals earned $70 million more from investments, charitable contributions and other sources of revenue.\n\nThe new data show that the seven hospitals with operating losses were: Hartford, Windham, New Milford, Connecticut Children's, John Dempsey, Johnson Memorial and Milford. When non-operating gains and losses were factored in, five hospitals \u2013 all of them smaller -- ended the year in the red: Windham, New Milford, Milford, Johnson and Manchester. Three of those hospitals are part of larger health networks, while Johnson and Milford hospitals are freestanding.\n\nOHCA cited Milford Hospital as of \"particular concern\" because it had run deficits every year for the last six years. It also noted that Windham has had a negative total margin in each of the last five years -- despite its affiliation with the Hartford Health Care Corp. network in 2009. Windham had positive financial outcomes in the four years preceding that affiliation, the report says.\n\nStephen Frayne, senior vice president for health policy for the Connecticut Hospital Association, said that hospitals generally need to clear at least a 4 percent profit from operations to be able to keep up with infrastructure, technological and other improvements. Statewide, hospitals cleared an average operating profit of 3.15 percent in 2013, with only 12 of the 29 hospitals hitting the 4 percent target.\n\nFrayne cited reductions in state Medicaid funding as a key reason why operating gains had fallen. In the 2013 fiscal year, hospitals paid about $350 million in state taxes and received back about $323 million \u2013 a cut of $76 million from the prior year. In 2014, state reimbursement fell by another $74 million, he said. Cuts to the federal Medicare program in 2013 also impacted hospital revenue.\n\n\"You just start layering these things in, year after year, and it's bound to have a deleterious effect on hospitals,\" Frayne said. \"Unfortunately, the results we're seeing are not surprising.\"\n\nFrayne said it was too soon to say whether hospitals that are part of larger networks would have an easier time facing financial challenges than stand-alone facilities. Of the 12 hospitals that had operating profits exceeding 4 percent, eight were part of networks, including all three of the Yale system hospitals \u2013 Bridgeport, Greenwich and Yale-New Haven.\n\nEleven hospitals reported a larger total margin last year than in the prior year. The report notes, \"This result is in stark contrast to the improvement between FY 2011 and FY 2012, when three-quarters of hospitals reported stronger total margins.\"\n\nIn terms of operating surpluses, Yale-New Haven had the largest dollar gain -- $104.8 million \u2013 followed by Bridgeport, Stamford and St. Vincent's hospitals, which each had operating surpluses exceeding $30 million. Waterbury Hospital, which is expected to be taken over by a for-profit Texas hospital chain, had a $3.5 million operating surplus.\n\nThe report shows a slight decline in emergency department utilization, which had increased in 2012. Emergency room visits dropped by 33,000 in 2013, leveling off at about 1.7 million.\n\nSome health care experts have predicted that the federal Affordable Care Act would reduce emergency room visits by linking newly insured residents with community providers. But others have said the insurance expansion could generate more traffic to emergency rooms if newly insured people can't access primary care providers.\n\nA link to the full report :\n\nhttp://www.ct.gov/dph/lib/dph/ohca/hospitalfillings/2013/fsreport_fy2013_final.pdf\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Operating Profits Drop At State Hospitals: New Report", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Connecticut's acute-care hospitals saw gains from their operations tumble 35 percent in the last fiscal year, with seven of 29 hospitals reporting operating losses, according to a new state report.", "title": "Operating Profits Drop At State Hospitals: New Report", "url": "http://www.courant.com/health/hc-hospital-profits-20141208-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5485e267/turbine/hc-hospital-profits-20141208", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Hospitals, healthcare, medicine, Connecticut, John Dempsey hospital, Yale-New Haven hospital", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/82223482", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-08", "Description": "Connecticut's acute-care hospitals saw gains from their operations tumble 35 percent in the last fiscal year, with seven of 29 hospitals reporting operating losses, according to a new state report.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Hospitals, healthcare, medicine, Connecticut, John Dempsey hospital, Yale-New Haven hospital"}, "article_summary": "Connecticut's acute-care hospitals saw gains from their operations tumble 35 percent in the last fiscal year, with seven of 29 hospitals reporting operating losses, according to a new state report.\nThree of those hospitals are part of larger health networks, while Johnson and Milford hospitals are freestanding.\nOHCA cited Milford Hospital as of \"particular concern\" because it had run deficits every year for the last six years.\nWhen non-operating gains and losses were factored in, five hospitals \u2013 all of them smaller -- ended the year in the red: Windham, New Milford, Milford, Johnson and Manchester.\nWaterbury Hospital, which is expected to be taken over by a for-profit Texas hospital chain, had a $3.5 million operating surplus."}
