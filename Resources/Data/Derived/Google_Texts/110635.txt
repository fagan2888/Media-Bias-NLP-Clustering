Canberra FC remains in the hunt for the league championship after easily disposing of Woden Valley 5-1 at Deakin Stadium on Saturday.

Four goals in the first half were followed by debutant Anthony Giorgi scoring in the 90th minute of the Canberra National Premier League encounter.

Canberra FC has now moved to the top of the table on 25 points alongside Belconnen United, which has a game in hand.

Cooma Tigers (24) can take a two-point advantage if it can get the maximum result out of Sunday's fixture with the Monaro Panthers at Nijong Oval.

After an up-and-down season culminating in the sacking of coach Ray Junna, Canberra FC captain Adam Spaleta believes the league title is within reach.

"We're quietly confident, we've still got some games to play against some of the bigger teams,'' Spaleta said. "We're still in the hunt, we definitely haven't given up the ghost yet, there are still a lot of games to play.

"Belconnen and Cooma have played some good football and we've dropped off of late, but we feel we've turned the corner.''

Spaleta said the players remained focused after technical director Andy Bernal was appointed following Junna's axing.

"It was a setback to see [Junna] go, but the attitude has been good in response,'' he said.

"The guys that have come in around the club have a great attitude and they're trying to bring a great mentality to the team. It's starting to show itself a little bit today.''
