About 40 people gathered Saturday morning (June 14) at the Louisiana State Capitol to rally against the use of the Common Core academic standards.

The group asked Gov. Bobby Jindal to remove Louisiana from Common Core and a related standardized test. They also want Louisiana Education Superintendent John White, a Common Core supporter, replaced.

The rally was held in Baton Rouge with the intention of influencing Jindal, but the governor was out of the town on Saturday morning, speaking at a state Republican Convention in Iowa.

Jindal has said he intends to pull the state out of using the Common Core academic standards and an associated assessment, though it is not clear whether he has the authority to do either of those things.

The Louisiana Legislature and the state school board refused to pull the plug on Common Core and its testing this spring. The Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education oversees education policy in the state and generally controls things like what academic standards and standardized tests are used in the state.

Organizers of the rally said the Father's Day holiday on Sunday interfered with the movement drawing a bigger crowd.
