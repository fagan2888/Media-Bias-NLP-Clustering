A few nodded. Others stared blankly.\n\nAs enrollment began around the nation, the scene at this Wesley Health Center underscored one of the major challenges facing officials \u2013 overcoming the lack of awareness.\n\nNearly all of the patients in the crowded waiting room were Latino, including several first-generation immigrants. Some had never heard of the new law and few knew that Oct. 1 was the first day of enrollment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are tons of people who don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on today,\u201d said Valerie Lopez, an outreach worker at the center.\n\nPena explained to the patients at the health center that starting Tuesday, they could sign up for new health coverage that would begin Jan. 1. Depending on their income, they would either qualify for free insurance through Medicaid (called Medi-Cal here) or for discounted private insurance through Covered California, the state\u2019s online health insurance marketplace. And she warned about the penalty that most people who don\u2019t have insurance would face in 2014.\n\nThe patients asked many questions: Do I have to pay a fine if I am not working? Do I still qualify for Medi-Cal if I own a home? Are there people to help me fill out the application? Pena didn\u2019t know all the answers, but she said people would be available soon to help with enrollment. There was no one at the center who could actually help people enroll. They are still being trained.\n\nThe Obama administration is counting on outreach efforts to enroll Latinos and other immigrants. They tend to be younger than the general population, and so they balance out the costs of older, sicker people in the insurance pool.\n\nGetting the information out to immigrants is an uphill battle, said Reshma Shamasunder, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center. Many speak little or no English. They also may live in mixed-status families, where some are eligible for new insurance options and others aren\u2019t. And after years of deportations throughout immigrant communities, the distrust of government is high, she added.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be important to have trusted messengers in their communities,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth clinic administrators say they hope their staff members will be those messengers. \u201cOnce patients establish that rapport and that trust, they are going to look for us for information,\u201d said Frances Bernabe, director of clinic operations for the Wesley Health Centers.\n\nEven if they are successful with their outreach efforts, California officials know millions could remain uninsured. A U.C. Berkeley study last year found that as many as 4 million Californians could still be without insurance in 2019 and nearly three-quarters will be U.S. citizens or legal residents. Two-thirds remaining uninsured will be Latino.\n\nAbout 1 million of those remaining uninsured will be immigrants not in the country legally, the study said. The law bars undocumented immigrants from getting insurance from the exchanges, even if they pay for it themselves.\n\nOne of the patients at the Bell Gardens Center, Celia Figueroa, limped into the clinic early Tuesday morning, hoping to see a doctor about a lingering pain in her knee. A doctor told her years ago that she needs surgery but Figueroa said she can\u2019t afford it.\n\nFigueroa, 57, who is uninsured, said she has heard of the health law but doesn\u2019t know what it does or if she qualifies for it. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Obamacare,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother patient, Sandy Esquivel, 30, said her mom told her the basics but not any details. Esquivel, who works part-time for the city of Cudahy, said she hasn\u2019t been paying attention to the news about Obamacare and doesn\u2019t know how much it would cost or how to apply.\n\nEsquivel said that she would be relieved if she could get low-cost health coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be so much better, knowing I won\u2019t have to struggle just to go to the doctor,\u201d she said.\n\nMonica Delgado, 32, listened to the presentation by the outreach workers but knew none of it applied to her because she is in the country illegally. Delgado, who works as a housekeeper, said she feels frustrated that she can\u2019t take advantage of the new coverage options.\n\n\u201cThis is unequal because it\u2019s not for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cBut everybody gets sick.\u201d\n\nDelgado came to the clinic Tuesday morning because her daughter, who is covered by Medi-Cal, had a spider bite. Without insurance, she said she would continue relying on the clinic, where she can get care for free.\n\nIn an effort to get the word out to Latinos, Covered California is running ads in both English and Spanish, and officials have translated information about the new insurance options into Spanish.\n\nCovered California has also awarded millions in grants to organizations working with Latinos and other ethnic groups to help people to enroll.\n\nJenny Seon, immigrant rights project director at the Korean Resource Center, spent the weekend at the annual Korean festival in Los Angeles telling people about their new options. Seon said she spoke to many who are excited about the possibility of getting insurance but worried about the cost and whether they will be able to get help in Korean.\n\nSeon said that the work is personal for her, because her parents are also uninsured and rely heavily on herbal medicine instead of going to the doctor.\n\nOn Monday afternoon at another clinic, St. John\u2019s Well Child and Family Center, Maria Gomez, 58, said she pays in cash when she goes to the doctor or has to buy medication. Gomez, a legal resident from Mexico, came to the center for more information about the health law.\n\nWhen she learned she would be eligible for expanded Medi-Cal coverage, she said. \u201cFinally, I am going to have insurance. I feel happy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BELL GARDENS, CALIFORNIA -- Carrying Spanish-language brochures, outreach worker Sandra Pena walked around a crowded health clinic here early Tuesday morning.\r\n\u201cHave you heard of the program Obamacare?\u201d Pena asked a group of patients.
