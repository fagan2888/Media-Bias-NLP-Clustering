Ted Cruz discussed local business concerns at a roundtable discussion Friday hosted by the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce Governmental Affairs Council.\n\n\u201cIn my discussions with business leaders in Amarillo, the message is the same here as it is throughout the state of Texas,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey want economic growth.\u201d\n\nCruz touched on issues including tax reform and immigration, but he also expressed concerns about a proposed U.S. military strike on Syria, for which President Barack Obama plans to seek congressional approval.\n\nCruz said he was \u201cdeeply, deeply skeptical\u201d about involving the U.S. in Syria. \u201cI believe doing so has a very real risk of benefiting the rebels \u2026 and I think empowering them would only undermine U.S. national security interests,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, I think the so-called limited strikes have a potential to escalate dramatically and draw the United States into protracted military engagement in Syria,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it is not the job of our military to send statements or defend international norms,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the young men and women in the military signed up to do.\u201d\n\nAmarillo Mayor Paul Harpole, a Vietnam veteran, echoed Cruz\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced there are valid reasons, and I don\u2019t like the timing and idea of using people\u2019s lives to pursue a conflict that doesn\u2019t fit the just war theory,\u201d Harpole said.\n\nCruz also expressed interest in defunding the Affordable Care Act, which he thinks will negatively affect businesses and their hiring practices.\n\nState Sen.
