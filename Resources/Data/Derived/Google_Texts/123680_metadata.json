Moreover, 27 percent of city renters are \"severely\" cost burdened, paying more than half their income for the same.\n\nThe city may think it is doing a good job providing or promoting lower-income, affordable housing, but we beg to differ. A review of the new affordable low-income housing produced or in the construction pipeline during the current administration shows that since 2009 fewer than 100 units of new low-income units have been made available each year. At that rate it will take something like 80 years to meet the 8,240 units needed in the city.\n\nThis is about housing for the lower-income residents in our city. These are individuals and families who are poor and working class and spend the largest part of their income for housing. They must make the heartbreaking choice between a place to live or enough to eat, adequate health care, reasonable transportation or decent clothing.\n\nOur call is for affordable housing for all low-income residents. We pray the City Council respond and act on their behalf. We can begin today with immediate action on the following:\n\n\u2022 Transit Oriented Development: The city has ambitious plans for development along the UTA transit corridors. It is reported that more than 750 market-rate units have already been built along 400 South from 200 East to 900 East, with another 500 under construction or planned. More development is anticipated along the other mass transit corridors in the city. The city's transit station zoning overlay ordinance should require Transit Station Area (TSA) developments include 20 percent rent-assisted/subsidized low income, affordable housing.\n\nThe city should adopt options to increase financing resources and development incentives so this 20 percent inclusionary requirement can be achieved.\n\n\u2022 A no net loss policy: The council should revisit the city housing mitigation ordinance and revise it to achieve a \"no net loss\" policy requiring replacement of affordable housing units lost to demolition and/or contribution of money or land to allow for replacement of those units.\n\n\u2022 Inclusionary zoning options: The council should prioritize inclusionary zoning options such as density bonuses that encourage and enhance mixed-used and mixed income development.\n\nOur city embodies the values of hospitality, diversity and equality. We tell everyone, \"There is a place here for you.\" None shall be discriminated against. In this spirit we call upon our City Council to help make room for the poor. We ask them to enact a better city housing policy, intent upon building a community in which all prosper.\n\nRev. David Nichols is pastor of Mt. Tabor Lutheran Church. Rev.
