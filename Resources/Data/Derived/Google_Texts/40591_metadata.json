Please.\u201d\n\nInternational monitors say armed rebels have limited their access to the crash site and Ukrainian officials said armed rebels took 192 bodies away from their workers by force Sunday.\n\nFredriksz-Hoogzand\u2019s son and his girlfriend were among the 193 Dutch victims of the crash, making this nation of 17 million the hardest hit by the tragedy. The Boeing 777 was flying from Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down, killing all 298 passengers and crew.\n\nGrief is turning to anger for the Dutch as pro-Russian rebels hamper efforts to recover the dead and investigate the cause of the disaster.\n\n\u201cNo words can describe it,\u201d Fredriksz-Hoogzand told AP. \u201cBodies are just lying there for three days in the hot sun. There are people who have this on their conscience. There are families who can never hold the body of a child or a mother.\u201d\n\nShe said she sent Bryce and Daisy on vacation to Bali to get over the grief of Daisy\u2019s mother dying two and a half months ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy on top of a tragedy,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked Sunday night what delay was acceptable in returning bodies to their families, Prime Minister Mark Rutte replied: \u201cZero. Nothing is acceptable. All this should be done two days ago. But we are working as hard as possible to ensure a quick repatriation.\u201d\n\nAcross the nation, worshippers at church services prayed for the victims of the disaster and their next of kin.\n\nAt the St. Vitus church in the central city of Hilversum, Father Julius Dresme described the nation\u2019s pain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, and everybody\u2019s hearts are bleeding and crying,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it makes (people) restless and people feel sorrow, and feel a little anger but mostly sadness, confusion.\u201d\n\nIn Rome, Pope Francis led thousands of tourists and pilgrims assembled in St. Peter\u2019s Square in prayer for peace in Ukraine and the Mideast.\n\n\u201cI invite you to remember and to keep praying for tensions and conflicts which are going on in different parts of the world, especially in the Middle East and in Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers mourned privately.\n\nAt the Amsterdam student rowing club Skoll, a single member sat weeping Sunday as she wrote in a condolence book for two members of the club who died, Karlijn Keijzer and her boyfriend, Laurens van der Graaff.\n\nAmid the grieving, Rutte is pushing for Putin to use his influence over the rebels in eastern Ukraine to ensure a full investigation into the tragedy.\n\nHe said Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans was on his way to New York to speak to the United Nations and Security Council members \u201cto further expand the international coalition pushing for quick recovery of the bodies and getting to the bottom of the terrible events on MH17.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, Rutte angrily condemned the rebels for interfering with the wreckage and bodies in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is totally disgusting. It is also serious because it undermines the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nRutte called Putin on Saturday and had what he described as \u201can extremely intense telephone conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him the time is running out to quickly show the world that he intends to help,\u201d Rutte said. \u201cHe must take the responsibility now with the rebels and show the Netherlands and the world that he is doing what is expected of him.\u201d\n\nRutte said he planned to speak to Putin again Sunday night.\n\nBest-selling Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf went further in a front-page appeal for decisive action to protect the crash site.\n\nUnder the Dutch headline, \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d the paper called for NATO troops to be deployed in Ukraine to secure the wreckage and bodies in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, special forces must be deployed to track down the perpetrators of this mass murder and bring them to the Netherlands to face justice.\u201d\n\nAlso Sunday, the chief executive officer of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, arrived in the Netherlands and signed a condolence book at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport for victims of the crash.\n\nThe airline also announced it was \u201cretiring\u201d the flight code 17 of its Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur flights \u201cout of respect for our crew and passengers of the mentioned flight code\u201d and replacing it from July 25 with the flight code 19.\n\nFredriksz-Hoogzand said her only concern was getting back the bodies of her son and his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cShe was such a kind girl,\u201d she said, her voice cracking with emotion. \u201cAnd she has been murdered, together with my son. They were totally innocent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Grieving mother of Flight 17 victim appeals to Russian president", "title": "Grieving mother of Flight 17 victim appeals to Russian president", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/20/grieving-mother-of-flight-17-victim-appeals-to-russian-president/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140720__victimsp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140720__victimsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-20T14:38:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:07:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc75d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut I know for sure that Mr. Putin can do something.\u201dEarlier, at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport, she made a simple, but heart-rending appeal to the Russian president: \u201cMr.\nFredriksz-Hoogzand said her only concern was getting back the bodies of her son and his girlfriend.\nAmid the grieving, Rutte is pushing for Putin to use his influence over the rebels in eastern Ukraine to ensure a full investigation into the tragedy.\nAsked Sunday night what delay was acceptable in returning bodies to their families, Prime Minister Mark Rutte replied: \u201cZero.\nFredriksz-Hoogzand\u2019s son and his girlfriend were among the 193 Dutch victims of the crash, making this nation of 17 million the hardest hit by the tragedy."}
