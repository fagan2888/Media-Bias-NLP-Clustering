Currently, Apple is developing software and sensors to monitor the user's heart with optoelectronic sensor technology, which measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels. The smartwatch, \u201ciWatch,\u201d may increase the chances of survival for heart attack patients and reduce the annual death rate of 600,000 people who die of heart disease.\n\n\"It could be part of a larger portfolio of solutions aimed at the broader ecosystem of health care,\" said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones Investments in St. Louis, to the SF Gate. \"That would be fascinating to watch.\" The iWatch is expected to come with several health and fitness-related features that will provide more personalized information about the health of the person.\n\nThe new technology, featuring medical sensors, aims to predict heart attacks by identifying the sound blood makes when it tries to pass through a blocked artery. During a heart attack, the coronary artery \u2014 one of two blood vessels, branching off from the aorta, that feeds oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle \u2014 suddenly becomes blocked, stops the flow of blood to the heart muscle, and damages it. The Cleveland Clinic says all or part of the heart muscle becomes cut off from its oxygen supply, which therefore leads the heart muscle to be injured.\n\nThe iWatch, an optoelectronic \u2014 electronic devices that source, detect, and control light \u2014 measures changes in light reflected by the body as it detects the amount and color of the light that bounces back. The changes shown in light levels are monitored and used to measure a person\u2019s heart rate and blood oxygen levels.\n\nAccording to Apple Insider, the smartwatch tracks blood oxygen levels in a process known as pulse oximetry. Pulse oximeters use visible red and infrared LEDs to detect how much oxygen is being carried in the blood\u2019s hemoglobin \u2014 a red protein responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to all other tissues of the body. In this process, the oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more infrared light, while the deoxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more visible red light. In other words, when the body pumps more blood, more light is absorbed.\n\nThe company chose the light-based technology over electrocardiography because it is considered to be a more accurate method to measure electrical impulses. Most electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) products require users to attach several diodes to their body or to touch the product with both hands in order to get a reading. However, the light-based technology will monitor the user\u2019s heart rate with the user just simply wearing the wristwatch.\n\nThe smartwatch will take measurements of respiratory rate, blood oxygen levels, and pulse rate throughout the day so the user can get a view of their overall health and physical condition. Talk of the iWatch comes at a time where the climate for \u201cwearable\u201d computers is high with Google introducing \u201cGoogle Glass,\u201d Nike the \u201cFuelBand,\u201d and Samsung\u2019s release of the \"Galaxy Gear.\" The question remains whether Apple can make the body-monitoring, health-improving smartwatch marketable to a wide audience, especially those under 30. The release date for the iWatch has yet to be announced, but Apple\u2019s iWatch patent in 2011 can be viewed here.\n\nAside from the forthcoming iWatch, several medical technologies in recent years have made it feasible for people to assess their risk for diseases. The following three may you keep your health in check:\n\n1. Alzheimer\u2019s Take-Home Test\n\nThe Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE) has developed a 15-minute evaluation test that is able to spot cognitive decline in patients who are unable to identify them on their own. The SAGE self-administered test can assess six separate aspects of cognition: orientation, language, reasoning/computation, visuospatial comprehension, problem solving, and memorization. This medical advancement may help physicians identify patients with mild cognitive impairments that would fail to meet the criteria for Alzheimer\u2019s otherwise.\n\n2. Blood Test Predicts Possibility of Heart Attack\n\nResearchers developed a procedure called the High-Definition Circulating Endothelial Cell (HD-CEC) assay to detect and characterize the CECs in blood samples. The test determines whether a patient is at very high risk for a heart attack by recognizing these specific cells in the bloodstream. In a study, the researchers found the assay correctly identified CECs by their morphological features, along with their reactions with specific antibodies.\n\n3. Blood Test Predicts Breast Cancer Relapse Risk\n\nCanadian researchers discovered a \u201cgenetic marker\u201d method to accurately profile women who are more likely to have their breast return years later. The new blood test assess a patient\u2019s risk of getting luminal A breast cancer. It may help physicians and ocologists to design a more aggressive therapy for these patients in order to prevent the cancer from coming back.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "iwatch, apple, smartwatch, wristwatch, medical device, technology, heart attack, heart disease, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, health, fitness,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Apple\u2019s latest medical device, iWatch, may predict a user's heart attack through optoelectronic sensor technology that measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels.", "title": "Apple iWatch May Predict Heart Attack Risk; Plus 3 Technological Advances To Keep Your Health In Check", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/apple-iwatch-predict-heart-attack-plus-3-other-technological-advances-help-keep-your-health-check", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/male-finger-taps-blue-smartwatch-icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Apple\u2019s latest medical device, iWatch, may predict a user's heart attack through optoelectronic sensor technology that measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels.", "title": "Apple iWatch May Predict Heart Attack Risk; Plus 3 Technological Advances To Keep Your Health In Check", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/apple-iwatch-predict-heart-attack-plus-3-other-technological-advances-help-keep-your-health-check", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/male-finger-taps-blue-smartwatch-icon.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/male-finger-taps-blue-smartwatch-icon.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-02-17T13:47:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T13:47:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Apple\u2019s latest medical device, iWatch, may predict a user's heart attack through optoelectronic sensor technology that measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0762\"", "article_summary": "Currently, Apple is developing software and sensors to monitor the user's heart with optoelectronic sensor technology, which measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels.\nAccording to Apple Insider, the smartwatch tracks blood oxygen levels in a process known as pulse oximetry.\nThe changes shown in light levels are monitored and used to measure a person\u2019s heart rate and blood oxygen levels.\nHowever, the light-based technology will monitor the user\u2019s heart rate with the user just simply wearing the wristwatch.\nBlood Test Predicts Breast Cancer Relapse RiskCanadian researchers discovered a \u201cgenetic marker\u201d method to accurately profile women who are more likely to have their breast return years later."}
