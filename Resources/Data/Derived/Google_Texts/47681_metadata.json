Anderson understands his grandmother deserved the precious gift.\n\nAnderson is a slashing and bruising runner capable of bouncing a defensive lineman and eluding a defensive back. But thanks in large part to the way his grandmother brought him up, Anderson is also a sweetheart of a guy. He demonstrated his kindness by using some of the $150,963 playing-time bonus he received a couple days ago to buy his grandmother, Barbara Gaddies, a new Honda CRV EX. Anderson surprised her with the maroon car as she came outside her Vallejo, Calif., home with many of their family and friends looking on.\n\nGrandma was quite excited.\n\n\u201cI always told her that when I got to the NFL that I was going to buy her a new car and new house,\u201d Anderson said Saturday. \u201cShe\u2019s done so much for me. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today if it wasn\u2019t for her.\u201d\n\nSo the house comes with the next contract?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Anderson said, laughing. \u201cFirst things, first.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "C.J.
