Time to unplug \u2013 for minutes, hours or days at a time \u2013 prop up your feet and kick back. But what about a good read? Should you grab a relaxing snoozer that won\u2019t tax your brain or a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat? A topic that relates to the biotech field or a subject as far removed from the office as possible? History or science fiction? Inspiration or cautionary tale?\n\nWhatever your preference, BioWorld has options.\n\nOne respondent to the survey for our 2014 reading list, the 8th in our series, suggested the raft of biotech S-1s over the past 12 months \u2013 64 initial public offerings closed since the end of May 2013, with another 21 in the queue, according to BioWorld Snapshots \u2013 could offer an ideal solution to induce vacation shuteye. That may be true, but we\u2019ve found livelier suggestions across multiple categories.\n\nSo, happy vacationing \u2013 after ASCO and BIO, at least \u2013 and happy reading.\n\nThe world of fiction, from 19th Century Iceland to dystopian Chicago\n\nBarbara Fox, CEO of Avaxia Biologics Inc., set her reading list when she received a trio of contemporary titles from one of her daughters. One of those, the 2014 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Goldfinch, by Donna Tartt, is the tale of a 13-year-old New Yorker who miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Twists of fate then mark his adult life. Another, The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, explores a bittersweet story of love in the face of terminal illness.\n\nJohanna Holldack, CEO of Telormedix SA, recommended The Elephant Keepers\u2019 Children, by Peter H\u00f8eg. The novel examines fundamentalism vs. spiritual freedom and reflects on the meaning of everyday life. \u201cI love H\u00f8eg\u2019s books, in particular Borderliners,\u201d Holldack said. \u201cAnd I find it interesting the title is derived from an Indian saying: \u2018In case you wish to befriend an elephant keeper, make certain to have room for the elephant.\u2019\u201d\n\nBioWorld\u2019s Washington Editor Mari Serebrov (@mserebrov), whose stellar first novel, Mama Namibia, was published last year, admitted to having little time for a leisurely read this summer as she pursues her PhD and conducts research for her next book \u2013 yes, in her spare time. Nevertheless, Serebrov recommended Hannah Kent\u2019s Burial Rites, a historical novel based on a real incident that occurred in 19th century Iceland. The haunting story centers on a servant, condemned to death for a brutal murder, who is sent to the isolated farm of the district commissioner\u2019s family, rather than to prison, to live out her final months.\n\nBioWorld Staff Writer Randy Osborne (@ORandyO) proposed the novel Orfeo, by Richard Powers, which he called \u201cbrilliant.\u201d A modern telling of the Orpheus myth, the book recounts the story of Peter Els, a composer with a microbiology lab in his home who is seeking to discover the \u201cmusic\u201d in molecular patterns. Long story short, the Department of Homeland Security takes an interest, and Els becomes a fugitive known as \u201cthe Bioterrorist Bach.\u201d Osborne, who is completing a book of personal essays that includes All Sorts of Things and Weather, Taken in Together and the award-winning Natural Science, commended the prose, such as this example: \u201cScience should have been the career, music just a hobby. He\u2019d lived through the birth of biotech, that whole new art \u2026 Genomics was right now learning how to read scores of indescribable beauty. Els just wanted to hear, before the light in his tent went out.\u201d\n\nJennifer Boggs, BioWorld\u2019s Managing Editor, acknowledged that her fiction picks represent \u201ca bit of a theme, which is unintentional and somewhat disturbing.\u201d With a nod to recent news that Synthetic Genomics Inc. and United Therapeutics Corp. subsidiary, Lung Biotechnology Inc., are working to develop humanized pig organs for transplant, Boggs recommended Margaret Atwood\u2019s post-apocalyptic trilogy, Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood and MaddAddam. The books feature pigoons, transgenic pigs designed to grow replacement organs for human transplant. \u201cThere are, naturally, some unforeseen consequences,\u201d Boggs deadpanned.\n\nIn other post-apocalyptic fiction, Boggs recommended Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline. Although perhaps \u201cnot as cerebral\u201d as some recommendations, \u201cit\u2019s a great \u2013 if sometimes silly \u2013 read for anyone who is an aficionado of sci-fi and \u201880s pop culture and is in the mood to completely geek out,\u201d she said.\n\nBioWorld Senior Production Editor Ann Duncan recommended the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child, the pen name of British author Jim Grant. The main character, popularized by the 2012 film of the same name, is a former military police officer who roams the U.S. with only a toothbrush, an expired passport and an ATM card in his pocket but has a penchant for solving mysteries. Duncan also recommended the science fiction Divergent trilogy, by Veronica Roth, which is set \u201csometime in the future after a great war,\u201d in a dystopian Chicago society behind walls. The first book of that trilogy, by the same name, also was translated to the screen.\n\nHolland Johnson (@Hojomedtechpro), Executive Editor of BioWorld\u2019s sister publication, Medical Device Daily, put in a plug for Breakfast Served Anytime, a young adult novel by his sister-in-law, Sarah Combs. The sweet coming-of-age story, which takes place at a camp for gifted and talented students, likely harkens to the experiences of many an inventor \u2013 not to mention the next generation of rockstar researchers. The book\u2019s back story isn\u2019t bad, either.\n\nNonfiction: Obamacare, \u2018bankers beware\u2019 and warfare\n\nKate Kuhrt (@KateKuhrt), Senior Director of News and Generics Content Strategy at BioWorld parent company Thomson Reuters, recommended Ezekiel Emanuel\u2019s Reinventing American Health Care: How the Affordable Care Act will Improve our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System. The author, professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania and former special adviser to the White House on health care reform, examines the ways the ACA reforms are reshaping the U.S. health care system and looks to six emerging health care mega trends.\n\nBioWorld Insight Editor Peter Winter (@canadianbiotech) picked the riveting Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt, by Michael Lewis. Winter called the book about high frequency trading \u201ca great and disturbing read\u201d about mechanisms enabling the U.S. stock market to be \u201crigged for the benefit of insiders.\u201d\n\nAmanda Lanier, Production Editor for BioWorld Insight and manager of BioScan, also turned to Wall Street with the recent Kevin Roose release, Young Money: Inside the Hidden World of Wall Street\u2019s Post-Crash Recruits. For three years following the financial collapse of 2008, Roose shadowed eight entry-level employees at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and other leading investment firms. The book details the reactions of the young bankers to their grueling work weeks, strange initiations and multi-million-dollar trades, as well as their disappointment at downsizing in their firms and their dismay at criticism of their profession. \u201cBankers beware: Roose gets pretty critical of the industry,\u201d Lanier said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a quick and easy read that\u2019s perfect for plane or poolside.\u201d\n\nHistory buff Steliou Kosta, CEO of Phenomatrix Inc., selected two studies of character and perseverance. He called The Riddle of the Labyrinth: The Quest to Crack an Ancient Code, by Margalit Fox, \u201can intriguing and thrilling story about breaking the code of ancient languages.\u201d His second pick, The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, by Siddhartha Mukherjee, makes its second appearance on our summer reading list. The 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner examines a disease that \u201crules\u201d all of us, Kosta said, and dictates the scientific and business strategies of innumerable biotech firms.\n\nIn a different take on character and domination, Kosta recommended William D. Cohan\u2019s Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World. The meticulously researched account examines how the storied investment firm\u2019s darker side may have disproportionately contributed to the Great Recession.\n\nBill Chin, executive vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at PhRMA, suggested The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism, by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. The story is woven around an intense friendship between the two U.S. Presidents that dissolved into a bitter rivalry, splitting apart everything they held dear. \u201cKearns provided memorable glimpses into the lives and times of Lincoln and other U.S. Presidents,\u201d Chin said, adding that her newest book examines the recurring historical theme of social inequity while breathing life into the early 20th Century politicians whose personalities led to cataclysmic political shifts and into the keen investigative reporters who exposed them.\n\nIn another historical turn, Chin recommended Men Who United the States: America\u2019s Explorers, Inventors, Eccentrics and Mavericks, and the Creation of One Nation, Indivisible, by Simon Winchester. \u201cAs an unabashed nerd, I have long admired and enjoyed Winchester\u2019s prodigious works, focused on diverse topics such as famous volcanoes, the origin of the Oxford English Dictionary, the birth of geology and the wonders of the Atlantic Ocean,\u201d Chin said. \u201cHis gift of clear exposition shines brilliant light on some of the most abstruse technical subjects. I know that this most recent work won\u2019t disappoint.\u201d\n\nRounding out the category, Mark McCarty (@MedDeviceMark), Medical Device Daily\u2019sWashington Editor, recommended Hew Strachan\u2019s The First World War: To Arms, the first of three volumes. McCarty called the book \u201cvery timely considering we\u2019re close upon the 100-year anniversary of the lighting of the fuse, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a history buff, per se, but World War I, to me, was the defining event of the 20th Century.\u201d\n\nThe stuff of science: AIDS, Alzheimer\u2019s and Africa\n\nA title mentioned on our 5th edition that\u2019s worth a repeat is The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by Rebecca Skloot, recommended by Rachel Hutman at Canale Communications Inc. Equal parts family history, scientific narrative and ethical drama, the page-turner recounts the story of the now-famous woman whose cervical cancer cells were transformed into the indispensable HeLa cell line. In the wake of findings reported at the 50th annual ASCO meeting, this book is a timely choice.\n\nRob Sarisky, chief business officer at Forma Therapeutics Holdings LLC, recommended a title close to the heart of many biotech CEOs. The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma, by Barry Werth, examines the ups, downs and staying power of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., whose efforts to respond to the AIDS epidemic were chronicled earlier by Werth in The Billion Dollar Molecule: One Company\u2019s Quest for the Perfect Drug.\n\nStephen Rose, chief research officer at the Foundation Fighting Blindness, recommended The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, by Sam Kean, which features not only incredible stories of science but also meanders through history, finance, mythology, the arts and medicine. Calling Kean \u201can excellent writer\u201d with a gift for deftly explaining his subject, Rose recommended a second work along the same lines. The Violinist\u2019s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code explores the impact of DNA as the building block of each individual and the human species, as a whole.\n\nKari Watson, of Macdougall Biomedical Communications, recommended the graphic novel Neurocomic, written by Hana Ro\u0161 with illustrations by Matteo Farinella, with support from the Wellcome Trust. Watson discovered the book, which examines the workings of the brain, on the blog, Brain Pickings, and credited Maria Popova\u2019s review for piquing her interest. She called the book \u201cincredibly well written\u201d and also \u201cbeautiful to look at and to hold. I love sci-art and a well-bound book,\u201d Watson said. \u201cAs someone who works to make complex science understandable and approachable to multiple audiences, it\u2019s awesome to see the complexities of neuroscience explained in such a fun, creative way. My six-year-old daughter was even drawn to pick it up and ask questions.\u201d\n\nBioWorld European Correspondent Cormac Sheridan (@cormac_sheridan) offered up two science titles, admitting that \u201cneither is probably suitable for poolside lounging, but they do look interesting.\u201d In The Alzheimer Conundrum: Entanglements of Dementia and Aging, author Margaret Lock \u201cunpacks assumptions surrounding the looming Alzheimer\u2019s epidemic and challenges current ways of framing the disease,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s research seems to be stuck at present,\u201d he added. \u201cA fresh perspective could shine new light on a very gloomy subject.\u201d\n\nSheridan also suggested Bitter Roots: The Search for Healing Plants in Africa, in which University of California, Berkeley historian Abena Dove Osseo-Asare \u201ctackles the thorny subject of bioprospecting, delineating the clash between indigenous knowledge and patent-driven western pharmaceutical research through six case studies, all of which involved plants native to the African continent.\u201d\n\nBiographies: Political intrigue and a science mystery\n\nAnette Breindl, BioWorld\u2019s Science Editor, recommended Nathalia Holt\u2019s Cured: How the Berlin Patients Defeated HIV and Forever Changed Medical Science. \u201cDespite the sensationalist and, in my opinion, incorrect headline, the story of the Berlin patients \u2013 starting with the fact that there are two of them \u2013 is fascinating,\u201d she said. Breindl\u2019s BioWorld article about Timothy Ray Brown and \u201cthe Mississippi baby\u201d offers a compelling backgrounder about the value, and potential foibles, of case studies.\n\nUnder biographies, I recommend Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Whether you love politics or detest them, Gates is a straight shooter whose tenure under vastly different White House administrations offers fascinating insights into the workings of the U.S. government\u2019s inner sanctum.\n\nA third recommendation in the category came from Avaxia\u2019s Fox. I am Livia, by Phyllis Smith, recounts the remarkable life of Livia Drusilla, wife and counselor of the Roman emperor Augustus. Though far removed from the modern world of scientists and politicians, Livia was a woman ahead of her time, wielding incredible power in ancient Rome and the center of no small amount of intrigue.\n\nInspirational, personal and professional development\n\nThe Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success, by William M. Thorndike, was the pick of Oleg Nodelman, founder and managing partner of EcoR1 Capital Management LLC. The book discusses capital allocation \u201cas the single most important job of every CEO and the only path to value creation,\u201d according to Nodelman, who initially picked it up on the advice of \u201cseveral of my favorite CEOs.\u201d\n\nGreg Bailey, chairman of Portage Biotech Inc., selected Cracking the Code: Understand and Profit from the Biotech Revolution That Will Transform Our Lives and Generate Fortunes, by Jim Mellon and Al Chalabi, which links biotechnology not only to discoveries that offer life-changing therapies but also to innovations that offer the prospect of improved financial returns.\n\nAbbie Celniker, president and CEO of Eleven Biotherapeutics Inc., called Malcom Gladwell\u2019s David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants a \u201cmust-read,\u201d suggesting the book will inspire biotech execs to think differently about \u201cthe concept of turning disadvantages into advantages.\u201d Celniker also plans to re-read The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, by Daniel Brown, which recounts the story of the University of Washington\u2019s eight-oar crew team in their pursuit of an Olympic gold medal. \u201cThere is so much in this book about the mystery of what makes a stellar team and how underdogs can excel through almost unexplainable synergy,\u201d she said.\n\nBioWorld\u2019s Senior Editorial Director Don Johnston (@JohnstonDon), plans to read Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn from the Most Iconic Band in History, by David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan. The book was a gift from his daughter, a marketing professional. \u201cI had heard Scott speak at a conference, was intrigued, and had discussed it with my daughter,\u201d Johnston recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick, fun read. Not every point the authors make will be valid for BioWorld or for any other business. Some of the lessons, though, like \u2018Turn your customers into evangelists\u2019 and \u2018Rethink traditional industry assumptions,\u2019 are universal.\u201d\n\nRachel Hutman at Canale Communications Inc. endorsed a tale of inspiration far from the boardroom in Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, by Cheryl Strayed. The author recounts her solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington. \u201cShe decided to do the hike to find herself again, after her mother passed away suddenly of cancer and her marriage crumbled,\u201d Hutman said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t put it down.\u201d\n\nForma\u2019s Sarisky recommended Supersurvivors: The Surprising Link Between Suffering and Success, by David B. Feldman and Lee Daniel Kravetz. \u201cGiven my family\u2019s daily struggles with cancer, I\u2019m fascinated by the biology of hope and resilience,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout this, we\u2019re learning about the impact of social connections on one\u2019s resolve to make the world a better place.\u201d That philosophy tied into an additional recommendation: The Key: How Corporations Succeed by Solving the World\u2019s Toughest Problems, by Lynda Gratton.\n\nFinally, a recommendation from the heart\n\nMy husband has prosopagnosia, or face blindness, a topic on which I (very) occasionally blog. Friends and colleagues have encouraged a book, and the story of our journey may one day work its way through my fingertips. In the meantime, a fictional character, Jessica, already exists in Faces and the recent follow-on Duplicity. Written by Diane Winger \u2013 a rock-climbing enthusiast and self-described software geek who coincidentally has prosopagnosia \u2013 the books are entertaining and easy reads, even if the topic is anything but uncomplicated.\n\nIt\u2019s somehow comforting to read about the familiar signs of face blindness \u2013 the inability to spot loved ones in photos, the need to memorize voices or distinctive mannerisms, the hesitation to speak to a colleague or mingle at a dinner party \u2013 and hope others are learning about the condition, as well. Considering the biopharma industry hasn\u2019t made much of a dent in huge central nervous system indications like Alzheimer\u2019s disease and schizophrenia, it\u2019s not likely we\u2019ll see a therapy for prosopagnosia anytime soon. But at least awareness of the condition is growing. And, perhaps, understanding.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "u.s., summer reading list", "description": "Ah, the summer holidays.
