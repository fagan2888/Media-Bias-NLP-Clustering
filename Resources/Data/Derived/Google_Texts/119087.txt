The only skilled nursing center on the Outer Bank is being told by Nags Head that it is in default of its lease and it could be evicted.

The town gave Tar River of Kinston a 10 year, $10 a month lease on the Colony Ridge Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in 2011, with the understanding that they perform $1.5 million in renovations by June 2013.

According to the town, Tar River said it couldn't make the improvements, and was unsuccessful in getting another operator to run the facility.

Town commissioners voted on Wednesday to notify the company it was in default.

The town says Tar River can voluntarily terminate the lease, or Nags Head will get a court order to evict them from the facility.

Nags Head says even if Colony Ridge is closed, even temporarily, Tar River would be required to place current residents in other nursing facilities within 60 days.

Colony Ridge is licensed by the state for a maximum of 144 patients.
