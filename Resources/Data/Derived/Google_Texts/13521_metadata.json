We economists may have taken all the fun out of Christmas , but I think we can make Valentine\u2019s Day more successful. Here\u2019s how. First, figure out how to signal to your mate that youcare about him or her. Second, if you want to give your mate a great Valentine\u2019s present, spend money on. Finally, one great gift is to stop hoping for perfection in your mate and, in the words of Stephen Stills , \u201clove the one you\u2019re with.\u201d\n\n\u201cSignaling\u201d in economics means figuring out a way to show another party that you really mean what you say. In many cases, the best way to signal is to make a wasteful investment. This shows you are willing to spend a lot to demonstrate your credibility, and it separates you from those who will not expend that cost. For example, signaling is valuable in the education world, where an early-decision application shows a college that a student is particularly attracted to that school. According to some analysts, a business can also make good use of signals by underpricing its stock when it goes public to show that it is a good investment.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Valentine\u2019s Day? Start by asking yourself, \u201cWhat do I want my partner to think upon receiving my Valentine\u2019s present?\u201d\n\nSuppose you buy your significant other a dozen red roses or a box of chocolates. She is likely to think, \u201cAll right, he cares about me enough to buy the obvious present.\u201d Sixty-four percent of men buy flowers on Valentine\u2019s Day, so giving flowers signals that you are like two-thirds of men. This is roughly the equivalent of writing \u201chb\u201d on your mate\u2019s Facebook wall on her birthday: it shows that you remember, and that you are willing to spend approximately seven seconds conveying that fact.\n\nSo how do you say \u201cHoney, I really care about you, and you are very special to me\u201d? Put your resources where your mouth is. You don\u2019t have to spend a lot of money, but to credibly signal you really care, do something personal. Cook something she really loves, take her to see a movie you know she will love and that you will hate (possibly something starring Sarah Jessica Parker), or do some unpleasant chores around the house that she has wanted done for a long time. These gestures show that you really do care for her, and they can separate you from other guys who care about their mates, but not that much.\n\nTip #2: Make your partner happy by spending on yourself\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out a creative way to credibly signal your affection, it\u2019s time to expend some resources on yourself. Studies show quite clearly (though you don\u2019t really need a study to back this up) that people are more attracted to partners and potential partners who have certain desirable characteristics. For example, one study of an online dating site found that a man who makes $250,000 per year, holding other things equal, is contacted two and a half times as often as a man who makes under $50,000. Men, on the other hand, tend to be more focused on women\u2019s looks. According to an analysis of its own users, the dating site OKCupid found \u201ca hot woman receives roughly 4x the messages an average-looking woman gets.\u201d\n\nYou have to tailor this to the tastes of your partner, of course. Not all men care so much about looks (O.K., maybe they do) and not all women care so much about money. Some people appreciate education, a taste for certain books, or cooking ability, for example. But let\u2019s say you are a typical man who could make your partner happier if you increase your income. How should you do it?\n\nLabor economists have shown that more than anything else you can control, education increases income. An additional year of education, all else equal, leads to about 8 percent higher income every year for the rest of your working life. So, if you really want to make yourself more attractive this Valentine\u2019s Day, spend some time in the classroom so that you can earn more.\n\nBut if going back to school is not feasible, there is another way. Research also shows that better-looking people make more money. One study, for example, found a \u201cbeauty premium\u201d and a \u201cplainness penalty\u201d of 5 to 10 percent each. This means a very attractive person will, on average, outearn an unattractive person by up to 20 percent. So you can make yourself more attractive, both physically and through your earning power, if you spend Valentine\u2019s Day getting a better haircut, working out so you get more toned, or buying yourself some new and pleasing clothes. Just tell her, \u201cI love you so much, honey, that I\u2019m buying myself that sport coat.\u201d (Though you may want to wordsmith that declaration a bit.)\n\nTip #3: Love the One You\u2019re With\n\nThough scientific evidence on this is scant, informal studies claim that Valentine\u2019s Day is a common breakup time. The day, and the hype leading up to it, may remind people that their current mate is not perfect \u2014 he or she is not \u201cthe one.\u201d\n\nEconomics tells us that in many markets, we have to keep searching until we find something that is really good. We especially spend a lot of time looking for just the right house and job, not to mention clothes, groceries and other regular purchases. But you also have to know when to stop searching because, just as you will never find the perfect job, you won\u2019t find the perfect life partner. That person is simply not out there. Breakups have costs. There\u2019s the emotional toll, of course, and then there is the use of time and resources looking for your next partner.\n\nSo, before you let some Valentine\u2019s ideal lead you to look for someone better, think a bit more methodically about the costs and benefits of moving on. I am not suggesting staying in a relationship that is abusive or otherwise clearly dysfunctional. But just as every job has downsides and every house has a few quirks you would rather not have, every life partner is less than ideal. The costs of accepting someone really good are often less than the costs of being lonely while you wait for someone better to come along.\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day, show your affection through economics. Signal how much your mate means to you through a carefully thought out and personalized gift. Then make your mate even happier by investing in yourself. Finally, stop and appreciate your partner \u2013 \u201cThe One\u201d may not exist, but that doesn\u2019t mean your partner is not \u201cA Really Good One.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140213110044, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 13, 2014", "keywords": "Dating and Courtship,Economics (Theory and Philosophy),Gifts,Holidays and Special Occasions,Love (Emotion),Valentine's Day,Today's Economist", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/How to Be a Better Valentine, Through Economics ( 20140213 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Paul Oyer", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Paul Oyer", "byl": "Paul Oyer", "twitter": {"description": "An economist offers three tips from his field on making the day special for your beloved.
