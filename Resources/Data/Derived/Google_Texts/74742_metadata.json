The Ravens upset the Steelers 30-17 on Saturday night at Heinz Field, a convincing win behind Joe \u201cCool\u201d Flacco and an opportunistic defense.\n\nFlacco, the new Eli Manning, continues to play his best when it matters most. A pedestrian quarterback during the regular season, he delivered a performance that conjured memories of his magical 2012 Super Bowl lap. Flacco finihsed 18-for-29 for 259 yards and two scores. He had just five completions for 74 yards at halftime before connecting on scores to Torrey Smith and former CSU star Crockett Gillmore, helping the Ravens advance to face the top-seeded New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cYou have to play these games to win. You can\u2019t play these games not to lose,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing aggressive football, not having a conscience.\u201d\n\nTerrell Suggs shoved Flacco into position to seal coach John Harbaugh\u2019s seventh playoff road win, matching the NFL record. With the Ravens leading 23-15, Pittsburgh running back Ben Tate, signed earlier in the week, missed a block on the blitz, leaving quarterback Ben Roethlisberger eluding the rush. Roethlisberger escaped and tried to flip a desperate pass to Tate. Tate missed it. Pass protection and catching the ball out of the backfield are strengths of the injured Le\u2019Veon Bell, the play explaining why he was sorely missed.\n\nAfter Tate couldn\u2019t corral the pass, it landed in linebacker Suggs\u2019 belly. He fell to the ground and pinched the football between his knees, somehow preventing it from touching the soggy Heinz Field turf.\n\n\u201cCoach said it was the best interception he\u2019s ever seen,\u201d Suggs said with a smile. \u201cI think he\u2019s just gassing me up because we got the turnover.\u201d\n\nFlacco capitalized, finding Gillmore open for an easy 21-yard touchdown. Flacco faked the handoff to Justin Forsett, and the linebackers bit. It left Gilmore uncovered.\n\n\u201cThey kind of lost me,\u201d Gillmore said. \u201cIt was a nice little scamper into the end zone. I don\u2019t think there was every a doubt we would win. As soon as the game plan was put in on Monday and Tuedsay we were ready. We are not here to sit out. We are here to play. If you can\u2019t contribute, you won\u2019t be a Raven. We have a championship attitude.\u201d\n\nNews and notes:", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/03/former-csu-star-crockett-gillmore-says-ravens-championship-attitude/31887/", "site_name": "First-and-Orange", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/01/crockett-gillmore.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Crockett Gillmore says Ravens have 'championship attitude'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Former CSU star Crockett Gillmore says Ravens have \u2018championship attitude\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/03/former-csu-star-crockett-gillmore-says-ravens-championship-attitude/31887/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/01/crockett-gillmore.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Ben Roethlisberger,Ben Tate,Crockett Gillmore,Joe Flacco,Terrell Suggs"}, "article_summary": "The Ravens upset the Steelers 30-17 on Saturday night at Heinz Field, a convincing win behind Joe \u201cCool\u201d Flacco and an opportunistic defense.\nHe had just five completions for 74 yards at halftime before connecting on scores to Torrey Smith and former CSU star Crockett Gillmore, helping the Ravens advance to face the top-seeded New England Patriots.\nThe Baltimore Ravens, the underdog nobody wants to see in the playoffs, are up to their old tricks.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just gassing me up because we got the turnover.\u201dFlacco capitalized, finding Gillmore open for an easy 21-yard touchdown.\nA pedestrian quarterback during the regular season, he delivered a performance that conjured memories of his magical 2012 Super Bowl lap."}
