This is not the time to pull the trigger on new taxes as that would only be a drag on our growing economy. Alaska's fiscal foundation is secure and our financial books are the envy of 49 other states. Alaska's budget reserves have always been our shock absorber to draw on when oil prices went lower, and today is no different. We must continue to drive spending down. We must live within our means and I am the only candidate running for governor who has ever cut a state budget.
