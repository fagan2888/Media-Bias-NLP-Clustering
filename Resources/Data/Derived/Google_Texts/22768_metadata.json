With the high volume of hit pieces on Bernie Sanders Mr. Krugman has authored, the former bomb-throwing Nobelist has become just another talking head of the elites and the establishment\u2014so staunchly opposed to Mr. Sanders\u2019 campaign that he\u2019s delusional when it comes to analyzing what the 2016 presidential election is actually all about.\n\nIn his latest piece, Bernie\u2019s Bad End, Mr. Krugman calls Mr. Sanders\u2019 persistence to take his campaign all the way to the Democratic Convention in July \u201cwhining.\u201d Mr. Krugman condescendingly asks, \u201cCan someone tell Bernie that he\u2019s in the process of blowing his own chance for a positive legacy?\u201d Such a point is moot, given that all of Mr. Krugman\u2019s work denigrates Mr. Sanders\u2014calling him a Bernie Bro in addition to many other smears\u2014making it impossible for any of Mr. Krugman\u2019s readers to imagine a positive legacy in the first place.\n\nBernie Sanders isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, and he won\u2019t go away after the Democratic Convention in July. His campaign has given voice to millions of progressive Democrats and Independents who have grown weary of a system favoring money over people. Highlighting direct evidence of a Democratic primary that overtly favors Hillary Clinton is far from whining\u2014because, rather than just sitting around and complaining, millions of voters have become involved in the political process. Mr. Sanders\u2019 campaign has broken fundraising records, has welcomed millions of volunteers, and has seen record-breaking attendance at campaign rallies, marches and grassroots events. Mr. Sanders\u2019 legacy is secure, and will continue strong as his campaign adds more states to his current victory tally of 17 so far.\n\nUrging Mr. Sanders to drop out is also hypocritical, given that Ms. Clinton refused to do so in 2008. Although the delegate lead Barack Obama had over her was smaller, Ms. Clinton had to loan herself money to continue to campaign in May 2008, and continued to disparage Mr. Obama\u2019s legitimacy as a candidate. When Ms. Clinton finally did bow out of the race, she did so under the condition Mr. Obama would help her with the campaign debt she had accrued. Mr. Sanders isn\u2019t staying in the race to help pay off campaign debt\u2014he is staying in the race to ensure his supporters, who have been silenced the majority of this campaign by most media outlets, have a voice.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Mr. Krugman wrote similar hit pieces on Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cMost of the venom I see is coming from supporters of Mr. Obama, who want their hero or nobody,\u201d Mr. Krugman wrote in his 2008 article, Hate Springs Eternal. \u201cI\u2019m not the first to point out that the Obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality.\u201d Despite one of President Obama\u2019s hallmark achievements being the Affordable Care Act\u2014an important step toward universal healthcare\u2014in 2007 Mr. Krugman wrote, \u201cMr. Obama just isn\u2019t that serious about achieving universal care\u2014that he introduced a plan because he had to, but that every time there\u2019s a hard choice to be made he comes down on the side of doing less.\u201d\n\nMr. Krugman also complained of a media bias in favor of Mr. Obama over Ms. Clinton, yet he alleges Mr. Sanders\u2019 supporters are \u201cwhining\u201d when they claim there was a media bias against the senator, despite a detailed analysis conducted by the Tyndall Report in 2015 showing Mr. Sanders received a fraction of the media coverage Ms. Clinton had. The New York Times has no op-ed columnist to balance Mr. Krugman\u2019s overt bias, and the paper publicly embarrassed itself after making drastic edits to a published article about Bernie Sanders that morphed any semblance of praise into criticism.\n\nDNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz did nothing to suggest she would remain impartial in the 2016 primaries from favoring Hillary Clinton, whose campaign she served as co-chair in 2008. Bernie Sanders\u2018 supporters had every right to criticize the debate schedule, the poor decision to close off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to voter database files, and an admittance in a CNN interview that the super delegate system was created to favor establishment-friendly Democratic candidates against grassroots activists. One of the DNC\u2019s vice chairs, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, resigned due to the corruption in the DNC. The Democratic Party has severe internal issues they must address at the DNC Convention or they are going to continue to worsen, to the demise of the party as a whole.\n\nIf Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign lent any credence to establishment puppets like Paul Krugman, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Democratic Primary race. The longer Bernie Sanders stays in the Democratic primaries, the better off the party will be.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Michael Sainato", "sailthru.author": "Michael Sainato", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-493571738.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-493571738.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 election, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, democrats, Hillary Clinton, New York Times, Paul Krugman, Tulsi Gabbard, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "2016 election, barack obama, bernie sanders, debbie wasserman schultz, democrats, hillary clinton, new york times, paul krugman, tulsi gabbard", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-493571738.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Krugman Fail: New York Times Clinton Puppet Gets It Wrong Again", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "michael-sainato", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-493571738.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Paul Krugman is completely delusional when it comes to analyzing what the 2016 presidential elections are actually all about.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/img_1537.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-05-02T20:00:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T14:57:19+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/michael-sainato"}, "sailthru.description": "Paul Krugman is completely delusional when it comes to analyzing what the 2016 presidential elections are actually all about.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Paul Krugman is completely delusional when it comes to analyzing what the 2016 presidential elections are actually all about.", "title": "Krugman Fail: New York Times Clinton Puppet Gets It Wrong Again", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/05/the-new-york-times-clinton-puppet-gets-it-wrong-again/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/gettyimages-493571738.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Michael Sainato's writing has appeared in the Guardian, Miami Herald, Baltimore Sun, Huffington Post, LiveScience, Buffalo News, the Plain Dealer, the Hill, Gainesville Sun, Tallahassee Democrat, Knoxville News Sentinel, and the Troy Record.
