Comcast’s Xfinity X1 television platform experienced a widespread outage overnight, showing blank screens for many users across the country, according to reports on Twitter and the Comcast customer forums.

The outage appeared to be worst close to midnight last night, based on reports made to DownDetector.com. Engadget reported on the news shortly after 3 a.m. This morning Comcast advised anyone still having problems to power cycle their box by unplugging it for at least 30 seconds, then plugging back in.

We’ve asked the company for more details on the problem and the restoration of service. I’ve been using the Xfinity X1 for the past two months but I didn’t try to watch any television last night. Everything seems to be working fine for me this morning. If you experienced problems (or are still having them) feel free to share the details in the comments.
