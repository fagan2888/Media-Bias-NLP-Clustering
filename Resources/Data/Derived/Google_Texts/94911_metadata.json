But the attacks of 9/11 led law enforcement to turn this rule on its head.\u201d\n\nAmidst unprecedented focus on overreach at the National Security Agency (NSA), many Americans have come to understand the risk of being spied on by the government in their electronic communications. But the intelligence-sharing hubs coordinated between DHS and state and local police departments around the country, called \u201cfusion centers,\u201d show there is extensive surveillance of Americans\u2019 physical and social activities as well.\n\nIn 2012, a Senate investigation found that fusion centers cost taxpayers billions of dollars, but disrupted no actual terrorist plots. The investigation said the intelligence gathering was \u201coftentimes shoddy\u201d and \u201cmore often than not unrelated to terrorism\u201d while \u201csometimes endangering citizens\u2019 civil liberties.\u201d\n\nAs the Associated Press reported at the time of the Senate report, fusion centers often targeted the First Amendment activities of Americans, \"circulating information about Ron Paul supporters, the ACLU, activists on both sides of the abortion debate, war protesters and advocates of gun rights.\u201d\n\nFusion centers in Boston, Massachusetts, filed scores of \u201cintelligence reports\u201d on anti-war activists, according to findings from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\n\u201cWe now have proof of what peace groups and activists have long suspected: Boston Police officers have worked within the local fusion spying center, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC), to monitor the lawful political activity of local peace groups and track their movements and beliefs,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s Nancy Murray wrote last year.\n\n\u201cThis information is fed into an array of federal information sharing networks, creating mountains of data,\u201d the Brennan Center report explains, describing the apparent civil liberties infringements as \u201cpotentially illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some jurisdictions,\u201d the report warns, \u201cpolice have used aggressive information-gathering tactics to target American Muslim communities without any suspicion of wrongdoing. Such practices have not generated investigative leads or proven especially useful in preventing potential terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nFusion centers collect information on \u201csuch innocuous and non-criminal activities as photography, looking through binoculars, and taking notes.\u201d\n\nOther activities collected by law enforcement officials and stored in fusion centers included:\n\nIndividuals who stay at bus or train stops for extended periods while buses and trains come and go;\n\nIndividuals who carry on long conversations on pay or cellular telephones;\n\nIndividuals who order food at a restaurant and leave before the food arrives or who order without eating; and\n\nJoggers who stand and stretch for an inordinate amount of time.\n\nThese complex intelligence programs are comprised of work by federal, state, and local authorities and are deliberately decentralized. According to the Brennan Center, proper \u201cintelligence oversight is extremely uncommon at the state and local level.\u201d\n\nThe report urges significant operational and oversight reforms to the program, including requiring police and intelligence officials to adopt basic \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standards for collecting information on citizens and to \u201cprohibit the collection, maintenance, or dissemination of information that relies on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation as a factor in establishing reasonable suspicion.\u201d\n\nThe Brennan Center report does not include recommendations for imposing accountability on federal, state, and local authorities for violating the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe lack of accountability mirrors that found in the NSA surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden. Last week, a federal judge ruled that NSA\u2019s collection of virtually every American\u2019s phone records was likely unconstitutional and \u201calmost Orwellian\u201d in its scope. Judge Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, said the authors of the Constitution would be \u201caghast.\u201d\n\nAnd the secret FISA court tasked with overseeing NSA programs found in 2011 that the NSA \u201cfrequently and systematically violated\u201d statutory laws governing how intelligence agents can search databases of Americans\u2019 telephone communications and that NSA analysts deliberately misled judges about the nature of the programs in order to get court approval.\n\n\u201cThe rules have been broken, and the rules have been broken a lot,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in October.\n\nSystematically violating both statutory and constitutional restrictions and infringing on the Fourth Amendment rights of millions of Americans\u2019 as a matter of policy are no minor transgressions. They are crimes. But no NSA or executive branch official has been called to account.\n\nAs the ongoing controversy over the NSA leaks clearly demonstrates, 9/11 prompted the intelligence community to seriously exceed its authority and expand its capabilities to spy on citizens in the name of foiling terrorists. Despite serious offenses, an erosion in the rule of law has prevented government officials from being prosecuted. And the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s fusion centers are no different.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A new report says they're fraught with waste and abuse and have whittled away at civil liberties protections.", "title": "Fusion Centers: Expensive and Dangerous to Our Liberty", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/25/fusion-centers-expensive-and-dangerous-t", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13878213218598.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13878213218598.jpg", "description": "A\ndomestic surveillance system established after the terrorist\nattacks of September 11&nbsp;collects and shares intelligence on a\nmass scale about \u201cthe everyday activities of law-abiding Americans,\neven in the absence of reasonable suspicion,\u201d according to a new\nreport.\nThe \nreport, released this month by the Brennan Center for Justice,\na nonpartisan policy institute at NYU School of Law, found that law\nenforcement", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fusion Centers: Expensive and Dangerous to Our Liberty"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2013-12-25T14:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/john-glaser"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca25a\"", "article_summary": "In 2012, a Senate investigation found that fusion centers cost taxpayers billions of dollars, but disrupted no actual terrorist plots.\nAnd the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s fusion centers are no different.\nThese complex intelligence programs are comprised of work by federal, state, and local authorities and are deliberately decentralized.\nBut the intelligence-sharing hubs coordinated between DHS and state and local police departments around the country, called \u201cfusion centers,\u201d show there is extensive surveillance of Americans\u2019 physical and social activities as well.\n\u201cPolice could only examine this type of First Amendment-protected activity if there was a direct link to a suspected crime."}
