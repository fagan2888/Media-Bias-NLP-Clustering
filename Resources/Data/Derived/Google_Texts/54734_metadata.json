Retired Air Force Col. Rob Maness, State Treasurer John Kennedy, congressman John Fleming and Charles Boustany latched on to Trump\u2019s brand, in some shape or form, be it his slogans, platform, speech or his way of distancing himself from the political establishment.\n\nFor example, Maness wrapped up his opening statements at the candidate forum by telling the audience, \u201cI\u2019m the different one, just like Mr. Trump is.\u201d\n\nAlford says Maness, a Mandeville native who ran unsuccessfully in the 2014 U.S. Senate race as a tea party alternative, sought to draw a distinction between himself and the rest of those sitting at the table.\n\n\u201cManess noted that his opponents have more than 100 years of combined elected experience. Or as Trump said at an Iowa rally, \u2018These politicians are all talk,\u2019\u201d Alford writes. \u201cRemarking on the oil and gas industry, Maness even lifted from Trump\u2019s signature motto\u2014\u2018Make America Great Again\u2019\u2014and made it his own. \u2018It\u2019s the lifeline of what makes America great,\u2019 Maness said of the energy sector.\u201d\n\nAlford also notes that during forum, Kennedy described members of Congress as \u201cweenies,\u201d declared that \u201cObamacare sucks\u201d and continued on with at least one other choice word use. He quotes Kennedy as saying: \u201cThe best way to get back on your feet, forgive me, is to get off your a**.\u201d\n\n\u201cCursing seems to have helped Trump grab headlines as well,\u201d writes Alford. \u201cAt a New Hampshire rally, The Donald said of elected officials, \u201cThese people \u2026 I\u2019d like to use really foul language. I won\u2019t do it. I was going to say they\u2019re really full of sh*t. But I won\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nAlford says that it\u2019s possible that Trump, whose style and brand has seeped into the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race, has tapped into something deeper than just one-liners, occasionally-vulgar diatribes and patriotic messaging.\n\n\u201cMaybe voters truly want someone who will shake up Washington, D.C,\u201d he writes. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ve heard all of this before, just inside different packaging. Time will tell if this trend is just a flash in the pan or the fire needed to actually start cooking.\u201d\n\nRead the full column.\n\nJeremy Alford publishes LaPolitics Weekly, a newsletter on Louisiana politics, at LaPolitics.com.
