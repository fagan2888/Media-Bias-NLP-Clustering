Sioux Falls, SD

People at the PREMIER Center had the opportunity to see a special dedication ceremony for a memorial honoring missing POW and MIA soldiers.

This memorial will have a permanent location near the main lobby at the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center. Purple Heart Recipient Ken Teunissen was the chairman of the committee that put together the memorial. He says after three years of hard work, he's happy to see something that's not in any other arenas in the country.

“I would just like to thank the city of Sioux Falls, the mayor, the city council and all the Sioux Falls Residents for allowing this because this is probably the only one in the nation that we are aware of and hopefully this will spread. If nothing else we planted a seed for other cities,” Teunissen said.

The memorial was brought in a week ago.
