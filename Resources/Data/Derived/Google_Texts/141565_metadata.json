Arizona is the only state without an active CHIP program.\n\n\u201cIn effect, this enrollment freeze limited eligibility for children in Medicaid to 152 percent of the FPL (federal poverty level), the lowest income eligibility level in the country,\u201d the report stated.\n\nDr. Daniel Derksen, a professor at the University of Arizona\u2019s Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, said he is not surprised by the state\u2019s high uninsured rate.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those things that would be a relatively easy legislative fix,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest barrier we face in Arizona \u2013 we are the only state in the country that has eliminated the CHIP program.\u201d\n\nJoe Fu, the director of health policy at Children\u2019s Action Alliance in Arizona, agreed that the lack of a CHIP program is what\u2019s holding the state back.\n\n\u201cWithout that program, we have seen that Arizona lags behind its neighboring and peer states in its ability to protect children\u2019s health,\u201d Fu said.\n\nArizona\u2019s ranking came despite the fact that the state did well in terms of gains for the number of Hispanics under age 18 with health care coverage: Uninsured kids in the state fell 2.4 percentage points between 2013 and 2014, the fifth-best increase in the country.\n\nThe report said one characteristic of states with lower uninsured rates for Hispanic children is the expansion of Medicaid coverage. Arizona expanded its Medicaid coverage in 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\nExpanding coverage options for parents can create a \u201cwelcome mat\u201d effect, the report said, that leads parents to enroll their children in insurance programs when they sign up for their own.\n\nDerksen said that while both Medicaid and KidsCare were frozen at the beginning of the recession, only Medicaid has been restored and then expanded under Obamacare. He said continued inaction on the children\u2019s program is a disservice to the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irrational that we continue on this path,\u201d he said.\n\nNationally, the number of uninsured Hispanic children is decreasing at a rate much faster than that of all kids. But Latino children still make up 40 percent of all uninsured kids, while they only account for 24 percent of the children in the country.\n\nThe report pointed to two possible barriers for Hispanics seeking coverage, including a lack of access to materials in Spanish, as well as a fear of providing information due to the immigration status of themselves or their family members.\n\nFu agreed that fear can be a hurdle and said advocates need to focus on \u201ccreating a safe space where parents can take their kids to apply\u201d for coverage.\n\nIn an interview last week before the report was released, a spokesman for Cover Arizona, a coalition working to increase health insurance enrollment in the state, also cited those barriers and added that many people are unaware of their eligibility for Medicaid or tax credits that can help subsidize a marketplace plan.\n\n\u201cNeighbors say it is expensive, so they go by that,\u201d said Cover Arizona\u2019s David Aguirre, referring to potential enrollees.\n\nAguirre said that to combat those barriers, Cover Arizona works very closely with local media to get the message out to the community. Partnerships with Telemundo and print media help it specifically target the Hispanic population, he said, as do opportunities for one-on-one assistance in order to quell fears of deportation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the trust comes in,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cThey confide in us so they don\u2019t have to go through a government agency.\u201d\n\nCalls seeking comment from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the agency that runs the state\u2019s Medicaid program, were not immediately returned Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report says that Arizona had the 10th-highest percentage of uninsured Hispanic children in the nation in 2014 \u2013 the third-highest among states with the largest numbers of Hispanic children.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Jessica Swarner, Cronkite News", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "A new report says that Arizona had the 10th-highest percentage of uninsured Hispanic children in the nation in 2014 \u2013 the third-highest among states with the largest numbers of Hispanic children.", "title": "Report: Arizona fares poorly on health insurance for Hispanic kids", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2016/01/26/report-arizona-fares-poorly-on-health-insurance-for-hispanic-kids/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2016/01/doctor-medicine-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Report: Arizona fares poorly on health insurance for Hispanic kidsArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "health care, health insurance, arizona kids health insurance, hispanic kids health insurance,arizona kids health insurance,health insurance,hispanic kids health insurance", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nationally, the number of uninsured Hispanic children is decreasing at a rate much faster than that of all kids.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A new report says that Arizona had the 10th-highest percentage of uninsured Hispanic children in the nation in 2014 \u2013 the third-highest among states with the largest numbers of Hispanic children.\nThe report said one characteristic of states with lower uninsured rates for Hispanic children is the expansion of Medicaid coverage.\nThe report said one factor behind Arizona\u2019s relatively high rate may be its 2010 decision to freeze enrollment in KidsCare, the state\u2019s children\u2019s health insurance program, or CHIP.\n\u201cThey confide in us so they don\u2019t have to go through a government agency.\u201dCalls seeking comment from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the agency that runs the state\u2019s Medicaid program, were not immediately returned Tuesday."}
