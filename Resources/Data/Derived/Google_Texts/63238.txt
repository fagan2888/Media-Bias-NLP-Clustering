The singer Amanda Palmer has weighed in on the debate over Macklemore’s performance and wins at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. She had recently seen “12 Years a Slave,” the Oscar-nominated film about the horrors of slavery that concludes with producer Brad Pitt playing a cameo role as an emancipator figure.

..more fuel on the fire of a deep-seated, generally unaddressed race problem in america that is simmering loudly getting worse by the second — Amanda Palmer (@amandapalmer) January 28, 2014

as with feminism -> "[we] have a long way to go, & criticizing allies for 'not getting it perfect' is not going to get us there any faster" — Amanda Palmer (@amandapalmer) January 28, 2014

To wit: In the era of slavery in America, white anti-slavery crusaders played the role that Macklemore does today, which is why it’s a travesty when people criticize him for winning an industry award or for performing at the ceremony in a certain way? Except that Brad Pitt’s character actually did free a slave, while Macklemore’s moves toward equality have been far more conceptual, encouraging general acceptance of gay people in an industry he’s hazily alleged to be anti-gay. Also, slavery was slavery.
