During a speech in Austin, Texas on Thursday, President Barack Obama found a new way to express his frustration with Republicans: movie quotes. The president told the crowd of supporters there that he’s starting to feel like Mark Wahlberg’s character in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed.

Obama described the scene in question for anyone who hadn’t seen the Oscar-winning film, in which Wahlberg’s character is on a stakeout with other police officers who end up losing track of the suspect they’re following. When another man asked Wahlberg who he is, he responds, an Obama’s paraphrase, “I’m the guy going my job, you must be the other guy.”

“Sometimes I feel like saying to these guys,” Obama said of Republicans in Congress, “I’m the guy doing my job, you must be the other guy.” Instead of waging a “political stunt” like suing him for taking executive action, Obama had a different challenge for his opposition: “Do something!”

“It is lonely with me just doing stuff,” he said. “I’d love it if the Republicans did stuff too.”
