Known as \u201ccarders,\u201d these middlemen bring together hackers who have stolen credit card data and criminals who make illegal purchases with the pilfered information.\n\n\u201cSecurity breaches and the theft of American credit card data have reached epidemic proportions, costing time and money for both businesses and consumers,\u201d Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), who is backing the measure along with Rep. Randy Forbes Randy ForbesOvernight Regulation: Supreme Court rejects GOP redistricting challenge Supreme Court rejects GOP challenge to Va. redistricting plan GOP rep: Details of Iran's treatment of US sailors disturbing MORE, (R-Va.), said in a statement shortly after the bill passed by voice vote.\n\n\u201cCyber crime has a very real financial impact on those affected, and also on the underlying cost of doing business, and we must provide law enforcement with the tools necessary to bring these criminals to justice,\u201d Langevin added.\n\nThe CARDER Act would remove some barriers its backers say are preventing the Department of Justice (DOJ) from going after people who operate overseas forums selling stolen credit card data.\n\nCurrent law requires the DOJ to prove that information used in the fraud or profits were \u201cmoved through the United States.\u201d\n\nBut many of these \u201ccarders\u201d operate overseas and are not involved in actual hacking or the subsequent fraud, often keeping them immune from legal action, according to the bill's supporters.\n\nThe CARDER Act would allow DOJ prosecutors to go after anyone caught with stolen credit card data with an intent to defraud, regardless of where they or their profits are located, as long as a U.S. company issued the card.\n\nThe bill, Forbes said, would \u201censure bulky, outdated requirements don\u2019t hinder the Department of Justice\u2019s ability to prosecute criminals outside the U.S. who commit crimes that harm Americans.\u201d\n\nThere is no specific timeline for the bill to head to the full House floor. But if the CARDER Act does ultimately pass the lower chamber, the Senate has already approved identical language as part of its recent cybersecurity bill, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), according to Langevin\u2019s office.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Supporters say the DOJ needs more tools to take down overseas dark Web markets.", "description": "Supporters say the DOJ needs more tools to take down overseas dark Web markets.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Supporters say the DOJ needs more tools to take down overseas dark Web markets.", "title": "House committee OKs bill to counter stolen credit card forums", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261790-house-committee-oks-bill-to-counter-stolen-credit-card-forums", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/creditcard_120215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261790-house-committee-oks-bill-to-counter-stolen-credit-card-forums", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-02T12:05-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Randy Forbes,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-02T12:05:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/261790-house-committee-oks-bill-to-counter-stolen-credit-card-forums", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Supporters say the DOJ needs more tools to take down overseas dark Web markets.", "card": "summary", "title": "House committee OKs bill to counter stolen credit card forums"}, "dcterms.title": "House committee OKs bill to counter stolen credit card forums"}, "article_summary": "The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday approved a bill aimed at cracking down on the cyber thieves who profit from stolen credit card information.\nKnown as \u201ccarders,\u201d these middlemen bring together hackers who have stolen credit card data and criminals who make illegal purchases with the pilfered information.\nThe CARDER Act would remove some barriers its backers say are preventing the Department of Justice (DOJ) from going after people who operate overseas forums selling stolen credit card data.\nADVERTISEMENTThe Cybercrime Anti-Resale Deterrent and Extraterritoriality Revision (CARDER) Act would give law enforcement more tools to go after foreign criminals who sell credit card data stolen from Americans to fraudsters, often on dark Web forums.\nThe CARDER Act would allow DOJ prosecutors to go after anyone caught with stolen credit card data with an intent to defraud, regardless of where they or their profits are located, as long as a U.S. company issued the card."}
