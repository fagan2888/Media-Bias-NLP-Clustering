French Hill of Little Rock.\n\nA Malvern native, Curry was elected to the Little Rock School Board in 2006 and served three terms. She retired from state government after 27 years of service in education and the public audit of banks.\n\nShe was appointed to the Arkansas Division of Volunteerism by former Gov. Mike Huckabee and reappointed by Gov. Mike Beebe.\n\nThe 61-year-old Curry now works with small-business owners and families as a tax consultant.\n\nIn 2013, she announced plans to run for lieutenant governor, but she later said she would not seek the office so Democrats could unite behind John Burkhalter, who won the nomination and went on to lose in the November 2014 election to Republican Tim Griffin.\n\nAfter deciding not to run for lieutenant governor, Curry considered running as a 2014 candidate for the 2nd District congressional seat but ultimately chose not to.\n\nCurry said in an interview Wednesday, \u201cA lot of the constituency and people that I know that have been supportive of me over the last 10 years, almost, said that, \u2018We\u2019d like to see you continue to be an advocate for the people in our community.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said her campaign issues will include ensuring that all have access to quality educational opportunities, \u201cwhether they\u2019re public or charter\u201d; preserving Social Security; creating economic stability and jobs; and keeping the Affordable Care Act in place.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has been a good thing, I feel, for our nation and our state,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople that never had access to health care have been now able to have health care. A more healthy America and a more healthy Arkansas is definitely a plus for us.\u201d\n\nHill supports repealing the law.\n\nCurry said she will work hard to energize voters.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s going to need a lot of mobilization to get people back to the polls to vote. A lot of people didn\u2019t vote in the last election,\u201d she said.\n\nNo other Democrats have announced for the 2nd District seat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Democrat Dianne Curry of Little Rock announced Wednesday she will run for the 2nd District congressional seat currently held by first-term Republican Rep.
