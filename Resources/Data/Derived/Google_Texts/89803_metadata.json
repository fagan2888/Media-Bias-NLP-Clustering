Beware of French counterfeits!)\n\nSometimes, though, you got the feeling that whatever private got ordered to go out and take the photos for the catalog didn\u2019t really have his heart in it. Some of the pictures in the catalog wouldn\u2019t pass muster on Craigslist. For instance, it\u2019s a little difficult to get a good sense of what these army dress boots really look like in this shot:\n\nAnd this winter jacket might sell better if it were modeled by an attractive soldier rather than being flung down on a concrete floor.\n\nBut even the most talented marketing pro would have a hard time making some of the merchandise look appealing.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Calculated Revival of the Russian Orthodox Church\n\nWhat am I bid for this wooden crate of rusty old mufflers that look as though they were left out in the rain?\n\nAnd how about this \u201cfloating crane\u201d that doesn\u2019t really float so well anymore?\n\nThen there\u2019s this decommissioned cable-laying ship. It\u2019s hard to make out the details, but it\u2019s also hard to blame the photographer for not wanting to take one step further onto that dock.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Takes on Putin in Berlin Speech\n\nIn addition to the barbecue gear touted by the Ministry of Defense on Twitter, the auction offers a large number of food preparation items that \u201cpromise to cause rabid excitement\u201d among prospective buyers, according to the ministry. Indeed, who could resist this attractive rolling oven?\n\nOr this fully-equipped field bakery?\n\nAnd finally, for the military surplus enthusiast who has bought up enough gear to outfit his own private army, the ultimate topper: A Russian general\u2019s hat.\n\n(Hurry!
