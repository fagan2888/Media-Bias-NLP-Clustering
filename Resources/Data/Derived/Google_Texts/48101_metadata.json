The gunman apparently fired shots out the window of a vehicle, then sped off.\n\nEmergency responders found Carruthers just outside an apartment section that was riddled with bullet holes.\n\nDetails on what she saw and what she did to prevent the children from becoming victims of the rampaging shooter are not likely to surface until her accused attacker is brought to trial, Fuller said.\n\nJason Brian Dalton, 45, of Cooper Township, was arrested early Sunday morning in connection with that shooting and others. He was being held in the Kalamazoo County Jail facing multiple murder and felony firearms charges.\n\nEight people were shot. Six died.\n\nFuller said Carruthers' parents are very concerned about her and want to keep her isolated while she heals.\n\nThe other survivor of Saturday night's attacks, 14-year-old Abigail Kopf, of Battle Creek, continues to be monitored at Bronson Methodist Hospital.\n\n\"Abigail remains critically ill but is continuing to show improvement,\" her parents, Gene and Vicki Kopf, of Battle Creek, said in a prepared statement. \"She is responding to staff, has given thumbs-up and wiggled her toes. We anticipate further improvement over the next several days.\"\n\nKopf was accompanying a group of women on a night out in Kalamazoo when they were approached by a gunman outside the Cracker Barrel restaurant in Texas Township and shot. The group included Barbara Hawthorne, 68, of Battle Creek, whom Kopf called \"Grandma Barb\" and considered her pretend grandmother.\n\nThey were in a vehicle with Mary Jo Nye, 60, and Dorothy \"Judy\" Brown, 74, both of Battle Creek. In another vehicle was Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda. She was the sister-in-law of Mary Jo Nye. All except Kopf were killed at about 10:24 p.m. Saturday in the restaurant parking lot.\n\nPolice say the women had dinner at Cracker Barrel before attending a show at Western Michigan University's Miller Auditorium. They were returning to the restaurant parking lot to retrieve one of their vehicles when they were attacked.\n\nBetween the attack on Carruthers and the attack on the women at Cracker Barrel, the gunman shot and killed Richard Eugene Smith Jr., 53, and his son Tyler Daniel Smith, 17, outside the Seelye KIA car dealership on Stadium Drive in Kalamazoo.\n\nPolice said the father and son were in the dealership parking lot after hours looking a new cars when they were approached suddenly and shot at about 10:08 p.m.\n\nIn their statement, Kopf's parents said, \"We appreciate all of those who have donated or offered to donate to help with family and medical expenses. In addition to the Battle Creek Community Foundation fund, we have approved a GoFundMe page which was set up in Abigail's name.
