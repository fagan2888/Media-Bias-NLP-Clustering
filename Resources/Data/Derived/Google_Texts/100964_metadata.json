Readmission rates dropped from 21.5 percent to 17.8 percent from 2007 to 2015, according to the findings, and rates for nontarged conditions declined from 15.3 percent to 13.1 percent.\n\nAlthough the study also found an increase in observation status, researchers noted the trend began in 2008, two years before the passage of the ACA. Moreover, researchers found that while the \"preventable readmissions\" measure has trended downward, so too have overall returns to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, a broader measure that encompasses observation stays as well as readmissions.\n\n\"Readmission trends are consistent with hospitals' responding to incentives to reduce readmissions, including the financial penalties for readmissions under the ACA,\" the authors wrote. \"We did not find evidence that changes in observation-unit stays accounted for the decrease in readmissions.\"\n\nIn an HHS blog post, Rachael Zuckerman, an economist with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, presented the research as vindication for the readmissions program in the face of the allegations of deceptive hospital practices. She said that \"the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program is just one part of the Administration's broader strategy to promote better care, smarter spending and healthier people by paying providers for what works, unlocking healthcare data, and finding new ways to coordinate and integrate care to improve quality\" through advancements such as accountable care organizations.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the blog post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEvidence grows of link between increased observation stays, lower readmissions\n\nAs readmissions fall, observation status rises--even at hospitals outside readmissions program\n\nObservation status, ED visits create illusion of fewer readmissions, quality gains\n\nNew Virginia law requires hospitals to inform patients of observation status\n\nSenate hears providers' concerns about observation status crisis\n\nSenate committee hears stories on observation status, two-midnight rule\n\nNo one-size-fits-all strategy for readmission reduction\n\nNon-clinical care coordination process improves discharge process, reduces readmission\n\n'Patient navigators' reduced readmissions, overuse of ER in pilot program\n\nBest practices to reduce costly readmissions", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research discounts the theory that hospitals were able to\u00a0reduce readmissions and avoid federal financial penalities by increasing observation status admissions.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "New research discounts the theory that hospitals were able to\u00a0reduce readmissions and avoid federal financial penalities by increasing observation status admissions.", "title": "Fed data contradicts theory that observation stays skew readmissions data", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/fed-data-contradicts-theory-observation-stays-skew-readmissions-data/2016-02-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act (ACA),Care Delivery,Health and Human Services,observation status,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,readmission reduction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "New research discounts the theory that hospitals were able to reduce readmissions and avoid federal financial penalties by increasing observation status admissions.\nAlthough the study also found an increase in observation status, researchers noted the trend began in 2008, two years before the passage of the ACA.\n\"Readmission trends are consistent with hospitals' responding to incentives to reduce readmissions, including the financial penalties for readmissions under the ACA,\" the authors wrote.\nMoreover, researchers found that while the \"preventable readmissions\" measure has trended downward, so too have overall returns to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, a broader measure that encompasses observation stays as well as readmissions.\n\"We did not find evidence that changes in observation-unit stays accounted for the decrease in readmissions.\""}
