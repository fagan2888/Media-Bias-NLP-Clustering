Metro area residents woke to find blanket of three to nine inches of snow covering neighborhoods Sunday, but the storm is expected to give way to warmer temperatures on Monday, according to the National Weather Service.

“We had a large, narrow band of snow that went over the metro area,” with the greatest accumulation in the Arvada, Westminster area,” NWS meteorologist Kyle Frieden said.

Snow showers are expected to decrease through the day Sunday.

Temperatures, which wer in the low 20s in Denver at about 8:30 a.m., were forecast to hit the mid-50s on Monday, before climbing to the low 60s on Tuesday, Frieden said.

Snow, along with some rain, could be back on Wednesday.

Road conditions were dicey Sunday morning, with Aurora, Boulder, Thornton on accident alert.

By 9 a.m., road conditions were improving from earlier in the day, said Mike Murray, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokesman.

“The traffic has vastly improved since earlier this morning,” Murray, said.

Early morning snow slowed and “crews were able to get on top of things. You are still going to find some icy spots here and there. Conditions in the mountains look pretty good.”

Traffic was heavy heading west bound into the mountains, “especially for this late in the morning,” Murray said.

“It’s hard to say whether people are going up skiing or go somewhere to watch the Super Bowl.”
