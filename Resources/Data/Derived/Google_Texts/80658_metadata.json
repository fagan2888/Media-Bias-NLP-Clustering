Australia (Tony Abbott, whose platform featured a rejection of climate change hokum, was elected prime minister), Japan (the country dramatically scaled back its 2009 carbon emissions pledges) and Poland (which fired its environmental minister just days into the COP-19/Conference of Parties climate change forum) all sent a clear message that they would not be bound to any economically destructive international agreements based on fraudulent science.\n\nIn terms of COP-19 \u201caccomplishments,\u201d the Obama administration pledged to have U.S. carbon reduction targets in place by the 2015 Paris conference and there was a loose agreement on a \u201closs and damage\u201d (a wealth redistribution scheme compensating developing countries for damages from greenhouse gas emissions with funds from developed countries) plan. Such \u201ccommitments\u201d are best to be taken with a grain of salt, however, given the poor record of nations keeping such promises.\n\nOne 2013 event that held out hope for man-made climate change advocates was Typhoon Haiyan, a category 4 storm that struck the Philippines in early November. Having recast their focus on \u201cextreme weather events\u201d (instead of rising temperatures) as the litmus test for the existence of man-made climate change, the alarmists viewed Haiyan as a godsend.\n\nIn the wake of the storm, the main stream media and climate change alarmists trumpeted their message of linkage between climate change and the storm\u2019s intensity. Following the hyperbole emanating from these messengers of doom, however, a number of scientific analyses and historical hurricane records were published that conclusively debunked any such linkage. In fact, claims of causality between purported climate change and Haiyan\u2019s intensity carried about as much water as similar calls linking \u201csuper storm\u201d Sandy and climate change the year before.\n\nThe typhoon was the highlight of a normally active Pacific hurricane season, but the Atlantic Basin was quite tranquil with the region experiencing the fewest number of hurricanes in 30 years. Of thirteen named storms, only two became hurricanes and only one of these made landfall in the U.S. Mexico experienced a total of eight storms, with three making landfall as hurricanes. Of greater significance, however is the long term record that shows no trend of increase in the number or severity of U.S. hurricanes since 1990 (2013: Slowest Hurricane Season in 30 Years, Anthony Watts, November 25, 2013).\n\nAnd what about those global sea ice trends? Perhaps one should ask those aboard the MV Akademik Scholkalskiy, the misfit bunch of researchers and tourists who went venturing off to the Antarctic to see how climate change was affecting sea ice. Well, to paraphrase a famous play, a funny thing happened on the way to the Douglas Mawson base camp (the researchers mission was to recreate the 1912 exploits of the Australian scientist).\n\nThe latest news was that the ship was stuck in ice 15-feet thick with attempts by several other ships to rescue the crew members rendered unsuccessful due to similarly poor seafaring conditions. In fact, the latest satellite data shows that Antarctic sea ice is at record highs while Arctic sea ice is up 35% or more from last year\u2019s low levels. Translation: global sea ice is now well above the historical average.\n\nPerhaps the crowning achievement of the alarmist community in 2013 was the IPCC\u2019s release of its Fifth Assessment Report, or AR5, another IPCC publication that came up well short in the credibility column. Most laughable among the report\u2019s conclusions was the statement claiming improved confidence in projections of rising temperatures despite the increasingly yawning disconnect between actual global temperatures and rising CO2 levels. Thus is the logic of the IPCC. Welcome to the global warming \u201cpause,\u201d 17 years and counting. [Editor: Catch up with the latest definitive rebuttal to IPCC alarmism, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change or NIPCC.]\n\nIn an effort to refute this widening decoupling, the \u201ctrue believers\u201d like Heidi Cullen continued to grasp for straws, claiming that the earth\u2019s warming is taking place in the deep ocean with the effects to become more profound in the future. The problem with people like Heidi Cullen, Al Gore and NOAA\u2019s James Hansen, is that their predicted apocalyptic events are always in the future, thus in order to avoid accountability.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/there-is-no-denying-mother-nature/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/global-warming-climate-change-antarctic-ship-stuck-in-ice.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "There Is No Denying Mother Nature"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde65b\"", "article_summary": "[Editor: Catch up with the latest definitive rebuttal to IPCC alarmism, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, from the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change or NIPCC.]\nIn fact, the latest satellite data shows that Antarctic sea ice is at record highs while Arctic sea ice is up 35% or more from last year\u2019s low levels.\nTranslation: global sea ice is now well above the historical average.\nIn fact, claims of causality between purported climate change and Haiyan\u2019s intensity carried about as much water as similar calls linking \u201csuper storm\u201d Sandy and climate change the year before.\nAnd what about those global sea ice trends?"}
