Gallagher & Co.\n\nSixty-three percent of employers polled in Gallagher\u2019s 2nd Annual Benefits Strategy & Benchmarking Survey, released on Thursday, said that managing the rising cost of providing group health care benefits was their greatest HR challenge.\n\nMore specifically, employers ranked controlling their health care costs as their top benefits management priority for 2014 by a margin of more than two to one. The second-most pressing benefits priority in 2014 cited by employers was keeping up with regulatory and legislative changes, primarily relating to their obligations under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, only 31% of employers polled said they have quantified the additional costs their company will incur as a result of the health care reform law. What\u2019s more, only 10% of employers have formalized a total rewards or strategic benefit plan that includes measurable objectives for managing employee benefits-related challenges, according to the survey results.\n\n\u201cAlthough organizations may be aware of the changes that are shaping the future of the employee benefits market, the survey suggests that many are not yet ready to face the challenges these changes will bring,\u201d James W. Durkin, Jr., Gallagher\u2019s Itasca, Illinois-based president of employee benefit consulting and brokerage, said in a statement released on Thursday. \u201cThose that adequately adapt to the current reality will optimize their ability to mitigate future costs.\u201d\n\nGallagher\u2019s survey results showed that 62% of employers saw their group health care premiums increase by at least 4% at the most recent renewal, with 25% of employers\u2019 premiums increasing by 10% or more.\n\nBut despite the increasing costs and regulatory complexity, 98% of employers polled indicated their commitment to providing some form of health care coverage to their employees for the foreseeable future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Rising health care costs and evolving regulations continue to be the top human resources challenge facing employers, and many companies are struggling to effectively meet that challenge, according to a new survey by Arthur J.
