There are people who need health care and could not get it. Not everyone working for minimum wage is lazy or undeserving. There are indeed predatory aspects of student loans and of course veterans should receive benefits, but that doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be paths to citizenship for those who want to contribute to the system.\n\nAgain, those who spend their time arguing these issues miss the point and the common thread among them all: money and greed.\n\nThe real division in this country is not between black and white or illegal immigrants and citizens. The division isn\u2019t between Christians and Muslims. It isn\u2019t between the lazy and the hard working. It isn\u2019t even between those who think Tom Brady is a lying, cheating no-good no-talent with an overinflated view of his own self worth and those who think he\u2019s The Second Coming.\n\nThe difference is between those who have the money and those who have not.\n\nThe middle class is shrinking, the poor are becoming poorer and the rich \u2013 the idyll rich, the super rich, the rich who make the decisions and don\u2019t work at all \u2013 are controlling everything everyone else sees and everything you do.\n\nThey don\u2019t want you involved in politics. They own the politicians. They don\u2019t care about taking care of the veterans; they just want us to bankroll more wars to pad their wallets.\n\nBlack and white people have more in common with each other than the rich. They have more in common with those on minimum wage too.\n\nThey actually have more in common with Tom Brady as well \u2013 though I\u2019ll never admit I have anything in common with that cleft-chin Nancy boy, but it is a fact.\n\nRight now people are worrying about racism, sexism and every other ill on the planet without once taking a look at the problems caused by the disproportionate distribution of wealth in this country.\n\nThose who argue \u2013 \u201cHey they worked for it,\u201d are delusional.\n\nThose who berate the poor, the hungry, the tired and the rest of the huddled masses, surely miss the point and sink us further into a slime of stupidity.\n\nBenjamin Franklin once opined we should all hang together for we\u2019ll definitely hang separately.\n\nWe are all hanging separately.\n\nWe divide ourselves into small groups. We\u2019re liberals. We\u2019re conservatives. We\u2019re pro-police. We\u2019re anti-police. We\u2019re pro flag. We\u2019re anti flag.\n\nBut we\u2019re really ignorant. And the greediest continue to take the money and run.\n\nFor those worried about lazy poor people, why aren\u2019t you worried about the lazy rich people who do no work and still rake in cash?\n\nFor those of you worried about illegal immigrants, why aren\u2019t you worried about the jobs gone overseas \u2013 shipped there by corporations that make more money off of cheap labor?\n\nFor those who preach revolution and change, why don\u2019t you get involved and vote?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you volunteer? Why don\u2019t you become a part of your community and help become a decision maker? Don\u2019t buy into the nonsense you can\u2019t have any effect on the system.\n\nDon\u2019t preach to me about how some people shouldn\u2019t get health care when the richest of us never worry about health care and don\u2019t need it.\n\nIn short, there is a division in this country. A real division of meaning and it\u2019s a scary one.\n\nThere are actually people who still like Tom Brady and there are the rest of us.\n\nOh yeah, and there are the Haves and the Have Nots.\n\nTwo clubs.\n\nAnd most of us belong to the larger and poorer one.
