It prohibited donations \u201cdirectly associated with any product, service, or enterprise that would reflect adversely on the NPS mission and image, such as alcohol or tobacco products.\u201d\n\nJarvis\u2019 memo said the Budweiser deal could help develop new policies \u201cas we contemplate potential updates to Director\u2019s Order 21.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Jarvis blocked a proposed ban on bottled water in Grand Canyon National Park after Coca-Cola, which distributes water under the Dasani brand, objected to the deal. Coca-Cola has donated more than $13 million to parks.\n\n\u201cThis deal isn\u2019t a slippery slope. It\u2019s a bungy jump,\u201d Ruch said of the Budweiser agreement. \u201cThis not a modest, limited step.\u201d\n\nThe public-private partnership has become a vital tool for cash-strapped land managers since the late 1990s. Congress\u2019 fiscal 2015 National Defense Authorization Act encouraged the park service to pursue private funding with rules allowing donor recognition for official sponsors and even \u201cnaming rights to any unit of the National Park System or a National Park System facility, including a visitor center.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these centennial partnerships are in keeping with the direction of Congress to leverage private support in tandem with public investment in advance of the centennial,\u201d\n\nthe agency\u2019s chief of public affairs April Slayton said.\n\nThe park service has suspended the alcohol prohibition before. A 2012 deal allowed a California vintner to sell National Park wines. Sales through 2014 earned the National Parks Foundation $78,000\n\n\u201cThe waiver permitting the Budweiser partnership carefully builds on that past successful partnership,\u201d Slayton said.\n\nBudweiser announced the partnership in in a press release that included samples of the \u201cpatriotic packaging featuring the iconic silhouette of Lady Liberty\u201d designed by social media landscape photographer 13th Witness.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage a new generation of beer drinkers to get out there and see what America is made of,\u201d Budweiser spokesman Brian Perkins said in the statement. \u201cAnd where better than in America\u2019s national parks?\u201d\n\nThis week the beermaker backed off a slogan that was part of its wider \u201cUp For Whatever\u201d campaign, which came to life last year when the beermaker took over Crested Butte for a three-day party. The phrase \u2014 \u201cThe Perfect Beer For Removing \u2018No\u2019 From Your Vocabulary For The Night\u201d \u2014 printed at the bottom of Bud Light labels sparked a social media firestorm, that blasted the campaign as encouraging rape and conflicting with the national \u201cNo Means No\u201d campaign.\n\nThe park service has been exploring additional funding avenues for several years as its federal budget tightens and visitation climbs. Last year it proposed increases in visitor entrance fees. The agency in March announced an $11.5 billion backlog in deferred maintenance\n\n. Its 2016 budget request included a $243 million annual increase in operational funding and $300 million a year over the next three years to help rehab tired buildings and roads in places including Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe Budweiser pact is part of the largest fundraising campaign in park history, National Park Foundation interim president Dan Wenk said in an e-mail. \u201cThe goal is hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week the foundation announced a three-year collaboration with Disney to get 500,000 kids in national parks by 2017.\n\nThe National Park Service recently unveiled its \u201cFind Your Park\u201d campaign, the largest marketing push ever for national parks. The idea is to elevate parks as a destination for millennials and urbanites. The campaign includes big-name stars, innovative social media and a website where visitors can upload pictures from national parks with the intent of sparking a road trip.\n\nThe entire \u201cFind Your Park\u201d campaign is privately funded corporate sponsors, Wenk said.\n\nRuch blasted the idea that a beer campaign will help lure younger people to parks.\n\n\u201cDo they really believe a brewery is the path to reaching a new generation?\u201d Ruch said. \u201cFollowing that thinking, all of the baby boomers should have become farmers after Woodstock.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "National parks ink $2.5M marketing pact with Anheuser-Busch", "title": "National parks ink $2.5M marketing pact with Anheuser-Busch", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/01/national-parks-ink-2-5m-marketing-pact-with-anheuser-busch/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150501__20150502_Z00_BZ02BEERPARKSp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150501__20150502_Z00_BZ02BEERPARKSp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-01T15:56:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T05:31:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Beer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d8e\"", "article_summary": "The National Park Service recently unveiled its \u201cFind Your Park\u201d campaign, the largest marketing push ever for national parks.\nIn 1998, then National Park Service Director Robert Stanton issued\u201cDirector\u2019s Order 21\u201d guiding the agency\u2019s fundraising.\nSales through 2014 earned the National Parks Foundation $78,000\u201cThe waiver permitting the Budweiser partnership carefully builds on that past successful partnership,\u201d Slayton said.\nIn its scramble for additional funding to spruce up parks for next year\u2019s 100th anniversary celebration, the National Park Service is, apparently, up for whatever.\nThe park service has been exploring additional funding avenues for several years as its federal budget tightens and visitation climbs."}
