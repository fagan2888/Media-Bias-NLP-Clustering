Whether you're looking for a visit to the desert, an English garden or tropical paradise, a few planters can help create the mood.\n\nReduce your workload and increase your enjoyment with a bit of planning and proper planting.\n\nSelect a container with drainage holes, as well as one that mimics the color and feel of the location you are trying to recreate. Use troughs, stone or other containers made from neutral colors when growing succulents. The container should complement, but not overpower, the simple beauty of the desert plants.\n\nIf you're going for a more tropical feel, keep things warm and natural. Wicker, bamboo and other natural materials work well with the lush foliage and vibrant colors of tropical plants.\n\nOn the other hand, when creating an English cottage setting, add a few terra cotta, metal and basket type containers. Set them on your patio, steps or in the garden to create a focal point.\n\nKeep your plants looking good throughout the season with the proper planting mix. Look for potting mixes with good drainage and water holding abilities, like Schultz Potting Soil Plus (schultz.com). Check the label as some mixes contain enough fertilizer to last the entire season and water-retaining crystals to reduce the need to water.\n\nTo provide the perfect growing conditions for cacti and succulents, use a cactus mix. The potting mix should retain the moisture and nutrients the plants need while also providing the excellent drainage that is a must for these plants.\n\nPlant any orchids added to your backyard tropical paradise in a potting mix designed for these plants. Use an orchid mix that has excellent drainage and aeration, yet retains the moisture and nutrients these beauties need to thrive.\n\nCheck your planters daily and water thoroughly whenever the top few inches of soil are crumbly and slightly moist. Allow cacti and succulents to go a bit drier.\n\nMulch the soil in tropical, herb, vegetable and annual container gardens. Spread a thin layer of shredded leaves, evergreen needles or twice shredded bark over the soil surface. Use fine pebbles for cacti and succulents that like things hot and dry.\n\nAnd don't forget about garden accents. A wattle fence and arbor of twigs and branches work well for an English garden setting, while a water feature can enhance a tropical paradise themed garden. Meanwhile, some southwest garden art can complete the desert scene you're going for.\n\nSo start your vacation this year with a trip to the garden center. Invest in a few containers, the right potting mix and plants. Then plant your way to the retreat of your dreams.\n\nGardening expert, TV/radio host, author & columnist Melinda Myers has more than 30 years of horticulture experience and has written over 20 gardening books, including Can't Miss Small Space Gardening and the Midwest Gardener's Handbook.
