Friendships have been formed with other participants and attendees from similar professional backgrounds and we would be in regular contact on issues of mutual interest \u2014 again initiated by the CWA.\n\nStories have been shared, songs have been sung, we have laughed together and I reflect in wonderment at how someone involved at the conference lit the spark of an idea which merged a rock guitarist, a jazz guitarist and an Irish folk guitarist on one performance panel. This is just one example of what made this conference \"a treasure.\" That said, I don't know how the audience reception and experience of these would appear on a cost-benefit analysis or as an outcome/output.\n\nAs an employer responsible for 16 people's livelihoods, the article where a former CWA employee referred to the \"exact same culture of fear and secrecy\" made uncomfortable reading. The resignations by many people I have come to know and hold in high regard is equally disheartening.\n\nI could not therefore envisage me sitting on panels discussing issues around mental well-being, for example, or experiencing the pleasure of hearing audiences singing along with my songs, knowing that any of those who enabled me to be there were working in a culture of fear and secrecy. If anyone regards this stance as lacking in loyalty and commitment to the conference, then so be it.\n\nFeargal Lynn\n\nCWA three-year participant\n\nCounty Antrim, Northern Ireland", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28302868/feargal-lynn-why-ive-opted-out-cwa", "modificationDate": "2015-06-13T19:42:15-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2025-06-12T15:08:11-0600", "description": "In response to your recent article on CWA, may I expand on why I have chosen to exempt myself from being invited to the conference in the future?", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28302868:view"}, "startDate": "2015-06-13T19:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28302868/feargal-lynn-why-ive-opted-out-cwa", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "In response to your recent article on CWA, may I expand on why I have chosen to exempt myself from being invited to the conference in the future?", "title": "Feargal Lynn: Why I've opted out of the CWA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "In response to your recent article on CWA, may I expand on why I have chosen to exempt myself from being invited to the conference in the future?", "title": "Feargal Lynn: Why I've opted out of the CWA", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28302868/feargal-lynn-why-ive-opted-out-cwa", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-13T19:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Feargal Lynn: Why I've opted out of the CWA", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-06-13T17:36:36-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2df5\"", "article_summary": "As an employer responsible for 16 people's livelihoods, the article where a former CWA employee referred to the \"exact same culture of fear and secrecy\" made uncomfortable reading.\nIf anyone regards this stance as lacking in loyalty and commitment to the conference, then so be it.\nIn response to your recent article on CWA may I expand on why I have chosen to exempt myself from being invited to the conference in the future?\nThat said, I don't know how the audience reception and experience of these would appear on a cost-benefit analysis or as an outcome/output.\nThe resignations by many people I have come to know and hold in high regard is equally disheartening."}
