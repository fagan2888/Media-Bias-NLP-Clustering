Here we have a French president who\u2019s going after ISIS, with bombs, with closed borders, and with an all-out attack, a left-wing politically correct, socialist, French president. And our president, he\u2019s attacking Republicans, specifically Republican governors, because they know that the brunt of this refugee issue is going to be settled by their budgets, and by their neighborhoods. It\u2019s just astonishing to see that the president would make this all about himself, not about the safety and security of the American people. The number one job the president has, protect America, not protect the reputation of Islam.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was saying the US should have admit zero refugees, Huckabee answered, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about a religious test. I\u2019ve never suggested that. And, honestly, if there are children, and there are elderly women, and there are people who have been vetted, the issue is not so much how many or who. The issue is how do we know who these people are? And the fact is, we\u2019re being asked to just trust the federal government, and we\u2019re being told something that is nothing less than fairy dust when they tell us that they have this wonderful process in place. These are the same people who spent half a billion dollars supposedly training Syrian rebels, and ended up training four of them for that amount of money, that gave us the Obamacare website, the explanation that was a total lie for what happened in Benghazi. These are the people that said they would get to the bottom of the IRS attack on conservatives and pro-Israel groups. And now they want us to just trust them that all the people who come here are going to behave nicely, none of them are really ISIS plants, and that we don\u2019t need to fear. We saw what happened in the streets of Paris. And I\u2019ll tell you, the people who are pushing for us to take them in, interestingly they\u2019re not pushing for them to come into their neighborhoods. I don\u2019t see people saying, \u2018Let\u2019s send them to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, let\u2019s send them to Chappaqua, let\u2019s send them to the upper west side of Manhattan.\u2019 The people who are asking for this live behind gated communities and are generally guarded by armed guards. Well, a lot of Americans don\u2019t have that luxury, and they are not comfortable when they see the carnage in Paris, wondering is that what\u2019s coming to their neighborhood next.\u201d\n\nHuckabee was also asked what number of ground troops he would send to fight ISIS. He responded, \u201crather than the number, I think we base it on what we need to do to eliminate ISIS. We can\u2019t do this in a half-hearted way.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Huckabee: Obama's Attacking the GOP While France Is 'Going After ISIS'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Huckabee: Obama's Attacking the GOP While France Is 'Going After ISIS'", "title": "Huckabee: I Don't See People Saying We Should Send Refugees To Chappaqua or Martha's Vineyard - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Huckabee-1118-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/18/huckabee-i-dont-see-people-saying-we-should-send-refugees-to-chappaqua-or-marthas-vineyard/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huckabee: Obama's Attacking the GOP While France Is 'Going After ISIS'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Huckabee-1118-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Huckabee: I Don't See People Saying We Should Send Refugees To Chappaqua or Martha's Vineyard - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, ISIS, Mike Huckabee, President Obama, Syrian refugees,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Immigration,Huckabee", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Syrian refugees", "published_time": "2015-11-18T12:37:10-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t see people saying, \u2018Let\u2019s send them to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, let\u2019s send them to Chappaqua, let\u2019s send them to the upper west side of Manhattan.\u2019 The people who are asking for this live behind gated communities and are generally guarded by armed guards.\nThe number one job the president has, protect America, not protect the reputation of Islam.\u201dWhen asked if he was saying the US should have admit zero refugees, Huckabee answered, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about a religious test.\nHere we have a French president who\u2019s going after ISIS, with bombs, with closed borders, and with an all-out attack, a left-wing politically correct, socialist, French president.\nHe responded, \u201crather than the number, I think we base it on what we need to do to eliminate ISIS.\nThese are the people that said they would get to the bottom of the IRS attack on conservatives and pro-Israel groups."}
