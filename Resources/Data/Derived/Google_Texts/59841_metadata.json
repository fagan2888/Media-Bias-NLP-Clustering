The event brought together healthcare providers, carriers, employers and institutions to discuss the seismic changes that are reshaping healthcare as we know it. The summit featured multiple sessions and compelling keynote addresses. Here, we bring you some of the highlights from the day-long event.\n\nBefore the Bingham Canyon Mine experienced one of the largest human-caused landslides in history, technical experts used sophisticated systems to monitor ground acceleration in the area. Engineers knew the slide was coming, and mine officials used those warnings as a signal to move employees and equipment, which ended up saving lives and millions of dollars in collateral damage.\n\nSpeaking at the Utah Employers Healthcare Summit, Rich McKeown, CEO of Leavitt Partners, uses this analogy as he discusses the landscape of healthcare in the United States.\n\n\u201c[The Kennecott officials\u2019] anticipation, their reaction, their willingness to participate and engage in this discussion and thoughtfully approach the way they did is a model that I think we need to approach healthcare,\u201d McKeown says. \u201cThere are weak signals, there are some strong signals, but there are emerging signals that are telling us how to react and what we ought to do.\u201d\n\nMcKeown co-founded Leavitt Partners with Michael O. Leavitt, former Utah governor and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary. McKeown served as Leavitt\u2019s chief of staff in Health and Human Services. Although the status of healthcare reflects uncertainty, McKeown says that with focused awareness, leaders can take these warnings and steer programs in the best direction. He cites several pressures for leaders to monitor that directly affect healthcare.\n\nEconomic\n\nAmericans have always demonstrated a charitable spirit. In the 20th century, public policy began reflecting that attitude with the creation of Social Security and eventually Medicare and Medicaid. These entitlements are underlying components that alter the way healthcare is funded.\n\n\u201cOver the course of time, we have exercised this ideological compassion. We\u2019ve institutionalized it and it\u2019s created a very significant financial cliff for us,\u201d McKeown says. \u201cThere\u2019s a financial reckoning and this financial pressure is one of the underlying pressures we\u2019re beginning to see.\u201d\n\nOther economic factors include the national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, and the federal deficit that is expected to reach $474 billion this year. Add in an aging population and the growth of health insurance premiums, and it all signals a fundamental weakness in the economy.\n\n\u201cOur borrowing habits in the nation have changed from the creation of infrastructure to consumption, and borrowing for consumption can never lead to prosperity,\u201d McKeown says.\n\nDemographics\n\nIt is estimated that by 2030, one-third of Americans will suffer from chronic disease. Obesity rates continue to climb, creating a culture of illness and high medical expense. Aging baby boomers are moving out of the workforce and living longer, but not necessarily healthier, than any generation before.\n\nMillennials and their children will carry the burden of the country\u2019s healthcare needs. Salt Lake City has the second highest density of millennials in any city across the country, and the way they access medical care is evolving\n\n\u201cThis new population of people are changing the way they are interacting with the healthcare system,\u201d he says. \u201cDemographics are a huge component part of this that is changing the face of healthcare.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nMcKeown says the Affordable Care Act did three things: it expanded access to healthcare, it increased insurance regulation and it established minimum benefits.\n\nEligibility for Medicaid is expanding and insurance carriers are obligated to cover certain procedures as well as eliminate the denial of insurance because of a pre-existing condition. Additionally, dependents under the age of 26 can be covered by a parent\u2019s policy.\n\nWhile the ACA has been mostly unpopular, \u201cwe\u2019re beginning to chip away at the rough edges,\u201d says McKeown. Hundreds of pages of regulations attempt to clarify and guide the program but several unintended consequences have arisen as a result of the act.\n\nInsurance premiums have increased, which McKeown says caused employers to reduce workers\u2019 hours in order to avoid paying for insurance. Also, companies hire fewer people as they cap their employee numbers to stay below federal limits that mandate insurance coverage. Many large organizations no longer cover spouses or partners.\n\nAdditionally, volatile fighting around the ACA has created lasting political partisanship.\n\nThe Supreme Court\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed with the Supreme Court to determine if the ACA is legal. The court ruled the ACA was a tax and not a mandate, while still declaring the act constitutional.\n\nThere continue to be legal challenges to the ACA and each decision is watched with anxiety by people on both sides of the argument.\n\nAnother ruling lets states opt-out of expanding Medicaid. With almost half of the states choosing not to expand Medicaid in 2014, millions of the nation\u2019s poorest people were left without access to medical insurance. States can choose to accept federal funding that would allow them to expand Medicaid eligibility for three years, but then the funding would shift back to the states. Many states have accepted these federal dollars, but others are still facing the decision of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm of legislation. You have a group of people, typically described as on the right, saying the federal government will not be able to live up to its match over the course of time,\u201d McKeown says. \u201cThe other side said, we have this window to be able to give access to people who need it most. From a fiscal perspective, or from a human perspective, we have this dynamic collision that is playing out.\u201d\n\nMove toward value\n\nPatients want to have input in their healthcare. Doctors are learning to listen to patients\u2019 wants and adapt a health program based on their needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving our way toward medical care organizations that provide better quality services, provide lower cost services and engage patients in the process more profoundly,\u201d says McKeown. As an example, he says, one study showed older people were going to emergency rooms because they were lonely and wanted someone to talk to. It was costing insurance companies lots of money.\n\nCarriers determined it was cheaper to hire someone to go out and visit these seniors in their homes, to talk with them and make sure they were taking their medications. It wasn\u2019t long before the company noticed a drastic drop in unnecessary ER visits.\n\nMcKeown calls it the beginning of accountable care organizations, where groups of medical providers, including doctors and hospitals, work together to provide Medicare patients a higher level of care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the system from one where providers get paid for every medical widget they provide,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2026In my opinion, it will be the golden age as soon as we make this transition.\u201d\n\nEmployers\n\nBecause of high costs, health insurance has moved from being a benefit to a boardroom decision. Many employers find they cannot increase wages and pay high premiums. They can\u2019t hire full-time workers because they can\u2019t afford to offer insurance\u2014but they can\u2019t remain competitive to attract skilled workers without paying increasing healthcare premiums.\n\n\u201cThe inability of employers to increase wages because of expanding healthcare has been driving them crazy for the last decade,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2026Employers, talk to your brokers and understand exactly what options you have, because between co-ops and private exchanges and insurance carriers there are a developing set of new options.\u201d\n\nEven with these pressures, McKeown says there is room for optimism. Healthcare is moving toward a value-based system that will be better for everyone. Life expectancy in the United States is climbing.
