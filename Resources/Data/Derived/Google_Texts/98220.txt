Just over 110,000 people signed up for private insurance plans through the state’s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT, during the open enrollment period that ended Feb. 15, according to figures released by the exchange Monday.

The 110,095 private insurance customers includes 68,231 people who also had coverage through Access Health in 2014 and 41,864 new customers. Seventy-seven percent qualify for federal tax credits to discount their insurance premiums, while the rest must pay the full price for their coverage.

It’s not clear how many of the new customers were previously uninsured because the exchange did not ask about insurance status on its application.

Access Health reported that it had 162,494 new customers who used the exchange to sign up for Medicaid, but that figure includes both people who did not have Medicaid in the past and those who previously signed up for Medicaid through the state Department of Social Services and then renewed their coverage through Access Health.

Medicaid enrollment in Connecticut has grown by about 102,000 people between October 2013 — when the first open enrollment period under the federal health law began — and January, according to figures from the state Department of Social Services. People can sign up for Medicaid at any time during the year.

Access Health officials said at the start of the enrollment period in November that they hoped to sign up 70,000 new customers overall and have 110,000 private insurance customers.

The exchange did not have a full breakdown of members' insurance company and plan selection Monday.
