Political strategist Joe Trippi, who managed Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign for president, imagined \u201chuge, involved communities around political issues and candidates \u2026 these people would be an army, ready to mobilize at the first sign that the government was doing that top-down, trust-us-we-know-what\u2019s-best-for-you crap that people were so sick of \u2026 The American people are going to learn how to organize themselves and then watch out.\u201d\n\nFrom the world of academia, Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler argued that the Internet had enabled the rise of a new \u201cnetworked public sphere\u201d that was more open to diverse voices and less driven by big money, and that this new media system would nurture a politics that was more small-d democratic. Over the years, Benkler has pointed to a series of Net-driven successes, including the 2004 blogger-led boycott of Sinclair Broadcasting, the Diebold voting machine scandal, the many revelations published by WikiLeaks, and the grass-roots defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA) as proof of this power shift.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t happened. Ten years since the Internet first emerged as a mass platform for political engagement, power and wealth are incontrovertibly more concentrated than they were a decade ago.\n\nHere\u2019s why. Trippi and Benkler\u2019s optimism (which I once shared) was built on a model of Internet-based power with one fatal weakness: In each case, a dispersed network came together to say no to a more concentrated and powerful institution\u2019s yes. That is, successful collective action happens on the Internet when an external stimulus propels sufficient numbers of independent actors to coalesce in opposition \u2014 not because those independent actors first bring themselves together in concert. The Internet is good at no; it\u2019s not good at yes.\n\nBenkler is right that the new Internet-powered media environment is preferable to the old mass media system. But only up to a point. The networked public sphere does not exist in a vacuum. Its dynamics are also shaped by the tools that we use to traverse it. And joining the public conversation is only one component of exercising power. Indeed, while the barrier to entry to public media has been lowered by the Internet, the proliferation of digital tools and behaviors has not made participation in decision-making or group coordination substantially easier. With so many more of us creating and sharing content, it may actually be getting harder to come to consensus about common goals.\n\nWorse yet, the primary tool we use \u2014 email \u2014 has its own inner logic that makes it useful only for certain kinds of coordination, ones that tend to concentrate power in the hands of \u201cBig Data\u201d collectors (like presidential campaigns) and \u201cBig Email\u201d managers (like the folks running e-activist lists at MoveOn or FreedomWorks). The wonder of email is that it costs (almost) nothing to make more of it. For one-on-one conversations, it works beautifully. But as soon as the list of recipients increases to more than one person, the opportunities for misunderstanding multiply. All unmoderated email lists inevitably have \u201cflame wars\u201d where, lacking the normal visual cues that might temper emotional responses and dampen disagreement, some people attack each other viciously. Even moderated lists often turn ugly. As a result, the best use of email is to be the owner of a big list where you are writing directly to many atomized individuals who can\u2019t respond or talk to each other, but where some fraction will click on a request you make, such as to sign a petition or make a donation. We need better tools if we want to get to yes.\n\nRecall what actually happened in each of Benkler\u2019s cases: The Sinclair boycott was a response to the giant media company\u2019s outrageous plan to air an anti-Kerry documentary on its news stations just weeks before the 2004 election. The Diebold activists thought they had proof that the company helped steal the 2000 election for Bush, and when its lawyers tried to quash the publication of its internal documents, those activists found many allies willing to risk punishment in exchange for a chance to thumb their nose at a powerful enemy. WikiLeaks benefits from excessive government and corporate secrecy: If such institutions were more open by default, WikiLeaks would get far less attention. In late 2011, when the U.S. government and its officials went after WikiLeaks and got third parties like Amazon, Visa, PayPal and Mastercard to stop providing WikiLeaks with hosting and commercial services, even people who were unsure whether they supported Julian Assange rallied to protect his freedom from organized suppression. Likewise, the scrappy activists who stopped SOPA and PIPA benefited from the fact that the Hollywood interests who drafted those bills were so greedy that they overplayed their own hand.\n\nOccasionally thwarting powerful overlords is not the same thing as transforming the system that confers so many advantages on them into one that is more democratic and effective at representing the interests of all. So far, Joe Trippi\u2019s \u201cAmerican people\u201d haven\u2019t learned how to self-organize, at least not in ways that have radically changed either government or corporate America. That\u2019s not to say these things can never happen, just that 10 years into the Networked Age they haven\u2019t yet done so, and we need to ask why.\n\nGenerally speaking, it\u2019s only on the fringes of the political system that we\u2019ve seen new voices gain new power in America. On the right, libertarian outsider Ron Paul was the first to demonstrate, with his 2008 campaign for president in the Republican primaries, how an Internet-enabled candidate could carve out an independent and viable presence all the way through the national party convention without the support of party leaders or elites. Then in 2010, the Tea Party translated its anti-Obama passion into numerous successful campaigns against moderate Republicans in both the House and Senate. The revolt on the Republican right that led to the government shutdown of October 2013 was also powered by a combination of big money and networked grass-roots activism and media.\n\nOn the left, the open Internet and connection technologies have given antiwar and pro-civil liberties dissidents like writer Glenn Greenwald a reach that, if we had a multiparty political system, would surely be rewarded with a healthy segment of the popular vote. Some minority voices and causes, particularly those centered on \u201cidentity politics,\u201d have more salience than in the past. And Occupy Wall Street, which was organized almost entirely outside the contours of \u201cnormal\u201d American politics by anarchists inspired by the protest movements of Europe and the Arab Spring, was able to briefly upend the political debate and focus attention on inequality in America, a topic that the two major parties uniformly ignore.\n\nBut the central contours of American politics really haven\u2019t changed all that much in the 10 years since the rise of \u201cpeople-powered\u201d campaigns, or groups like MoveOn, online fundraising hubs like ActBlue, blogs and social media. The political operating system of big money campaigns, gerrymandered districts, discriminatory ballot access rules that favor the major parties, undisclosed lobbying and winner-take-all elections hasn\u2019t been altered in the slightest.\n\nConsider these facts:\n\n* In 2004, the average cost of winning a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives was $1.26 million (in inflation-adjusted 2012 dollars), according to the Campaign Finance Institute. In 2012 it rose to $1.6 million. On the Senate side, the average winning campaign cost $8.7 million in 2004; in 2012 that average rose to $10.4 million.\n\n* If the Internet was democratizing electoral politics, then small donors would be stepping up and playing a bigger role in helping candidates clear these tougher thresholds. But on the whole they aren\u2019t. In the 2004 cycle, just 8 percent of the money given to House candidates came from donors giving less than $200. In 2012, that percentage inched up to just 10 percent. Big donors (those who give more than $1,000) and PACs still mattered far more to House candidates, delivering a whopping 71 percent of all the money raised in 2012 (which was, in fact, more than in 2004). On the Senate side, the percentage of money going to candidates from donors giving less than $200 didn\u2019t change at all: it was 17 percent in 2004 and 17 percent in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Web democracy fail: Easy to join the conversation but impossible to be heard, and big money speaks loudest of all", "author": "Micah Sifry", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Web democracy fail: Easy to join the conversation but impossible to be heard, and big money speaks loudest of all", "title": "Great for the Tea Party, bad for the people: How the 1 percent conquered Internet activism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/great_for_the_tea_party_bad_for_the_people_how_the_1_percent_conquered_internet_activism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/howard_dean.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Web democracy fail: Easy to join the conversation but impossible to be heard, and big money speaks loudest of all", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/howard_dean.jpg", "title": "Great for the Tea Party, bad for the people: How the 1 percent conquered Internet activism", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Great for the Tea Party, bad for the people: How the 1 percent conquered Internet activism", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, diebold, Editor's Picks, Elizabeth Warren, Glenn Greenwald, Howard Dean, Internet Culture, Joe Trippi, Julian Assange, Micah Sifry, Ron Paul, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5f6d\"", "article_summary": "Benkler is right that the new Internet-powered media environment is preferable to the old mass media system.\nGenerally speaking, it\u2019s only on the fringes of the political system that we\u2019ve seen new voices gain new power in America.\nThe revolt on the Republican right that led to the government shutdown of October 2013 was also powered by a combination of big money and networked grass-roots activism and media.\nThen in 2010, the Tea Party translated its anti-Obama passion into numerous successful campaigns against moderate Republicans in both the House and Senate.\nTen years since the Internet first emerged as a mass platform for political engagement, power and wealth are incontrovertibly more concentrated than they were a decade ago."}
