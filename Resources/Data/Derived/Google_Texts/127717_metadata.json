But these days there\u2019s something other than pizza on their menu.\n\n\u201cI looked at the bottom and it was like ticket shock,\u201d a customer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ve never heard about it before,\u201d another customer said.\n\nIt\u2019s not an ingredient they\u2019re talking about, but rather a 5 percent surcharge added to customers\u2019 bills to help cover the cost employees\u2019 health care.\n\n\u201cThey need it, it enriches their lives. We all know what it\u2019s like to be worried about paying bills and our medical bills,\u201d Double D\u2019s owner Ted Dorr said.\n\nDorr says it\u2019s is not a political statement or reaction to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been wanting to give our employees insurance since we first opened from the very beginning,\u201d Dorr said. \u201cThe last seven years have been pretty tough. It just took a while to finally get it into play.\u201d\n\nDorr says the money will be used to pay for half of the health care costs of all employees, both full- and part-time.\n\n\u201cI know that myself and the rest of the staff really appreciate that Ted and Cindy (his wife) took it upon themselves to kind of help us have a solution to the problem,\u201d an employee said.\n\nThis idea isn\u2019t new. Restaurants throughout California already have similar surcharges in place.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more a necessity than a political statement,\u201d University of Colorado Denver business professor Cliff Young said.\n\nYoung says the added surcharge is simple way to offset health care costs and thinks more restaurants will be using it in the future.\n\n\u201cI think it will be predominantly in service workers like restaurants,\u201d Young said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be that much in retail.\u201d\n\nCustomers are reacting differently to the newest item on the menu.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care, I know what I\u2019m paying,\u201d a customer said.\n\n\u201cThe total cost of the actual food that we ate was $30. The employee health care was only $1.51,\u201d customer Bonnie Bell said.\n\nFor Bell the pizza\u2019s taste was spoiled by the bill\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that it should be shoved in people\u2019s faces like this,\u201d Bell said.\n\nPeople in Florida may soon be grumbling as restaurants there are starting to add the charges as well.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "0.000000;0.000000", "description": "Restaurant patrons might want to take a closer look at their next bill as some are adding a charge they\u2019ve probably never seen before.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/03/05/new-surcharge-at-colorado-restaurants-related-to-health-care/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthcare-surcharge-pkg-co.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthcare-surcharge-pkg-co.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "Restaurant patrons might want to take a closer look at their next bill as some are adding a charge they\u2019ve probably never seen before.", "title": "New Surcharge At Colorado Restaurants Related To Health Care"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthcare-surcharge-pkg-co.jpg?w=1500", "description": "Restaurant patrons might want to take a closer look at their next bill as some are adding a charge they\u2019ve probably never seen before.", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New Surcharge At Colorado Restaurants Related To Health Care"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSDenver.com in Denver is Colorado's Online News Channel with up to the minute breaking news, weather, sports and top spots.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Denver", "ICBM": "0.000000, 0.000000", "keywords": "business, local, news, suzanne mccarroll, syndicated local, bonnie bell, cliff young, double d's sourdough pizza, health care, obamacare, restaurant surcharge, ted dorr", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://denver.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1358cb67b88b4ef2e59895070c511d70?s=16", "news_keywords": "bonnie bell, cliff young, double d's sourdough pizza, health care, obamacare, restaurant surcharge, ted dorr"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s not an ingredient they\u2019re talking about, but rather a 5 percent surcharge added to customers\u2019 bills to help cover the cost employees\u2019 health care.\nYoung says the added surcharge is simple way to offset health care costs and thinks more restaurants will be using it in the future.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be that much in retail.\u201dCustomers are reacting differently to the newest item on the menu.\nThe employee health care was only $1.51,\u201d customer Bonnie Bell said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that it should be shoved in people\u2019s faces like this,\u201d Bell said."}
