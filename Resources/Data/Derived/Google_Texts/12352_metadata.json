The Canadian border is only 50 miles away, and dancers and visitors from Canada mixed with the Blackfeet, and several other tribes. Across the field to the West, the rodeo grounds were filled with Indian cowboys roping, riding, and racing.\n\nOn July 10-13, the Blackfeet hosted their 63rd Annual North American Indian Days on their reservation in Browning, Montana. It is one of the largest pow wow celebrations in the region with 579 dancers registered. But, it\u2019s not just about the competition; it\u2019s also about catching up with old friends.\n\nMilitary leaders from 47 countries around the world were introduced before the start of the Grand Entry. Many leaders were seeing a pow wow for the first time.\n\nIn the rodeo arena, a large group of teenage girls from Hawaii were also introduced. It\u2019s that kind of event. It brings visitors from across the nation; in addition to the wide range of Indian nations.\n\nThe dance arbor is an open, circular facility with bleacher seating around the dance area and covered for sun protection, which was needed this year as temperatures were in the high 80s. Host drums were Bull Horn and Black Lodge. Four announcers shared the duties: Jay St.Goddard, Russell Red Crow, Eldon Weasel Child, and Reuben Little Head.\n\nThrow in a parade, golf and softball tournaments, horse racing and a hand game tournament, and it makes for a busy weekend. There was even a walk/race and a horseshoe tournament.\n\nBrowning is in a beautiful region with Glacier National Park forming the western border of the Blackfeet reservation. Glacier\u2019s peaks, valleys, and lakes were the summer home for tribal members for thousands of years and huge herds of buffalo ranged here and in the rolling country where Browning now sits.\n\nThis is horse country and was immediately evident at the beginning of North American Indian Days. Herds of horses were run through town with riders keeping them moving at a gallop. The parade emphasized the importance of horses to the Blackfeet people. Many were ridden bareback and riders ranged from elders to small youngsters. Two young women on horseback pulled travois, the old time method of transporting tipis and other items from campsite to campsite. Other parade entries were decorated with buffalo hides in tribute to their historical importance to the tribe. It\u2019s no wonder that rodeo is big in these parts with the abundance of horses. The rodeo also offered all the major events for men and women.\n\nMany of Indian country\u2019s top cowboys were signed up. Crowds were numerous, not only for the final rounds but during the elimination rounds leading up to the finals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tipis were placed around the dance arbor, and their lodge poles white against the sky.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/21/north-american-indian-days-pow-wow-celebrates-blackfeet-traditions-155956", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/dancers_dance_at_the_north_american_indian_pow_wow.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "North American Indian Days Pow Wow Celebrates Blackfeet Traditions"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/21/north-american-indian-days-pow-wow-celebrates-blackfeet-traditions-155956", "dc": {"title": "North American Indian Days Pow Wow Celebrates Blackfeet Traditions"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-21T09:21-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "North American Indian Days Pow Wow Celebrates Blackfeet Traditions"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd803b\"", "article_summary": "On July 10-13, the Blackfeet hosted their 63rd Annual North American Indian Days on their reservation in Browning, Montana.\nThis is horse country and was immediately evident at the beginning of North American Indian Days.\nAcross the field to the West, the rodeo grounds were filled with Indian cowboys roping, riding, and racing.\nIt is one of the largest pow wow celebrations in the region with 579 dancers registered.\nThe Canadian border is only 50 miles away, and dancers and visitors from Canada mixed with the Blackfeet, and several other tribes."}
