Senior discounts, priority parking spaces and life experience definitely go in the pro column. Finding affordable health care is a con if you don\u2019t know your options.\n\nAnd employees over the age of 65 have quite a few.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act went into effect, more employers have added high-deductible health plans to their benefits offerings. A survey conducted by the National Business Group on Health found that 4 out of 5 employers will offer a high-deductible plan in 2015.\n\nBut it\u2019s expensive. The federal government set $1,300 as the benchmark for a high-deductible plan for individual coverage. Family coverage costs an average of $2,600.\n\nHigh upfront costs have some older members of the workforce considering a second option: Medicare. However, this could be a big mistake, said Michael Thompson, a principal in the human resources practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n\u201cMedicare is not as rich of a plan as most employer plans,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cTypically, employer plans tend to be heavily subsidized and even more heavily subsidized for people who are older. More often than not it\u2019s a better deal to stick with your employer\u2019s high-deductible plan.\u201d\n\nThompson explained that basic Medicare does not offer prescription drug coverage, which many people over age 65 need. Instead, an employee would need to purchase a separate Part D plan that is not as comprehensive as those offered through employers at discounted rates.\n\nThose considering enrolling in Medicare simultaneously with a high-deductible plan are wasting their time, Thompson said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an active employee, the reality is that your employer\u2019s plan will pay first,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt will be your primary plan. Basic Medicare will pay second. Because of that, Medicare doesn\u2019t even end up paying that much because employer plans are more substantial.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being ineffective, enrolling in Medicare ends an employee\u2019s eligibility to enroll in a health savings account, which has broader financial consequences.\n\nAn HSA is a tax-advantage medical savings account that allows employees to contribute funds that are not subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit, explained Whitney Johnson, an associate professor of business law at St. Cloud (Minnesota) State University. Employees can use the money they\u2019ve saved tax free to pay the high deductibles associated with their employer-provided plans.\n\nTo be eligible for an HSA, an employee must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, Whitney said. Medicare is not a high-deductible health plan.\n\nWhile socking away funds in an HSA and then enrolling in Medicare is an option, the uncertainty of future medical expenses makes that a risky decision.\n\n\u201cFor most employees, it\u2019s still in their best interest, while they\u2019re still active, to stay on the employer\u2019s plan,\u201d Thompson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Getting old is a mixed bag.
