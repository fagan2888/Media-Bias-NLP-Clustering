Since 1922, youth from the United States and its territories have participated in this youth leadership development conference.

It is designed to address the needs and issues of youth while helping to develop capable, competent and caring citizens.\n\nWade Hofmeister\n\nThe program is built upon the Cooperative Extension System's belief that young people can be significant partners in addressing the issues that face our nation especially those affecting youth. The program combines plenary sessions, seminars, discussion groups, and a service learning experience. The nation's most outstanding community leaders, speakers, and educators present the most current and timely information available.\n\nCommunity service, tours, workshops and an evening of culture fill the days and nights of National 4-H Congress. Some of the tours available to the delegates are the Atlanta Zoo, CNN Center, The Atlanta History Center, The Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta Cyclorama, The World of Coca-Cola, the Carter Presidential Library and the Martin Luther King Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach participant, youth and adults, were asked to bring $20 and help to raise enough money to build the third \"Clover House.\" In cooperation with the local Habitat for Humanity Chapter, 4-H members have provided the money in the past to build a \"Clover House.\" Youth will also participate in several other service projects in Atlanta during their \"day of service\" on Monday.\n\nAudrey Hoffman\n\nHoffman, Hofmeister and Link's trip was sponsored by the Morgan County 4-H Leaders' Advisory Committee, Morgan County 4-H Foundation and the Colorado 4-H Foundation.
