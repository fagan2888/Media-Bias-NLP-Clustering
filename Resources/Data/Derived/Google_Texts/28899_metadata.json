It has very little to contribute to the understanding over inequality over the last 20 years, and is not the basis for thinking about the future so much,\u201d Mr. Mishel said.\n\n\u201cSo if we want to talk about changing income inequality, a lot of it is about broadening wage growth and better jobs. And that\u2019s a different set of policies than just human capital development,\u201d he said, referring to efforts to boost workers\u2019 education and skills. \u201cAnd it even includes addressing the top 1% which is something we haven\u2019t really talked about,\u201d he said, referring to the top 1% of the population by income or wealth.\n\nMr. Mishel said the surging wages at the very top of the income distribution had more to do with high executive pay and financial sector excesses than gaps in educational achievement. At the same time, he said wages for college graduates overall have not risen since 2000, suggesting income stagnation affected a much wider swath of the population than just poor communities.\n\n\u201cWe have to really think about the structure of the labor market, the forces at play including unemployment, including business practices, including having unions, the minimum wage, and think about shaping the wages that people earn on their jobs,\u201d Mr. Mishel said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do that we won\u2019t get the mobility that we want.\u201d\n\nU.S. authorities also must think about ways of directly restraining surging compensation and wealth at the very top, a politically sensitive topic in Washington, he said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t avoid the top 1%. In Washington the political parlor game is we don\u2019t want to talk about income inequality in the top 1% because it sounds like income redistribution and we\u2019ve got to raise money from all those people,\u201d said Mr. Mishel. \u201cSo let\u2019s just talk about social mobility. And to me that\u2019s playing pretend. And I don\u2019t want us to play pretend.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Gaps in educational achievement and shifts in technology do little to explain widening income inequality, says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute.", "title": "Economist: Skills, Tech Gap Can\u2019t Explain Inequality", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/10/20/skills-and-tech-gap-cant-explain-inequality-economist-says/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FC238_mishel_P_20141020140731.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Economist: Skills, Tech Gap Can\u2019t Explain Inequality", "description": "Gaps in educational achievement and shifts in technology do little to explain widening income inequality, says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Pedro Nicolaci da Costa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "Gaps in educational achievement and shifts in technology do little to explain widening income inequality, says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-20T18:18:43-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/10/20/skills-and-tech-gap-cant-explain-inequality-economist-says/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-28592", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Gaps in educational achievement and shifts in technology do little to explain widening income inequality, says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute.", "title": "Economist: Skills, Tech Gap Can\u2019t Explain Inequality", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/10/20/skills-and-tech-gap-cant-explain-inequality-economist-says/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FC238_mishel_P_20141020140731.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-28592", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-21T20:02:29-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb641\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMost of the policy discussion is limited to school interventions, go to college \u2013 totally a human capital orientation,\u201d said Mr. Mishel.\n\u201cSo if we want to talk about changing income inequality, a lot of it is about broadening wage growth and better jobs.\nIt has very little to contribute to the understanding over inequality over the last 20 years, and is not the basis for thinking about the future so much,\u201d Mr. Mishel said.\nAnd that\u2019s a different set of policies than just human capital development,\u201d he said, referring to efforts to boost workers\u2019 education and skills.\nIn Washington the political parlor game is we don\u2019t want to talk about income inequality in the top 1% because it sounds like income redistribution and we\u2019ve got to raise money from all those people,\u201d said Mr. Mishel."}
