On Saturday, June 28, a Prayer Gathering for the protection of sacred and burial sites will be held at Mahto Tipila, also known as Devil’s Tower.

Starting at 10:30 a.m. at the Ceremonial Grounds on the west side of Mahto Tipila, those who are able will continue a Prayer Walk around the base—a distance of 1.3 miles—finishing again at the Ceremonial Grounds. Elders and those unable to do the Prayer Walk may stay at the Ceremonial Grounds.

No pipes will be filled but prayer ties and flags may be tied on the trees at the Ceremonial Grounds.

Traditional dress is encouraged and women are asked to wear skirts and no revealing clothing as was our traditional custom. All tribes and people are welcome.

This is not a media event so do not bring cameras, recorders, or film to the ceremonies.

The National Park Service has waived the fee for those coming to the Prayer Gathering.

A potluck lunch will be held at the conclusion of the prayers.

A carpool will be leaving the Mother Butler Center in Rapid City, South Dakota at 7:30 a.m.

Bring you own umbrellas and lawn chairs.
