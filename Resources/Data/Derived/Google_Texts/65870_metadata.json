Trent Franks, R-Ariz., leader of the Congressional EMP Caucus.\n\nFranks emphasized he wasn\u2019t looking to task another federal agency with assessing the U.S. electric grid\u2019s vulnerabilities to EMPs and solar storms, also known as geomagnetic disturbances.\n\n\u201cThere have now been nearly a dozen federal government reports and studies on the dangers, threats and vulnerabilities the U.S. electric grid faces from EMP and GMD, including reports from the EMP Commission, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the National Academy of Sciences, and the U.S. national laboratories,\u201d Franks said.\n\n\u201cAll of them come to similar conclusions. The U.S. electric grid is dangerously vulnerable to EMP and GMD.\u201d\n\n>>> Electromagnetic Pulse: The Clock Is Ticking\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the bill, scheduled for a potential vote this week in the House, makes no mention of assessing threats from electromagnetic pulse weapons.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nConcern over the vulnerability of modern civilization\u2019s electrical backbone isn\u2019t new.\n\nNearly 52 years ago, the government detonated Starfish Prime, a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon, 250 miles above the Pacific Ocean. The electromagnetic shockwave it emitted disrupted electricity and phone service more than 800 miles east of the blast in Hawaii.\n\nBy comparison, the combined total of all the explosives detonated in World War II is an estimated three megatons.\n\n>>> Electromagnetic Pulse: Not If but When\n\nSoviet scientists observed similar effects in their own high-altitude nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War, according to the testimony of a Defense Department official during a congressional hearing in 1997.\n\nThe damage from Starfish Prime resembled the effects of a shockwave of solar wind and magnetic energy sent by the sun in 1859, called the Carrington Event, which hit Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere and caused telegraph systems to fail across Europe and North America.\n\nThe shockwave, called a coronal mass ejection, is associated with solar flares that erupt from the surface of the sun.\n\nScientists consider electromagnetism one of the four fundamental forces of the universe, along with gravity. But electromagnetism is estimated to be about 1 billion billion billion billion times stronger than its more familiar cousin.\n\nUnderstanding the threat is one thing, but protecting against it is another.\n\nExperts have warned that although the military has been hardening its systems for years against the possibility of an attack from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the civilian world is woefully unprepared.\n\nA 2013 report by London-based insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London considered a Carrington-level geomagnetic storm to be \u201calmost inevitable in the future,\u201d and damages could cost the economy from $600 billion to $2.6 trillion.\n\nThe report also estimates that 20 million-40 million people in the United States were at risk of an extended power outage lasting between 16 days to as much as two years if a Carrington-level geomagnetic storm were to occur.\n\nPeter Vincent Pry, executive director for the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill during a hearing in May he believed the damages wrought by an EMP could kill as many as nine out of 10 Americans.\n\nPry also served in the Central Intelligence Agency, as professional staff on the House Armed Services Committee and on the Congressional EMP Commission, which was established by Congress in 2001 to research the U.S. electric grid\u2019s vulnerabilities to an EMP attack.\n\nThe costs of upgrading the grid, by comparison, are a drop in the bucket. The Congressional EMP Commission, for example, estimated a $2 billion investment would be enough to protect the grid, approximately the same cost of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nIn testimony before the North Carolina Joint Legislative Commission on Energy Policy in December 2013, Pry told state lawmakers he estimated $10 million would be enough to protect North Carolina\u2019s grid.\n\nUpgrade costs appear to become even more manageable when considered on an individual ratepayer basis.\n\nMore than 3 \u00bd years ago, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission study found upgrades to protect the power grid from such a blast could mean as little as 20 cents extra per month for ratepayers\u2019 electric bills over three years.\n\nNot willing to wait for the federal government to act on the problem, states have taken it upon themselves to protect their residents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House passed a measure that calls for an assessment of the capability of enemies to attack our power grid.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House passed a measure that calls for an assessment of the capability of enemies to attack our power grid.", "title": "House Passes Measure to Assess Grid Vulnerability to Electromagnetic Pulse", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140625_EMP_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-25T23:12:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wywLUn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House passed a measure that calls for an assessment of the capability of enemies to attack our power grid.", "title": "House Passes Measure to Assess Grid Vulnerability to Electromagnetic Pulse", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140625_EMP_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "Homeland Security", "published_time": "2014-06-25T16:47:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T23:12:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Trent Franks, electromagnetic pulse, power grid, electricity, House of Representatives"}, "article_summary": "But electromagnetism is estimated to be about 1 billion billion billion billion times stronger than its more familiar cousin.\nMembers of Congress want to know more about whether America\u2019s adversaries possess the capability to shut down the nation\u2019s power grid.\nThe U.S. electric grid is dangerously vulnerable to EMP and GMD.\u201d>>> Electromagnetic Pulse: The Clock Is TickingThe Senate\u2019s version of the bill, scheduled for a potential vote this week in the House, makes no mention of assessing threats from electromagnetic pulse weapons.\n>>> NBC\u2019s \u2018Revolution\u2019 Shows Life after An Electromagnetic Pulse AttackThe provision was attached as an amendment introduced by Rep.
