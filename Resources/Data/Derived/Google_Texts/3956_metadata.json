Kyler Elsworth, who started in place of suspended senior leader Max Bullough, hurdled the pile to deliver an electrifying, head-on hit to fullback Ryan Hewitt.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw their offensive linemen\u2019s stance, I knew the way to make a play was to go over the top,\u201d said Elsworth, selected the game\u2019s defensive MVP.\n\nTyler Gaffney ran for 91 yards and an early TD for Stanford, and linebacker Kevin Anderson returned an interception 40 yards for a score late in the first half. But the Cardinal couldn\u2019t follow up last season\u2019s victory in Pasadena with back-to-back Rose Bowl wins, managing just three points from their offense after the first quarter.\n\nThe Spartans have long labored in the shadow of Michigan and Ohio State, but coach Dantonio\u2019s seven-year rebuilding project in East Lansing has put them on top of the Midwest this season with an unbeaten run through conference play.\n\nAfter knocking off the unbeaten Buckeyes in the league title game, Michigan State earned only the Big Ten\u2019s second Rose Bowl win since 2000, even rallying from its first double-digit deficit of the entire season to do it.\n\nCook led the way in his own inimitable fashion, making incredible plays and huge mistakes along the way. Along with his costly interception to Anderson, he also threw two passes that went through the hands of Cardinal defenders, and an interception in the third quarter was wiped out by a defensive holding call.\n\nBut when the Spartans needed big plays in the second half, Cook repeatedly delivered, finishing 22 for 36.\n\nKevin Hogan beat Wisconsin in last year\u2019s Rose Bowl, but he couldn\u2019t match Cook, going 10 for 18 for 143 yards and a key interception for Stanford.\n\nA mere 112 years after the game considered the first Rose Bowl was played in a park elsewhere in Pasadena, Stanford and Michigan State engaged in an old-fashioned slugfest in the venerable stadium that will host the BCS title game Monday night.\n\nMichigan State fans dominated the Rose Bowl grounds and stands, with about 70 percent wearing green in the crowd of 95,173 \u2014 the game\u2019s largest turnout since 1998.\n\nAfter Tournament of Roses Parade grand marshal Vin Scully flipped the coin, Stanford started with a 77-yard drive culminating in Gaffney\u2019s 16-yard TD run.\n\nMichigan State had never trailed by double digits all season long until Jordan Williamson\u2019s field goal put Stanford up 10-0 late in the first quarter, but the Spartans finally connected with a 13-play, 75-yard drive culminating in Langford\u2019s bounce outside for a 2-yard TD.\n\nThe Spartans dominated the second quarter, but Cook handed seven points to the Cardinal shortly before halftime. With Usua Amanam bearing down on him unblocked, Cook inexplicably threw a soft looping pass directly to Anderson, who returned his first career interception untouched for a score \u2014 the first defensive touchdown allowed by Michigan State all season.\n\nA hush fell over the partisan crowd, but Cook responded with a stellar drive in the waning minutes, moving Michigan State 75 yards in 99 seconds and evading pursuit to deliver Pendleton\u2019s 2-yard TD catch 28 seconds before halftime.\n\nThe Spartans had every bit of momentum after Michael Geiger hit a tying field goal, Trae Waynes made a diving interception and the Michigan State defense stuffed Gaffney on a big fourth down. Stanford\u2019s Shayne Skov forced a fumble by Langford inside the Cardinal 10 late in the third quarter, but Cook connected down the middle with Lippett for the go-ahead score early in the fourth.\n\nStanford kicked a field goal with 5:05 left.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Connor Cook passed for a career-high 332 yards and hit Tony Lippett with a tiebreaking 25-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter, leading No. 4 Michigan State to a 24-20 victory over No. 5 Stanford on Wednesday night in the 100th Rose Bowl.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Connor Cook passed for a career-high 332 yards and hit Tony Lippett with a tiebreaking 25-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter, leading No. 4 Michigan State to a 24-20 victory over No. 5 Stanford on Wednesday night in the 100th Rose Bowl.", "title": "Michigan State wins Rose Bowl to finish season with 10 straight victories", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/1/michigan-state-wins-rose-bowl-finish-season-10-str/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/01/rose-bowl-footballjpeg-09007.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/01/rose-bowl-footballjpeg-09007.jpg", "description": "Connor Cook passed for a career-high 332 yards and hit Tony Lippett with a tiebreaking 25-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter, leading No. 4 Michigan State to a 24-20 victory over No. 5 St", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Michigan State wins Rose Bowl to finish season with 10 straight victor"}, "Author": "Greg Beacham", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Connor Cook, Stanford University, Jeremy Langford, Tony Lippett"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc967c\"", "article_summary": "Michigan State fans dominated the Rose Bowl grounds and stands, with about 70 percent wearing green in the crowd of 95,173 \u2014 the game\u2019s largest turnout since 1998.\nBut the Cardinal couldn\u2019t follow up last season\u2019s victory in Pasadena with back-to-back Rose Bowl wins, managing just three points from their offense after the first quarter.\n4 Michigan State to a 24-20 victory over No.\n5 Stanford on Wednesday night in the 100th Rose Bowl.\nAfter knocking off the unbeaten Buckeyes in the league title game, Michigan State earned only the Big Ten\u2019s second Rose Bowl win since 2000, even rallying from its first double-digit deficit of the entire season to do it."}
