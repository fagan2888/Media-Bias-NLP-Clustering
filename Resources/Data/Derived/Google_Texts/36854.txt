An accident on Interstate 65 involving two motorcycles near Glendale south of Elizabethtown resulted in one fatality and one critical injury Sunday afternoon.

Kentucky State Police dispatcher Joey Mattingly said the incident occurred near mile marker 85 on southbound Interstate 65 at about 1:20 p.m. Both of the people in the accident were motorcycle operators, and the critically-injured person was flown to University of Louisville Hospital, Mattingly said.

Trooper Jeff Gregory said both were traveling south and that the person who was killed was a female, and the other was a male. Neither police official knew whether they were traveling together.

No further details about the accident were available.

Mattingly said southbound I-65 was closed and that traffic was backed up for about six miles, from the site of the accident to exit 91. The Kentucky Transportation Department had been notified, he said, and drivers were diverted to exits 86 and 91. One lane of southbound I-65 was reopened about 8:30 p.m.
