BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) - Three ranches in the Shields Valley have been combined to form a 39-square-mile ranch being purchased by an East Coast buyer.

The Billings Gazette reports (http://bit.ly/1cb4Kdz) that the three ranches have been purchased by a buyer under the name of 4 Diamond Ranch at Wallrock LLC.

Tim Murphy of Hall and Hall properties in Bozeman says it took 18 months to combine the properties together for the buyer. Murphy declined to reveal the buyerâ€™s name.

Murphy says the buyer from the Boston area is interested in a long-term family investment in a working cattle ranch.

The ranches include the 9,600-acre Master Key Ranch advertised for $16.95 million and the 5,848-acre Wallrock Ranch advertised for $7 million.

A third ranch is the 9,600-acre Pulis Ranch, which has yet to close.
