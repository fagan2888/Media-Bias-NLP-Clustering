Campopiano, who had Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, died earlier this month. \u201cEvery experience we\u2019ve had with hospice has been wonderful,\u201d his wife, Lynn, said. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than a million times a year, a terminally ill patient in the United States is enrolled in hospice care. Each time, the family confronts a decision that, while critical, often must be made almost blindly: Which hospice to hire?\n\nA boom in the industry allows patients to choose from an array of hospice outfits, some of them excellent. More than a thousand new hospices have opened in the United States in the past decade. But the absence of public information about their quality, a void that is unusual even within the health-care industry, leaves consumers at a loss to distinguish the good from the bad.\n\nThough the federal government publishes consumer data about the quality of other health-care companies, including hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies, it provides no such information about hospices.\n\nAfter years of public pressure, Congress in 2010 required that the government publish information about hospice quality, but the Medicare agency said in May that such consumer information would not be forthcoming until 2017 \u2014 at the earliest.\n\nSimilarly, state records of hospice inspections are often unpublished, sparse, and, when they are available, difficult to find and understand. Government inspections of hospices have typically been scheduled about every six years, though Congress in September called for more frequent checks.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the evidence-based data about hospices is simply not available,\u201d said Naomi Naierman, president of the American Hospice Foundation, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nA report from the congressional watchdog group that oversees Medicare put it this way: \u201cWe do not have sufficient data to assess the quality of hospice care provided . . . because publicly reported information on quality is generally unavailable.\u201d\n\nThe absence of information forces families to speculate and hope for the best \u2014 to roll the dice \u2014 when choosing medical care for a loved one facing death.\n\nIt also allows hospices that offer poor service to escape detection, while the care at better hospices goes unrecognized.\n\nUsing Medicare data that the government has yet to publish in a form that consumers can easily use, The Washington Post has created a guide for hospice patients and their families that offers insights into the operations of almost every hospice in the United States. While not comprehensive, the guide includes measures that experts say can help gauge the quality of care.\n\n\n\nHospices vary widely in ways that can affect patient care. But consumers can benefit from knowing how a hospice compares to others on certain important measures. Here's a guide to those measures and data on over 3,000 hospices.\n\nThe information was gleaned from reports that hospices are required to file with Medicare, and it relies on them for accuracy.\n\nBecause hospices can vary widely in quality, consumers should use care when choosing one. Indeed, according to a battery of Medicare statistics, some appear to be offering scant care: 18 percent of hospices do not provide continuous nursing care or inpatient care for patients in crisis; a similar proportion regularly fail to have a registered nurse visit the patient in the 48 hours before death; and at hundreds of hospices, more than a third of patients drop hospice services before death \u2014 a sign that the patients may not have been getting adequate care.\n\nThe reasons that some hospices stint on care may be at least partly financial. Medicare, the chief source of industry revenue, pays hospice companies per day of care \u2014 about $155 for a \u201croutine\u201d day \u2014 regardless of how much care is actually provided. That means that the less a hospice spends on nursing and other services, the more it can profit.\n\nThe hospice \u201ccame in and promised the world,\u201d said Janice Holan, whose husband, a lung cancer patient, died at home under the care of a Pittsburgh-area hospice. \u201cAnd when it really mattered, they delivered nothing.\u201d\n\nHolan, a nurse, had tried to make sure the hospice company would provide good care. It had been recommended by her husband\u2019s doctor, and when the company sales representative turned up at their home, Holan asked several questions.\n\nWas the hospice doctor reliable? Could her husband get round-the-clock medical care at his bedside when necessary? Did they have enough nurses?\n\nYes, the representative said, and the outfit, known as Horizons Hospice, was hired.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d heard of them but didn\u2019t know much more,\u201d Holan said.\n\n\n\nJanice Holan, with her daughter Darlene Holan and a photo of her husband, Robert Holan, says the Pittsburgh-area hospice she chose to care for Robert when he had lung cancer \u201ccame in and promised the world. And when it really mattered, they delivered nothing.\u201d (Joe Appel/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn the night before he died, Robert Holan was in pain, coughing and choking. A nurse from the hospice visited the home and discovered that he lacked needed medicines \u2014 medicines that should have been there all along, according to family members, who have initiated a lawsuit against the hospice.\n\nThe nurse could not get the right medicines sent because the hospice doctor was unreachable and Holan\u2019s primary-care doctor was out of the country. After about a half-hour visit, the nurse then said, \u201cSorry,\u201d and just left, said Janice Holan and her daughter Darlene.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d Janice Holan said. \u201cMy husband was suffering. There was nobody here.\u201d\n\nHospice officials declined to comment.\n\n\u2018Luck of the draw\u2019\n\nThe number of Americans receiving hospice services has surged in recent decades, and this is at least in part because many have experienced good care. Indeed, some families offer almost reverential praise for the services they have received.\n\nTake, for example, Robert Campopiano of Falls Church, Va. Years ago, both of his parents received hospice care. So did his mother-in-law.\n\nAt 74, stricken with ALS, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, Campopiano received hospice care from Capital Caring, a large nonprofit provider in the Washington region.\n\n\u201cEvery experience we\u2019ve had with hospice has been wonderful,\u201d his wife, Lynn, said.\n\n\n\nRobert Campopiano uses a keyboard and computer to communicate with his family and hospice nurse in June. During his illness, the Campopianos received a nursing visit at least once a week and a social worker and chaplain arrived twice a month. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nCampopiano, a retired government worker and a retired Marine, entered hospice care in February after breathing troubles landed him in the hospital for nine days. During a visit this summer from his hospice nurse, Jessi ZuHone, Campopiano had a feeding tube and, because his breathing was affected by the disease, he typed most of his remarks into a computer that reproduced his words in a robotic voice.\n\nAsked about his decision to enroll in hospice care, Campopiano typed into the computer keyboard. The robotic voice said, \u201cIt\u2019s the way life is,\u201d and Robert gestured, shrugging and turning his palms up. He smiled.\n\nThe Campopianos got a call every morning between 9 and 10 from the hospice to check his status. During one of the morning calls, Lynn reported a stomach problem. Another time, she reported that Robert seemed more dependent on the oxygen machine. Both times, the hospice sent out a nurse or another staff member to check in.\n\nIf nothing was wrong, the Campopianos received a nursing visit once a week, and a social worker and chaplain arrived twice a month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very comforting to have them come out, as much for me as for him,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIf I needed someone in the middle of the night, I knew they would be there.\u201d\n\nRobert died this month with his wife and children nearby. Toward the end, hospice nurses were with him continuously, Lynn said, offering \u201cphenomenal\u201d support.\n\nThe fact that the Campopianos found a hospice they like may be entirely a matter of chance.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how we ended up with Capital Caring,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cI think we were assigned them at the hospital? Maybe it was the luck of the draw?\u201d\n\nProfits or patients first?\n\nThe Post\u2019s consumer guide shows information that can help identify hospices that provide suitable care, according to experts. For example, two of the measures presented in the database were proposed as quality measures by experts working for MedPAC, which provides congressional oversight of Medicare.\n\nThe database shows, among other things, whether the hospice has provided more intense levels of care for patients suffering a crisis; how much it spends on nursing visits per patient; and whether it has won approval from one of three outside accrediting agencies, the Joint Commission, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care and Community Health Accreditation Program, or CHAP.\n\nThe figures reflect positively on Capital Caring\u2019s Capital Hospice in Virginia: It has been around 30 years, it has provided patients with both types of crisis care, and it has won accreditation from CHAP.\n\nBy contrast, the hospice that served the Holans has provided no or negligible amounts of crisis care to patients, according to the Medicare data.\n\nOther hospices that the Holans might have turned to appear better, according to the statistics. One, for example, is Forbes Hospice, which has been around at least 31 years, provides crisis care and spends more than is typical on nursing. Another is Gateway Hospice, which pays more for nursing per patient day than others in the state.\n\nThe chief operating officer of Gateway, Mary Tobin, noted that the industry is changing into \u201cbig business.\u201d\n\nDuring her 15 years in the field, Tobin said, she has come into contact with other hospices that \u201cbase their decisions on finances and resource constraints. But you can\u2019t go wrong if you put the patient first.\u201d\n\nNo hospice is perfect, however. It is an inherently human enterprise, and even good hospices can make mistakes.\n\nCapital Caring makes some extra attempts to avoid them. It has created a call center from which operators can call every patient once or twice a day. Administrators generate a daily report of patients whose pain has not been adequately controlled. (On a recent visit, only about 1 percent of its 1,200 patients fell into that category.) That list is sent to managers, and those patients receive extra attention.\n\nWhile such efforts are expensive, Capital Caring benefits from its size and donations, which amount to about 10 percent of its $75 million annual operating expenses.\n\n\n\nJim Rice, the director of TeleCaring at Capital Caring, discusses the work schedule with specialists Victoria Hayes and Pam McKinley in Falls Church. When Robert Campopiano was receiving hospice, he and his wife, Lynn, received calls from such a call center every day to check on Robert\u2019s condition. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nTentative monitoring efforts\n\nDespite the public\u2019s interest in more information about hospice quality, Medicare\u2019s efforts to define and measure quality at the nation\u2019s hospices have been halting.\n\nThe Medicare program has been trying since 2000 to come up with ways for hospices to measure and report the quality of their patient care. The federal government has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in attempts to statistically define hospice quality.\n\nIn 2005, Medicare formally proposed that \u201chospices collect the data necessary to evaluate the quality of care they are providing and use this information in a systematic and retrievable way.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2008 that the proposal was adopted, however, and it did not specify what data would be collected.\n\nIn 2010, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Congress called for hospices to report some information about quality \u2014 information that would be defined by Medicare.\n\nBut since then, progress has been delayed.\n\nIn 2012, Medicare specified one quality statistic, related to how much pain patients were experiencing, for hospices to collect and report.\n\nIn May, however, Medicare changed course, dropping that statistic and specifying seven other quality measures. It also announced that any such information will not be available to the public until 2017 at the earliest.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that public reporting of quality data is a vital component,\u201d the agency leaders wrote, also calling for surveys of patients. But \u201cit is critical to establish the reliability and validity of the [quality] measures.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult for a variety of reasons to measure hospice quality, experts said. Many patients cannot communicate; if you ask family members instead, their perceptions can vary widely.\n\nBut the vast growth of the hospice field \u2014 nearly every other Medicare patient enrolls in hospice care now \u2014 makes the need for more public information urgent, according to consumer advocates.\n\nRobert Krughoff, founder of checkbook.org, a consumer advocacy and service group, said that in a few states, including Florida, a little hospice information has become public. But even in those places, he said, there is very little to go on. Families are left to judge a hospice in the same way they might hire other household help \u2014 by asking friends and family for recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing you do when you hire a roofer or a landscaper,\u201d Krughoff said. \u201cIt just happens that in the health-care field, the stakes are very, very high.\u201d\n\n\u2018Gone when we needed them\u2019\n\nOn the night before Robert Holan died, the harried nurse from the hospice discovered that the \u201ccomfort kit\u201d \u2014 the emergency medicines many home patients are equipped with \u2014 was not in the home.\n\nThe nurse, who introduced himself as \u201cMichael,\u201d needed a drug called atropine from the kit to ease Holan\u2019s breathing, coughing and choking, Janice and Darlene Holan said.\n\nBut when the nurse reached the hospice doctor\u2019s office, the doctor was \u201cnot to be bothered,\u201d Michael said, according to Janice and Darlene.\n\nBefore leaving, family members said, Michael told them: \u201c \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t do anything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA few months later, the family learned that the hospice doctor \u2014 the one who could not be reached \u2014 had been considered by authorities to be one of the largest sources of illegal opiates in the Pittsburgh area. Oliver Herndon is serving an 11-year sentence for fraud related to pain-killer prescriptions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a believer in hospice,\u201d Janice Holan said. \u201cAs a nurse, I know how much it can help families. But when he was dying, and when we really needed them, they were gone. And we had no way of knowing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hospice, elder care, terminally ill patients, health care, Medicare, hospice regulation", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "More consumer data that could help patients make choices will not be forthcoming until at least 2017.", "title": "A dilemma for the dying: Absence of information about hospice outfits forces patients to choose blindly", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/quality-of-us-hospices-varies-patients-left-in-dark/2014/10/26/aa07b844-085e-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/18/Others/Images/2014-06-18/FI-HOSPICEQUALITY%200021403098385.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dtkeating"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/quality-of-us-hospices-varies-patients-left-in-dark/2014/10/26/aa07b844-085e-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hospice, elder care, terminally ill patients, health care, Medicare, hospice regulation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "aa07b844-085e-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "More consumer data that could help patients make choices will not be forthcoming until at least 2017."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe312c\"", "article_summary": "But \u201cit is critical to establish the reliability and validity of the [quality] measures.\u201dIt is difficult for a variety of reasons to measure hospice quality, experts said.\nThe federal government has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in attempts to statistically define hospice quality.\nIn 2012, Medicare specified one quality statistic, related to how much pain patients were experiencing, for hospices to collect and report.\n(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)Tentative monitoring effortsDespite the public\u2019s interest in more information about hospice quality, Medicare\u2019s efforts to define and measure quality at the nation\u2019s hospices have been halting.\nIt also allows hospices that offer poor service to escape detection, while the care at better hospices goes unrecognized."}
