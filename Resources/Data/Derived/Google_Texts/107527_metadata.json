University of Southern Denmark\n\nHere\u2019s a quick reminder on fat, if you needed it: We have both brown and white. You probably know the white fat, because it\u2019s the one that shows on your belly and your thighs. It\u2019s the fat that stores energy as large droplets, contributing to obesity. Brown fat, however, is special. When we\u2019re born, about five percent of the fat on our bodies are of the brown kind, small in droplet size and rich in energy-producing mitochondria, which burn calories. Knowing this, it would make sense to want more brown fat and less white fat, and new research has found this may be possible by converting the latter to the former.\n\nUsing advanced genome sequencing techniques, researchers from the University of Southern Denmark found that a protein called KLF11, which is found in all fat cells and regulates their expression, could be manipulated to turn white adipose tissue brown. White adipose tissue is typically classified as either visceral, meaning it surrounds organs, or subcutaneous, which means it\u2019s under the skin. By turning some of this white fat brown \u2014 or as the researchers call it, turning it \u201cbrite\u201d \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t only help people who are obese lose weight but also reduce their risk of obesity-related diseases like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.\n\n\u201cWe stimulated browning in human white adipocytes by [using] a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, and compared white and \"brite\" fat cells,\u201d said Professor Susanne Mandrup, lead author of the study from the university\u2019s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, in a press release. \u201cThis showed that \u2018brite\u2019 fat cells have distinct gene programs which, when active, make these cells particularly energy-consuming,\"\n\nAlthough previous studies have found that simply being in a cold environment could stimulate the growth of brown fat, doing so just isn\u2019t practical. Therefore, researchers have been developing therapeutic techniques. Another study from 2012 found that a diabetes drug \u2014 it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s the same one \u2014 activated a cell receptor called PPAR-gamma, which is affects metabolism and increases insulin sensitivity, leading to the growth of brown fat from white fat.\n\nBy figuring out a way to create \u201cbrite\u201d fat in humans, the researchers may be able to lower obesity rates throughout the U.S. Over a third of the country\u2019s adults and 17 percent of its children are considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSource: Mandrup S, Loft A, Forss L, et al.
