President Obama will address the Democratic National Committee at its annual winter meeting on Feb. 28 in Washington, D.C.

This is the first time Obama has spoken in person at a DNC meeting since 2010, DNC spokesman Michael Czin confirmed to The Hill.

That year, the Republican Party won a majority in the House, gaining more than 60 seats.

At the February 2010 winter meeting, Obama expressed his commitment to the healthcare reform law, which Congress passed a month later.

“Let me be clear: I am not going to walk away from health insurance reform. I'm not going to walk away from the American people. I'm not going to walk away on this challenge,” Obama said. “"I'm not going to walk away on any challenge. We're moving forward. We are moving forward. Sometimes, we may be moving forward against the prevailing winds. Sometimes it may be against a blizzard! But we're going to live up to our responsibility to lead.”

The Republican National Committee held its winter business meeting last month.
