Or perhaps, the healing period coincided with a nudge from Peyton Manning.\n\nEither way, Broncos\u2019 receiver Emmanuel Sanders was back on the practice field Thursday. He has been in and out of practice and the preseason because of his leg injury.\n\nIf all goes well, Sanders will have a chance to get his first preseason reception Saturday night against the Houston Texans in what will be a final tuneup to the regular season for Broncos\u2019 starters.\n\n\u201cI know Peyton was happy for me to be out here,\u201d said Sanders, who signed a three-year contract with the Broncos in March to replace Eric Decker. \u201cHe texted me last night and told me that he would like me to be out here today practicing and catching balls, so it was fun.\u201d\n\nAlthough another top receiver, Wes Welker, missed his second consecutive practice Wednesday for personal reasons, many Broncos\u2019 first-stringers are getting healthy just in time for the third preseason game, which traditionally is the exhibition when the starters get the most playing time.\n\nDuring practice Thursday against the Texans, Broncos running back Montee Ball got his first serious 11-on-11 activity since his appendectomy on Aug 4. Defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson (hip) and linebacker Von Miller (knee) also got a few more reps.\n\nThe final determination on whether those three will play Saturday against Houston won\u2019t be made until game day.\n\nHarris update. Starting cornerback Chris Harris definitely won\u2019t play Saturday, although he\u2019s coming along well in his recovery from anterior cruciate ligament surgery and is scheduled to start the season opener Sept. 7 against Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cRight now, I have a little split-second that I have to tune up,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat comes with practice reps. I\u2019ve only been practicing for a couple weeks.\u201d\n\nClowney gets Tamme\u2019d. If he were the type, Broncos tight end Jacob Tamme would have stood with arms crossed and chest puffed during practice down time Thursday with the Texans. Instead, the unassuming Tamme seemed uncomfortable with the suggestion he got the better of Houston\u2019s imposing rookie Jadeveon Clowney as they knocked heads during a 9-on-7 drill Wednesday.\n\nClowney sat out the rest of practice Wednesday and didn\u2019t participate Thursday. If Clowney suffered a concussion, the Texans aren\u2019t saying. His status for the game Saturday at Sports Authority Field is uncertain.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know what happened there,\u201d Tamme said. \u201cIt was a pretty normal block. It might have been helmet to helmet. I\u2019ve received about a thousand texts on it. Sometimes freak stuff happens on little plays like that if your helmets hit.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. There was little doubt Jordan Norwood was going to make the Broncos\u2019 53-man roster. He would have been their top returner while mixing in as a receiver. But Norwood suffered a torn left ACL during practice Wednesday and is finished for the season. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed for him and for us, selfishly,\u201d said Broncos coach John Fox. \u201cI know he\u2019s disappointed just like we are.\u201d \u2026\n\nThe Broncos and Texans started disliking each other during their first practice Tuesday. On Wednesday, tempers began to simmer. During practice Thursday, ill feelings rose to a full boil. During one, bench-clearing skirmish, a few haymakers were thrown, although none seemed to do any damage. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the nature of the game,\u201d said Broncos left tackle Ryan Clady. \u201cWhen it\u2019s not your actual teammate, you\u2019re going to want to lash out and fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders returns to Broncos, may get chance to play Saturday", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders returns to Broncos, may get chance to play Saturday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/21/emmanuel-sanders-returns-to-broncos-may-get-chance-to-play-saturday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821_013957_emmanuel-sanders-1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821_013957_emmanuel-sanders-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T17:04:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:20:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb5d\"", "article_summary": "Either way, Broncos\u2019 receiver Emmanuel Sanders was back on the practice field Thursday.\nDuring practice Thursday against the Texans, Broncos running back Montee Ball got his first serious 11-on-11 activity since his appendectomy on Aug 4.\n\u201cI know he\u2019s disappointed just like we are.\u201d \u2026The Broncos and Texans started disliking each other during their first practice Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the nature of the game,\u201d said Broncos left tackle Ryan Clady.\n\u201cI know Peyton was happy for me to be out here,\u201d said Sanders, who signed a three-year contract with the Broncos in March to replace Eric Decker."}
