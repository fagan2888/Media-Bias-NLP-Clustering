That's the percentage by which the U.S. budget deficit has shrunk in the first 11 months of this fiscal year from the same point last year.\n\nWonkbook\u2019s Chart of the Day: Average welfare declined in 35 states under the ACA, a new paper finds. That decline, however, was largely attributed to state decisions, not elements of the law.\n\nWonkbook's Top 5 Stories: (1) Islamic State plan policy and economic fallout; (2) the Fed's rate-guidance dilemma; (3) an Obamacare for every state; (4) problems plaguing the Ebola response; and (5) the quiet drop in deportations.\n\n1. Top story: The policy and economic implications of the plan to battle the Islamic State\n\nU.S., allies try to choke off Islamic State funding. \"Treasury and other U.S. agencies will need to implement a hybrid strategy that both diminishes the coffers of a state while ferreting out the secretive financial channels of a terrorist organization, according to current and former U.S. officials....Stopping Islamic State's oil sales will require much stricter policing of Turkey's borders with Syria as well as those controlled by the semiautonomous Kurdish Regional Government in Iraq, current and former U.S. officials said. Tracking the terrorist group's oil infrastructure shouldn't be difficult if regional governments cooperate....The U.S. and the European Union are also redoubling their efforts to cut off the funding of Islamic State from overseas donors.\" Jay Solomon in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nU.S. already has Arab, European allies. How broad can the U.S. go? \"Membership of this coalition appears to be wide open, with the United States actively appealing to nations normally regarded as adversaries. During a trip to China, National Security Advisor Susan Rice urged Beijing to assist in the fight against the Islamic State. There is also a possibility that Iran will play a part in the international coalition, but it is unknown if and how the United States would work with Tehran....Hicks also says the involvement of the French is key for building credibility.\" Sebastian Payne in The Washington Post.\n\nExplainer: Four questions about the Obama ISIL strategy. Daniel W. Drezner in The Washington Post.\n\nOn 9/11 anniversary, U.S. has weakened al-Qaida groups around the world but hasn't wiped them out. \"Even as Obama warned that 'it will take time to eradicate a cancer' like the Islamic State, the timing of his remarks...underscored how elusive the finish line has been for the United States in a series of conflicts that have come to resemble a permanent war. Although the conventional wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have essentially concluded, the United States is still battling al-Qaeda affiliates in countries including Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. None of those groups has been eradicated, or even degraded to a degree that would allow U.S. counterterrorism operations to end.\" Greg Miller and Craig Whitlock in The Washington Post.\n\nOverseas conflict a wild card for U.S. growth, economists say. But oil prices should be relatively stable. \"The U.S. is also better off because of increasing domestic oil production and the potential for new industries to grow on the back of that cheaper energy supply, Mr. Carson said. Indeed, a majority of economists don't believe global oil prices will change over the next six months as a result of turmoil in the Middle East. One-third said the instability might lead to a slight increase in oil prices. Economists cited the situation in Ukraine as the largest threat to global growth, followed by monetary missteps by central bankers and structurally high unemployment.\" Nick Timiraos in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nExplainers:\n\n13 years after 9/11 spawned hundreds of charities, a list of those remaining. Eleanor Goldberg in The Huffington Post.\n\nShifting tones: How President Obama has talked about 9/11 over the years. Associated Press.\n\nCongress may punt on war powers until after midterms. \"Administration officials said they welcome Congress' imprimatur, to the extent it shows unity and adds legitimacy. But officials also told lawmakers in classified briefings on Thursday that it's not required, because they believe the operations are covered already under the Authorization for Use of Military Force Congress passed in 2001 to target al Qaeda. Most lawmakers \u2014 even the skeptics \u2014 seemed ready to let the matter slide until the lame-duck session....Should Congress not act quickly (or at all) to authorize the use of force in Syria, it won't have operational consequences....But it would set a precedent for legislative-executive-branch relations that some lawmakers and lawyers warn may be deeply damaging.\" Sam Stein, Michael McAuliff and Sabrina Saddiqui in The Huffington Post.\n\nExplainer: What legal experts are saying about the war-powers debate. The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSaudi oil next for Islamic State? \"Syria and Iraq were a good place to start their campaign; but in order to survive and prosper it knew from the outset that it had no choice but to set its sights on the ultimate prize: the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. It is in that direction that the battle for control of the world\u2019s largest oil fields is currently heading. ISIS, which has its origins in al-Qaeda, knows full well that in order to sustain itself as a viable and lasting religious, political, economic and military entity in the region, it has to follow the same objectives established by al-Qaeda when Osama bin Laden broke off his relations with the Saudi monarchy and vowed to bring down the House of Saud.\" Claude Salhani in OilPrice.com.\n\nIslamic State's financial independence poses quandary for its foes. \"The Islamic State has almost weaned itself off private funds from sympathetic individual donors in the Gulf. Such money flows have come under increased scrutiny from the U.S. Treasury. Instead the group has formalized a system of internal financing that includes an Islamic form of taxation, looting and most significantly, oil sales, to run their 'state' effectively. This suggests it will be harder to cut the group's access to the local funding....Nevertheless, financing from Gulf donors may prove more critical in months to come, if U.S. President Barack Obama's mission to 'degrade and destroy' the group succeeds and the group loses territory and finds itself looking abroad for funds.\" Raheem Salman and Yara Bayoumy in Reuters.\n\nExplainer: Oil, extortion and crime \u2014 how the Islamic State gets its money. NBC News.\n\nThe U.S. right now probably can't revoke passports of Americans fighting for Islamic State. \"The United States can deny application for or completely revoke Americans' passports...if they get committed to a mental institution, fall behind on child-support payments, or join an enemy nation's army. Several lawmakers this week have called upon that last reason....But...the U.S. does not specifically have the power to revoke their passports. That's because ISIS is not a foreign state....Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas introduced on Monday the Expatriate Terrorists Act, which would allow the government to strip the citizenship of those who join or give assistance to a 'designated foreign terrorist organization.'\" Rebecca Nelson in National Journal.\n\nFight against Islamic State could boost Pentagon budget. \"Obama said nothing about what his long-term strategy would cost in terms of increased spending on defense, anti-terrorist activities, enhanced homeland security measures, assistance and training for friendly rebel forces in Syria and the many other related expenses. While the initial cost of expanding U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in northern Iraq to include forays into parts of neighboring Syria can easily be absorbed by the Defense Department\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations, some lawmakers and policy experts anticipate renewed pressure to eliminate automatic across the board spending cuts in the Defense Department budget that are scheduled to resume next year.\" Eric Pianin and Rob Garver in The Fiscal Times.\n\nObama's Syria arm-and-train request to Congress is confusing lawmakers. \"The White House insisted Thursday it needed congressional approval to move ahead with its proposed program to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition, amid confusion across the government as to whether that explicit authority was actually necessary....The confusion seemed to stem partially from the complex web of authorizations that govern what the Pentagon can and cannot do. While the White House says it lacks authority specifically for the 'train and equip' program proposed by the president, the Pentagon is able to provide support for the Syrian opposition outside of that specific initiative. In fact, Kirby said Thursday, the Pentagon has already been providing the rebels with assistance.\"Justin Sink and Kristina Wong in The Hill.\n\nRetired Gen. John Allen to lead the coordination effort. \"Allen comes to the job with vast experience coordinating international allies on the warfront. He served as deputy commander in Iraq's Anbar province from 2006 to 2008, working with Arab partners on organizing the Sunni uprising against al-Qaida. He moved from there to serve for two years as the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military troops and operations in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia. Allen next became the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013, where he worked with international allies who sent troops to the battlefield. As a result of his experience, Allen is very familiar many of the Middle East nations and leaders considered crucial to the latest effort\" Lolita C. Baldor in the Associated Press.\n\nLibertarian wing of GOP giving way to the hawks. \"Among Republicans, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has led the critics of the NSA. His denunciations of government surveillance, highlighted by a 13-hour filibuster against the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan in March 2013, catapulted him into the first ranks of Republican presidential prospects. But if the shift in the Republican mood persists, with growing support for the use of military force overseas and declining concern over civil liberties, Paul's appeal could wane. Notably, the senator has appeared to shift ground in recent days.\" David Lauter in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nPoll: GOP expands edge as party better on terror. Gallup.\n\nRelated: Welcome to the post-Snowden era. Aaron Blake in The Washington Post.\n\nIGNATIUS: Obama's advantages as a reluctant warrior. \"Obama\u2019s preference for working through allies, derided by critics as 'leading from behind,' may offer an advantage now. The United States can use its air power to degrade the Islamic State because it has support from allies in the region \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and (implicitly) Iran. The United States can avoid major ground combat to the extent that it recruits other boots on the ground, from its regional allies. This Muslim cover is essential if the United States is going to fight the next round of the campaign against jihadists without making the mistakes of the past decade.\" David Ignatius in The Washington Post.\n\nYOO: Why Obama doesn't need congressional approval to attack ISIS. \"The 2001 AUMF would apply to the Islamic State if the group is linked to al-Qaeda or other groups/nations/organizations/persons involved with the 9/11 attacks. At one point, it appears, the head of the Islamic State took an oath of allegiance to al-Qaeda, but reports now claim that the former has broken with the latter. Because the AUMF\u2019s application depends on this crucial question, the Obama administration \u2014 if it seeks to rely on the 2001 authorization \u2014 should present evidence to Congress and the American people proving the link. Even if the 2001 AUMF did not apply, however, the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq, passed by Congress in October 2002, provides more direct legal support.\" John Yoo in National Review.\n\nZAKARIA: Don't forget the politics. \"Obama promised to 'degrade' the Islamic State. Good. He also promised to 'ultimately destroy' it. We have not been able to get rid of al-Qaeda. And destroying a group such as this requires defusing the sectarian dynamics that fuel it. That\u2019s not for Washington to do, but it can help make it happen by pressing the Iraqis and enlisting the Saudis and other regional powers. Obama\u2019s military intervention in the region will work only if there is an equivalent, perhaps even more intense, political intervention.\" Fareed Zakaria in The Washington Post.\n\nTop opinion\n\nKRUGMAN: The inflation cult. \"This tribal interpretation of the inflation cult helps explain the sheer rage you encounter when pointing out that the promised hyperinflation is nowhere to be seen....But what about the economists who go along with the cult? They\u2019re all conservatives, but aren\u2019t they also professionals who put evidence above political convenience? Apparently not. The persistence of the inflation cult is, therefore, an indicator of just how polarized our society has become, of how everything is political, even among those who are supposed to rise above such things. And that reality, unlike the supposed risk of runaway inflation, is something that should scare you.\" Paul Krugman in The New York Times.\n\nCONOVER: Obamacare worsens economic inequality. \"The best available evidence suggests that most of the lag in earnings growth for low income workers relative to high income workers can be attributed to the rapid increase in the cost of health insurance benefits provided to workers by employers. More importantly, because of its flawed design, Obamacare will aggravate this problem even further among large firm workers and create unnecessary distortions that will be particularly pronounced in the labor markets for low-wage workers....A far more sensible approach that would avoid all these economic distortions and attendant adverse effects on economic inequality is to get rid of the individual and employer mandates entirely and to make all Americans eligible for standardized tax credits.\" Chris Conover in Forbes.\n\nMcARDLE: Why students can't defeat Big Oil. \"Last year, student activists famously disrupted a Swarthmore College open meeting where the issue was being discussed, which I filed away under 'people with too much time on their hands and an insufficient grounding in enlightenment values.' But according to the Wall Street Journal, the movement is having some effect: Several major endowments, including Stanford\u2019s, have divested from fossil fuels. I find this sort of riveting. I think the odds of this movement having any impact at all on the consumption of fossil fuels are statistically indistinguishable from zero. So why are endowments giving in, and thereby sacrificing potential returns? Why, for that matter, has this so fixated the students?\" Megan McArdle in Bloomberg View.\n\nOSTERHOLM: What we're afraid to say about Ebola. \"There are two possible future chapters to this story that should keep us up at night. The first possibility is that the Ebola virus spreads from West Africa to megacities in other regions of the developing world....The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air....Why are public officials afraid to discuss this? They don\u2019t want to be accused of screaming 'Fire!' in a crowded theater \u2014 as I\u2019m sure some will accuse me of doing. But the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic.\" Michael T. Osterholm in The New York Times.\n\nCHOW: A NATO for Ebola. \"The West African Ebola outbreak is not only killing people; it is shredding the medical front lines and social fabric of the entire region....To make matters worse, those brave people fighting the virus are doing so without the backing of any substantial medical reserve force that could come in with fresh supplies and trained personnel....That needs to change.\n\nEbola's surprise attack against fragile countries, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, demonstrates the compelling need for a new international epidemic response corps that can go straight to a hot zone when needed.\" Jack C. Chow in Foreign Policy.\n\nFRAKT AND CARROLL: Workplace wellness programs usually don't work that well. \"Most news coverage of the new Kaiser Family Foundation annual survey on employer-sponsored health plans has focused on the fact that growth in premiums in 2013 was as low as it has ever been in the 16 years of the survey. But buried in the details of the report are some interesting insights into how employers think about controlling health care costs. One example is that they\u2019re very fond of workplace wellness programs. This is surprising, because while such programs sound great, research shows they rarely work as advertised.\" Austin Frakt and Aaron E. Carroll in The New York Times.\n\n9/11 interlude: Remembering the terror attacks 13 years later, in pictures.\n\n2. Can the Fed change its communication without spooking the markets?\n\nFed may change rate guidance to give itself more flexibility to react to economic changes. \"The Fed has said since March that its benchmark rate would stay low for a 'considerable time' after it completes monthly bond buying intended to boost growth. With purchases set to end late this year and the Fed nearing its full-employment goal, that assurance will soon become obsolete. The need for new guidance unites policy makers who want to keep rates low for longer, like Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, with those who prefer to raise them sooner, such as Philadelphia\u2019s Charles Plosser.\" Jeff Kearns, Christopher Condon and Steve Matthews in Bloomberg.\n\nExplainer: What Fed policymakers are saying. Michael S. Derby in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCan the Fed drop 'considerable time' without spooking markets? \"Investors tend to see the world in black and white. They might look at the removal of the 'considerable time' language as a sign that interest rate increases are imminent....Fed officials want to move away from these commitments, but they want more evidence on the economy\u2019s performance before they decide when to raise rates....They could change considerable time and leave other low-rate cues in their statement \u2014 such as the judgment that there remains significant slack in labor markets. Moreover, Chairwoman Janet Yellen has a tool that Alan Greenspan didn\u2019t have in 2004 \u2014 a press conference to explain the central bank\u2019s views....It\u2019s not clear that officials will dump the low rate assurance this time around.\" Jon Hilsenrath in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSurvey: Fewer economists see rate hikes starting before next summer. Ben Leubsdorf in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe guidance isn't the only challenge. There's also the exit plan. \"Officials now generally agree on several important changes to a set of exit principles first published in 2011, including steps to prevent the Fed's balance sheet from shrinking before rates rise. Most of them also now think the Fed should hold on to most of the housing-backed securities it has purchased. Still under intensive discussion is how to use a newfangled tool...to help sop up excess liquidity when the Fed starts tightening policy....It is increasingly likely the Fed will relegate the new overnight reverse repurchase facility to a supplementary and maybe temporary role, in part due to worries it could spark 'runs' from more risky markets in times of financial stress.\" Ann Saphir and Michael Flaherty in Reuters.\n\nJobless rate may be flawed indicator for Fed policy on rates. \"Perhaps the most puzzling feature of the Great Recession and its aftermath was the sharp decline in the percentage of working-age people in the labor force. You have to be either working or looking for work to be in the labor force. People who are not looking are ignored when the government calculates the unemployment rate, which has fallen to 6.1 percent from a peak of 10 percent....At issue is why all those people are not in the labor force. If it is some sort of structural problem \u2014 most of them either do not want to work or do not have the appropriate skills to obtain jobs \u2014 then monetary and fiscal policy are not going to help.\" Floyd Norris in The New York Times.\n\nU.S. jobless claims rise somewhat, but remain below pre-recession levels. \"Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 315,000 for the week ended Sept. 6, the highest level since late June....The period included the Labor Day holiday and claims tend to be volatile around holidays. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the state level data. The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 750 to 304,000, not far from pre-recession levels and consistent with strengthening labor market conditions.\" Lucia Mutikani in Reuters.\n\nHealth care spending may boost 2nd-quarter growth estimate. \"Revenue at health-care providers rose 3 percent from the first quarter, according to quarterly data on service industries that aren\u2019t adjusted for seasonal swings or price changes. At hospitals, revenue climbed 2.6 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months, seasonally adjusted. That probably means economic growth for the period will be revised up to a 4.6 percent annualized rate, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC....Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.2 percent clip in the second quarter....Health-care spending fell in the first three months of the year.\" Victoria Stilwell in Bloomberg.\n\nOther economic/financial reads:\n\nSkills gap bumps up against vocational taboo.

That may have cost you. \"In the five states most resistant to Obamacare implementation \u2014 Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming \u2014 those purchasing their own health insurance were $245 worse off on an annual basis when compared to enrollees in all other states' individual markets....These 'direct enforcement' states... saw smaller coverage increases over this time. Even though premiums in these states started out lower, they almost caught up by the end of the second quarter of 2014. And though the average cost per enrollee started much lower in direct enforcement states, the costs exceeded all other states by the end of the second quarter.\" Jason Millman in The Washington Post.\n\nStates that embraced Obamacare got healthier enrollees to sign up, keeping costs lower. \"The average welfare improved in six of the eight states that successfully rolled out their own insurance exchanges and expanded Medicaid coverage...the study found. The measure of welfare is determined by a formula based on enrollment figures, changes to premiums and changes to the cost of providing care. States that set up their own exchanges may have done a better job attracting more healthy participants to plans than states that took a handsoff approach, Dr. Kowalski said. Healthier participants help to lower costs per enrollee.\" Eric Morath in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRelated study: Why the geographic variation in health care spending can\u2019t tell us much about the efficiency or quality of our health care system. Brookings.\n\nBackground reading: Remember that red-blue state divide on Medicaid expansion. Here's an update on where states stand. Advisory Board Daily Briefing.\n\nThanks to the ACA, employers brace for more workers on 2015 plans. \"Employers are expecting an influx of workers who haven\u2019t previously taken advantage of company-paid health coverage to do so as more mandates and rules are implemented under the Affordable Care Act, according to a new analysis of large companies. Employee benefits consulting firm Mercer says 22 percent of employer health plan sponsors are 'likely to see enrollment grow' when they are required to open plans to employees who work 30 or more hours per week. Meanwhile, eligible employees who have opted to go without coverage may now do so to avoid tax penalties, which could also trigger an additional increase in workers on company health plans.\" Bruce Japsen in Forbes.\n\nICYMI: High-deductible plans gain clout at workplaces. Jason Millman in The Washington Post.\n\nA rise in health spending may simply reflect a temporary ACA enrollment bump. \"Some who follow costs closely don't think the pace will continue. First, health spending suffered a mini-crash over the winter, as bad storms kept people away from caregivers. Hospitals and doctors billed less from January to March than they did last fall. Part of the second-quarter recovery may just have been catch-up, analysts said. At the same time, many people covered through the health law's online marketplaces didn't sign up until close to the deadline at the end of March. Much of the spring increase may represent a one-time surge as those folks sought treatment for previously neglected conditions. For those reasons, the year-over-year results for the second quarter may give a better indication of longer-term cost trends.\" Jay Hancock in Kaiser Health News.\n\nICYMI: The get-more, pay-less era of health care? Sarah Kliff in Vox.\n\nHouse resumes its anti-Obamacare votes. \"The House approved the bill, 247-167, with the support of all Republicans and 25 Democrats. It was the first vote on the health care law since April.The bill, targeted at President Barack Obama\u2019s promise that consumers would be able to keep their health plans under his signature health law, was sponsored by Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is in a tight race to unseat Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana....The bill would allow insurers to keep selling health plans that are currently available in the group market to be offered through 2019. The scope is broader and longer-term than the administration\u2019s decision to allow certain non-compliant plans to be extended.\" Jennifer Haberkorn in Politico.\n\nBut...

Problems plaguing the Ebola outbreak response\n\nThe global response is running behind due to poor coordination. \"There is no clear sense of who is leading the international response, how funds are being collected and disbursed, which organizations are providing equipment and personnel, and when any of these efforts will make a significant difference....The confusion and lack of coordination have delayed shipments of desperately needed supplies; some of those being pledged now won\u2019t arrive for months. For example, a 62-bed facility that the British government on Monday promised to deliver will take eight weeks to be operational; the 25-bed field hospital the Pentagon has offered will take at least a month before it is up and running. The lagging response means that the relief effort is three to four months behind where it should be, given the seriousness of the epidemic, health experts say.\" Lena H. Sun in The Washington Post.\n\nExplainer: Here's what's needed to make the Ebola relief effort work \u2014 because right now, it isn't working. Sophie Novack in National Journal.\n\nThe U.S. military isn't all-powerful. \"The Department of Defense runs a sophisticated health service for its own troops. Its staff includes infectious disease experts, doctors and nurses. It can set up massive field hospitals almost anywhere. On top of that, the military can do logistics like no other: It can move fuel, food and supplies en masse....But the Pentagon's commitment seems modest in the wake of Obama's comments. It plans to supply Liberia with a 25-bed field hospital \u2014 but no medical staff. The World Health Organization says hundreds of beds are urgently needed....But the military says it can't do everything.\" Geoff Brumfriel in NPR.\n\nICYMI: And the military doesn't have all the Ebola expertise it needs, some say. Lena H. Sun in The Washington Post.\n\nBut the U.S. is planning a surge of workers to Ebola-stricken West Africa and an evacuation procedure. \"About 1,400 U.S. government employees are in the region now, and more are on the way, the State Department said....As workers for global aid groups have fled, 'the vacuum is increasingly being filled' by U.S. aid providers, the department said. In July, two U.S. citizens infected with Ebola in Liberia were evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta by the Phoenix Air Group....The State Department now plans to pay the company as much as $4.9 million over six months to evacuate any U.S. workers who become infected in the future.\" Alex Wayne in Bloomberg.\n\nCould Ebola collapse Liberia? \"Although the minister's assertion was unusual in its severity, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history has indeed created a dire situation for the current government of Liberia. But is it truly a serious threat to the the country's existence? The U.N. special envoy to Liberia, Karin Landgren, seems to agree with Samukai, at least to an extent. Landgren told the U.N. Security Council this week that 'Liberians are facing their gravest threat since war,' referring to two civil wars between 1989 and 2003 that left more than 250,000 dead. Those bloody conflicts completely destabilized the country, and Liberia was still recovering when the current Ebola outbreak began.\" Abby Ohlheiser in The Washington Post.\n\nProfile: From the Ebola front line \u2014 teaching how to stay safe.

The quiet fall in deportations\n\nDeportations down 20 percent, fewest since 2007. \"President Barack Obama has quietly slowed deportations by nearly 20 percent while delaying plans to act on his own potentially to shield millions of immigrants from expulsion....The Obama administration decided as early as summer 2011 to focus its deportation efforts on criminal immigrants or those who posed a threat to national security or public safety....As Border Patrol agents detain more people from countries in Central America, not Mexico, the volume and circumstances of the cases take more time for overwhelmed immigration officials and courts to process because, among other reasons, the U.S. must fly such immigrants home rather than letting them walk back across the border into Mexico.\" Alicia A. Caldwell in the Associated Press.\n\nBackground reading: Who's the real deporter-in-chief: Bush or Obama? Nora Caplan-Bricker in The New Republic.\n\nObama reassures Hispanic lawmakers on immigration action before holidays are over. \"White House chief of staff Denis McDonough pledged to Latino lawmakers during a private meeting Thursday that President Barack Obama will take executive action on immigration before the holidays are over \u2014 an effort to soothe lawmakers furious about the administration\u2019s move to hold off on action. The timeline was described by several members who attended the meeting and, substantively speaking, isn\u2019t different than the end-of-year pledge made by the White House when it moved to delay executive action on immigration until after the midterm elections. But it gives at least some faith to members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\" Seung Min Kim in Politico.\n\nSouthern Border Command planned at DHS. \"The plan would create a Southern Command...bringing together groups of agents from Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, these people said. A Coast Guard admiral would oversee Southcom, and have command over personnel from both agencies, they said. The effort is aimed at reducing the influx of illegal immigrants and improving investigations of criminal activity along the Southwest border.
