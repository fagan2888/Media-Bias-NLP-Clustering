It is all about perspective. It is about understanding. Everything related to communication and effective communication has to do with points of relatability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my unique profile helps me achieve a better platform to be able to communicate our shared values, than I am happy to do that and I consider that an honor,\u201d she added.\n\nGarcia is already in her fourth term serving as a state representative in her home state of New Hampshire. She says that she never had any personal political ambitions until her friend suggested that instead of working for a campaign, she should run her own. She was only 23-years-old when she ran and was elected to her first term in the state House.\n\nShe was content serving at the state level until she began to notice the adverse effects the Obama administration had on one of the signature issues she focused on as a lawmaker \u2014 health care.\n\n\u201cI was very involved in working on healthcare reform in my state,\u201d she told TheDCNF. \u201cI wanted to make that market more consumer oriented. Citizens should be able to make decisions about those services like they do for everything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter working for four years on those issues it was very frustrating for me to see Obamacare take root and really just wreak havoc almost overnight to our healthcare system in my state,\u201d explained Garcia. \u201cWe have so many people who were going to a specific doctor and now they have to travel three hours to find a provider. Premiums have skyrocketed everywhere. And in terms of the exchange there are really not options because we only have one insurance provider in our state so it has really created a monopolistic system.\u201d\n\nThe unraveling of the health-care reform she had dedicated much of her energies to compelled her to campaign against the currently serving U.S. congresswoman from her district, Ann McLane Kuster.\n\nKuster \u2014 a Democrat \u2014 was not in Congress when Obamacare was voted into law, but she has stated publicly that she supports the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to reform the healthcare system.\n\nBut before Garcia faces off against Kuster in the 2014 congressional elections, she needs to beat fellow Republican and current state senator Gary Lambert in the primaries. Lambert has a dual career as an attorney and a member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.\n\nAside from their obvious profile differences, they diverge greatly on certain policy issues \u2014 especially energy, says Garcia.\n\nShe was specifically referring to Lambert\u2019s approval of a multi-state cap-and-trade program \u2014 the Regional Green House Gas Initiative \u2014 which involves admissions regulations and carbon taxes, among other regulatory burdens.\n\nThe prospects of a Republican winning back the district\u2019s congressional seat will be decided by voters who have helped earn New Hampshire a reputation as a swing state. In other words, the election results could tilt either way.\n\nIf she does win an office on the Hill, she hopes to bring some of the sensibility that has allowed New Hampshire to balance its budget, maintain low unemployment numbers, and a high standard of living.\n\n\u201cWe keep electing the same sort of people and achieving the same sort of results, which no one seems to be happy with\u2026 I thought I would throw in my hat,\u201d said Garcia.\n\nFollow Breanna on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
