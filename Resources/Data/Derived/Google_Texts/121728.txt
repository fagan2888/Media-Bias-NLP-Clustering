ASPEN — A recently issued report placed Aspen as No. 9 among Colorado cities with Ashley Madison accounts.

The infidelity study, performed by RoadSnacks.net, concluded that Colorado had more than 207,920 accounts created with Ashley Madison, the website that hooks up frisky people who already are married or in a relationship.

There are more than 32 million Ashley Madison accounts worldwide.

RoadSnacks.net analyzed Colorado’s 139 cities and towns with at least 2,000 residents. Using the Ashley Madison database, RoadSnacks.net counted how many accounts were created in each ZIP code.

“Finally, we used an estimate for the population of the ZIP codes to identify the number of cheaters per capita,” the website said.

Topping the list was the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, which boasted 464 accounts, or 12.5 percent of its population.

Vail ranked No. 5 with 490 accounts, or 7 percent of its population.

Other area towns in the survey included Rifle (No. 13), Glenwood Springs (No. 25), Silt (No. 80), Carbondale (No. 82) and Basalt (No. 91).
