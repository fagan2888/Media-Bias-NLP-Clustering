EUREKA, Ill. -- Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is hoping to invoke the spirit of Ronald Reagan into his bid for the White House.

The Republican Presidential hopeful visited Reagan's Alma Mater of Eureka College Thursday.

Walker says, like Reagan, he hopes to "drain the swamp" in Washington D.C.

The nation's deficit, the Iran Nuclear deal, and Obamacare were all targets.

And lawmakers in his own party were chided for not taking action against the Affordable Care Act.

"...Remember last year, we heard a lot in the campaigns about how if we just had Republican majorities in the Congress after the 2014 election, they'd vote to repeal Obamacare," said Walker. "Well, last time I checked its after Labor day and there's no bill on the President's desk to repeal Obamacare. You see that's why people are upset with Washington. That's why I'm upset with Washington. You see talk is cheap. We need action."

Scott Walker is one of 16 Republican candidates vying for the GOP nomination.
