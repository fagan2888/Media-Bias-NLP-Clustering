U.S. Supreme Court rulings on a range of issues, from Confederate license plates to the Affordable Care Act and gay marriage, once again have the political pundits twisted up over very nature of our glorious founding document.

To wit: Did the Founders intend for the Constitution, put to paper in 1787, to be interpreted literally forevermore? Or did they intend for it to be a living document that would endure and adapt to ages they could not yet fathom?

Tomorrow’s Viewpoints page tackles the argument from both sides. Columnist George Will warns that we are wise to be wary of a “dismaying intimation of a ‘living Constitution’ too malleable to limit government because it conforms to whatever shape serves transitory political and cultural impulses.”

Bloomberg’s Noah Feldman, meanwhile, says the framers hoped to create a living document that would work for all time. Says Feldman: “The organism is alive.”

Lastly, we have another contribution from the great Sean Petrie of Typewriter Rodeo, who urges us on this Independence Day to “Just Breathe.”

He writes:

“Democracy is so, so alive.

And we are governed not by long-dead men

But by a wondrous document that lives

And calmly

Breathes

As we move forward.”

Well-said, Sean. Happy Fourth of July weekend, folks.
