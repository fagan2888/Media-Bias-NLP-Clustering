He\u2019s all about lost glory, lost empire, lost power.\"\n\n*On Bush, post 9/11: \" Had I been in office at the time, I\u2019m not sure I would have differed with his approach.\"\n\n*On Libya, I asked: \"Had the Secretary of State not urged intervention, do you think the President would have done it?\" The former Secretary of Defense responded: \"I think he might well not have. He told me it was an extremely close decision on his part. It was an extremely close call.\"\n\n*Gates doubted he would have inserted special forces the night of the attack in Benghazi, but when I asked him why we don't know what the president and the Secretary of State were doing that night, Gates responded \"I just don\u2019t have any idea what the problem is in finding that information out.\" He added, with reference to the Oversight Committees of Congress, \"if it\u2019s germane to their examination of the circumstances, I would think that they ought to be able to find that out.\"\n\n*Gates urged continued military assistance to Egypt. \"I believe it\u2019s a mistake to cut off military assistance to the Egyptians at this point, because the future of the Middle East is so uncertain right now.\"\n\n*When I asked him about the competence levels on the Middle East of the White House today, Gates responded \"Well, I think, you know, you look at Syria and so on, and I think it\u2019s a matter of concern, that\u2019s for sure.\"\n\n*When talk turned too Vice President Biden, Gates became expansive, and close to transparent on who he voted for in 2012:\n\nRG: Well, I like Biden. I enjoyed working with him. He\u2019s a stand-up guy. I think he\u2019s a person of integrity. But you know, you just go back, he\u2019d only been a Senator two or three years when he voted against the assistance package to South Vietnam that was a central part of the Ford administration\u2019s effort as we had to leave Vietnam to try and give the South Vietnamese government a shot at survival. So then-Senator Biden voted against that aid package, and it was defeated, so no aid went. He voted against every element of President Reagan\u2019s Defense build-up, and President Reagan\u2019s approach to dealing with the Soviets. He voted against the B-1 bomber, the B-2 bomber, the MX missile, and several other weapon systems, voted against all kinds of missile defense. He voted against the first Gulf War. So I think that there\u2019s an ample record there of somebody who\u2019s just too often, particularly when dealing with our major adversary, the Soviet Union, got it wrong.\n\nHH: Did you vote for him in either election?\n\nRG: Well, I think I\u2019ll keep my votes private.\n\nHH: All right, now I go back to the first question as to why he gets it wrong\u2026\n\nRG: But if you listen closely to the answer I just gave\u2026\n\nFinally, we talked about Iran --Gates doesn't think Israel will strike Iran within the next six months but thinks trigger sanctions should be passed by the Congress that will kick in if Iran balks at any significant decision point-- and about America's generals, about why he didn't tell us what he knew before the election, and about Johnny Football and the Cleveland Browns, because after all Gates did lead A&M and some things have to be asked.\n\nRobert Gates has served eight presidents. There's much and more in the book that needs to be explored. It isn't in the nature of most of the talking heads on most of the networks to actually read a book, and to do so closely, but if they do so with Duty, they will learn why so much has gone so wrong in the past five years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Gates was in the news a lot when his memoir Duty first hit stores.
