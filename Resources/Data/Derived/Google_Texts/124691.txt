Don't worry, Obama may not have a strategy now but he penciled in getting a strategy for sometime next year. In the meantime he has more important priorities, like illegal alien amnesty, racial demagoguery and Global Warming.

And suing a county that denied a mosque permission to build in an industrial zoned area.

He'll probably figure this thing out by the end of his term or by the time ISIS attacks America. If not, he'll wear a purple suit to the press conference condemning ISIS for not speaking in the name of Islam.

The information on the laptop makes clear that its owner is a Tunisian national named Muhammed S. who joined ISIS in Syria and who studied chemistry and physics at two universities in Tunisia's northeast. Even more disturbing is how he planned to use that education: The ISIS laptop contains a 19-page document in Arabic on how to develop biological weapons and how to weaponize the bubonic plague from infected animals. "The advantage of biological weapons is that they do not cost a lot of money, while the human casualties can be huge," the document states. The document includes instructions for how to test the weaponized disease safely, before it is used in a terrorist attack. "When the microbe is injected in small mice, the symptoms of the disease should start to appear within 24 hours," the document says. The laptop also includes a 26-page fatwa, or Islamic ruling, on the usage of weapons of mass destruction. "If Muslims cannot defeat the kafir [unbelievers] in a different way, it is permissible to use weapons of mass destruction," states the fatwa by Saudi jihadi cleric Nasir al-Fahd, who is currently imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. "Even if it kills all of them and wipes them and their descendants off the face of the Earth."

We can wake up and start fighting back or we can listen to the Obamanites tell us that all we need is to win over the moderate ISIS Jihadists.
