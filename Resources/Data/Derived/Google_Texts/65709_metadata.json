The studies were funded by the UC Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in a warehouse for years and have had major health problems while I worked for minimum wage with no benefits,\u201d Rafael Sanchez, a warehouse employee in Jurupa Valley, said in a statement provided by Sheheryar Kaoosji, director of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center advocacy group. \u201cIn this situation, I have medical bills I will never be able to pay... .\u201d\n\nThe UCR researchers made three key recommendations:\n\n\u2022 Raise the minimum wage to a living wage \u2014 about $15 an hour, researchers said \u2014 particularly in Ontario, where 338 warehouses were operating in 2013.\n\n\u2022 Incentivize the conversion of temporary positions to full-time jobs through community benefit agreements and union contracts.\n\n\u2022 Reduce the cost of deductibles for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans.\n\n\u201cI would hope that (in) the cities in our region, including the city of Ontario, that policymakers consider raising the minium wage,\u201d said a co-author of the wages report, Ellen Reese, a professor of sociology and chair of the Labor Studies program at UCR. \u201cI think it would help to raise the wage. The city of Los Angeles adopted that kind of policy, and I think it\u2019s definitely a policy we could use in our own region.\u201d\n\nAllison said that in addition to a living wage, more programs could be offered to train people earning low wages to move up into positions with more responsibility and higher pay.\n\n\u201cIf you have a situation where people are routinely being paid low wages, if you can offer a way to move up, it\u2019s not quite as bad,\u201d Allison said.\n\nJohn Husing, chief economist for the Inland Empire Economic Partnership business advocacy organization, said he agreed with the recommendations but disputed the data used and characterized the report as one-sided.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEssentially, what they proved is what they\u2019ve set out to prove themselves, and it is in complete contradiction to the official state data, which shows a much better pay scale for people in this sector,\u201d Husing said.\n\n\u201cOne of the findings is that there are an inordinate number of people working in the field who come from employment agencies,\u201d Husing said.\n\nBut government data, Husing said, show the proportion of warehouse workers from employment agencies to be much lower than the UCR researchers reported.\n\n\u201cThat finding, by itself, shows what they\u2019re doing cannot possibly be accurate,\u201d he said.\n\nHusing and others have long pointed to the logistics industry as a silver lining to the Inland Empire\u2019s economic boom and bust. It\u2019s a path to the middle class, he has said.\n\nThe region\u2019s logistics sector, or the jobs related to the warehousing and transportation of goods to and from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach throughout the Inland Empire, carried the most job growth in the past year, he told a crowded room of business and government leaders earlier this year.\n\nAnd such jobs continue to make news.\n\nWarehouse worker jobs in the Inland Empire are expected to expand significantly with Amazon hiring 2,000 more people to work in its Inland Empire fulfillment centers in Redlands, Moreno Valley and San Bernardino. The Australia-based Goodman Group and its Irvine-based North American subsidiary, Goodman Birtcher, are also continuing development on a $350 million, 2.4 million square-foot logistics complex in Eastvale, designed to accommodate office space, light industry, a shopping center, a hospital and a hotel, according to a description on the developer\u2019s website.\n\nThe project promises to bring hundreds of new jobs to the region.\n\nThe region\u2019s logistics sector, or the jobs related to the warehousing and transportation of goods to and from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach throughout the Inland Empire, carried the most job growth in the past year, Husing said earlier this year. There were 86,000 warehouse jobs in the Inland Empire, according to the latest data by the California Economic Development Department for June 2015, up 8.4 percent from the year prior.\n\nBut researchers say there\u2019s a story behind such numbers.\n\nResearchers from UCR\u2019s Labor Studies program and School of Public Policy\u2019s Center for Sustainable Suburban Development reported they interviewed more than 350 Inland Empire warehouse workers in 2012 and 2013.\n\nTheir jobs, according to the researchers, typically pay less than the living wage, which the authors said contributes to poverty rates in the Inland Empire that exceed poverty rates for California and the nation.\n\n\u201cI think the report gives an accurate picture of what a lot of warehouse workers are going through,\u201d said Kaoosji, of the Warehouse Worker Resource Center. \u201cAnd we think it\u2019s good information.\u201d\n\nThe UCR report comes on the heels of a USC researcher\u2019s report in 2013. It reported that the logistics industry\u2019s reputation as a path to prosperity for less-educated workers and the Inland Empire as a whole is based on misleading analysis that doubles the actual median wage earned by most people in the industry.\n\nIn his eight-page report for the university\u2019s Program for Environmental and Regional Equity, Juan D. De Lara calculated that if you removed the white-collar jobs that were typically put into wage calculations, the median yearly pay for such as job is only $22,000 \u2014 and only $10,067 for temporary workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The warehousing of goods is a top job provider  for the Inland Empire, but UC Riverside researchers say a majority of those jobs typically pay less than a living wage, are often temporary, and do not provide health-ca", "title": "UCR researchers call for raising minimum wage for Inland Empire warehouse workers", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/social-affairs/20150722/ucr-researchers-call-for-raising-minimum-wage-for-inland-empire-warehouse-workers", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20150722/NEWS/150729830/AR/0/AR-150729830.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "894px"}, "type": "article", "title": "UCR researchers call for raising minimum wage for Inland Empire warehouse workers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "The warehousing of goods is a top job provider  for the Inland Empire, but UC Riverside researchers say a majority of those jobs typically pay less than a living wage, are often temporary, and do not provide health-ca", "title": "UCR researchers call for raising minimum wage for Inland Empire warehouse workers", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/social-affairs/20150722/ucr-researchers-call-for-raising-minimum-wage-for-inland-empire-warehouse-workers", "image": {"src": "http://www.sbsun.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LG/20150722/NEWS/150729830/AR/0/AR-150729830.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Inland Empire, Minimum wage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Inland Empire, Minimum wage"}, "article_summary": "One Inland Empire local economist, while agreeing with the researchers\u2019 key recommendations, questions the data they used and the researchers\u2019 objectivity.\n\u201cAnd we think it\u2019s good information.\u201dThe UCR report comes on the heels of a USC researcher\u2019s report in 2013.\nTwo studies were conducted, one on warehouse workers\u2019 wages, and one on access to health care.\nResearchers from UCR\u2019s Labor Studies program and School of Public Policy\u2019s Center for Sustainable Suburban Development reported they interviewed more than 350 Inland Empire warehouse workers in 2012 and 2013.\nWarehouse worker jobs in the Inland Empire are expected to expand significantly with Amazon hiring 2,000 more people to work in its Inland Empire fulfillment centers in Redlands, Moreno Valley and San Bernardino."}
