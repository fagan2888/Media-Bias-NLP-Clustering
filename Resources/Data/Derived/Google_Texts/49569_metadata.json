The tax would be raised by 3 cents per gallon next July 1, another three cents by July 1, 2015, and four cents by July 1, 2016.\n\nThis charge is being led by State Representative Josh Byrnes (R-Osage) who is the chairman of the House Transportation Committee.\n\nAny revenue that is collected from the gas excise tax is allocated to Iowa\u2019s Road Use Tax Fund which is constitutional protected an only supposed to be used to maintain Iowa\u2019s roadways. Currently, regular unleaded gas has a 21 cents per gallon state excise tax. Ethanol has a 19 tax and diesel fuel is taxed 22.5 cents a gallon.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Gazette reported that Byrnes \u201csaid he suspected if the split-control Legislature could get a gas tax bill to Gov. Terry Branstad\u2019s desk, that he will support it like he did the last gas tax increase in Iowa in 1989. So far Branstad has not endorsed any plan.\n\nByrnes, was joined by State Representatives Dennis Cohoon (D-Burlington), Jim Lykam (D-Davenport), Brian Moore (R-Bellevue) and Gary Worthan (R-Storm Lake) in support of the tax increase.\n\nAll of the recent polling that I have seen on the issue a clear majority of Iowans are against such a tax increase.\n\nAnd Byrnes wants to do this in an election year? Politically speaking that is a fool\u2019s errand, and legislators would follow his lead at their electoral peril. Politics aside a tax increase will be hard on Iowa families during a time where many families budgets are stretched by existing high gas prices.\n\nThe Sioux City Journal reports that studies suggest the tax increase would cost Iowa motorists between $50-60 per year. I believe that is a conservative figure. Certainly families who don\u2019t drive much and have cars with excellent fuel economy will be impacted the least by this change. Not everyone is in that boat. Just a personal example my car averages around 20 miles per gallon (Yeah I know, I\u2019d love to have a car with better fuel economy, but just can\u2019t do it right now). I average around 19,000 miles per year. In 2016 I will be paying $95 more, and that is just for my car. What about the transportation industry who is already being impacted by ungodly high gas prices?\n\nDo they think this won\u2019t impact jobs? What kind of impact will this make on our agricultural economy?\n\nI understand we need to keep our transportation infrastructure maintained and I agree that it is an essential function of state government. There are other options.\n\nFor instance State Senator Amy Sinclair (R-Allerton) is the lead sponsor for SF 2042 which would make an annual transfer of 2% of the general fund receipts to the road use fund. She told Caffeinated Thoughts, \u201cIt would be a standing appropriation so would be a stable and consistent source of funding without increasing taxes.\u201d\n\nState Representative Jake Highfill (R-Johnston) plans to file a bill that would send 1/2 of a percent of existing revenue to the road use fund. He told Caffeinated Thoughts that it would provide approximately $270 million annually. \u201cIt constitutionally protects existing revenue without raising taxes. It sets our priorities straight,\u201d Highfill said.\n\nState Representative Jason Schultz (R-Schleswig) also supports a similar approach that he outlined during a Americans for Prosperity event in Logan, IA. He suggested diverting 1 to 2 cents of our current sales tax to the road fund.\n\nThe Iowa Legislature, especially Republicans, need to strongly consider alternative means of funding roads. It does not make sense when the state has been producing a surplus. Also when Iowans see a growing state budget every year under Governor Branstad it\u2019s hard to fathom that the only solution to this problem is to raise taxes.\n\nReader Poll: Should Iowa raise the gas tax?", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/02/raising-the-gas-tax-is-wrong-for-iowa/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gas-pump-12-19-2011_thumb.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-02-03T18:05:21+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-24T06:23:27+00:00", "keywords": "amy sinclair, brian moore, dennis cohoon, gary worthan, gas tax, hsb 514, iowa state budget, jake highfill, jason schultz, jim lykam, josh byrnes, road use fund, sf 2042, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Last Thursday, a Iowa House subcommittee voted 5-0 in favor of House Study Bill 514 which if passed would raise the state excise tax on gasoline by 10 cents over the next three years.\u00a0 The tax would be raised by 3 cents per gallon next July 1, another three cents by July 1, 2015, and \u2026", "title": "Raising the Gas Tax is Wrong for Iowa | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gas-pump-12-19-2011_thumb.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-03T12:29:22-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/02/raising-the-gas-tax-is-wrong-for-iowa/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last Thursday, a Iowa House subcommittee voted 5-0 in favor of House Study Bill 514 which if passed would raise the state excise tax on gasoline by 10 cents over the next three years.\u00a0 The tax would be raised by 3 cents per gallon next July 1, another three cents by July 1, 2015, and [\u2026]", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gas-pump-12-19-2011_thumb.jpg", "title": "Raising the Gas Tax is Wrong for Iowa | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-02-03T12:05:21-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Iowa News & Politics", "modified_time": "2014-02-03T12:29:22-05:00", "tag": "SF 2042"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4e9\"", "article_summary": "Terry Branstad\u2019s desk, that he will support it like he did the last gas tax increase in Iowa in 1989.\nThe Cedar Rapids Gazette reported that Byrnes \u201csaid he suspected if the split-control Legislature could get a gas tax bill to Gov.\nReader Poll: Should Iowa raise the gas tax?\nAny revenue that is collected from the gas excise tax is allocated to Iowa\u2019s Road Use Tax Fund which is constitutional protected an only supposed to be used to maintain Iowa\u2019s roadways.\nCurrently, regular unleaded gas has a 21 cents per gallon state excise tax."}
