Even churches are not exempt from funding abortions.\n\nBut churches in California are refusing to comply with the law. Instead, they\u2019re working with the pro-life legal group Alliance Defending Freedom to file suit against the state. And one church leader is willing to defy the state.\n\nAccording to reports, on Sunday morning Senior Pastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, a nondenomination church in southern California, spoke up against the mandate and has encouraged his congregation to uphold religious values and fundamental liberties in the public square.\n\n\u201cI felt violated; I felt forced,\u201d Hibbs said in response to the abortion mandate. \u201cI love America and I love American history, and I have a lot of invested interest in defending the unborn. I see the Constitution under attack, and I see my religious freedom under attack.\u201d In an interview with Live Action, Hibbs said the DMHC\u2019s decision is a flagrant violation of the right of churches and pastors to freely exercise their freedom of conscience. Hibbs and his congregation have joined six other churches across the state in a legal challenge opposing the coercion. CLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE! Hibbs said he, in concert with pastors named in the legal challenge, will do whatever it takes to send this message to the state of California: \u201cWe will take this to the point of being jailed, if necessary, being arrested, if necessary \u2013 whatever it takes. I cannot violate my biblical worldview,\u201d Hibbs said. \u201cOnce I have to do that, I no longer live in the United States our founding fathers gave me.\u201d \u201cThis abortion issue for a Christian is not a political issue \u2013 it\u2019s a biblical issue,\u201d Hibbs added. \u201cGod is the engineer of life \u2013 he\u2019s the giver of life. I cannot think of a human being more defenseless than an unborn baby.\u201d \u201cWe have been suffering under a rogue government,\u201d Hibbs said. \u201cI think Californians are waking up and churches are starting to wake up. I\u2019m a pastor and I have faith in God, and I know my Bible. He always moves with a small group of people \u2013 he always moves with a remnant.\u201d\n\nLast month, ADF filed the lawsuit, Foothill Church v. Rouillard, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of Foothill Church in Glendora, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino, and The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch.\n\nLast year, ADF and Life Legal Defense Foundation filed formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services against DMHC regarding California\u2019s mandate and its violation of federal conscience law. Those came on the heels of a complaint filed directly with DMHC, which responded by affirming its decision to force all plans to cover all abortions without any explanation as to how that decision squares with the Constitution and contrasting federal law.\n\n\u201cBecause Obamacare requires health insurance coverage, and the California mandate requires abortion coverage in any health plan, these churches are truly left with no way to opt out of paying for abortions,\u201d said ADF Litigation Staff Counsel Jeremiah Galus. \u201cWhat\u2019s absurd, though, is that the same government that rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage. Californians should not be forced to choose between following their deepest convictions and submitting to unlawful and unnecessary government mandates.\u201d\n\n\u201cElective abortions are not part of \u2018basic health care,\u2019\u201d Galus continued. \u201cThey have no business being forced into the medical coverage provided by churches that do not wish to support terminating lives due to very real, sincere, and well-known faith convictions. We hope the court will require California to follow the Constitution and respect these churches\u2019 fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nAD told LifeNews that the concern of many pro-life Californians about being compelled by the government to pay for elective abortions has only been enhanced recently by the knowledge that some of those aborted children may have had their body parts sold for profit. Planned Parenthood has been caught in a series of videos selling aborted babies and their body parts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pastor: I'd Go to Jail Before Being Forced to Fund Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "A California pastor is speaking up against a move by the state to force churches to fund abortions and he says he will gladly go to jail before complying with t", "title": "Pastor: I\u2019d Go to Jail Before Being Forced to Fund Abortions", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/11/09/pastor-id-go-to-jail-before-being-forced-to-fund-abortions/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jackhibbs2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "pastor: i\\'d go to jail before being forced to fund abortions", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A California pastor is speaking up against a move by the state to force churches to fund abortions and he says he will gladly go to jail before complying with the abortion mandate.\n\u201cI felt violated; I felt forced,\u201d Hibbs said in response to the abortion mandate.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s absurd, though, is that the same government that rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage.\nHibbs and his congregation have joined six other churches across the state in a legal challenge opposing the coercion.\nBut churches in California are refusing to comply with the law."}
