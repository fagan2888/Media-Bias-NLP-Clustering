Eric Wood isn't scared to let you know how much he gained on Thanksgiving. (USATSI)

Everyone does Thanksgiving dinner and complains to their relatives -- or people in the general vicinity -- about how much they've gained as a result of stuffing face with turkey.

Few people actually weigh themselves. Bills center Eric Wood did just that and found out he gained 7.4 pounds during Thanksgiving day.

New Thanksgiving tradition I suggest adapting: weigh in when you arrive and leave. Tough to see but I gained 7.4 pic.twitter.com/8omkKsterw â€” Eric Wood (@EWood70) November 28, 2014

This is the part where you think "Oh wow it was only 7.4 pounds that seems kind of reasonable because to be honest I just had my fourth serving of different dessert and that Founders Breakfast Stout I had to top it probably didn't help matters much."
