She asked if the president still planned to kill the savings plan.\n\nMr. Obama, who pulled the proposal two weeks ago in the face of heated GOP opposition to raising taxes on the middle class, said he had learned his lesson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, there were enough people who were already utilizing 529s that they started feeling as if, \u2018Well you know changing like this in midstream, even if I\u2019m not affected right now, I like the program,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth it for us to eliminate it. The savings [to the government] weren\u2019t that great. So we actually, based on response, changed our mind.\u201d\n\nThe president acknowledged that he and wife Michelle are using 529 plans to save for their daughters\u2019 college educations.\n\n\u201cThe folks who used them most were folks who were a little more on the high [income] end,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cA lot of people couldn\u2019t use them because they just weren\u2019t generating enough savings to take advantage of the benefit. Our thinking was you could save money by eliminating the 529 and shifting it into some other loan programs that would be more broadly based.\u201d\n\nThe president also fielded a question from a student who wondered if Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to provide \u201cfree\u201d tuition to community college students would cheapen the value of their degree.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cDon\u2019t think paying more is better. Paying less is better. I\u2019m always looking for a deal.\u201d\n\nThe president promoted his economic agenda Friday at Ivy Tech Community College, where the institution\u2019s president is fighting Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate, saying it will cost the school system millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cMy budget makes two years of community college free for every responsible student,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe want to make our community colleges even better, even more responsive to what\u2019s going on in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nBut the university system\u2019s president, Thomas Snyder, has spoken out against Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate. Mr. Snyder is supporting Sen. Joe Donnelly, Indiana Democrat, in his push to change Obamacare\u2019s definition of the work week from 30 hours to 40 hours.\n\n\u201cPart of our strategy to keep tuition affordable is to have 50 percent of our classroom time taught by adjunct professors,\u201d Mr. Snyder said in Washington last month. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has caused us to reassess our ability to do that. We have to use the 30-hour rule, and what it means is that we have to count prep time. And if we don\u2019t do this, we\u2019re facing a $10-to-12 million health care bill.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said the U.S. \u201ccan actually afford to pay for all of\u201d his proposals by raising taxes, or as he put it, eliminating \u201ckickbacks for folks who don\u2019t need them.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s budget, introduced on Monday, calls for a one-time 14-percent tax on corporations\u2019 overseas profits, raising the top capital gains tax rate and closing a tax loophole on trust funds.\n\n\u201cAmerica is poised for another good year \u2026 as long as Washington works to keep that progress going,\u201d Mr. Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama said Friday that he abandoned a proposal to eliminate a popular college-savings plan because \"it wasn't worth it\" and too many families objected to his plan.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama said Friday that he abandoned a proposal to eliminate a popular college-savings plan because \u201cit wasn\u2019t worth it\u201d and too many families objected to his plan.", "title": "Obama: Plan to kill college-savings plan \u2018wasn\u2019t worth\u2019 the furor", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/6/obama-promotes-budget-indiana-college/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/obama-community-collegejpeg-0f8f1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/obama-community-collegejpeg-0f8f1.jpg", "description": "President Obama said Friday that he abandoned a proposal to eliminate a popular college-savings plan because \"it wasn't worth it\" and too many families objected to his plan.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: Plan to kill college-savings plan \u2018wasn\u2019t worthR"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer, Tom Howell Jr. and Dave Boyer, Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "President Obama said Friday that he abandoned a proposal to eliminate a popular college-savings plan because \u201cit wasn\u2019t worth it\u201d and too many families objected to his plan.\n\u201cAmerica is poised for another good year \u2026 as long as Washington works to keep that progress going,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\u201cThe folks who used them most were folks who were a little more on the high [income] end,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\u201cMy budget makes two years of community college free for every responsible student,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nMr. Obama, who pulled the proposal two weeks ago in the face of heated GOP opposition to raising taxes on the middle class, said he had learned his lesson."}
