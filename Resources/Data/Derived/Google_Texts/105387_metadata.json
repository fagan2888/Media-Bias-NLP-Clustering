The other 25 percent of above average corporate income tax would go to the state\u2019s existing constitutional Rainy Day Fund, which can be spent by the Legislature during certain specified financial emergencies.\n\nIn some ways, the idea mimics a good strategy used by North Dakota, which saved 30 percent of its severance tax receipts during the now-gone oil boom, which left it with a $3 billion cushion to fall back on.\n\nThe problem is, North Dakota\u2019s severance tax was 11.5 percent. Oklahoma\u2019s is 2 percent on newly drilled wells. The Oklahoma severance tax is part of an inadequate state revenue plan that perpetuates underfunding of state government, especially public schools, higher education, health and mental health.\n\nIf the tax base were sufficient to adequately fund those essential elements of state government, it would only make sense to save extra money. But there is no extra money. Taking away future tax growth and saving it only assures that we perpetuate even worse state government funding at an inadequate level.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "If the state of Oklahoma had a sufficient tax base, a newly proposed revenue stabilization fund would be prudent.As it is, it's robbing Peter to bail out Paul.", "title": "Tulsa World Editorial: New stabilization fund stabilized inadequate funding", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/editorials/tulsa-world-editorial-new-stabilization-fund-stabilized-inadequate-funding/article_1a619103-2fd5-5173-af67-d805196c12d7.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/49/0490e20f-6f8e-5366-9240-0c9694116a72/5743627a16942.image.jpg?resize=760%2C372", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "If the state of Oklahoma had a sufficient tax base, a newly proposed revenue stabilization fund would be prudent.As it is, it's robbing Peter to bail out Paul.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "severance tax,receipts,income tax,money,state,plan,tax base,media in tulsa oklahoma,stabilization fund,tulsa world,tulsa metropolitan area,funds,now-gone oil boom,north dakota,oklahoma,editorial,opinionhomepage3,editorials,editorialboard,homepagelatest", "news_keywords": "severance tax,receipts,income tax,money,state,plan,tax base,media in tulsa oklahoma,stabilization fund,tulsa world,tulsa metropolitan area,funds,now-gone oil boom,north dakota,oklahoma,editorial,opinionhomepage3,editorials,editorialboard,homepagelatest"}, "article_summary": "House Bill 2763 creates a new revenue stabilization fund that would take \u201cexcess\u201d future tax revenue and save it for times when it is more desperately needed.\nIf the state of Oklahoma had a sufficient tax base, a newly proposed revenue stabilization fund would be prudent.\nThe Oklahoma severance tax is part of an inadequate state revenue plan that perpetuates underfunding of state government, especially public schools, higher education, health and mental health.\nThe problem is, North Dakota\u2019s severance tax was 11.5 percent.\nTaking away future tax growth and saving it only assures that we perpetuate even worse state government funding at an inadequate level."}
