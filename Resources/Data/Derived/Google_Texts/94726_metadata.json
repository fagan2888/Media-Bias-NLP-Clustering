Employers had until Dec. 5, 2014, to file an enrollment form with HHS that automatically calculated the amount of the fee. CMS says employers that now realize they gave an incorrect health plan enrollment count in filing the form should refile the form to receive a refund.\n\nThe deadline for employers to refile the form is April 30, or 90 days from when they originally filed the form, whichever is later. Unless an employer was late in filing the enrollment form, the deadline to refile in order to receive a refund would be April 30.\n\nIn addition, while the guidance is not clear, \u201cit appears that in addition to refiling the form, plan sponsors must email a refund request to CMS at reinsurancecontributions@cms.hhs.gov\u201d, benefit consultant Buck Consultants at Xerox reported in an alert released Wednesday.\n\nIn the two succeeding years of the three-year program, refund requests also must be filed within 90 days from the date an employer filed its enrollment form. The 2015 fee is $44 per plan participant, while the 2016 fee is $27 per plan participant.\n\nThe CMS announcement comes on the heels of a disclosure by HHS that it has collected $8.7 billion in 2014 reinsurance fee payments and anticipates collecting another $1 billion.\n\nIf that estimate is accurate, 2014 fee revenue would fall short of the $12 billion the Affordable Care Act stipulated was supposed to be collected. Of that $12 billion, $10 billion was to go to insurers in reinsurance payments and $2 billion to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nThat revenue shortfall \u201craises a concern that employers may be required to contribute yet additional amounts for 2014, or in higher future contribution rates,\u201d said Rich Stover, a Buck Consultants principal in Secaucus, New Jersey.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8d8\"", "article_summary": "Employers had until Dec. 5, 2014, to file an enrollment form with HHS that automatically calculated the amount of the fee.\nEmployers that realize they overpaid a health reform law-mandated \u201creinsurance\u201d fee generally have until April 30 to seek a refund from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, regulators have disclosed.\nOf that $12 billion, $10 billion was to go to insurers in reinsurance payments and $2 billion to the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe 2015 fee is $44 per plan participant, while the 2016 fee is $27 per plan participant.\nIn little-noticed guidance issued last week, CMS, a unit of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said it \u201cis aware\u201d that some employers may have overpaid the Transitional Reinsurance Program fee."}
