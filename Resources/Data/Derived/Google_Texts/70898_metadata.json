Katherine Gaydos called for someone to give her eye drops. Either in an act of absent-mindedness or extreme cruelty, someone offered her super glue instead.\n\nGaydos explained the horrific accident during an interview with WPBF.\n\n\u201cSomething blew into my eye. I screamed for someone else to get eye drops out of my purse, and they brought super glue and poured it in my eye\u2026I closed my eye and screamed and called 911.\u201d\n\nThe terrified Gaydos found that she\u2019d accidentally glued her eye shut. As much of a nightmare as such an incident would be to the average person, what followed may perhaps be even more scary. Katherine Gaydos went to her doctor for help but found that treatment was discontinued until she could find a way to pay for medical care.\n\n\u201cHe was talking about doing surgery to try and save my eye, but now I don\u2019t know what to do \u2014 I don\u2019t have a job, no insurance or any money.\u201d\n\nThe single mother of two said doctors repeatedly refused to treat her. Even worse, she walked around for a week with her eye glued shut because of an inability to afford proper medical care.\n\n#ICYMI: Woman says someone put super glue into her eye and it\u2019s been glued shut for a week: http://t.co/ZQ4ydpKtlr pic.twitter.com/JmUTsw5Hf3 \u2014 ABC7 News (@abc7newsBayArea) October 9, 2015\n\nPeople wrote that it wasn\u2019t until the shocking story made local headlines that her primary doctor contacted Gaydos again. After going to his office on Thursday, the doctor was able to get Katherine\u2019s eye open. She reportedly went back Friday to get dried super glue scraped from her cornea.\n\nGaydos was clearly elated to have her eye open. Despite temporary vision problems, it looks like the worst is over.\n\n\u201cHe said I should get my sight back, and not have permanent damage.\u201d\n\nThis story goes much deeper than accidentally gluing one\u2019s eye shut; it is a viral story that demonstrates the problematic nature of the American healthcare system. In short: The \u201ccare\u201d has gone out of healthcare.\n\nIt\u2019s true that medicine is how persons earn a living, but when someone comes to you with their eye glued shut and you turn them away because they\u2019re broke, it\u2019s time to evaluate why you got into medicine in the first place.\n\nAccidents happen to everyone and anyone, regardless of their income level. It is impossible to predict when you are going to need care, or if you\u2019ll be able to afford that care when you need it most. Although the American Healthcare Act has made great strides in increasing the number of Americans who have health insurance, this woman represents the millions who continue to lack the means of affording treatment. This story also represents the consequences of finding oneself in such a helpless position with no one to turn to.\n\nKatherine Gaydos was extremely lucky. The story of accidentally substituting glue for eye drops and getting her eye glued shut is headline-worthy. The fact that this happened and she spent a week with her eye glued shut makes it very headline-worthy. The reason she remained in this sad state so long is despicable enough to ensure her story would be national news.\n\nBecause this woman garnered so much attention, her doctor was either shamed or felt properly ashamed of himself and was moved to help her. Fortunately, treating an eye that\u2019s been glued shut required a bit of \u201celbow grease,\u201d but not too much in the way of serious surgery.\n\nThis woman accidentally super-glued her eye shut: http://t.co/OdXAYgtHR5 pic.twitter.com/iBGzFxqMOn \u2014 Women\u2019s Health (@WomensHealthMag) October 9, 2015\n\nImagine if this Florida woman had accidentally experienced a more traumatic injury or health problem. Doctors were passing her up over an eye that was glued shut. It\u2019s chilling to think how much worse her situation could have been, and to know Gaydos would have likely been treated just as indifferently.\n\nSome observers have since commented that she should have gone to the nearest emergency room. Lengthy wait aside, it\u2019s likely she would have been seen; hospitals in America can\u2019t turn away someone in need of urgent care by law. However, the fact that it would even come to that for someone who had a family doctor is rather sad.\n\nFor the record, the company Super Glue has stated that persons who accidentally get glue in their eye should immediately flush the eye with water. The company actually doesn\u2019t recommend trying to pry the eye open.\n\n[Image Credit: Screen grab from YouTube via Paster John/ABC News]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A woman in Florida accidentally glued her eye shut.
