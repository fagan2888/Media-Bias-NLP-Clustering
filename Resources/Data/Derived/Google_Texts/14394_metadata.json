The city commission approved the new city rules this week.\n\n\n\nCommissioner Dave Ruth says the ordinance protects residents from people who want to house dangerous animals in the town.\n\n\n\nAnyone who currently owns exotic animals will be grandfathered in under the ordinance.\n\n\n\nThe ordinance originally would have banned pet birds and would have eliminated someone's grandfathered status if they were involved in a legal or lost their license in another state.
