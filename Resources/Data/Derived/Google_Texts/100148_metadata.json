Obama's proposals to tighten gun controls rules may not accomplish his goal of keeping guns out of the hands of would-be criminals and those who aren't legally allowed to buy a weapon. In short, that's because the conditions he is changing by executive action are murkier than he made them out to be. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (MEDIA GENERAL) \u2013 Lawmakers had a busy first week of 2016. Congress sent a bill repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood, prepared for the president\u2019s last State of the Union, and debated gun regulation. Here is your Capitol Edge.\n\n\u201cThis is the closest that we have come to repealing Obamacare,\u201d Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) said at a signing ceremony Thursday.\n\nRepublicans have tried more than 50 times to get a bill both the House and Senate can agree on to send to President Obama. They finally passed a bill on Wednesday. President Obama, as expected, vetoed the bill Friday.\n\n\u201cThat is what we promised to do \u2013 we are making good on that promise,\u201d Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said about passing the bill.\n\nRepublicans, for now, do not appear to have the support to overpower the President.\n\n\u201cYou know, we have passed some things out of the House that people didn\u2019t think we would ever get passed, so we\u2019ll see,\u201d Blackburn said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nPresident Obama announced several executive orders this week he believes will curb gun violence. Some Republicans said they plan to challenge his executive orders by doing whatever they can to cut off funding for his plans.\n\nNext week, the House is expected to vote on whether or not to punish North Korea after they claim to have tested a hydrogen bomb.\n\nThe biggest story on Capitol Hill next week though will be the State of the Union. You can expect President Obama to talk about ISIS, guns and the economy. He said this speech will be unorthodox compared to his past speeches, but didn\u2019t offer any other details.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress sent a bill repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood, prepared for the president's last State of the Union, and debated\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.krqe", "og": {"site_name": "KRQE News 13", "description": "Congress sent a bill repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood, prepared for the president\u2019s last State of the Union, and debated gun regulation.", "title": "Capitol Edge: State of the Union, Repealing Obamacare", "url": "http://krqe.com/2016/01/08/capitol-edge-state-of-the-union-repealing-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/e0827893733aea018c0f6a7067002793s3keypreview.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress sent a bill repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood, prepared for the president\u2019s last State of the Union, and debated gun regulation.", "title": "Capitol Edge: State of the Union, Repealing Obamacare", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/e0827893733aea018c0f6a7067002793s3keypreview.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@krqe", "site": "krqe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "AP News, Home, National, World, News", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Albuquerque News and Weather, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, New Mexico | krqe.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488525050", "fb": {"pages": 98691658081}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://krqe.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8ec5fa807657323809caf8c9db73e4ed?s=16", "application-name": "KRQE News 13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/krqenews", "published_time": "2016-01-08T21:40:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T21:40:05+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "D680B65910F40B115B0DE7298B906E56", "google-site-verification": "DybmyJ3qnLleDwi_e3uE6Wh_x8CKcwUamZdUxoElU1M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congress sent a bill repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood, prepared for the president\u2019s last State of the Union, and debated gun regulation.\nThe biggest story on Capitol Hill next week though will be the State of the Union.\nYou can expect President Obama to talk about ISIS, guns and the economy.\n\u201cThis is the closest that we have come to repealing Obamacare,\u201d Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) said at a signing ceremony Thursday.\nPresident Obama announced several executive orders this week he believes will curb gun violence."}
