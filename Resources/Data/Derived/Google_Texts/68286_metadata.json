Congo, DR Congo, Uganda), with maximum of 1 minute and 39 seconds visible from the Atlantic Ocean south of Ivory Coast and Ghana.\n\nThe hybrid eclipse of 2013 is visible from within a thin corridor, which traverses the North Atlantic and equatorial Africa. A partial eclipse is seen within the much broader path of the Moon\u2019s penumbral shadow, which includes eastern North America, northern South America, southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe path of the Moon\u2019s shadow begins in the North Atlantic approximately 1000 km due east of Jacksonville, Florida. From the central line, a 4 second annular eclipse is visible at sunrise (11:05 UT). As the shadow races forward, the narrow 4 km wide path rapidly shrinks to zero and the eclipse changes from annular to total.\n\nECLIPSE REMAINS TOTAL AFTER THE FIRST 15 SECONDS\n\nThis all transpires within the first 15 seconds of the shadow\u2019s trajectory. For the remainder of the track, the eclipse remains total.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a weird and dramatic spectacle, if your east horizon is clear\u201d \u2014 Robert Naeye\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a weird and dramatic spectacle, if your east horizon is clear,\u201d Robert Naeye, editor in chief of Sky & Telescope magazine, said in a statement.\n\nContinuing on a southeast course, the vertex of the umbral shadow passes progressively deeper into Earth as the planet\u2019s curvature brings the path along the surface closer to the Moon. By 11:10 UT, the track is 13 km wide and totality lasts 16 seconds. Growing quickly, the duration reaches 30 seconds by 11:18 UT.\n\nWith no landfall yet in sight, the shadow passes 500 km south of Cape Verde at 12:00 UT. On the central line, totality now lasts 1 minute 18 seconds, the Sun\u2019s altitude is 57\u00b0, and the path width is 56 km.\n\nGREATEST ECLIPSE OCCURS AT 7:47 EST\n\nGreatest eclipse occurs in the Atlantic at 12:47:36 UT, approximately 330 kilometres southwest of Liberia. At this instant, the axis of the Moon\u2019s shadow passes closest to Earth\u2019s centre. The maximum duration of totality is 1 minute 39 seconds, the Sun\u2019s altitude is 71\u00b0, and the path width is 57 kilometres.\n\nSlowly curving to the east, the track just misses Sao Tome and Principe and intercepts the coast of Gabon north of Port-Gentil in the Wonga Wongue Reserve (13:51 UT) where the central line duration is 1 minute 7 seconds and the Sun\u2019s altitude is 46\u00b0. The Moon\u2019s shadow crosses Gabon in 9 minutes and sweeps over the Congo in 7 more. Entering the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the path width is 36 kilometres and the duration is 48 seconds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out bright and early,\u201d Alan MacRobert, a senior editor of Sky & Telescope in Cambridge, Mass., said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve got a hillside scouted out with a good view of where the sun comes up.\u201d\n\nThe track begins curving to the northeast as it narrows and the duration of totality decreases. By the time the umbra reaches the western border of Uganda, totality drops to 23 seconds with the Sun at 18\u00b0 (14:22 UT). Sweeping over northern Kenya, the path crosses Lake Turkana where the central line duration is 14 seconds at 14:25 UT.\n\nIn its final 2 1/2 minutes, the lunar shadow races across southern Ethiopia before leaving Earth\u2019s surface in Somalia where a 1 second total eclipse occurs at sunset. Over the course of 3.3 hours, the Moon\u2019s umbra travels along a path approximately 13,600 kilometres long and covers 0.09% of Earth\u2019s surface area.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "alan macrobert,robert naeye,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/solar-eclipse-435.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "A total solar eclipse will occur this morning and it is one of the rare hybrid or Annular/Total eclipses in which some sections of the path are Annular while", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedb6\"", "article_summary": "The path of the Moon\u2019s shadow begins in the North Atlantic approximately 1000 km due east of Jacksonville, Florida.\nGREATEST ECLIPSE OCCURS AT 7:47 ESTGreatest eclipse occurs in the Atlantic at 12:47:36 UT, approximately 330 kilometres southwest of Liberia.\nThe Moon\u2019s shadow crosses Gabon in 9 minutes and sweeps over the Congo in 7 more.\nAt this instant, the axis of the Moon\u2019s shadow passes closest to Earth\u2019s centre.\nThe hybrid eclipse of 2013 is visible from within a thin corridor, which traverses the North Atlantic and equatorial Africa."}
