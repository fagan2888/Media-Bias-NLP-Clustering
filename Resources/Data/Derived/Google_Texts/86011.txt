Britton (Broomfield Police Department)

Broomfield police have arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of first-degree murder, after a 54-year-old man was found dead by gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon.

Sgt. Steve Griebel said that officers were called to 815 Lotus Way around 12:50 p.m., on reports of a domestic violence dispute.

"We found there was a shooting at the house, and the victim did indeed die," Griebel said.

The victim was dead on scene, Griebel added. He has not been identified beyond his age, as the coroner has yet to notify his next of kin.

Suspect Matthew Britton was arrested for first-degree murder, felony menacing and domestic violence.

"I'm not sure what other charges will be formally filed," Griebel said. "That'll probably be later next week."

Little is known to this point about the dispute that preceded the alleged killing, but Griebel said that the two men involved were believed to have engaged in an argument that also involved an unidentified woman.

Police do not believe the three were involved in a "love triangle," Griebel said.

The home at 815 Lotus Way is two blocks from Midway Park, where the city's annual Broomfield Days festival was ongoing at the time of the incident.
