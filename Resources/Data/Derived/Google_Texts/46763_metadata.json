Bodenheimer, MD, MPH\n\nIn an analysis and commentary, Thomas S. Bodenheimer, MD, MPH, a UCSF professor of family and community medicine, and Mark D. Smith, MD, MBA, president and CEO of the California HealthCare Foundation, cited estimates that the U.S. will have a shortage of 52,000 primary care physicians by 2025. To meet the shortage, they suggested the creation of physician-led patient care teams of licensed and unlicensed health care personnel who have been empowered to provide an expanded scope of care. They also advocated increased participation by patients in providing more of their own care.\n\n\u201cThe traditional solution to a shortage of physicians has been to mint more,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut that won\u2019t close the gap, because demand is too strong and too few medical students are choosing primary care.\u201d\n\nInstead, said Bodenheimer, \u201cThe gap can only be narrowed by empowering all team members to care for a large number of patients based on the team members\u2019 training and abilities.\u201d\n\nThe authors\u2019 recommendations include:\n\nUCSF Establishes a Health Workforce Research Center UCSF has been awarded one of three Cooperative Agreements from the U.S. Bureau of the Health Professions to establish the UCSF Health Workforce Research Center (HWRC). The task of the center will be to examine the supply, demand, distribution and capacity of the health care workforce to meet the needs of older adults and persons with disabilities, many of whom will be likely to prefer receiving long-term care at home or in community-based settings.

This mismatch between professional competence and scope of practice, said the authors, results in higher health care costs and needless inefficiencies.\n\n\u201cOur licensing laws have not kept pace with increasingly higher levels of education and better technology,\u201d said Dower. \u201cFor example, many state laws don\u2019t allow nurse practitioners [NPs] to see patients without physician supervision, even though NPs are educated, trained and tested to do so.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, she said, the existing \u201cpatchwork approach\u201d to the regulation of health professions, with each state passing its own set of laws, is a disservice to patients, professionals and health care employers alike.\n\n\u201cThe health professions regulatory system in the U.S. includes outdated laws and regulations, is not standard across states and is too often guided by politics rather than evidence,\u201d Dower said.\n\nThe authors recommended a number of legal and regulatory reforms, including:\n\nAlign scopes of practice with professional competence.\n\nMake regulations easier to update, to better reflect professional advancement.\n\nRecognize and accommodate overlapping scopes of practice between different health professions.\n\nMandate public participation in regulatory bodies that determine scope of practice, thus ensuring a voice for consumers and patients.\n\nUse best available evidence in setting regulatory policies.\n\nCreate a national clearinghouse that provides up-to-date information and research about emerging health professions and scope-of-practice expansions for use by states in creating policy.\n\n\u201cOld ways of regulating health care professionals result in unnecessary restrictions, limited choices and higher costs,\u201d concluded Dower. \u201cWe are restricting the full use of a workforce whose education and training is subsidized by public dollars.\u201d\n\nCo-authors are Jean Moore, BSN, MSN, and Margaret Langelier, MS, of the State University of New York Albany.\n\nThe Role of Nurse Practitioners and Potential Cost Savings\n\nA research team led by Joanne Spetz, PhD, professor of economics at the UCSF Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies and associate director of research strategy at the UCSF Center for the Health Professions, and Stephen T. Parente, PhD, MPH, MS, of the University of Minnesota presented evidence that liberalization of scope-of-practice laws for nurse practitioners could potentially achieve significant savings in the cost of visits to retail clinics.\n\nJoanne Spetz, PhD\n\nAccording to the authors, NPs are the primary health care providers in such clinics, which offer diagnosis and treatment for common, non-life-threatening health conditions. They are located in settings such as pharmacies, grocery stores and big-box retailers.\n\nThe team compared the two-week cost associated with a clinic visit for 9,503 patients in 27 states who visited retail and non-retail clinics at some point between 2004 to 2007. In 13 of the states, NPs were allowed to practice independently, without the supervision of a physician; in six of the 13, they were also permitted to prescribe independently. The remaining 14 states required NPs to be supervised by or collaborate with a physician.\n\nAdjusted to 2013 dollars, the average two-week cost for a non-retail clinic visit was $704. In states where NPs required physician supervision or collaboration, the cost was $543. In states where NPs were allowed the practice independently, the cost was $484; it was $509 in states where they both practiced and prescribed independently.\n\nBased on a projection that retail clinic visits will account for about 10 percent of all outpatient primary care visits by 2015, the authors estimate that the national cost savings from such a level of use will be $2.2 billion. They estimate that if NPs were allowed to practice independently all 50 states, the savings would increase by $810 million; if they were allowed to prescribe independently as well, the savings would increase by $472 million.\n\n\u201cOur findings underscore earlier research indicating that when NPs practice to the full extent of their training, they can deliver highly efficient high-quality primary care,\u201d said Spetz. \u201cWe believe that primary care practices should leverage NPs\u2019 knowledge and skills and the increased availability of convenient care delivery settings to expand access to health care.\u201d\n\nCo-authors of the study are Robert J.
