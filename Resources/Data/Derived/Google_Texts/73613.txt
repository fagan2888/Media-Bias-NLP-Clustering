Mainstream media outlets across the country are regularly accused of failing to be objective when it comes to President Barack Obama’s administration and his landmark health care law known as “Obamacare.” The same cannot be said about WTVT-TV political editor Craig Patrick.

The Tampa Bay, Fla., news station published Patrick’s commentary last week in a segment titled, “Republicans Are Winning the PR Battle Over Obamacare.” The video appears to be on its way to viral status.

The editor argued that the Obama administration’s botched rollout has made it very easy for critics to bash the new health care law.

Patrick also played several clips of President Obama clumsily attempting to explain the benefits of his signature health care law. It doesn’t help that Obama once argued against a “mandate” for health care coverage, he noted.

The segment is so well put together and humorously scathing that some conservative news sites are comparing Patrick’s performance to that of comedian Jon Stewart.
