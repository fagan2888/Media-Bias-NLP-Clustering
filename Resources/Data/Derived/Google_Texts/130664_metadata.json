The park called their birth a \u201cmiracle,\u201d citing advances in panda breeding technology.\n\nThe hoopla surrounding the panda cubs comes because the animals, notoriously uninterested in sex and famously choosy about mates, only have a window of several days to conceive each year. As of 2004, there were only about 1,600 pandas believed to be left in the wild.\n\nOf course, the triplets aren\u2019t out of the woods yet. According to the Associated Press, 26% of male panda cubs and 20% of females die within their first year.\n\nAccording to the San Diego Zoo, panda cubs usually open their eyes at around 50 to 60 days and begin crawling by about 10 weeks. The zoo also notes that sometimes pandas can become pregnant with more than one cub but only give birth to one, as their bodies reabsorb the other embryos.\n\n\u2013Brittany Hite and Li Jie", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A park in southern Guangzhou announced that a set of panda triplets was born late last month, the same day that the Edinburgh Zoo announced that one of its pandas is believed to be pregnant.", "title": "Panda Triplets Born in China", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/08/12/panda-triplets-born-in-china/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EB479_0814pa_G_20140812065542.jpg"}, "site": "chinarealtime", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Panda Triplets Born in China", "description": "A park in southern Guangzhou announced that a set of panda triplets was born late last month, the same day that the Edinburgh Zoo announced that one of its pandas is believed to be pregnant.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Brittany Hite", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "China Real Time Report Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "China Real Time Report", "article.summary": "A park in southern Guangzhou announced that a set of panda triplets was born late last month, the same day that the Edinburgh Zoo announced that one of its pandas is believed to be pregnant.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-12T10:59:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/08/12/panda-triplets-born-in-china/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-CJB-23579", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A park in southern Guangzhou announced that a set of panda triplets was born late last month, the same day that the Edinburgh Zoo announced that one of its pandas is believed to be pregnant.", "title": "Panda Triplets Born in China", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/08/12/panda-triplets-born-in-china/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EB479_0814pa_G_20140812065542.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "China Real Time Report", "article.id": "BL-CJB-23579", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-13T09:34:00-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The panda cubs, born on July 29 in southern China\u2019s Guangzhou to a mother called Juxiao, are the world\u2019s only panda triplets currently in existence, the safari park said, as triplets have a very low survival rate.\nAccording to the Associated Press, 26% of male panda cubs and 20% of females die within their first year.\nGuangzhou\u2019s Chimelong Safari Park announced Tuesday that a set of panda triplets was born late last month, the same day that the Edinburgh Zoo announced that one of its pandas is believed to be pregnant.\nAccording to the San Diego Zoo, panda cubs usually open their eyes at around 50 to 60 days and begin crawling by about 10 weeks.\nThe park called their birth a \u201cmiracle,\u201d citing advances in panda breeding technology."}
