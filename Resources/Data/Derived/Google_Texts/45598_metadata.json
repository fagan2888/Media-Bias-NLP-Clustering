Brandon (Levier) hit me with a good pass,\u201d said Gill. \u201cYes. I have \u2018dreamed\u2019 of making a big shot like that.\u201d\n\nGill had one lay-up (two points) until he connected for a 3-pointer with 1:49 remaining, moving the Lions within four (45-41).\n\n\u201cKendall was struggling most of the game. He was getting frustrated. He\u2019s our best shooter and that we were counting on him,\u201d said Columbia Central head coach Hal Murrell.\n\nFor that final 2.6 seconds, Murrell also had long range shooter Tyler Andrews on the opposite side of the court.\n\n\u201cThe screens freed Kendall, but they (Franklin County) forced Kendall out of the corner and out to the wing,\u201d said Murrell.\n\nThe Lions were able to get the ball to Gill uncontested, saving some time by rolling the ball into Levier who quickly passed the ball to Gill to complete one of numerous late game comebacks by the team.\n\n\u201cWe have been through this a lot. We just stick together, and play team ball,\u201d said Levier, who had a steal after a defensive rebound by a Rebel, and hit an off-balance shot to the left of the foul lane to close the gap to 52-47 with seconds left. Levier also had a dandy pass to low post player Ashanta Brown with 50.6 seconds left to 47-45.\n\nMurrell started an all-senior line-up which included two normal starters and a pair who have started a few games.\n\n\u201cOur seniors all stepped up big tonight,\u201d said Murrell following his team\u2019s first district seasonal title since 2010. \u201cWe have some time to rest up for the district since we have a bye and don\u2019t play until Saturday. But the district tournament will be a \u2018war.\u2019 Every one of the teams we played except Tullahoma played us to five point games, and we have gone into overtime in three of the last four.\u201d\n\nThough the late game offensive surge took the spotlight, the persistent defensive effort on Franklin County\u2019s Tyler Schaub was very significant. Senior Kevonta Cathey and freshman Tre Parker alternated most of the game with help from teammates like Brown, but down the stretch Levier took the primary role.\n\n\u201cBrandon has improved on his footwork and using his chest, not his hands, to keep position since his freshman year,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cHe made some big plays for us.\u201d\n\nSchaub did finish with a game-high 20 points, but did not have a field goal in five attempts during the final 9:45 of play.\n\n\u201cWe did a great job on him, but he still had 20,\u201d said Murrell. \u201cThat tells you how good he is.\u201d\n\nBrown and Gill led the Lions (17-9, 11-1) with 15 and 14 points respectively. Cathey, Brown and Levier had five rebounds each. Levier added four assists.\n\nMontrease Van Zant and Matt Schmitz added 14 and 11 points respectively for the Rebels (18-10, 8-3). Schaub was tops in rebounds with six and Van Zant contributed three assists.\n\nSpring Hill 54, Cascade 52, OT: The Raiders outlasted the host Champs when the game extended into overtime.\n\nChance Perry\u2019s 17 points paced the Raiders, who carried a 34-31 lead into the fourth period of the game which saw both team\u2019s with 41 points when the horn sounded after four quarters.\n\nTucker Rippy and Keidron McCallister tallied 14 and 12 points respectively for the Raiders (7-15, 3-7).\n\nHayden Edmondson hit six treys and led Cascade (18-5, 6-4) with 18 points. Will Holt added 17 points.\n\nCentennial 46, Summit 45: The Cougars held the host Spartans to five points in the fourth period to overcome a 40-37 deficit in the District 11-AAA game.\n\nTyrel Dodson led Centennial (8-17, 3-9) with 19 points.\n\nJohn Carter and Grant Robison scored 13 and 11 points respectively for Summit (8-15, 2-10).\n\nHampshire 67, Riverside Christian 49: Fabian Bojorquez reached the 1,000-point by scoring 29 points to lead the win for the Hawks (11-13).\n\nBojorquez had 13 two-point baskets and three foul shots on his big night.\n\nSeth Grimmitt and Marshall Wray provided 12 and 11 points respectively. Hayden Lightfoot, who scored his 1,000th point earlier this month, nailed two 3-point goals and netted eight points.\n\nJosh Hill (24 points) and Eli Wright (20) combined for the bulk of the points for the Knights (0-12).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Hardy Loyd Gym on the Columbia Central campus has been the site of numerous dynamic basketball games, but less than a handful matched the finish of Friday\u2019s District 8-AAA season championship game.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "MARION WILHOITE mwilhoite@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "The Hardy Loyd Gym on the Columbia Central campus has been the site of numerous dynamic basketball games, but less than a handful matched the finish of Friday\u2019s District 8-AAA season championship game.", "title": "Miracle finish nets district title for Lions", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sports/preps/miracle-finish-nets-district-title-lions", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_The-Shot_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sports/preps/miracle-finish-nets-district-title-lions", "title": "Miracle finish nets district title for Lions", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=772941", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=772941", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Preps,Local,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-08T22:03:48-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd050\"", "article_summary": "For that final 2.6 seconds, Murrell also had long range shooter Tyler Andrews on the opposite side of the court.\nMontrease Van Zant and Matt Schmitz added 14 and 11 points respectively for the Rebels (18-10, 8-3).\n\u201cThat tells you how good he is.\u201dBrown and Gill led the Lions (17-9, 11-1) with 15 and 14 points respectively.\nTucker Rippy and Keidron McCallister tallied 14 and 12 points respectively for the Raiders (7-15, 3-7).\nJohn Carter and Grant Robison scored 13 and 11 points respectively for Summit (8-15, 2-10)."}
