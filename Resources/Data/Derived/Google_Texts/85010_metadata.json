Six out of seven project a drop of around 10 percent in the holdings of foreign investors. One expects foreign holdings to remain stable.\n\nForeign holdings of Mexican peso-debt have dipped about two percent so far off a record high of 2.18 trillion pesos ($143 billion) seen in February.\n\nEven though Mexican growth has been slower than expected, economists said the country's relatively strong fundamentals made it stand out from other emerging markets suffering from domestic problems, such as Brazil and Russia.\n\n\"As one client put it, 'It's a beauty pageant and Mexico continues to be, by far, the least ugly,'\" said Alexis Milo, an economist at Deutsche Bank in Mexico City.\n\nMexico's central bank slashed its growth outlook for this year on Tuesday by half a percentage point to between 2.0-3.0 percent.\n\n(Reporting by Michael O'Boyle and Jean Luis Arce; Editing by Christian Plumb)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Four of seven economists queried at a round table hosted by Reuters in Mexico City exp", "title": "Mexican central bank likely to intervene more if peso slumps further: Reuters poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/05/20/Mexican-central-bank-likely-intervene-more-if-peso-slumps-further-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-economy-forex_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/05/20/Mexican-central-bank-likely-intervene-more-if-peso-slumps-further-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mexico-economy-forex_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Four of seven economists queried at a round table hosted by Reuters in Mexico City exp", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Mexico's central bank slashed its growth outlook for this year on Tuesday by half a percentage point to between 2.0-3.0 percent.\nThe central bank and the finance ministry jointly set currency policy.\nAnalysts doubted policymakers would resort to discretionary intervention, expecting rather that the central bank could increase the amount of dollars it sells or lower the threshold that would trigger the auction.\nThe peso has been hammered by concerns that a U.S. interest rate hike may push investors to dump emerging market assets.\nMexico's central bank avoids the direct intervention used by other emerging markets, preferring more market-friendly mechanisms, such as a current auction of $200 million dollars that is triggered by losses of more than 1.5 percent."}
