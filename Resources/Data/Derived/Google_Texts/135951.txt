The average family with school-age children will spend $630 on clothing and school supplies before their kids return to the classroom.

That’s down slightly from the $669 spent last year, but represents a 42 percent increase over the past decade, according to the National Retail Federation.

Despite the lower per-family spending, fewer consumers say the economy has influenced their spending plans, and a smaller percentage are looking for sales or buying generic products to save.

Among those surveyed, 93 percent said they’d buy clothing for their kids, laying out an average $218 on new threads and $117 on new shoes. Spending on school supplies will average $98.

Families said they planned to spend an average of $197 on electronics, down from $212 spent in that category last year.
