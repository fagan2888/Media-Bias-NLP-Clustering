A major shakeup is coming to the University of Texas at Austin. President Bill Powers, who is believed to be involved in an admissions scandal, was given an ultimatum: resign by the next regents' meeting or be fired.

According to The Houston Chronicle, Powers has not yet accepted the offer:

UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa asked Powers to resign before the regents meet again July 10, or be fired at the meeting, the source said. Powers told Cigarroa he will not resign, at least not under the terms that the chancellor laid out Friday. Powers told Cigarroa he would be open to discussing a timeline for his exit, the source said.

Powers' ouster follows the opening of an investigation into UT Law School. Numerous media outlets have reported that the law school was admitting vast numbers of unqualified students who had political connections. Powers was formerly dean of the law school.

The scandal may have remained unknown to the public if not for a personal investigation undertaken by UT Regent Wallace Hall, who filed numerous public records requests after coming across some suspicious documents. Powers' allies in the legislature retaliated by attempting to impeach Hall, though the motion was tabled by a legislative subcommittee.

The sudden downfall of Powers is a stunning vindication of the efforts of Hall and Texas Watchdog.org's Jon Cassidy, who provided an analysis of UT admissions that corroborated Hall's findings.

Thankfully, it looks like corrupt college administrators will no longer be able to keep the extent of their wrongdoing a secret from the public.
