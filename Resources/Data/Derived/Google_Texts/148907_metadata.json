Photo by Jason Towlen (Photo: Jason Towlen/Staff Photographer, Jason Towlen/Staff Photographer)Buy Photo\n\nA new service is offering free rides to people in Asbury Park, and all anyone has to do to get a lift is wave to the driver.\n\nJersey Shore Free Ride opened in the city after Memorial Day, and its billboard-sided electric cars can be seen driving around Kingsley Street, Cookman and Ocean avenues.\n\nPaid for through corporate sponsorships, the six-passenger cars are sided in colorful advertising promoting everything from local eateries to national brands.\n\n\u201cIt helps us bring awareness to the central business district,\u201d said John LiDestri, who owns Jersey Shore Free Ride with partner Kristina Bannon. Another Free Ride service based in the Hamptons owns a small share in their service.\n\nA Jersey Shore Free Ride car cruised down Ocean Avenue about noon on Sunday, where 61-year-old Tom Sanford jumped in to catch a ride to Cookman Avenue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Sandford, who lives in Asbury Park and would have otherwise walked the roughly half mile from the beach to the downtown section of the city for lunch.\n\nBoth LiDestri, 44, and Bannon, 35, live in the city themselves, and see the Free Ride service as a way to promote all Asbury Park has to offer. Inside the open-air cab, a mounted iPad cycles through advertisements for local businesses. On either side are folded brochures about the city.\n\nBefore launching the company, LiDestri sampled a Free Ride Service in West Palm Beach, Florida. Another Free Ride exists in Santa Monica, California, LiDestri said.\n\nSince Asbury\u2019s Free Ride is still new and somewhat unknown, much of Free Ride\u2019s existing advertising promotes other businesses owned by LiDestri and Bannon. LiDestri\u2019s family is involved in the food and alcohol industry, and Bannon owns two boardwalk eateries.\n\nAsbury\u2019s oceanfront re-developer iStar Residential is also on board with the project, sponsors the service, and welcomes Free Ride\u2019s three electric cars to park outside iStar\u2019s Waterfront Information Center on Cookman Avenue.\n\n\u201cFor us, it made a lot of sense,\u201d said Brian Cheripka, vice president of land for iStar Residential. \u201cOne of our main goals was to connect the central business district and the shops\u2026 to the waterfront.\u201d\n\nEach Free Ride electric car can travel about 15 miles \u2014 depending on traffic conditions and the weight carried \u2014 before it needs to be recharged. The service operates seven days a week between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m., weather permitting. Each car has no windows, so LiDestri and Bannon are considering moving the company to Austin, Texas, for the winter and operating in Asbury Park only during the warmer months.\n\nSo far, Free Ride has no designated stops or schedule. Bannon says the service can\u2019t be \u201ccalled\u201d for a pickup like other fee-based transportation services.\n\nFor the most part, the cars stick to shuttling visitors and residents between Cookman Avenue\u2019s restaurant and shopping district and the beach and boardwalk area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a feel-good project,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be millionaires from this... It\u2019s just a bunch of little people trying to pitch in and help the community.\u201d\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.app.com/story/news/local/2014/06/15/asbury-park-free-ride/10557587/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Asbury Park gets a free ride.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Asbury Park gets a free ride.", "title": "Asbury Park company offers a Free Ride", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/2014/06/15/asbury-park-free-ride/10557587/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Asbury Park gets a free ride.", "title": "Asbury Park's free ride", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d324205b27385800efa347ff5e5b02cf2f366af1/c=334-0-1667-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/06/15/shuttlejt061514114.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/amanda.oglesby.njpress"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Another Free Ride service based in the Hamptons owns a small share in their service.\nSince Asbury\u2019s Free Ride is still new and somewhat unknown, much of Free Ride\u2019s existing advertising promotes other businesses owned by LiDestri and Bannon.\nA Jersey Shore Free Ride car cruised down Ocean Avenue about noon on Sunday, where 61-year-old Tom Sanford jumped in to catch a ride to Cookman Avenue.\nBefore launching the company, LiDestri sampled a Free Ride Service in West Palm Beach, Florida.\nBuy Photo One of the three free mini-buses is driven along the the streets of Asbury Park, Sunday, June 15, 2014."}
