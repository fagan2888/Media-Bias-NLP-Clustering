Born with no heartbeat, he was resuscitated and spent 11 days in the neo-natal intensive care unit. The medical bill was over $200,000.\n\nYet \u201cevery single dollar of those bills was paid,\u201d Lansberry recalled, \u201cand it was paid through gifts and notes and cards and bearing the burden from hundreds of different families across the country \u2013 people who I\u2019ll never meet on earth, who took the time to not only bear the financial burden of my family, but I have cards and notes from 43 different states.\u201d\n\nLansberry is the vice president of the Christian health-sharing group Samaritan Ministries, and has been a member since 1996. Instead of enrolling in private insurance or the public health exchanges, member families of health-sharing ministries pay a monthly premium that covers each other\u2019s health care costs, and they can volunteer to pay even more for others\u2019 needs.\n\nWhen someone\u2019s cost exceeds the limit of the sharable amount \u2013 $250,000 for Samaritan members \u2013 other members can volunteer to cover the additional costs.\n\n\u201cHealth care sharing is specifically, as we practice it at Samaritan Ministries, is a lot like moving a piano,\u201d Lansberry said at a Heritage Foundation panel earlier this year. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it by yourself, and you need others to gather around you in a time of need when you can make that happen.\u201d\n\nEnrollment in health-sharing ministries is allowed under the Affordable Care Act, provided the ministries existed before the year 2000.\n\nMembership in the three largest health-sharing ministries \u2013 Samaritan Ministries International, Christian Care Ministry or \u201cMedi-Share,\u201d and Christian Healthcare Ministries \u2013 has risen significantly since 2013, jumping from around 190,000 members nationwide to over 311,000 at the end of 2014, according to the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nThe three ministries combined saw a total of $253 million in health care costs in 2015.\n\nThe author of the report on the ministries, Scott E. Daniels, credited their rising popularity in part to families\u2019 desires to pay only for insurance coverage they need.\n\nThere\u2019s also a demand for alternative health care providers spurred by the health care law\u2019s individual mandate and its \u201cvalues,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u201cvalues\u201d of the Affordable Care Act are not just abortion coverage and contraception mandates, Daniels insisted at the Heritage Foundation panel, but a much broader \u201csecular ideal of communal solidarity\u201d that coerces everyone into buying insurance so there are no \u201cfree riders\u201d in society.\n\nHealth-sharing ministries are a response to these \u201cvalues,\u201d he added, because they do promote a community, but a \u201cdevoutly Christian\u201d one of \u201cbearing one another\u2019s burdens\u201d and \u201cmutual aid,\u201d without coverage that members would object to subsidizing like abortions and contraceptives.\n\nIn 2014, a government watchdog report found that in federally-subsidized health plans on the public exchanges, insurers were not billing abortion coverage separately, thus leaving open the possibility of federal dollars going to cover elective abortions.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to what we were as an early Christian community,\u201d said Louis Brown, the director of CMF CURO, a Catholic health-sharing ministry that has partnered with Samaritan Ministries. This means \u201caccompanying each other in all aspects of our life\u201d and ensuring that the Lord is \u201cLord over everything\u201d including health care.\n\nCMF CURO was launched in October of 2014 as an alternative to the insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act. It partnered with Samaritan Ministries to ensure compliance with the health care law, since only health-sharing ministries created before 2000 are accepted as legal substitutes for insurance.\n\nAside from the monthly premiums or \u201cshares,\u201d members cover up to $300 of each medical need as their way of contributing. The cost of needs are generally shareable among members \u2013 excluding pre-existing conditions and preventive care \u2013 from $300 up to $250,000.\n\n\n\nSometimes a person may have to pay more than $300 up front for medical costs. In these cases they may pay that amount and be reimbursed later by other members for the costs exceeding $300.\n\n\n\nThe ministry encourages everyone to negotiate their costs with providers, with the help of Samaritan Ministries. CMF CURO can also send members a reference price \u2013 125 percent of the Medicare cost of that service -- that is fair to both patient and provider, with the help of a price administrator who works with the ministry.\n\n\n\nMembers can also use a CMF CURO debit card so when they receive shares from other members to pay for medical costs, the money goes straight to the debit card and not as a check in the mail. The card is usable only for medical services.\n\nThere is no reimbursement for morally-objectionable services like abortion, contraceptives, or in-vitro fertilization. Families cover one another\u2019s medical needs along with personal notes and prayers.\n\nParticipants must live a healthy, Christian lifestyle: regular church attendance and no drug abuse and sexual immorality. They also must abstain from tobacco use \u2013 except for a special cigar or pipe smoke \u2013 and must submit a yearly recommendation from their pastor.\n\nMost pre-existing conditions aren\u2019t eligible for reimbursement unless \u201cthe condition appears to be cured\u201d and a year has passed \u201cwithout symptoms, treatment, or medication.\u201d For more serious problems like Type 1 diabetes or a previous bout with cancer, the waiting period is longer.\n\nSomeone with these problems could conceivably enroll and rely upon the generosity of other members to cover their needs, however.\n\nThe ministry now has members in 48 states. 55,000 households have now enrolled with Samaritan Ministries.\n\nFor two families, the biggest factors in their decision to switch from the private insurance market and the exchanges to CMF CURO were the high cost and the Christian ethos \u2013 \u201cconscience and cost,\u201d as one member put it.\n\n\u201cThe most immediate benefit has been cost-saving,\u201d said Tim Mayer, a Catholic father of three from Manassas, Virginia.\n\nThe Charlotte Lozier report on health-sharing ministries found that member families paid anywhere from 45 to 60 percent less in monthly payments compared to market insurance, saving them hundreds of dollars a month and thousands per year.\n\nThe \u201cdeeper benefit,\u201d Mayer added, was \u201cthe opportunity to take full responsibility for our own health and to take a more active role in managing it.\u201d While normal private insurance is operated behind-the-scenes to the policyholder with insurers and providers negotiating costs, health-sharing involves considerably more personal oversight.\n\nAnd it is important to have truly Christian health insurance, Mayer added, \u201cgiving the Lord more of our trust, in terms of providing for our physical needs.\u201d\n\nFor Brooks Cross, a father of five from Hanover, Virginia, conscience played a key role in his decision to enroll his family in CMF CURO so that his premiums would not go to cover abortions, contraceptives, and sterilizations.\n\n\u201cOther people, if they want to live out Humanae Vitae, the Church\u2019s teachings, they want to be fruitful and multiply and bring children into the world as a blessing, this is a way that other Christians just basically help you pay for that and make it happen,\u201d Cross told CNA.\n\nIn the midst of a job change, Cross was searching for affordable health insurance for his family that would not subsidize abortion and contraception. However, \u201cthe rates were just so high,\u201d he said of the private market plans.\n\nAfter he and his wife prayed and searched, they found Samaritan Ministries and saw they would pay far less in monthly premiums. It was \u201ckind of a leap [of faith],\u201d Cross admitted, but added \u201cit allows us to live out the Gospel.\u201d\n\nHis family\u2019s monthly cost for insurance dropped significantly. For instance, he ultimately paid only $300 out of pocket for his youngest child\u2019s birth, on top of his monthly share payments.\n\nCross has been enrolled in CMF CURO for about a year now, Mayer for a few months. So far it was worked for both parties. Mayer said he would recommend it to any family shopping for insurance programs, provided that they don\u2019t have a condition that might not be covered under the health-sharing plan.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Syda Productions via www.shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nThis article originally ran on CNA Jan 24, 2016.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec1d\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s also a demand for alternative health care providers spurred by the health care law\u2019s individual mandate and its \u201cvalues,\u201d he added.\nWhen someone\u2019s cost exceeds the limit of the sharable amount \u2013 $250,000 for Samaritan members \u2013 other members can volunteer to cover the additional costs.\nIn the midst of a job change, Cross was searching for affordable health insurance for his family that would not subsidize abortion and contraception.\nThis means \u201caccompanying each other in all aspects of our life\u201d and ensuring that the Lord is \u201cLord over everything\u201d including health care.\nIt partnered with Samaritan Ministries to ensure compliance with the health care law, since only health-sharing ministries created before 2000 are accepted as legal substitutes for insurance."}
