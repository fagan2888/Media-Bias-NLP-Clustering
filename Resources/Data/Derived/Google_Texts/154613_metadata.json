Reuters\n\nTin prices rallied Thursday, propelled higher by concerns over tight supply from Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest supplier of the metal.\n\nThe price of tin, which is used in everything from computer chips to batteries, rose 1.9% to $22,285 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange Thursday, its highest price in almost a month. So far this week, tin prices have gained almost 5%.\n\nThe gains came as PT Timah (TINS.JK), the world\u2019s largest integrated tin producer, Wednesday declared force majeure, saying new Indonesian government regulations requiring all tin to be traded locally before export mean it can\u2019t fulfill contracts to directly ship tin to buyers.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan said last week that this move will improve price transparency, avoid smuggling and prevent sellers from declaring prices below what are actually received\u2013which means lower state revenue from royalties and taxes, but many producers have halted shipments while they amend contracts with buyers.\n\n\u201c[The force majeure] has put the cat among the pigeons, hence why we are seeing higher prices,\u201d said Gayle Berry, a metals analyst at Barclays. \u201cThe market is starting to realize that this could seriously tighten tin supplies. Meanwhile, there isn\u2019t much tin on the LME and some of that may not be immediately available, it could be stuck behind a warehouse queue.\u201d\n\nSome industry participants, meanwhile, doubted the lasting impact of Indonesia\u2019s new regulations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only a few days into the new exchange,\u201d said Charles Swindon, managing director of metals trading firm RJH Trading. \u201cI think it\u2019s highly likely there will be some kind of u-turn.\u201d\n\nThe London Metal Exchange declined to comment on Indonesia\u2019s new trading requirements.\n\n-Laura Clarke contributed to this item", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Tin prices rallied Thursday, propelled higher by concerns over tight supply from Indonesia, the world's largest supplier of the metal.", "title": "Is There About to Be a Tin Squeeze?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/05/is-there-about-to-be-a-tin-squeeze/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU294_0905ti_G_20130905123444.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Is There About to Be a Tin Squeeze?", "description": "Tin prices rallied Thursday, propelled higher by concerns over tight supply from Indonesia, the world's largest supplier of the metal.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Francesca Freeman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Tin prices rallied Thursday, propelled higher by concerns over tight supply from Indonesia, the world's largest supplier of the metal.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-05T16:40:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/05/is-there-about-to-be-a-tin-squeeze/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-7580", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Tin prices rallied Thursday, propelled higher by concerns over tight supply from Indonesia, the world's largest supplier of the metal.", "title": "Is There About to Be a Tin Squeeze?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/05/is-there-about-to-be-a-tin-squeeze/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU294_0905ti_G_20130905123444.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-7580", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-05T16:41:10-04:00"}, "article_summary": "So far this week, tin prices have gained almost 5%.\nThe gains came as PT Timah (TINS.JK), the world\u2019s largest integrated tin producer, Wednesday declared force majeure, saying new Indonesian government regulations requiring all tin to be traded locally before export mean it can\u2019t fulfill contracts to directly ship tin to buyers.\nA worker makes a final check of refined tin ahead of shipment in a warehouse owned by a private company in Indonesia\u2019s Bangka-Belitung province.\n\u201cWe\u2019re only a few days into the new exchange,\u201d said Charles Swindon, managing director of metals trading firm RJH Trading.\n\u201cThe market is starting to realize that this could seriously tighten tin supplies."}
