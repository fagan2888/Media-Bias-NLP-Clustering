If you wish to believe today\u2019s self-proclaimed experts, imagine a system of mobile devices through which music flows as a kind of utility, financed by a subscription similar to public television in Europe. Tomorrow\u2019s listeners will, they say, consume music like water. Just as water pours from your tap, old catalog will be legally available in online libraries. Discerning ears will pay a little extra for premium music, in the way that sensitive palates prefer bottled mineral water. In short, imagine a musical Utopia where technology makes us all happier and richer.\n\nNow open your eyes. When imagining any perfect system, the common error is to underestimate the guile, mischief, and plain vandalism of lawyers, lobbyists, teenagers, and other rogue gremlins in the machine. For about ten years now, technologists have told us that artists will sell themselves directly to the public\u2014because they physically can. Remember how, in and around 2005, we were all hailing MySpace as a revolution? Despite a promising start, MySpace quickly degenerated into a cardboard jungle of garage bands hustling each other for compliments. Today\u2019s expert predictions about \u201cthe future of music\u201d are a bit like astrology; you can\u2019t help reading them, but you\u2019d be a fool to believe any of it.\n\nThe truth is, the survivors of the CD crash have stopped trying to see into the future. Take Geoff Travis, who with record woman Jeannette Lee has successfully rehabilitated Rough Trade inside the Beggars Group. \u201cThe carrier question pales in comparison to the content,\u201d he believes. \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever cared about is finding music and finding ways of bringing it to people.\u201d Another die-hard indie, Daniel Miller, who recently extricated Mute from the EMI wreckage, paints an equally simple picture. \u201cPeople are just getting on with it. There\u2019s a lot of good music out there, and that\u2019s what drives us.\u201d\n\nSimply chasing the muse into the great wide open sums up the record man\u2019s cosmic bargain. As Jac Holzman puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re not an industry. It\u2019s every man for himself.\u201d Today, not only is a market recovery quietly in motion, the advantage has moved back to the old-school record man. \u201cGod bless the indies!\u201d exclaims Seymour Stein, who, like most of the other Warner barons, never forgot his origins. \u201cThey\u2019ve introduced every new trend since, and even before, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. You name it, it all started with the indies.\u201d\n\nAt the top of the indie community, the proverbial Last of the Mohicans is Martin Mills, who now presides over a group that includes 4AD, Matador, XL Recordings, and Rough Trade. He is old enough to see history repeating itself. \u201cIn 1987, when the house explosion really started to happen,\u201d recalls Mills, \u201cit looked very much to us like the punk explosion a decade previously . . . It was becoming clear that to be a successful label you had to catch successive waves. Although you couldn\u2019t catch every one, the way to compete with the majors was not to compete head-on, but to find the niche and take things beyond that niche.\u201d That philosophy has landed his group plenty of interesting fish: Gary Numan, Bauhaus, the Cult, Dead Can Dance, the Pixies, the Prodigy, the White Stripes, Bon Iver, Cat Power, the Libertines, and America\u2019s biggest-selling artist of 2011 and 2012, Adele.\n\nSticking to the simple business of finding brilliant music, Mills has not bought into America\u2019s latest gimmick, the so called 360\u00b0 deal\u2014 securing an artist\u2019s rights for recordings, publishing, merchandising, live, everything. Because most signatures lose money, Mills predicted that these \u201cland grab\u201d contracts, being more expensive, would lose more money and, in the exceptional cases of blockbuster success, arouse the artist\u2019s resentment. He\u2019s being proved right. Originally a lawyer\u2019s solution to falling profits, total merchandising has created a marketplace that Tom Silverman describes as \u201criddled with fear.\u201d \u201cThe return on the risk is so low that majors have to increase their batting average to a point where they don\u2019t want to sign anything.\u201d Silverman also points his finger squarely at the lingering specter of independent radio promotion. \u201cRight now in America,\u201d he continues, \u201calthough independent labels represent 34.5 percent of all single and album sales combined, they only get about 10 percent of airplay on commercial radio. . . . There\u2019s still a huge discrepancy between what people want to buy and what gets played on radio that can only be explained by a problem in the system.\u201d\n\nHaving recently left his co-chairmanship at Columbia following five difficult years, Rick Rubin confirms, \u201cThere is definitely a realization amongst the majors today that they have to get back to a more indie model.\u201d That model is the Beggars Group and its affiliated Rough Trade stores.\n\nOver the last fifteen years, carefully watching the Internet rise, Martin Mills has meticulously adapted his business structure to the changing environment. Thinking big but spending prudently, across Europe he designed a \u201cnesting system\u201d in which his overseas branches handle local promotion from within his chosen independent distributor. The records get plugged by employees who answer to Mills, without the risky costs of running a distribution system. As traditional megastores close, Rough Trade stores are opening in the big cities to cater to a community of specialist music lovers. In many ways, Beggars is a type of multi-tentacled deep-sea creature. Having spent almost forty years feeding off the underground, Mills has learned that survival requires an ability to dart at movements yet maintain a slow metabolism. He has come to expect long waits between feasts.\n\nMills has a reputation in the record industry as being a frugal spender, but those who know him intimately maintain he\u2019s anything but greedy. Despite his multimillion-dollar success with Adele, he spent weeks debating with himself whether he really deserved to splurge on a four-door Maserati. He succumbed to temptation in the end, but it was a rare treat. Speaking from his hideaway in the New Mexico wilderness, former colleague and 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell says, \u201cMartin Mills is definitely not motivated by money. Security perhaps, but not money. If you were shipwrecked with a handful of strangers, Martin is the one you would want in charge of water and rice rations.\u201d Among today\u2019s community of struggling indies, that\u2019s precisely the role he\u2019s assumed. With Alison Wenham, he set up indie trade body AIM, then brought the idea to America with its equivalent, A2IM. He also dreamed up Merlin, a digital rights platform enabling indies and lone producers to sell their music through all the online MP3 stores.\n\nOld-fashioned, pragmatic, and highly principled, Mills simply refused to adopt the glitzy, gung-ho culture of the corporate era. He rejected major buyout offers for two decades because \u201cI wouldn\u2019t swap what I do for a pile of money. I love what I do, and I don\u2019t love money that much.\u201d Nonetheless, Mills does firmly believe that true independence is also financial. \u201cNeither a borrower nor a lender be,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cAnother proverb which I grew up with: When you sup with the devil, sup with a long spoon. And to be honest, I\u2019ve always seen the moneylender as a devil. When we started out at Earl\u2019s Court, there was a Lloyd\u2019s Bank on the corner. I can still picture the bank manager; Mr. Clark was his name. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s dead by now, but I\u2019ve always been grateful to him, because he wouldn\u2019t let us have an overdraft. These days we\u2019re at Coutts and have been for twenty-five years, but we\u2019ve managed to grow without bank loans.\u201d For Mills, debt is the slippery slope to ruin because \u201cyou have to come up with business projections and cash-flow charts, which is always a complete waste of time in the industry we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nLife in the music business has taught Martin Mills that, as a rule, money should be treated with great trepidation. Whether with artists or business partners, \u201cmoney can be the root of all evil,\u201d he laments. \u201cWhen people are behaving in a way that you find unacceptable, very often money is at the root.\u201d The purist values that underpin the Beggars Group are a welcome reminder that some survivors of the record crisis are alive and well. \u201cMartin Mills is probably the best all-round record guy practicing today,\u201d salutes Jac Holzman. \u201cHe\u2019s never lost faith in this business.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the spectacular collapse of the record industry this last decade is just a long-overdue purge of all the cynicism and delusional financial logic that clogged up the industry for the best part of two decades. Those who\u2019ve been hardest hit arguably had it coming. This brings us full circle back to the special few who found and fostered most of the important music this last century: the music men, a conspicuously rare species in the corporate era\u2014pushed out and devalued by a generation of smug executives who believed that if they thought commercially, their sleek products would sell better.\n\nSo what is it that really makes the record business spin? \u201cA lot of it has to do with why we do what we do to begin with,\u201d believes Rick Rubin. \u201cI think people who get into music to make money, it doesn\u2019t always work out that way. I\u2019ve always just done music as best as I can, and wherever that leads, ultimately, it\u2019s okay. I see myself as sort of an art collector, not a gambler. The thing I\u2019ve always found is that it\u2019s almost like falling in love. It\u2019s not about what you can get out of this. It\u2019s not a commercial venture. It maybe becomes one, but that\u2019s a by-product. It\u2019s almost by not aiming at it, it\u2019s able to happen because the intention behind it is pure.\u201d Or as the great John Hammond put it, \u201cA hundred times I\u2019ve seen efforts to make a record more commercial turn the buyers off. Stand or fall on what you are, I tell my people. Be yourself.\u201d\n\nThe A&R craft operates on many levels, but one quality the greatest producers have in common is a deep-rooted faith in their own judgment\u2014so certain, so capable of recognizing genius in its embryonic stages, they often find themselves standing alone admiring things nobody else gets. \u201cWith every great musician I have discovered,\u201d continues John Hammond, \u201cthere was never a moment\u2019s doubt. I could hear the singularity of the sound. Always this quality seems obvious. Lights flash. Rockets go off. Where is everybody? Why don\u2019t they hear it? This has always amazed me.\u201d\n\nReaching that level of clarity takes years of learning. As John Hammond\u2019s blues-singing son of the same name testifies, \u201c[My father] was a complex guy who was on a mission. He was not in it for the money. He saw himself as independently wealthy and yet he died broke. He never took a royalty for any of the artists he produced . . . he was a straight shooter. He was fastidious about everything he did; dressed well, didn\u2019t drink, if you sent him a letter, he replied. He played viola, understood music charts, spoke five languages. He was a rebel in the sense that he wanted to know things for himself. He could read classical Greek and Latin, and at one point he thought about going into divinity school.\u201d\n\nAlso a bookworm and engaged humanist, Rough Trade\u2019s founder, Geoff Travis, describes the vocation as a form of journalism. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have any idea the work you have to do to have the clear sight to make the critical judgments,\u201d he explains. \u201cI think all of us who run labels spend our whole lives listening to music. Because to be able to judge something as being special you have to know everything else out there. It\u2019s like Ezra Pound\u2019s famous quote about the first person to compare their love to a rose is quite possibly a genius, the second an idiot. Then consider the sheer volume of music that comes out these days . . . The job of being an A&R person is to hear everything. It\u2019s not a chore, it\u2019s part of the excitement, but it\u2019s a real job; hours every single day researching, going out to gigs every night. The only way to run a record company is to have faith in your judgment. But your judgment has to be informed by a lifetime of work.\u201d\n\nCuriosity, proximity to the street, an openness to people and their stories\u2014all these qualities also make it relatively easy for artists to find the record men. Bob Dylan cleverly wangled his way onto Hammond\u2019s radar, just as Robert Johnson appeared at Henry Speir\u2019s counter. Elvis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis all turned up on Sam Phillips\u2019s doorstep. Bob Marley asked for an introduction to Chris Blackwell. Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr bluffed his way into the Rough Trade warehouse, pretending to be an employee and waited for Travis to appear through a doorway. In the history of music, such incidents are not unique. Great artists, having a strong sense of their own destiny, tend to choose their midwife.\n\nThe modern record man has an ancestor in the noble houses of Europe. Centuries of classical music repertoire depended on composers getting recognized and financially supported by wealthy patrons. Having a patron was the gateway into opera halls, theaters, and cathedrals. By raising up these artistic mirrors, the patrons sought to enlighten society from the top downward. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, a child of jazz and a grandchild of vaudeville, has simply adapted this ancient system to modern times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spotify?
