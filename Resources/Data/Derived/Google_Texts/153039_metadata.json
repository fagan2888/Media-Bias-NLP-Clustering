It said it included the 2000-2002 models in the crash data because it was possible that some of them contained the suspect algorithm.\n\n\"We call on NHTSA to examine each of the fatal non-deployment crashes to determine whether the air bag should have deployed and why it didn't,\" Clarence Ditlow, the center's executive director, said in the letter.\n\nDitlow credited accident investigator Don Friedman of Xprts LLC with uncovering the alleged defect. Friedman in November had called on NHTSA to open an investigation. A NHTSA probe could ultimately lead to a recall.\n\n\"We will, of course, cooperate with NHTSA if it determines any further action is needed regarding this petition,\" GM spokesman Greg Martin said.\n\nRelated: Did NHTSA Ignore Evidence of Unsafe GM Cars for Years?\n\nNHTSA said in a statement it \"has received and is evaluating a petition about possible defects\" in the deployment of air bags in certain Impalas.\n\nThe air bag algorithm has also become part of the investigation into a recall begun in February of 2.6 million Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other GM models for a defective ignition switch that could suddenly turn off the car's engine.\n\nQuestions have been raised about whether the largest U.S. automaker was trying to conceal the problem, after years of consumer complaints and at least 13 deaths linked to the faulty part.\n\nNHTSA acting Administrator David Friedman told a congressional hearing last week that his agency's investigators were surprised to learn that turning off the engine caused the air bags to deactivate immediately in the recalled GM cars.\n\nHe said the agency was examining what role, if any, the algorithm in the recalled cars had in the air bags not deploying in accidents.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "General Motors, which has recalled 2.6 million cars for faulty ignition switches that", "title": "GM Faced With Yet Another Faulty Airbag Issue", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/08/GM-Faced-Yet-Another-Faulty-Airbag-Issue", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03272014_GM_Wrapped.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/08/GM-Faced-Yet-Another-Faulty-Airbag-Issue", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03272014_GM_Wrapped.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "General Motors, which has recalled 2.6 million cars for faulty ignition switches that", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01c0\"", "article_summary": "Related: Did NHTSA Ignore Evidence of Unsafe GM Cars for Years?\nHe said the agency was examining what role, if any, the algorithm in the recalled cars had in the air bags not deploying in accidents.\nNHTSA said in a statement it \"has received and is evaluating a petition about possible defects\" in the deployment of air bags in certain Impalas.\nAir bags are not designed to deploy when a passenger's weight is below a certain amount, and a bouncing motion, even when the person is belted, could reduce the weight registered by the seat sensor linked to the air bag algorithm.\n\"We will, of course, cooperate with NHTSA if it determines any further action is needed regarding this petition,\" GM spokesman Greg Martin said."}
