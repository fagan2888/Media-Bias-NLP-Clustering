WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander was endorsed for re-election to the U.S. Senate today by the National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest pro-life organization in the nation.

“During his service in the U.S. Senate, Senator Alexander has been a strong supporter of major landmark pro-life laws including the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which punishes those who injure or kill unborn children while committing federal crimes,” said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. “He is currently co-sponsoring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, groundbreaking legislation to protect unborn children in the sixth month and later, who are capable of experiencing excruciating pain during their abortions.”

“Lamar Alexander was one of the determined pro-life senators who voted against enactment of the Obama health care law,” said Carol Tobias, National Right to Life president. Obama’s health care law – Obamacare – provides government funding for insurance plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will lead to the rationing of lifesaving medical care.

“All voters who are concerned with the right to life and with the protection of the most vulnerable members of the human family should vote to return Senator Alexander to the Senate, so that he can continue to work to advance vital pro-life public policies,” added Tobias.
