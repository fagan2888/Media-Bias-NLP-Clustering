(Photo: Matt Stone/The C-J)\n\nWhen southeastern Indiana became the face of the nation's opioid addiction epidemic, people asked, \"Why Scott County?\"\n\nBut the county's unprecedented HIV outbreak \u2014 the first in the nation linked to the injection of oral painkillers \u2014 revealed underlying issues in Indiana long noted by public health experts that suggest it could happen elsewhere in the state.\n\nThe addiction epidemic has hit Indiana harder than other states, and Indiana has less of a public health infrastructure to deal with the crisis. It ranks among the states with the fewest drug treatment providers and the lowest public health spending.\n\nOther obstacles include the state's previous ban on needle exchange programs, its moratorium on methadone treatment clinics and a criminal justice approach to the problem, instead of one focused on treatment.\n\n\"We've tried the war on drugs for several years. We've lost that battle,\" said state Rep. Steve Davisson, R-Salem, a pharmacist who grew up in Scott County and has been working to change some of the state's policies. \"So we have to have a new mentality now.\"\n\nThe HIV outbreak in Scott County drew national attention with some shocking details.\n\nAddicts are injecting a liquefied form of the potent painkiller Opana more than 10 times a day. Children, parents and grandparents are injecting together as a community activity. The more than 150 cases of new HIV infections identified since December exceed the number of people infected with HIV through injection drug use in New York City last year.\n\nSpecific factors contributed to the Scott County outbreak \u2014 including the area's generational poverty, its rural setting and its proximity to I-65, which links the community with major drug markets.\n\nBut it's not the only vulnerable community.\n\n\"Scott County is probably not unique,\" said Eric Wright, who chairs the Indiana State Epidemiology and Outcomes Workgroup. \"You drop HIV into the mix in any one of those other rural counties and you could have a similar outbreak.\"\n\nMore addicts, fewer treatment options\n\nThe national opioid epidemic is driven by prescription pain medications, and Indiana exceeded all but eight states in the number of pain prescriptions written per 100 people in 2012 \u2014 more than enough for every Hoosier to have his or her own bottle of pain pills.\n\nAfter increasing significantly since 2000, Indiana's prescription drug dependence is now significantly higher than national rates, according to the Epidemiology and Outcomes Workgroup.\n\nThe most effective way to treat substance abuse, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, is with a combination of behavioral therapies and medication.\n\nMethadone was the first drug used to manage the physical symptoms of withdrawal from another opioid. But critics view methadone as just substituting one drug for another.\n\n\"While methadone is helpful to some people for a while, it's very addictive, so we're only changing whatever they're on now to a legal addiction,\" said state Sen. Patricia Miller, R-Indianapolis, who defends the state's longtime moratorium on treatment programs that can dispense methadone.\n\nMiller, a registered nurse who chairs the Senate Health and Provider Services Committee, said other reasons for the moratorium included stories legislators heard about methadone being resold on the street, about people overdosing on methadone and the fact that some of the clinics near neighboring states were being frequented by those states' residents.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons,\" Miller said.\n\nBecause of Indiana's moratorium, the state has less than half the number of opioid treatment program clinics for its size than Illinois \u2014 which has 71 to Indiana's 14 \u2014 and has fewer per capita than all surrounding states except Ohio.\n\nWright and his epidemiology group noticed opioid abuse was growing in parts of the state far from clinics. He testified before a state legislative commission in 2013 that the moratorium should be lifted.\n\n\"We were concerned that restricting access to well thought out and very controlled treatment programs was hampering our ability to address the larger and growing epidemic of opioid addiction,\" he said.\n\nBesides methadone, there's now another drug \u2014 buprenorphine \u2014 used to help manage addiction while treating behaviors. It can be given in an office setting, instead of being restricted to an opioid treatment program as is methadone, if doctors obtain a waiver allowing them to prescribe.\n\nBut only 2.2 percent of doctors nationwide have a waiver and most of them are in urban areas, according to a study published this year in the Annals of Family Medicine. Indiana's rate is even lower \u2014 only 1.7 percent of doctors can prescribe buprenorphine.\n\nIndiana also ranks fourth-worst among states for the number of mental health and addiction treatment providers per 1,000 adults with addiction, according to an analysis by Advocates for Human Potential Inc. More than half of counties \u2014 including Scott \u2014 don't have a practicing psychiatrist.\n\n\"People are not realizing the extent to which (Scott County) is symptomatic of a state where there are absolutely grotesque shortages of appropriate mental health and addiction treatment infrastructure and expertise,\" said Dr. R. Andrew Chambers, director of the addiction psychiatry training program at the Indiana University School of Medicine. \"This is something that we have been raising alarm bells about for a while in Indiana.\"\n\nCost also has been a factor.\n\nBefore the 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility and required both Medicaid and private insurance plans sold through exchanges to include substance-abuse services, there wasn't a good payment mechanism, said Stephen C. McCaffrey, head of Mental Health America of Indiana.\n\n\"The result is there was little reason to go into the profession,\" he said. \"So we have a huge workforce development shortage.\"\n\nPublic health funding low\n\nFunding for other parts of the state's health infrastructure also has been in short supply.\n\nWhen Mitch Daniels first campaigned for governor in 2004, he said Indiana was leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table while other states had mobilized to compete for health care grants from the federal government. During his time in office, his administration tried to rebuild relationships with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIndiana briefly moved up from last place in per-capita CDC funding in 2008 to as high as 35th in 2010. But it has been back at the bottom since 2012, according to annual rankings from Trust for America's Health in Washington.\n\nIndiana also ranks low \u2014 44th \u2014 in the per-capita amount of its own money spent on public health.\n\nBeth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University, said the HIV outbreak in Scott County revealed \"we're not prepared and our system is kind of broken down.\"\n\n\"I often say that (the Indiana State Department of Health) is fighting the good fight with two hands tied behind their backs,\" she said. \"We really have a notion in the Midwest of 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps' and there isn't a very good communitarian notion of care.\"\n\nFederal and state funding cuts prompted Planned Parenthood to close five clinics in Scottsburg, Madison, Richmond, Bedford and Warsaw.\n\nPatti Stauffer, vice president of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, said she can't make a direct link between the closure of the Scottsburg clinic \u2014 which served 1,500 patients in the last full year before it closed \u2014 and the HIV outbreak.\n\n\"But that health center was providing HIV tests in Scott County, and any positive tests would have been reported to the state,\" she said.\n\nLow public health funding affects a state's ability to detect problems such as an HIV outbreak and to address them quickly, said Jeff Levi, executive director of Trust for America's Health and an HIV expert. \"But some of the issues associated with this have less to do with money and more to do with policy and appropriate policy response.\"\n\nHe said the biggest obstacle was the state's previous ban on needle exchange programs, as well as a lack of access to substance abuse treatment.\n\nChanging strategies\n\nThe health of counties across the nation is evaluated annually by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. This year they reported that more than 60 percent of counties in the country have improved premature death rates since 2004. In Indiana, however, only 43 percent of counties have gotten better.\n\nScott County has the worst premature death rate in the state. It also has been ranked the least healthy county in the state for the past six years.\n\nSince the HIV outbreak, help has poured into Scott County from the state and federal governments and nongovernmental groups. (The cost to the state's Medicaid program for treating those infected is estimated to be nearly $5 million a year.)\n\nState legislators responded by approving more funding to address substance abuse, including money to help pay off student loans for health professionals willing to treat addiction. Lawmakers now let local governments start needle exchange programs if they can prove to the Department of Health that a hepatitis C or HIV epidemic is occurring. And they will allow up to five more opioid treatment programs in Indiana over the next three years.\n\nDavisson, the lawmaker from Salem, had wanted 25 more. But said five is a good first step.\n\n\"I feel like if (Scott County) had had access to something like that earlier, we might have been able to prevent some of the problems,\" he said.\n\nMcCaffrey, the head of Mental Health America of Indiana, said many steps are needed to address the problem. But, for the first time, all the stakeholders in the criminal justice, public health and mental health communities have come together to say \"we need to figure out how to provide treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"That has never happened before in Indiana,\" he said. \"We have a history of just locking people up.\"\n\nStill, the emergency response teams trying to figure out how to control what's happening in Indiana are realizing that substance abuse treatment in Indiana is very minimal and the system can't turn on a dime.\n\nWhat is evident, health experts says, is that communities with warning signs shouldn't think that what happened in Scott County is an anomaly.\n\n\"I really don't think we're unique,\" said Scott County's Bridgewater. \"We just happened to be first.\"\n\nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
