Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate dropped from 14.3 percent to 8.5 percent in 2014 \u2014 a decrease of 5.8 percent, which ranked first in the country.\n\nSeveral surveys such as Gallup previously have found Kentucky to have one of the most dramatic uninsured rate decreases since the federal health care reform law, but the figures released by the Census are considered the most authoritative.\n\nWhile Kentucky had the 18th highest uninsured rate in 2013, it now ranks 37. The overwhelming majority of those gaining health insurance in Kentucky are covered by Medicaid, which is being paid for in full by the federal government until 2017. At that time, Kentucky\u2019s state government will have to kick in an increasing percentage for their coverage, topping out at 10 percent in 2020 \u2014 which is still far below the 30 percent the state contributes for those covered by traditional Medicaid.\n\nGov. Steve Beshear\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid in 2013 has become a major issue in this year\u2019s gubernatorial race, as candidates grapple with embracing or questioning its effect.\n\nThough Democrat Jack Conway has been attacked in TV ads by outside groups for supporting Beshear\u2019s move to expand Medicaid \u2014 attempting to tie him to President Barack Obama, who is mostly unpopular in Kentucky \u2014 he wants to keep it in place, as does independent candidate Drew Curtis. Conway has frequently cited Republican candidate Matt Bevin saying earlier this year that he would immediately repeal the Medicaid expansion. Conway has called such a move callous, saying it will throw half a million Kentuckians off of their insurance.\n\nDespite video evidence of his remarks, Bevin has repeatedly denied ever saying he would repeal Medicaid expansion. He now says he is considering a \u201ctweak\u201d of the expansion and following the example of Indiana, which received a waiver to expand Medicaid to those who pay a small monthly premium. However, Bevin\u2019s campaign website still states that he believes \u201cThe Medicaid expansion enacted under Obamacare is unaffordable for the taxpayers of Kentucky and should be repealed.\u201d\n\nAshley Spalding, a research and policy associate at the progressive Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, says the new figures released by the Census are yet another sign that health care reform is working in Kentucky \u2014 in addition to an independent study by Deloitte and the University of Louisville\u2019s Urban Studies Institute showing Medicaid expansion will create jobs and provide a large economic impact, all while saving the state money.\n\n\u201cThis data confirms Medicaid expansion and Kynect are commonsense solutions for helping Kentuckians be healthy and more productive members of their communities,\u201d says Spalding. \u201cWe already knew Kentucky was seeing huge benefits from those solutions, but the country\u2019s official data on health insurance rates reaffirms the impact.\u201d\n\nThe full chart from the Census showing the change in each state\u2019s insurance rate in 2014 is below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "U.S. Census shows Kentucky had the largest uninsured rate decrease in 2014.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "U.S. Census shows Kentucky had the largest uninsured rate decrease in 2014.", "title": "U.S. Census shows Kentucky had the largest uninsured rate decrease in 2014 - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 678, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-16-at-12.13.41-PM.png", "height": 432}, "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/metro/u-s-census-shows-kentucky-largest-uninsured-rate-decrease-2014/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Government", "tag": "Kynect", "published_time": "2015-09-16T13:21:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca8e\"", "article_summary": "Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate dropped from 14.3 percent to 8.5 percent in 2014 \u2014 a decrease of 5.8 percent, which ranked first in the country.\nWhile Kentucky had the 18th highest uninsured rate in 2013, it now ranks 37.\nConway has frequently cited Republican candidate Matt Bevin saying earlier this year that he would immediately repeal the Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cThis data confirms Medicaid expansion and Kynect are commonsense solutions for helping Kentuckians be healthy and more productive members of their communities,\u201d says Spalding.\nDespite video evidence of his remarks, Bevin has repeatedly denied ever saying he would repeal Medicaid expansion."}
