The benefits include 180 days of transition Tricare coverage.\n\nNevertheless, about 25 percent of 4,247 who received VSP in 2014 were wrongly issued the medical benefits, Air Force officials said.\n\nService officials told the Times that the Air Force does not provide TAMP benefits to those involuntarily separating because they receive a payment and have more time to plan for transition.\n\nA number of airmen said they were misled.\n\nA captain who left the Air Force late last month said he had been promised 180 days of medical coverage, but learned when he separated that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hit in the gut,\u201d the Times quoted him as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. They asked us to get out, and the last day you go and they say, \u2018You don\u2019t get this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA major who separated Sept. 29 said he had gotten mixed messages about extended health care, and recently was told he would have coverage, the paper reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told conflicting things since April,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody had any guidance until two or three weeks ago. The family center that does transition, they didn\u2019t know, and didn\u2019t get a list of what benefits would come. They defaulted to the line that if you volunteer, you don\u2019t get six months medical. As we\u2019re following up, in the last month or so [before separation], my wife called the DEERS field office, they looked at the code, and said, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re entitled to the benefits.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"dc.description": "More than 1,000 airmen given six months of transitional health insurance when they voluntarily separated suddenly lost coverage.", "dc.identifier": "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/10/10/air-force-cancels-health-care-for-airmen-separating-voluntarily.html", "ma": {"startdate": "2014-10-10T00:00:00Z", "contenttype": "maNews", "name": "Air Force Cancels Health Care for Airmen Separating Voluntarily", "image": "http://images.military.com/media/news/people/separating-airmen-600x400-ts90.jpg", "source": "synd", "id": 1199452556615}, "description": "More than 1,000 airmen given six months of transitional health insurance when they voluntarily separated suddenly lost coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "Military.com", "description": "More than 1,000 airmen given six months of transitional health insurance when they voluntarily separated suddenly lost coverage.", "title": "Air Force Cancels Health Care for Airmen Separating Voluntarily", "url": "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/10/10/air-force-cancels-health-care-for-airmen-separating-voluntarily.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://images.military.com/media/news/people/separating-airmen-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.contributor": "Katy OHara", "dc.publisher": "Brendan McGarry", "p": {"domain_verify": "d63ea8dea5c5b3636abbfd1d1f15fd56"}, "dc.creator": "Brendan McGarry", "dc.source": "Stars and Stripes", "dc.datesubmitted": "2014-10-10T19:29:58Z", "msvalidate.01": "025B9B5D734615E165952EE006CF8C36", "dc.date.created": "2014-10-10T18:30:34Z", "dc.title": "Air Force Cancels Health Care for Airmen Separating Voluntarily", "dc.date.modified": "2014-10-10T19:29:58Z", "viewport": "width=980", "dc.language": "en"}, "article_summary": "The Air Force blamed clerical errors at a number of bases for allowing the airmen to mistakenly receive the health coverage in the first place, the Air Force Times reported Thursday.\nNevertheless, about 25 percent of 4,247 who received VSP in 2014 were wrongly issued the medical benefits, Air Force officials said.\nMore than 1,000 airmen who were given six months of transitional health insurance when they voluntarily separated are now seeing their coverage yanked.\nA captain who left the Air Force late last month said he had been promised 180 days of medical coverage, but learned when he separated that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\nService officials told the Times that the Air Force does not provide TAMP benefits to those involuntarily separating because they receive a payment and have more time to plan for transition."}
