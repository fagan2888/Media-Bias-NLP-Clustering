Creepy Uncle Sam is back. The anti-Obamacare character from Generation Opportunity (GenOpp, for short) is taking his show on the road, kicking off a “Creepy Care-nival” at the National Mall from 6pm to 9pm on July 23.

Over the weekend, this author received a SnapChat (which he didn’t screenshot because that’s not cool, yo) from GenOpp’s creepyuncle.sam previewing Monday’s announcement.

BuzzFeed Benny has a write-up, full of .gifs from the announcement video:

According to Genn Opp (sic) leadership, the point of all this is to organize young people with “little bit of creepiness.” “It’s a seemingly exciting event where all the games are rigged against young people with a little bit of creepiness,” Evan Feinberg, the group’s president, told BuzzFeed. He called the carnival a symbol for Obamacare. But the carnival isn’t advocating any specific policy or change to the law. It’s just an elaborate, anti-Obamacare roadshow. “The ultimate goal is to educate and mobilize young Americans to kick the Obamacare disaster out of their towns,” he said, adding that the campaign will build on Gen Opp’s Opt Out campaign, in which the group tried to convince young people not to sign up for Obamacare.

You can follow the “Creepy Care-nival” site here, and check out the full video here:

GenOpp debuted Creepy Uncle Sam last September in two separate videos geared toward young women and young men. The videos, which were used to encourage young people to “Opt Out” of Obamacare, generated considerable media coverage.

Creepy Uncle Sam launched a SnapChat campaign late last year, as well, utilizing the new social media app to share weird images with countless recipients. During the same period, GenOpp took its creepy figurehead to college campuses, tailgating with young people and raising awareness for Obamacare’s negative effects.

After the Care-nival on the National Mall, GenOpp will take Creepy Uncle Sam to “10 or 12 states,” so be on the lookout for a raggedy ambulance in your neighborhood in the coming weeks.
