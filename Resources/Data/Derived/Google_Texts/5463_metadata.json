When it came to the elections, I was a dreamer who thought the Democrats were going to retain the Senate. Instead, we got walloped.\u201d\n\nBrown suggested that Democrats erred by running away from President Barack Obama, \u201cwhich simply played into the Republicans\u2019 strategy of portraying him as a failure.\u201d The party also failed to turn out young voters, he said.\n\n\u201cHillary Rodham Clinton must be wondering whether she really wants to run for president. Unless there are some serious readjustments to the Democratic operation, she is going to lose,\u201d Brown concluded.\n\nLast year, Brown had predicted Clinton would win easily in 2016: \u201c..[A]ll she has to do is continue to breath[e] and in 2016 she\u2019ll be elected to the presidency of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown served two terms as mayor of San Francisco, the first African-American to be elected to that office.\n\nSenior Editor-at-Large Joel B.
