Is it healthier to make the switch? \u2014 Doris E., Livingston, Montana\n\nA: Our take: Keep your wooden board. A consistently well-cleaned, not-deeply scarred wooden cutting board made from a fine-grained hardwood is safe to use. The best woods to use include bamboo, which is particularly impervious, as well as maple, walnut, cherry, teak, ash and birch.\n\nBut you still have to be careful! With a wooden cutting board, separate surfaces must be used to cut fresh veggies/fruits and raw meat/poultry/fish to avoid cross-contamination; there\u2019s sometimes salmonella (in raw chicken) and E coli (in ground turkey meat), for example.\n\nAnd after you cut animal products on a wooden board, you have to wash it using hot water, strong soap or a dilute bleach solution, and a disposable dishcloth (no sponges \u2014 they retain bacteria and can add it to the board). Then rinse well.\n\nAnd make sure your board is completely dry before you use it again. Wood boards do have antibacterial properties, but they may absorb bacteria that can live for a few hours below the wood\u2019s surface, even after washing.\n\nA plastic board doesn\u2019t absorb bacteria, and it\u2019s dishwasher-proof. But once the plastic surface becomes scored or cut, it\u2019s a great bacteria magnet \u2014 and a plastic board gets cut up pretty quickly. Then even the dishwasher can\u2019t get it completely clean.\n\nTypically, plastic boards are made from polyethylene. And while some forms of that plastic may leach hormone disruptors, there\u2019s no proof it does so in this hardened state. We say it\u2019s your call on the risks of this plastic, but we know that some \u2014 like the polyethylene terephthalate used to make clear plastic bottles\u2014 are worth staying clear of.\n\nAnd \u2014 knock on wood \u2014 wooden cutting boards have been used for millennia.\n\nQ: I\u2019m having a hip replacement in the fall (mini anterior), and I\u2019m a bit worried about the surgery itself and about \u201cgoing under.\u201d Am I being overanxious? \u2014 Rachel F., Fort Worth, Texas\n\nA: More than 332,000 folks in North America have hip replacement surgery annually.\n\nBut just because a lot of folks have this operation, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a big deal. You need to have a detailed conversation with your surgeon about the parts and surgical technique that will be used and with your anesthesiologist about the options available to manage pain and awareness during surgery.\n\nA mini anterior surgery means the surgeon uses a 4-inch incision to go in from the front (anterior), without cutting through your large hip muscles. This technique speeds up recovery time. You\u2019re up and about sooner than if the surgeon goes in from the side or back. Surgeons may opt for a lateral or posterior incision, however, especially if you\u2019ve had a prior hip replacement, are obese, very muscular or have a wide pelvis.\n\nGeneral anesthesia is frequently used during this kind of surgery. Although it\u2019s much less risky than it used to be, post-anesthesia cognitive problems remain a concern, particularly for the elderly.\n\nThese days many surgeons and anesthesiologists favor regional anesthesia; it results in less blood loss and improved pain control after surgery and negative results are extremely rare.\n\nRegional or local anesthesia is commonly administered as a spinal block (a numbing agent injected into the fluid surrounding your spinal cord); an epidural block (administered through a catheter inserted into the lower back); or a peripheral nerve block (it affects the major thigh nerves in the leg on which they are going to operate). You also can get a sedative, so you\u2019re not aware of what\u2019s going on.\n\nSo don\u2019t forget to discuss all these choices with your doctor in the weeks BEFORE you head to the OR.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
