It aims to provide better healthcare to residents and lower costs at a time when the healthcare industry is gearing up for the second open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith guidelines set by the the state\u2019s Prevention Agenda and proposed State Health Innovation Plan, AHI will convene stakeholders from 14 different sectors \u2014 including mental health, substance abuse, nutrition, and others \u2014 to find what issues and barriers to healthcare are most prevalent in communities across a six-county region.\n\nMegan Murphy is Community Health Services Director for AHI.\n\n\u201cThose issues may be similar or they may be slightly different, and so that\u2019s why you really want to get down to that local planning level and help them work together to figure out what the best solution is. And it may not be more infrastructure, it may be that there just needs to be better communication or innovative ideas that are brought to the forefront.\u201d\n\nBarriers to healthcare could include poverty, lack of transportation, education, and others.\n\nThe grant will fund the AHI\u2019s efforts to reach out to community stakeholders for the next two years. Part of the work will be to build a website that can provide information to the public, insurance buyers, and healthcare providers.\n\nLottie Jameson, Vice President of Regional Health Planning and Development, said in order to promote health and lower healthcare costs in the Adirondack Region as part of the Prevention Agenda and State Health Innovation Plan, it\u2019s essential for all stakeholders to work together.\n\n\u201cTo achieve those goals we know we have to stop working in silos, that we have to work across different sectors to really make a difference make a difference in healthcare status for the people living in our communities.\u201d\n\nAHI is one of 10 New York state regional contractors to receive the grant.\n\nThe organization is also involved in signing people up during the upcoming enrollment period.\n\n\u201cI think the challenge in a rural area is that sometimes our workforce in and of itself, it\u2019s not convenient. You can be working someplace 8 hours, but maybe your drivetime back and forth to home is another hour on either end of that,\u201d said Jameson. \u201cI grew up in rural Washington County, I think we kind of have kind of a mindset and an attitude where a lot of folks feel like \u2018Well I really don\u2019t need any help.\u2019\u201d\n\nAHI enrollment specialists help individuals sign up for health insurance at no charge.
