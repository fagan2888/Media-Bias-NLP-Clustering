Home Office\n\nHome offices are one of the most common deductions, but can also be the most confusing.\n\nAs of 2013 there are two methods for calculating these deductions; the simplified option, which allows you to deduct $5 per square foot of your office, up to 300 square feet, and the old method, which is a much more complicated formula based on the size of your office, the depreciation of your house, and other common expenses.\n\nHome office expenses are one of the most common flags for an audit, though, so whatever option you choose, remember that you can only deduct your home office if it is used regularly and exclusively.\n\nThat means you can\u2019t claim the guest room you occasionally check e-mails in.\n\n2. Car Use\n\nCars are a pretty standard deduction as well, but a lot of people are confused as to what, exactly, they can claim.\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot claim mileage related to your commute, getting to and from the office is considered standard personal use, but you can claim any mileage racked up in the course of running the business.\n\nThat means if you head out to meet clients, or get supplies, that mileage could be deductible.\n\n3. Business and \u201cHobby\u201d Expenses\n\nThe IRS treats businesses and hobbies very differently. You can use business losses to lower your tax bill, but not hobby-related expenses, so the IRS tends to keep a close eye on new business deductions.\n\nIn order to qualify as a business, a venture has to either make money, typically during at least three of five consecutive years, or have a provable plan to make money.\n\nOtherwise, your business may be dubbed a hobby.\n\n4. Start-Up Costs\n\nYou can deduct costs incurred while starting up, or investigating the possibility of starting up, a new business.\n\nThat means, if you paid for any pre-opening travel, advertising, and employee training, that could lower your tax bill.\n\nYou can even deduct costs related to incorporating or forming a partnership.\n\n5. Education or Professional Improvement\n\nBusiness owners fill a lot of different roles in their own company, which means we typically take different classes, or buy books, to help us become more efficient.\n\nThe IRS actually recognizes these efforts at self-improvement, and allows filers to deduct expenses relating to maintaining or improving skills needed for work.\n\nJust remember the education has to improve skills needed for your current job, not qualify you for a new one.\n\nSo a \u201cBookkeeping for Small Business Owners\u201d course may count, but a semester-long CPA-training session probably won\u2019t.\n\nRelated Article: 13 Genius Tax Write-Offs You Need to Take Advantage Of\n\n6. Insurance Premiums\n\nBusiness owners who are self-employed, don\u2019t have any employees, and did not qualify for another group plan either under their spouse or another employer, may deduct health and dental premiums under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf you do have employees, though, you can still get a tax credit of up to 50 percent of your premium costs, as long as you bought the plan through SHOP.\n\n7. Your Children\u2019s Wages (if They Work for You)\n\nFamily businesses are, by definition, run by families.\n\nSo if you own one and you brought on your kids to help, and they are under 18, you can actually deduct any wages paid to them as a business expense, as long as your company is a sole-proprietorship, or a partnership if both parents are owning partners.\n\nBetter yet, those wages aren\u2019t subject to FUTA or social security withholdings either.\n\n8. Cell-Phones and Computers\n\nYou cannot deduct the personal use of any cell phones or computers, but the IRS thankfully recognizes that we use our devices for a mixture of business and pleasure.\n\nAs a result, you can deduct whatever percentage of your device usage is related to running your business.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep track your business and personal usage, like with an itemized phone bill, just so you know exactly what percentage of your use is deductible.\n\n9. Service Fees\n\nBack before credit processing companies began turning iPads into portable point-of-service systems, most business owners knew to deduct the substantial service fees as standard business expenses.\n\nBut now fewer business owners seem to realize that, though the fees have gone down, they are still deductible.\n\nDon\u2019t overlook the costs for standard services necessary to run your business, fees from credit card processing companies, banks, and payment services are usually deductible.\n\n10. Section 179\n\nAccording to the NSBA Small Business Tax Survey, 44 percent of business owners feel Section 179 Deductions were the most important stimulants to business growth.\n\nCongress thankfully voted to extend Section 179 Deductions at the very end of last year, applying them retroactively throughout 2015.\n\nRelated Article: It's Raining Money: Top Business Tax Deductions [FREE CHECKLIST]\n\nThat means businesses can deduct qualifying purchases up to $500,000.
