NORMAN, Okla. (AP) - Construction on a renovation project at the University of Oklahoma football stadium could be halted after a judge issued an injunction for a company that was not chosen for the project despite being the lowest bidder.

District Judge Thad Balkman on Friday granted the injunction sought by HME Inc. The company is suing the OU Board of Regents, the project manager and the company awarded the contract under a state law allowing a higher bidder to be chosen if the low bidder doesn’t meet requirements of a “responsible” bidder.

Balkman stayed his ruling until Tuesday after OU asked HME to post a $30 million bond to cover potential damages that could be caused by delaying construction. OU vice president Anil Gollahalli said construction will continue while OU appeals the ruling.
