Broadcasting bigwigs gathered in Washington for a holiday party thrown by Armstrong Williams, the media mogul and close friend and adviser to Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson.

Williams, a conservative radio host who owns several television stations, hosted a Christmas party on Friday at The Monocle, a swanky American-style restaurant and bar near Capitol Hill.

And it wasn’t just a conservative gathering.

Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, an appointee of President Obama and one of three Democrats on the Federal Communications Commission, lauded Williams in a speech at the party.

“Regardless of our differences, when I moved here six years ago, the one person who called and said let’s meet ... was Armstrong Williams,” Clyburn said. “And I say that often because regardless of our political — we’re on different sides of the political fence — he was the one and most consistently is the one who calls to make sure I’m OK.”

“Even though we might have more differences than similarities, he has never allowed that to get in the way of our friendship,” she said.

David Smith, the owner of Sinclair Broadcast Group, was also on hand, as were several members of the Carson campaign, including Mike Murray, who handles Carson’s small-dollar donations, and Xavier Underwood, a Carson aide who this year made The Hill’s 50 Most Beautiful people list.
