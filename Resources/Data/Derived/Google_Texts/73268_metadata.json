Given that Cruz has made a name for himself in part by railing against what he perceives to be Obama's \u201clawlessness,\u201d it's a fitting answer.\n\nA president's first 100 days is shorthand stemming from the Franklin D. Roosevelt era for what can a leader accomplish during their honeymoon period with the American public. A look at what other presidential hopefuls have said, then, is a stand-in for the one goal they're most willing to spend their political capital on. Below, we've collected what 10 official and unofficial candidates have said about the early days of their hypothetical presidencies.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nThe White House is well aware of the potential for a Republican president to dismantle Obama\u2019s legacy. \u201cOur first 100 days we spent a lot of time signing executive orders undoing what [President George W.] Bush did,\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior aide to Obama, told the Wall Street Journal last year. \u201cI would like not to be sitting on a beach somewhere reading about President Cruz doing that to us, so it\u2019s very important to us\u201d that the actions stand, Pfeiffer said.\n\nCruz says he would do just that. \u201cIf you live by the pen, you die by the pen,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cEverything put in place by executive order can be undone by executive order.\u201d He added that he would use his first 100 days \u201cto engage in a careful, systematic review of each executive action and to rescind every one of them that exceeds the Constitutional and legal authority of the president.\u201d\n\nOn his first day, he said, he would also convene his national security team to conduct a \u201cserious, careful, sober\u201d analysis of Iran's nuclear capabilities.\n\nRand Paul\n\nSince launching his presidential campaign on April 7, the Kentucky senator has focused on the National Security Agency's spying program, and he says ending it would be his first order of business.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/randpaul/status/599031508725207040\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nOn day one of the Fiorina presidency, the former HP CEO says she would make three calls. \u201cFirst is to the prime minister of Israel because how we treat our friends is reassuring to our other friends,\u201d she said during an interview in May after her campaign announcement. Her second call would be to \u201cthe head of Iran\u201d to say the U.S. is imposing more sanctions, she said, and her third call would be to the Democratic Party. \u201cI would tell them, \u2018We have work to do and I look forward to working with both Republicans and Democrats to get work done.\u2019\u201d\n\nRick Perry\n\nIn his announcement speech last week, the former Texas governor laid out a vision for a very busy first day in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cOn my first day in office, I will issue an immediate freeze on all pending regulations from the Obama administration,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThat same day, I will send to Congress a comprehensive reform and rollback of job-killing mandates created by Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, and other Obama-era policies.\u201d He'd also sign an executive order approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, he said.\n\nJeb Bush\n\nThe former Florida governor, who is expected to announce his campaign on Monday, said in May that during his first 100 days in office he would try to change the regulatory environment and \u201cfocus on the things the executive branch, the presidency, the president can do without a whole lot of interaction with Congress.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrfY-2iy82I\n\nHe said he would hire officials who aren't \u201cjust political hacks and academics,\u201d undo executive orders he doesn't agree with, and focus on proposals that have bipartisan support. He said he would also work to \u201crestore the relationships\u201d with countries abroad (specifically with Netanyahu) that foster peace, and repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a 21st century, consumer-directed, patient-driven heath care system has to be a high priority,\u201d he said.\n\nBen Carson\n\n\u201cWell, I think it would be important to have a conversation with the House and the Senate and talk about what our goals as a nation should be,\u201d the retired neurosurgeon said in an April video before he announced his campaign. He goes on to say that he and congressional leaders would lay out \u201ccommon goals and objectives\u201d and \u201cstart by doing some things we all agreed needed to be done.\u201d\n\nHe said getting through the easy tasks would help build stronger relationships. He went on to say that the U.S. needs to do \u201csomething\u201d to address the national debt and to stimulate the economy with deregulation.\n\n\u201cI think if we use that kind of approach we'll be just fine,\u201d Carson says.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjqdpfXPVA\n\nScott Walker\n\nIn March, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked the Wisconsin governor if he would reject any Iran deal he inherited from the Obama administration if it allowed Iran to continue its uranium enrichment program. \u201cAbsolutely, on Day One,\u201d replied Walker, who is expected to announce his campaign in coming weeks.\n\nChris Christie\n\nThe New Jersey governor hasn't formally announced yet, but in February he laid out three priorities for his first 100 days. \u201cWithin the first 100 days, if I were to run for president and be elected, we would change this tax system in this country so that people and companies aren't leaving the country anymore,\u201d he told a group of New Hampshire Republicans.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we would pass a national energy policy, and one that takes full advantage of all of the resources that we have available to us to help grow our economy and make the world a more peaceful and stable place,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cAnd the third thing is ... is to reestablish American leadership around the world.\u201d\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nIn May, the Washington Examiner's David M. Drucker asked the Louisiana governor what he would do on \u201cDay One\u201d if he was elected president. \u201cThe very first thing the president's got to do, domestically, is repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d replied Jindal, who is expected to announce his campaign on June 24.\n\nWhen Drucker said he might not have the votes, Jindal said Democrats wouldn't be as supportive of Obamacare with a Republican in the White House. \u201cI don't think Republicans should start off assuming that Democrats won't help them to get rid of Obamacare. We won elections in a lot of states the president carried, in 2014, [by running] on Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nThe South Carolina senator's most well known statement on his first days in office came in March, before he announced his campaign, when he told an audience in New Hampshire that he would \u201cliterally use the military\u201d to keep Congress in Washington until they ended sequestration cuts to the defense budget.\n\nAnd here is the first thing I would do if I were president of the United States: I wouldn\u2019t let Congress leave town until we fix this. I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to. We\u2019re not leaving town until we restore these defense cuts. We\u2019re not leaving town until we restore the intel cuts. Killing terrorists is the only option other than capturing them, because they're not deterred by death.\n\nAs Bloomberg's David Weigel noted, this was a joke, though some media outlets didn't take it that way.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Arit John", "description": "Busy group.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Busy group.", "title": "What 10 Republican\u00a0Presidential Hopefuls Say They'd Do First", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-11/what-10-republican-presidential-hopefuls-say-their-first-acts-would-be", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i_gBoFO2cWmg/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Busy group.", "title": "What 10 Republican\u00a0Presidential Hopefuls Say They'd Do First", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-11/what-10-republican-presidential-hopefuls-say-their-first-acts-would-be", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i_gBoFO2cWmg/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "Busy group."}, "parsely-title": "What 10 Republican\u00a0Presidential Hopefuls Say They'd Do First", "parsely-tags": "Ted Cruz,2016,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NPRXR36KLVRA01", "parsely-author": "Arit John", "date": "2015-06-11T09:45:03.631Z", "keywords": "Ted Cruz,2016", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz,2016", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-11T09:45:03.631Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i_gBoFO2cWmg/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-11/what-10-republican-presidential-hopefuls-say-their-first-acts-would-be"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf382\"", "article_summary": "A president's first 100 days is shorthand stemming from the Franklin D.
