HOW DO WE KEEP MORE OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HERE AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THE GOOD JOBS. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT THAT QUALITY OF LIFE. AND DO NEBRASKANS AGREE? GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. I'M ROB McCARTNEY. I'M BRANDI PETERSEN. THIS IS A SPECIAL COMMITMENT 2014 EDITION OF KE TVs \"CHRONICLE\". THEY ARE SPENDING AN HOUR EACH WITH US, DISCUSSING THE TOPICS THAT MEAN MOST TO THEM AND TO YOU. LAST WEEK WE TALKED WITH HASSLE BROOK. TV.COM. HE GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WITH AN NBA IN MARKETING AND FINANCE. HE AND HIS WIFE LIVE IN OMAHA WITH THEIR THREE CHILDREN. AFTER GRADUATING, HE WORKED AT UNION PACIFIC BEFORE WORKING IN HIS FAMILY'S BUSINESS THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME KNOWN AS TDAMERITRADE. HE SERVED ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IS A DIRECTOR FOR THE CHICAGO CUBS. HIS RUNNING MADE IS MIKE FOLEY. SELECTED JUST OVER A MONTH AGO. FOLEY RAN AGAINST HIM IN THE PRIMARY AND IS CURRENTLY STATE AUDITOR. IT WAS JUST A GREAT HONOR FOR ME TO BE ASKED TO SERVE WITH PETE, TO RUN WITH PETE. HE'S GOT A LOT OF DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE AS I LAID OUT. HE'S BEEN A STATE SENATOR. HE WORKED ON PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION AND STATE AUDITOR. I LOVE THIS STATE. AND FOREVER THANKFUL FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE WHO HAVE FAITHFULLY SUPPORTED ME. I WISH YOU WELL. HE ADDED FOLEY AS HIS RUNNINGMATE AND CREATED A BALLOT CONTROVERSY. HIS NAME WAS REPLACED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN PETITIONED FOR CHANGE. THAT HAD TOP NEBRASKA DEMOCRATS PUSHING BACK. SINCE THE NEBRASKA CONSTITUTION GIVES THE GOVERNOR A CHOICE FOR A RUNNINGMATE, IT OUTWEIGHS THE SEPTEMBER 1ST DEADLINE TO LOCK IN CANDIDATES IN STATE LAW. HE BLAST HIS LEADERSHIP. SAYING HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE THE SEPTEMBER 1ST DEADLINE. EVENTS IN THIS STATE THAT HAVE ERODED PUBLIC TRUST IN THEIR THE MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NEXT GOVERNOR IS TO LEAD WITH INTEGRITY AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, TO EARN BACK THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. THE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR CHALLENGED THE RULING AND DECIDED NOT TO FIGHT THE DECISION. AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST MONTH, THE RACE IS PROVING TO HAVE A LOT MORE TWISTS AND TURNS. A HIGHLY CONTESTED RACE IN 2006 WHEN HE RAN AGAINST INCUMBENT SENATOR BEN NELSON. 370 PEOPLE VOTED TO KEEP NELSON IN OFFICE, TAKING 64% OF THE VOTE. IT ALL ADDS UP TO 214,000 VOTES. THAT ALL BEING SAID, JOINING US NOW TO TALK ABOUT HIS RUN FOR GOVERNOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY ISSUES TO TALK ABOUT. LOOKING AT ALL THAT, 2006, EVERYTHING WITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ISSUE, IS IT ALL WORTH IT? WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE GOVERNOR? IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR IN THE STATE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT T BY 2050 THERE WILL BE 2 BILLION MORE PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WE HAVE TO PRODUCE 100% MORE FOOD BECAUSE OF RISING STANDARDS OF LIVING. WE'RE IDEALLY SITUATED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. IT'S GOING TO COME FROM PRODUCTIVITY AND INNOVATION. I'M JUST EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HELP PUT TOGETHER THE PLAN THAT WILL UNLEASH THE POTENTIAL HERE IN THE STATE AND ALLOW US TO GROW JOBS, KEEP OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS HERE AND REALLY WORK WITH NEBRASKANS ACROSS THE STATE TO PUT THAT TOGETHER. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT GROWING GROWING -- IT'S A PERFECT METAPHOR FOR THE AGRICULTURAL STATE AS YOU SAY. IF YOU'RE ELECTED AND YOU GET IN, WHAT'S JOB 1? THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT ON MY CAMPAIGN. THE FIRST THING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IS TAX REFORM, ESPECIALLY PROPERTY TAX. ABSOLUTELY THE NO. 1 ISSUE. WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING TO A FARMER, RANCHER OR A HOMEOWNER IN OMAHA. EVERYBODY KNOWS OUR PROPERTY TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. WE ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY, AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURING, PUT OUT PLANS FOR HOW TO DO THAT. THE THIRD THING WE'LL FOCUS ON IS EDUCATION. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO A SINGLE MANUFACTURER ACROSS THE STATE WHO SAYS THEY CAN'T FIND ENOUGH WELDERS OR MACHINISTS OR TECHNICIANS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY VOCATIONAL TRAINING IS LOOKED AT IN OUR SCHOOLS. TO DO AS WELL IS HELP FOCUS ON VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN OUR SCHOOLS, STARTING IN JUNIOR HIGH AND MIDDLE SCHOOL. YOU'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR. HOW DOES THAT TRANSFER TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER VARIABLES YOU DON'T DEAL WITH? CERTAINLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT RIGHT, AS THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, THE GOVERNOR IS AN EXECUTIVE POSITION. WE USED TECHNOLOGY AND BEST BUSINESS PRACTICES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELIVER OUR SERVICES BETTER AND BRING DOWN OUR COSTS. EVERY PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANY HAS TO DO THAT OR THE COMPETITORS ARE GOING TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. NOBODY IS GOING TO PUT THE STATE OF NEBRASKA OUT OF BUSINESS, RIGHT? WE HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE ON THOSE AND DO A BETTER JOB RUNNING OR SERVICES. THAT'S SOMETHING I DID IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT I COULD BRING TO THE GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO BRING DOWN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO REDUCE THE GROWTH RATE TO ALLOW REVENUES TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND BRING OUR EXPENSES DOWN, WHICH IS HOW WE CAN MAKE THE TAX CUTS. PEOPLE LOOK BACK AT THE LAST RACE AND THEY SAY 12 MILLION, 11 SOME MIL. THEY SAY YOU TRIED TO BUY THAT YOU TRYING TO BUY THIS RACE? HOW DO YOU FIGHT THAT ARGUMENT? CERTAINLY IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I HEARD IN THE LAST RACE. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING IN LIFE, YOU WANT TO LEARN FROM YOUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND TRY TO DO BETTER. AS I LOOK AT THIS RACE, I FOCUSED A LOT ON REACHING OUT TO FOLKS ACROSS NEBRASKA AND GETTING THEM TO INVEST IN MY CAMPAIGN. SO IF YOU LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE, THE FUNDRAISING SUPPORTS I'VE GOT TREMENDOUS SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP ME BE ABLE TO RUN THIS RACE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE THINGS I HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR LAST TIME AND FOCUSED ON THIS TIME. THE IMPORTANT THING I LEARNED IS WHEN SOMEBODY WRITES YOU A $5 OR $10 CHECK, THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU AND INVEST IN THE CAMPAIGN. WE MADE THAT A FOCUS AS WELL. ARE THERE SPECIFIC OFFICES YOU'RE LOOKING AT OR LOOKING AT EVERY OFFICE AND DETERMINE WHERE WE CAN CUT? WHERE DO YOU BEGIN? THERE MAY BE PROGRAMS THAT ANYMORE AND COSTING US MONEY AND WE WANT TO DO AWAY WITH. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE TO ONE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND REDESIGNING AND RE-ENGINEERING. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND IN OUR COMPANY. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO THINGS AND BRING THE COSTS DONE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REENGINEER THE WAY WE DO THINGS TO BRING THE COSTS DOWN AND DO A BETTER JOB. PROBABLY GOING TO GET INTO THIS LATER ON IN ANOTHER SUBJECT, BUT SPEAKING OF THAT, WHAT KIND OF MANAGER ARE YOU? ARE YOU A HANDS ON OR HANDS OFF? WELL, YOU REALLY AS AN EXECUTIVE HAVE TO FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN BOTH. THE DETAILS TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BUT ALSO GIVE THEM A RESPONSIBILITY AND THE RESOURCES WITH THE GOALS IN MIND AND LET THEM GO AFTER IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO MICROMANAGE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO THEIR JOB AND YOURS AT THE SAME TIME. SO YOU SET GOALS, YOU GIVE THEM RESOURCES, HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE WHETHER THEY'RE REACHING THE GOALS OR NOT AND KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE DETAILS TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A PROBLEM. THAT'S REALLY THE BALANCE YOU HAVE TO STRIKE AS ANY EXECUTIVE. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS GOVERNOR. YOU THINK YOU STRUCK THAT BALANCE AT YOUR COMPANY? I WOULD THINK SO. THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING WITH THE COMPANY. WHEN I TOOK OVER AS PRESIDENT AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, WE HAD ABOUT 2800 JOBS. IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN PLACE, GETTING THE RESOURCES AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. THE NIGHT OF THE PRIMARY YOU MENTIONED HHS. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS COME ALSO INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DIRECTION AND THE DIRECTORS AND REVAMP THERE? ABSOLUTELY. HHS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT. WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. WE'RE GOING TO DO A NATIONAL JOB SEARCH TO FIND THAT PERSON WE CAN BRING IN TO HELP US CHANGE THAT CULTURE, BRING ABOUT THAT REFORM. SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT A TRACK RECORD AND SUCCESS IN DOING THAT LEADERSHIP AND CHANGING THE CULTURE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH HHS AND MAKING THAT A TOP PRIORITY. IT'S SO IMPORTANT. IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A CULTURE WHERE FOLKS ARE AFRAID TO BRING THAT'S A CULTURE WE HAVE TO CHANGE, BRING IN THE PROPER LEADERSHIP TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. SENDING OUT THE GOALS, HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESULTS AND HAVING GOOD THERE'S AN OLD BOOK CALLED \"MANAGEMENT BY WALKING AROUND.\" THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN BEING SUCCESSFUL. I HAD AN OPEN DOOR POLICY. ANYBODY IN THE COMPANY COULD WALK IN MY OFFICE AND SIT DOWN PEOPLE DIDN'T ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE. THEY JUST CAME IN WHEN THEY NEEDED TO. IT WAS A GREAT WAY -- I ALSO WALKED OUT, MADE SURE I WAS AROUND TO TALK TO PEOPLE. THEY STOPPED IN CASUALLY. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINGS TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE LEVEL OF DETAILS NOT. IT'S TIME FOR A SHORT BREAK. YOU'RE WATCHING A SPECIAL ONE HOUR EDITION OF \"CHRONICLE\". WHETHER IT'S FUNDING, OVERCROWDING, SAFETY. FOR YEARS WE HAVE REPORTED ON PRISONS. LAST YEAR IT SEEMS TO HAVE ALL COME TO A HEAD WITH AN EARLY RELEASE OF A CONVICTED SERIAL KILLER. THEN THIS SPRING WE LEARNED THE NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IGNORED A SUPREME COURT DECISION AND RELEASED SOME OFFENDERS BEFORE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT OF THAT DECISION, TRYING TO FIX A SYSTEM THAT APPEARS TO BE BROKEN. JOINING US THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES AND OTHERS IS REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR PETE RICETTS. YOU MENTIONED THE PRISON POPULATION. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IN SOFTWARE. CALCULATING IT AUTOMATICALLY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE, LOOK AT THE CULTURES IN PLACE AND BRING IN THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP TO CHANGE THAT GOING TO EARN THE PUBLIC'S TRUST. WHAT WOULD THE SOFTWARE DO? YOU PUT IN THE INPUTS FOR THE SENTENCE AND IT CALCULATES IT E-MAIL OUT. SO IT TAKES THE HUMAN ASPECT OUT OF IT? RIGHT. HOW ABOUT GOOD TIME LOGS? WOULD THAT BE A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS OR BASED ON TIME? THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE NEED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE GOOD TIME LAW. IT SHOULD BE EARNED TIME. PRISONERS SHOULD NOT GET AUTOMATIC TIME OFF FOR THEIR SENTENCES. FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS, THEY SHOULD GET NO TIME OFF AT ALL. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE HAVE TO GET THE LAW RESTRUCTURED SO IT BECOMES EARNED TIME, NOT GOOD TIME. THE VIOLENT CRIMES WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, IN SOME CASES THEY MAY BE A VIOLENT OFFENDER. WHAT THEY GO TO PRISON FOR THIS VIOLENT OFFENSE. SO DEALING WITH THE HABITUAL CRIMINAL LAW, FOR EXAMPLE, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL? CERTAINLY, WHEN WE BRING IN NEW LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THESE THINGS. THIS IS THE FIRST TRANSITION WE'VE HAD IN 16 YEARS. IT'S REALLY BEEN 16 YEARS. IT REALLY GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY I KNOW IT WORKED 16 YEARS AGO OR 10 YEARS AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING TODAY. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING AND SEE HOW WE CAN DO IT BETTER. YOU SAY THERE HAS TO BE A CULTURE CHANGE AND SHIFT IN CULTURE CHANGE AND AGENCIES. WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WRONG? IT'S ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU LEARN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IF YOU DON'T, YOUR COMPETITORS OF BUSINESS. THAT'S THE MIND SHIFT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN STATE GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL THAT REFORM IS NOT ABOUT A ONE AND DONE. IT'S ABOUT A MENTALITY WHERE WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT HOW TO THAT'S TRUE FOR ANY ORGANIZATION. THERE'S NO ORGANIZATION YOU CAN POINT TO AND SAY, OH, THEY'RE PERFECT, THEY CAN NEVER IMPROVE. WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING TO IMPROVE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN OUT HOW TO CREATE THE CULTURE WHERE WE PUT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE, GIVEN PEOPLE RESPONSIBILITIES SO THEY ALWAYS LOOK AT HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER. IN THIS CASE, IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR AN EMPLOYEE WHO DID NOT RESPOND QUICKLY ENOUGH OR WHO DID NOT MANAGE THEIR PEOPLE CLOSELY ENOUGH, WOULD YOU HAVE LET THEM GO AT TD AMERITRADE? ONE THING YOU WANT TO DO IS PUT SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. I'M NOT ON THE INSIDE RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS THAN YOU DO READING THE PAPER. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE GOOD LINES OF COMMUNICATION, YOU HAVE A CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE CAN BRING BAD NEWS TO THE BOSSES SO YOU CAN MAKE THE CHANGES LIKE PROBLEMS WE SEEM TO HAVE HAD DON'T LAY THERE FOR A WHILE. AGAIN, THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THINGS BETTER. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE TO DO IS BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION THE GOVERNOR HAS LAID AND TAKE IT FROM THERE AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE ANY PRELIMINARY PLANS IN MIND TO ALLEVIATE THE PRISON OVERCROWDING? WE'RE LOOKING AT PRISON OVERCROWDING. THE COUNCIL OF STATEMENT GOVERNMENTS WAS IN HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO STAND DRUG COURTS WHICH ARE 90 TO 95% EFFECTIVE. VETERANS COURTS TO KEEP OUR VETERANS OUT OF TROUBLE BEFORE GETTING INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM. WHAT CAN WE DO WITH MORE SUPERVISED RELEASE? PROBATION OFFICERS. IT COSTS LESS TO HIRE A PROBATION OFFICER THAN TO INCARCERATE SOMEBODY. THIS IS ALL THINGS THE COUNCIL OF STATE GOVERNMENTS RECOMMENDED WHEN THEY WERE IN HERE. I TALKED WITH THE POLICE CHIEF IN OMAHA AND THAT'S WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE. THAT'S HOW TO LOOK AT THE PROBLEM, HOW WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER AND MAKE SURE THE THINGS THAT WE DO THERE ARE GOING TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE, SEE HOW IT WORKS FIRST. HOW ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL? DO WE NEED MORE OF THOSE THINGS IN PRISON SYSTEMS? CERTAINLY MAKING SURE -- AGAIN, THIS IS WHERE THE SUPERVISOR COMES IN. WE'VE GOT PROBATION OFFICERS WHO ARE MONITORING THOSE RECENT RELEASED PRISONERS AND FOLLOWING AND MAKING SURE THEY GET THE HELP THEY NEED. THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS TO IMPROVE IT AND JUST IN GENERAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE AT THE STATE IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN ALSO IMPROVE. SHERIFFS, THEY'LL SAY A CONTINUOUS PROBLEM IS SOMEONE MAY DO SOMETHING, THEY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, END UP IN THE COUNTY JAIL, GET RELEASED AND END UP IN THE COUNTY JAIL AGAIN. IT BECOMES A REVOLVING DOOR FOR SOME PEOPLE. THERE'S CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, HOLES IN OUR SAFETY NET THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE TO CATCH THOSE PEOPLE SO THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED. SO MENTAL HEALTH -- I'M SORRY, ROB. SO MENTAL HEALTH NOT IN THE PRISON SYSTEM BROAD-BASED. WE'RE TRYING TO CUT COSTS? YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW TO DELIVER THE SYSTEMS AND DO A BETTER JOB. WITH MEDICAID FOR INSTANCE, WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD DATABASE FOR MANAGING OUR MEDICAID PATIENTS. ASSOCIATION, THEY TOLD ME, FOR INSTANCE, YOU COULD BE A MEDICAID PATIENT WHO GOES TO HASTINGS, GETS AN M.R.I. AND DRIVES TO CARNEY AND GETS ANOTHER ONE. WE IN THE STATE WOULDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER UNTIL WE GOT THE BILL IN THE MAIL. GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WOULD SAY DON'T DO THE SECOND M.R.I. AND CALL ANOTHER LOCATION AND YOU CAN PREPARE PROVIDERS SO WE KNOW THIS. CHILD WELFARE IS THE SAME DEAL. WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD DATABASE FOR MANAGING OUR CHILD WELFARE. I DON'T KNOW IF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA KNOWS HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN THE SYSTEM. IF WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY OF THEY'RE GETTING THE CARE THEY DESERVE? IF WE KNOW THEY'RE GETTING THE CARE THEY DESERVE AND WE'RE GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES, OUR COSTS WILL COME DOWN. SO BY IMPROVING THE SYSTEM, IT WILL HELP US. DOWN BUT IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HIGHER MORE PROBATION OFFICERS, MORE MENTAL HEALTH PERSONNEL, THINGS LIKE THAT. I WANT TO GET TO MONEY IN A LITTLE BIT HERE. ALONG THOSE LINES, YOU MENTIONED CHILD WELFARE AND ONE OF THE THINGS OUT THERE CONTINUOUSLY IS FOSTER CARE. WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ON TIGHTENING THE REIGNS ON FOSTER PARENTS, AND FOLLOW-UP, THE INVESTIGATION AND PAYING FOR IT? THAT'S AGAIN WHERE WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB ON OUR DATABASE MANAGEMENT. RIGHT? SO, FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S SOFTWARE THAT OTHER STATES USE TO HELP TRACK THE KIDS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING GOOD OUTCOMES. IF YOU'RE TRACKING THE KIDS AND TRACKING OUTCOMES, YOU'RE CREATING AN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE FOSTER PARENT AS WELL. MY WIFE IS A COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE AND SHE'S SEEN FIRSTHAND THE ISSUES WE HAVE IN CHILD WELFARE. A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT THE FOSTER PARENTS. IT'S THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON MAKING THE SYSTEM SUCH THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ALLOWABLE FOSTER PARENTS TO GIVE THE KIDS THE CARE THEY NEED. JUDGES HAVE A HUGE ROLE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE KIDS. OUT WHEN WE DID THE PRIVATIZATION OF CHILD WELFARE EARLIER. THERE'S A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS TO BRING IN TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT. SOMEONE WOULD HAVE SOLVED THIS ALREADY. WE CAN DO THIS. BY PUTTING THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN PLACE, WE CAN FIX THE SYSTEMS TO GET THOSE IMPROVED. YOU SAID EDUCATION IS ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES. OF THOSE AREAS? WELL, WITH REGARD TO EDUCATION IN PARTICULAR, I WANT TO FOCUS ON CAREER AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO A MANUFACTURER YET WHO HASN'T TOLD ME THEY CAN'T FIND ENOUGH WORKERS. WE HAVE JOBS AVAILABLE TODAY IF PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING. TO GIVE YOU EXAMPLE, IF YOU GET A TWO-YEAR ELECTRICIAN DEGREE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, YOU'RE GOING TO START AT 22 BUCKS AN HOUR. YOU STAY THERE AND PASS TWO TESTS, YOU'RE MAKING $28 AN HOUR. THINK ABOUT THAT, THAT'S A 21-YEAR-OLD MAKING $56,000 A YEAR AND FULL BENEFITS. THAT'S A GREAT CAREER. WE HAVE TO LET OUR KIDS KNOW THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AT A YOUNG AGE. WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH, EVERYBODY WAS REQUIRED TO TAKE INDUSTRIAL ARTS. THE SCHOOL SYSTEM DOESN'T DO THAT ANYMORE. IT'S A HUGE DISSERVICE TO OUR KIDS. WE NEED TO EXPOSE THEM TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT KIND OF PATHS ARE THERE TO PURSUE. I HAVE SOME IDEAS ON HOW TO CHANGE THIS MENTALITY. GRAND ISLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS INVESTED $8 MILLION AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR PUT IN $2 MILLION IN STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT IT IS THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT TO GET IN. IT STARTS CHANGING THAT MENTALITY OF THE STIGMA ATTACHED GOING INTO THE SKILLED LABOR FORCE. THE CAREER VOCATIONAL EDUCATION TO ALLOW YOU TO TAKE THAT JOB. LITTLE BIT? ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE LINE OF MEDICAID EXPANSION. YOU SAY EITHER/OR. PLAN A, PLAN B. WHAT'S YOUR STANCE ON THAT? THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO PRESERVE IS STATE AID. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STATE AID FORMULA. WE HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS THE RISE OF AG LAND VALUATIONS HAS COMING UP SO MUCH SO QUICKLY, A LOT OF OUR RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AREN'T GETTING EQUALIZED ANYMORE. THE ROUGH NUMBERS, THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS A BUDGET OF $7.9 MILLION. THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA PRESSURE ON PROPERTY TAXES. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE AG LAND VALUATIONS WENT UP SO QUICKLY. REFORMING THE SCHOOL AID FORMULA IS A JOB THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE, IT'S NOT HOW MUCH DOLLARS WE'RE SPENDING BUT HOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO PRESERVE THAT STATE AID EDUCATION. A LOT OF DISTRICTS, WE JUST HAD STORIES ON THIS WEEK, SOME LANDOWNERS SAY THEY SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX INCREASES. THE DISTRICT IS SAYING WE DON'T HAVE INTERNET IN OUR SCHOOL. WE CLEARLY NEED THIS. AS GOVERNOR, DO YOU GO IN AND HELP WITH SITUATIONS LIKE THAT IN PARTICULAR DISTRICTS? IS THERE A WAY THE STATE CAN HELP WITHOUT GETTING INVOLVED? HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT THAT? WE NEED COOPERATION OF THE FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE. THE COUNTY BOARDS AND SCHOOL BOARDS NEED TO DO THEIR PARTS. WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE STATE LEVEL, THOUGH, IS START FREEING UP THE UNFUNDED MANDATES SO THEY OWN BUDGETS. I WAS TALKING TO A SUPERINTENDENT AND THIS YEAR WE IT SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING FOR TEACHERS. THAT'S A GOOD THING. WHO COULD BE AGAINST THAT? BUT THE STATE DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY MONEY FOR IT. SO THE TEACHER HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT. THEY CAN DO IT JUST LIKE SUPERINTENDENTS ACROSS THE STATE CAN FIGURE IT OUT. THAT'S ANOTHER EXPENSE. THAT'S LESS FLEXIBILITY THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS TO MANAGE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. HE HAS TO FIGURE OUT WORKING WITH THE ISSUE HOW HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. CLASSROOMS. WE'VE ADDED AN EXTRA HOUR ON PER YEAR FOR TEACHER TRAINING. NOW THERE'S ONLY SO MANY HOURS TEACHERS HAVE FOR TRAINING. WE JUST MANDATED THIS ONE AND ALREADY ASKING TEACHERS TO DO EVERYTHING ALREADY, WHICH IS UNFAIR. THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND MORE OF THEIR OWN DOLLARS AND DO THINGS LIKE PROVIDE INTERNET. WE SHOULD TRUST OUR SUPERINTENDENT AND OUR SCHOOL BOARD. WE ELECT THEM LOCALLY. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEMS. I THINK SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING IS A GREAT THING BUT I TRUST OUR SCHOOL BOARDS AND SUPERINTENDENTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THAT TRAINING AND NOT HAVE US IN LINCOLN TRYING TO TELL EVERYBODY WHAT TO DO. BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MONEY, THOUGH. A LOT OF THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COMES FROM PROPERTY TAXES. YOU HAVE SAID YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF TOUCHING THE CASH RESERVE, POSSIBLY GOING UP, USING THAT. YOUR OPPONENT SAYS, HEY, YOU SHOULDN'T USE IT FOR ANY ONGOING KIND OF DEAL LIKE THAT. DO IT AS A ONE-TIME PAYMENT, BUT EVENTUALLY IT WILL RUN OUT POSSIBLY AND YOU HAVE PROMISES YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND MONEY FOR. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THE TAXPAYER MONEY. THAT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S MONEY. THAT'S THE TAXPAYER MONEY. IF WE HAVE LEFTOVER MONEY IN RETURNED TO THE TAXPAYERS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO IS START RETURNING IT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP DOING THAT. AT SOME POINT, I CAN'T SPEND DOWN THE CASH RESERVE ANYMORE. IT GIVES US TEMPORARY RELIEF RIGHT NOW WHILE WE GO ABOUT ADDRESSING THE BIGGER ISSUES OF HOW DO WE REENGINEER STATE DOWN? AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, WE DRILL REVENUES OF 5% ON AVERAGE. I THINK THE LAST BUDGET WE PASSED WAS A 3.6% IN INCREASING EXPENSES. WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR EXPENSES BELOW WHAT OUR REVENUES ARE GOING AT. THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE PROPERTY TAX CREDIT RELIEF FUND OR BRING OUR OWN TAX CREDITS DOWN. WE HAVE TO TAKE TIME TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS AND SEE THOSE COME THROUGH. IN THE SHORT-TERM, I THINK WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY FROM THE CASH RESERVE WHEN WE HAVE EXTRA SURPLUS AND RETURN IT TO THE TAXPAYERS. AFTER ALL, THEY'RE THE ONES THAT PAY FOR IT. KIND OF A JUMP HERE BUT ALONG THE SAME LINES OF GIVING FAMILIES RELIEF, BUT WHAT ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE? IF I THOUGHT RAISING MINIMUM WAGE WOULD DO IT, I WOULD GO FOR IT IN A HEARTBEAT. BUT THERE'S BETTER SOLUTIONS OUT THERE. FIRST OF ALL, IT STARTS WITH GROWING THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO START WITH BETTER PAYING JOBS IN THE STATE AND THEN WORK ON THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, CAREER VOCATIONAL TRAINING. WE HAVE LOTS OF JOBS AVAILABLE TODAY RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THE STATE THAT PAY WAY MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. YOU CAN START WORKING FOR A MANUFACTURING COMPANY AT 12 OR $13. I MENTIONED THE JOB WITH A TWO-YEAR TRAINING, MORE THAN DOUBLE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR. THAT'S THE WAY WE WANT TO ADDRESS IT. WE HAVE TO GROW THE PIE FOR EVERYBODY, SO EVERYBODY WINS. IT'S A WIN-WIN. SOME OF THE BUSINESSES WOULD ARGUE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT JOBS AND LAY OFF PEOPLE. WE'LL HAVE TO REDUCE HOURS. DON'T YOU THINK NEBRASKANS WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY A COUPLE OF EXTRA CENTS MORE ON A PRODUCT THAT PUSHED ALONG THE COST IF IT WAS GOING TO INCREASE THEIR MINIMUM WAGE AND NOT GO IN THEIR POCKETS? I THINK WHAT IT WILL HURT THE WORST IS THE RESTAURANTS AND CAFES. I WAS TALKING TO A GENTLEMAN IN ONE OF OUR SMALL TOWNS WHO, AGAIN, IT'S A SMALL TOWN. HE SAYS I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY JUST TO RAISE MY PRICES. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT IF IT'S $4,000 A PERSON AND YOU HAVE 10 PEOPLE, NOW IT'S $40,000. FOR A SMALL TOWN RESTAURANT OR CAFE, THAT'S A BIG DEAL. THAT'S WHERE HE SAYS TO STAY OPEN I HAVE TO CUT BACK ON HOURS OR LET PEOPLE GO. SO THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS IF WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED HERE. WE HAVE ANOTHER 30 MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES ON \"CHRONICLE\". VETERANS AND MORE ON HEALTH CARE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WELCOME BACK TO THE SPECIAL COMMITMENT 2014 EDITION OF KETV \"CHRONICLE\". HOT TOPICS IS HELPING VETERANS WITH HEALTH CARE AND JOBS TO KEEP THEM FROM LEAVING THE STATE. BUT OUR STATE UNILATERALLY DECIDED OR ARBITRARILY DECIDED THAT POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IS NOT A MENTAL ILLNESS FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT SERVICES. AND THAT IS JUST WRONG. IT'S JUST WRONG ECONOMICALLY AND WRONG BUDGET-WISE. WE OWE MORE FOR OUR VETERANS. IT MAKES OUR STATE STRONGER AND OUR ECONOMY STRONGER. WE'RE ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF STATES THAT TAXES MILITARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS. I HAD A VETERAN TELL ME IT WAS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY RETIRED AND THE TAX PACKAGE WE PASSED ONLY ADDRESSED FUTURE RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS GOING FORWARD IN OUR FUTURE. THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE NEED TO TAKE CARE JOINING US TODAY IS PETE RICKETTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR VETERANS AND OUR TAXES. WOULD THAT BE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU DO IS GET RID OF THE TAXES ON PENSIONS. WHEN I WAS A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, THE MAN WHO RAN MY PROGRAMS WAS A RETIRED VETERAN. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IS SOMEONE WHO WAS A VETERAN. THEY WERE RISING QUICKLY IN THE RANKS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE WE TAX THOSE BENEFITS LEAVE THE STATE. WE LOSE BECAUSE OF IT. IT'S ONE OF THE PACKAGES, PART OF THE PACKAGE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES TO TAX REFORM WHEN ADDRESSING MILITARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS SO WE DON'T HAVE THE VETERANS LEAVING THE STATE. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ALL RETIRED VETERANS? LET'S SAY -- IT'S A STEP. IT'S A SMALL STEP THE FIRST THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN OUT 30 AND 40 AND 50 YEARS? SAW THAT FROM THE CLIP. ONE VETERANS GROUP SAID, WHAT ABOUT ME? I SERVED MY COUNTRY, TOO. WHY AM I NOT INCLUDED? I THINK IT'S A FAIRNESS THAT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE ALL VETERANS. WHAT ABOUT TAX INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO HIRE VETERANS WHO ARE JUST COMING HOME OR LEFT THE MILITARY? IT FALLS INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY. WHEN IT LOOKS AT OUR OVERALL INCENTIVE SYSTEM AND HOW IT TO BE LOOKED AT IT AS WELL. I THINK IT FALLS INTO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY BUT ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT. THE V.A. HAS A BUILD LEASE PROGRAM GOING ON FOR A NEW HOSPITAL. ANYTHING YOU WOULD DO AS WE'VE BEEN ON THIS LIST? I KNOW IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE. YOU WOULD CARRY KIND OF A BIG STICK AROUND THE STATE, BEING THE GOVERNOR. COULD YOU COERCE PEOPLE TO MOVE IT QUICKER? I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD COERCE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING, BUT THE WAY WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THESE PROJECTS IS A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. WITH THE FEDERAL DELEGATION TO GO OUT AND GET YOUR METHODS OUT THERE. YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WE NEED THE PROJECT IN NEBRASKA. WHILE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WEIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S VOICE CARRIES IN D.C., IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ADVOCATING FOR THAT. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT RULE THE GOVERNOR PLAYS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF NEBRASKA TO BE THE ADVOCATE FOR THE PEOPLE HERE AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS I WOULD BE. WHAT ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT? THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN VOCAL TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HIS OPPOSITION TO IT. AS GOVERNOR, I COULD HELP THE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. KNOW THEY MADE A HUGE MISTAKE WHEN THEY PASSED THIS HYPER PARTISAN THEIR DOCTORS, PREMIUMS GOING UP, DEDUCTIBLES GOING UP. IT'S SO NONSENSICAL FOR FOLKS AND UNBELIEVABLE. WE IN THE STATE AS I'VE BEEN CRISS-CROSSING IT. WE KNOW THAT. IT'S UP TO ME AS GOVERNOR TO HELP BE THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IN NEBRASKA TO TELL THAT TO THE FOLKS IN NEBRASKA. YOU WOULD FIGHT AGAINST MEDICAID EXPANSION? ABSOLUTELY. FOR THREE REASONS. ONE IT'S AN EXPANSION OF OBAMA CARE IN THE STATE AND WE JUST DESCRIBED HOW BAD THAT IS. TWO, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PROMISING TO PAY FOR THIS STUFF. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO RENEGE. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE. THE EXPANSION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. NOW THEY'RE DOWN TO PAYING 18%. WHO DO YOU THINK IS PAYING THE REST? WE ARE. THAT'S OUR TAX DOLLARS. TO PAY FOR ADDITIONAL EXPANSION, THEN WE DON'T HAVE THE DOLLARS TO INVEST IN THINGS LIKE ROADS AND EDUCATION THAT WILL HELP US GROW THE STATE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING THOSE WISE INVESTMENTS TO GROW THE STATE. THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IS CREATE MORE AND BETTER PAYING JOBS HERE. CRITICS SAY, LOOK, IT'S A DONE DEAL AND BY NEBRASKA NOT GOING ALONG WITH THIS AND TAKING A STAND, WE'RE PAYING FOR IT ANYWAY. WE'RE NOT SEEING THE BENEFITS. WELL, WE'RE REALLY NOT PAYING FOR IT, RIGHT? THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. WE'RE BORROWING 42 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL. THIS MONEY IS COMING FROM CHINA OR SOMEPLACE ELSE. IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE NOT RUNNING UP THE DEBT MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING. I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. OF COURSE, THERE WAS AN ESTIMATE THAT WOULD COST THE STATE OF NEBRASKA ABOUT $143 MILLION TO EXPAND MEDICAID. AGAIN, THAT'S OUR TAX DOLLARS. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR. I DON'T SEE THIS AS BEING SOMETHING WE'RE NOT COLLECTING OUR FAIR SHARE OR WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR BIT AT THE TROUGH. THIS IS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE OUR TAX DOLLARS HERE IN THE STATE. YOUR OPPONENT SAYS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. HE SAYS WE'RE GETTING THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS HERE. WELL, MY OPPONENT SAID A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT RIGHT. SO I GUESS I'LL RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON THAT. YOU DON'T THINK WE'RE PAYING MORE IN PREMIUMS, COSTING MORE TO NOT HAVE -- WE'RE PAYING MORE IN PREMIUMS BECAUSE THE WAY THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP. ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE PAYING MORE IN PREMIUMS IS WE'RE ASKING A 59-YEAR-OLD MAN TELLING ME ABOUT SINGLE, HAS TO BUY MATERNITY INSURANCE. DOES HE WANT THAT? NO. HE DOESN'T NEED THAT. BUT HE HAS TO PAY FOR IT. PAYING FOR THINGS WE DON'T WANT OR NEED. THERE'S PLENTY MORE TO COME IN THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF KETV \"CHRONICLE\". UP NEXT, BIG MONEY DONORS AND THE TRIO TALKED TO A CROWD AT RICKETS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. TAKING A LOOK AT THE MONEY TRAIL BETWEEN RICKETS AND HASSLE BROOK, IT'S ONLY MATCHED. ACCORDING TO A DISCLOSURE COMMISSION REPORT AT THE END OF THE SEPTEMBER, RICKETS HAS $1.2 TO HASSLE BROOKS $546,000. HAVING THE BIG NAME, DOES IT MEAN MORE VOTES AND MORE PEOPLE TURNING OUT? I THINK WHAT IT SAYS TO PEOPLE IS THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE AN EFFECTIVE JOB IN THE CASE OF GOVERNOR PALIN SEE THE SAME POTENTIAL IN ME. PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THIS JOB SAY, I KNOW PETE, PETE CAN DO THIS JOB. WHAT ABOUT OPPOSITION WHO SAYS, LOOK, WE NEED SOMETHING NEW. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH GOVERNMENT, WITH WASHINGTON TODAY. THEY SEE THE BIG NAMES AND DON'T LIKE IT. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM? THAT'S WHERE I REPRESENT A THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BRINGING SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE, WHO HAS CAN BRING THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THINGS WE DO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND BRING THEM OVER TO STATE GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP BACK DONE THE LAST 16 YEARS AND SAY WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER? HOW CAN WE IMPROVE ON WHAT'S ALREADY THERE AND TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL? PEOPLE LIKE SARAH PALIN, THEY'RE SO FAR TO THE RIGHT. HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THE MODERATES? I'VE BEEN TALKING TO FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE. CREATING MORE JOBS HELPS EVERYBODY. I WANT TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN WORKING FOR NEBRASKANS ACROSS THE STATE TO CREATE MORE AND BETTER PAYING JOBS. IT'S SOMEBODY THAT APPEALS TO SOMEBODY FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL AISLE. WE WANT TO DO THAT. DEMOCRATS TELL ME WE'VE GOT TOO HIGH OF TAXES, TOO. THEY'RE PAYING THE SAME PROPERTY TAXES THAT REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS ARE. IT'S ABOUT THE ISSUES AND THE PLAN, NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PARTISANSHIP. HOW DO YOU CONVINCE VOTERS YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH EXAMPLE WHO MAY BE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM THAT YOU ARE, BUT TO GET THINGS DONE AND YOU WON'T BE BUTTING HEADS CONSTANTLY. I'VE BEEN GOING ACROSS THE STATE AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THOSE SENATORS OR THE INCOMING SENATORS. SO I'VE SAT DOWN WITH SENATOR MILLER TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET, SENATOR CAMPBELL TO TALK ABOUT HHS AND TO TALK ABOUT STRATEGY LEGISLATURE DOES FOR STRATEGY AND HOW THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE DOES IT TO COMING UP WITH A COMMON STRATEGY. I'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO TALK TO INCOMING SENATORS. JOHN KING, FOR INSTANCE, IS A GENTLEMAN WHO IS RUNNING FOR TOM CARLSON'S SEAT. HE'S FROM HARTWELL, A VETERINARIAN. HE DOESN'T HAVE AN OPPONENT SO I'M SURE I'LL MEET WITH HIM NEXT YEAR. I'M REACHING OUT AND DEVELOPING SO THAT WHEN WE GET THERE, WE CAN START PUTTING TOGETHER THAT CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO GROW THE STATE. WHAT ABOUT THE TONE OF THE CAMPAIGN. YOUR OPPONENT SAID HE CAME TO YOU EARLY ON AND SAID, HEY, LET'S HAVE AN AGREEMENT TO BASICALLY PLAY NICE, NOT GO NEGATIVE AND HAVE A MUD SLINGING DEAL. YOU DECLINED TO AGREE TO THAT. LET'S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. HE DIDN'T COME AND TALK TO ME AHEAD OF TIME LIKE AN ADULT WOULD HAVE DONE, TO SIT DOWN AND SEE IF WE CAN HASH THIS OUT. HE DID THIS FOR PUBLICITY SAKE. SINCE HE PUT THAT CAMPAIGN PROMISE OUT THERE, HE HAS NOT RUN ONE NEW POSITIVE AD. HE'S BEEN RUNNING NEGATIVE ADS THE WHOLE TIME. COULDN'T YOU RESPOND TO THE PRESS RELEASE? WHAT WAS HE WORRIED ABOUT? LOOK AT EVERY ONE OF MY ADS. THEY HAVE BEEN POSITIVE. ONE OF THE THINGS HE WANTED TO DO SOMEHOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO CONTROL THIRD PARTY GROUPS. HE KNOWS I CAN'T DO THAT. IT WAS A GIMMICK. HE KNEW WE COULDN'T COMPLY WITH CONTROL THIRD PARTY GROUPS ANY MORE THAN HE DOES. THE CLOSER WE GET TO NOVEMBER 4TH, DO YOU SEE YOURSELF PUTTING OUT MORE ADS THAT DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCES AND FOCUS ON YOUR OPPONENT. I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT NEBRASKANS CARE ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US GROW THE STATE? THE PEOPLE I TALK WITH SAY POLITICIANS THINK WE'RE DUMB. THEY THINK THE AVERAGE PERSON OUT THERE IS STUPID AND THEY'LL BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU SAY OR THEY DON'T SEE PAST THE NEGATIVITY OR THE MONEY. WHAT DO YOU TELL THOSE PEOPLE? THEY'RE NOT STUPID. NO, I DON'T THINK SO AT ALL. THAT'S WHY I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US GROW THE STATE AND MY OPPONENT IS MAKING CLAIMS THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE. THAT'S WHY I'M OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER HERE IN THE STATE, HOW WE CAN CREATE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL IN THE STATE. WE JUST HAVE TO UNLEASH IT. THAT'S WHAT MY CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ABOUT. I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT IN LEFT FIELD HERE. WE'RE TRYING TO HIT ON AS MANY ISSUES AS POSSIBLE. GOOD BASEBALL ANALOGY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CREATING AS MANY JOBS AS POSSIBLE, WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL MARIJUANA, LEGALIZING MARIJUANA, WE SEE COLORADO, IOWA TO SOME EXTENT. IS THAT SOMETHING NEBRASKA NEEDS TO LOOK AT? ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA. COLORADO IS SEEING THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF IT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE SEEING THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF IT RIGHT NOW. I WAS TALKING TO THE SHERIFF IN SIDNEY. THEY'VE HAD FOUR MURDERS THERE. ONE WAS OVER $150 WORTH OF MARIJUANA. WE AT THE STATE ARE GOING TO FEEL THE IMPACT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HELP THEM OUT AND WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH COLORADO TO SEE HOW WE CAN CONTAIN THIS. I WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD TRY TO UNDO THIS. MARIJUANA IS A DANGEROUS DRUG. IF YOU WANT TO USE IT LEGALLY, IT OUGHT TO GO THROUGH THE F.D.A. AND BE TESTED LIKE ANY OTHER DRUG. IT SHOULD NOT BE RECREATIONAL. CANNABIS OIL HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HELP. IT NEEDS TO BE DEEMED SAFE AND EFFECTIVE LIKE EVERY OTHER DRUG WE HAVE. PEOPLE SAFE FROM BAD DRUGS AND DRUGS THAT DON'T WORK. WE NEED TO FOLLOW THAT PROCESS. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK NOW. STILL AHEAD, THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES. INCLUDING THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASK. \"CHRONICLE\" CONTINUES. WELCOME BACK. WE'RE TALKING TO PETE RICKETTS IN A ONE HOUR EDITION OF KETV \"CHRONICLE\". SAME-SEX MARRIAGE HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS AT THIS WEEK. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO DEFEND OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO HAVE OUR GUNS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME, NOT BECAUSE I'M A GUN OWNER BUT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW THE GOVERNMENT WAS HEADING TOWARD TYRANNY. WE NEED OUR GUNS TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS THEY COME TO US FROM GOD. NOT THE GOVERNMENT. TALKED A LOT ABOUT EDUCATION, MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. ABSOLUTELY. I WANT TO WORK WITH THE INCOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY AND WORK ON THEIR STRATEGIC PLAN. MILLIKIN PUT TOGETHER A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. WE NEED TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND FOCUS ON THE THINGS WE WANT TO BE WORLD CLASS AT IN NEBRASKA. WHETHER IT'S AGRICULTURE, BUSINESS, ENGINEERING, BECOME FOCUSED ON THAT TO WHERE WE PUT OUR RESOURCES ON THAT AND LET OTHER THINGS BECOME DEPRIORITIZE DEPRIORITIZED. IT WILL CONTROL THE COSTS. ONE OF THE WAYS TO CONTROL COSTS, LIKE WE WANT TO DO IN STATE GOVERNMENT, DO A BETTER JOB AND BE FOCUSED ON THINGS YOU SAID RIGHTS COME FROM GOD AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT. PEOPLE MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TOO MUCH RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT. CERTAINLY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS ABSOLUTELY BELIEVED A PROPER MORAL COMPASS IS IMPORTANT FOR A FOUNDING DEMOCRACY. IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE BEING ASKED AS A PEOPLE TO MANAGE OURSELVES. IT'S A RADICAL IDEA BACK WHEN OUR FOUNDING FATHERS FOUNDED THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND THAT MORAL COMPASS IS IMPORTANT TO THE RESPONSIBILITY. UNDERSTANDING THERE'S BIGGER ISSUES THAN JUST OURSELVES. WE HAVE TO THINK OF THE GREATER WHOLE. THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE? I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD IT. IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR NEBRASKA AND CREATE 3,000 JOBS WHILE BEING BUILT, 300 JOBS THEREAFTER. IT'S GOING TO HELP US WITH ENERGY SECURITY IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ACCESS TO GET OUR CARS AND GRAINS AND ETHANOL TO MARKET. WE NEED TO BUILD A PIPELINE TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. WHAT ABOUT THE EMINENT DOMAIN ISSUE. YOUR FAMILY IS FROM NEBRASKA. IF SOMEONE CAME IN AND THEY'RE OPPOSED TO IT AND WANTED TO TAKE THAT LAND, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IS THAT? 95% OF THE LANDOWNERS HAD WILL ALREADY SIGNED UP. RIGHT NOW IN THE NEW PIPELINE PROPOSED ROUTE, 85%. I WOULD HOPE TO BE ABLE TO COME TO AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT REALLY TAKING THE LAND, YOU'RE JUST BUILDING A PIPELINE UNDERNEATH IT. GET THE USE OF THE LAND ON TOP OF IT. IT'S JUST BEING ABLE TO PUT THE PIPELINE THROUGH AND THE PIPELINE COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBLE. IT'S THE LAW ALREADY. FOR THE PIPELINE, WHETHER IT HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT OR IT LEAKS OR SO CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR FOLKS IN THE STATE. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD OF ENERGY SECURITY HERE IN NORTH AMERICA, IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR OUR COUNTRY IF WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY OIL FROM PEOPLE WHO HATE US. HOW DOES THAT CHANGE OUR FLEXIBILITY IN THE WORLD? IT'S A HUGE, HUGE DEAL. I THINK THIS YEAR WE'VE PRODUCED MORE OIL THAN SAUDI ARABIA. RENAISSANCE HERE IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY THAT WILL CREATE LOTS OF JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. BRIEFLY THEN, HAVE YOU DECIDED, IF ELECTED, WHERE YOU'LL LIVE? WELL, I'LL BE IN LINCOLN. THAT'S WHERE THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR IS. THAT'S WHERE THE JOB OF THE GOVERNOR IS YOUR HOME. THAT'S WHERE I'LL BE. MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL YEAR BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL HOW IT IMPACTS MY FAMILY BUT I WILL BE IN LINCOLN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SOME FINAL THOUGHTS. FIRST, THOUGH, A REMINDER THAT YOUR COMMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SHOW. THERE'S OUR NUMBER. PLEASE SPEAK CLEARLY AND WE MAY TRY TO USE YOUR COMMENTS ON AIR. WELCOME BACK TO THIS EDITION OF \"CHRONICLE\". TODAY WE TALKED WITH PETE RICKETTS ABOUT PRISON REFORM, TAXES, EDUCATION NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO SPEAK OUT AND TALK TWO MINUTES TO THE NEBRASKA VOTERS. HELLO, EVERYBODY. THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WE'RE FACING HERE IN THE STATE IS HOW DO WE GROW? HOW DO WE CREATE MORE AND BETTER PAYING JOBS? HOW DO WE KEEP MORE OF OUR KIDS HOW DO WE ATTRACT KIDS FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO COME HERE? AS I'VE MADE MY WAY AROUND THE STATE, THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO FALL INTO THREE BROAD CATEGORIES. FIRST, WE HAVE TO HAVE TAX REFORM. ESPECIALLY PROPERTY TAX. I'VE PUT OUT A PLAN FOR HOW TO DO THAT. THE SECOND THING WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO GROW THE ECONOMY. ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURING. AGRICULTURE IS 25% OF THE FOLKS MANUFACTURING IS 13% OF OUR STATE ECONOMY. I PUT OUT PLANS FOR HOW TO GROW BOTH OF THOSE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GROW EXPORTS, VALUE ADDED AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LAST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS ABOUT JOB TRAINING AND EDUCATION. HOW DO WE IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL OUR KIDS? THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO DO AS WELL IS FOCUS ON CAREER AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T TALK TO A MANUFACTURER WHO HASN'T TOLD ME THEY CAN'T FIND ENOUGH WELDERS, ELECTRICIANS AND MACHINISTS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO IS FORM THE PLAN. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO IS WORK WITH FOLKS LIKE YOU, NEBRASKANS ACROSS THE STATE. TO CRAFT THE PLAN HOW TO GROW NEBRASKA. HOW WE CREATE MORE AND BETTER PAYING JOBS. HOW WE KEEP MORE OF OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS HERE. HOW WE ATTRACT KIDS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO COME HERE. WE PUT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER, START CREATING THE JOBS AND WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL CREATE THE FUTURE THAT NEBRASKA FAMILIES WANT AND DESERVE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE WATCHING TODAY. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. PLEASE MAKE SURE TO GET OUT THERE BY THE NOVEMBER 4TH DEADLINE. WE'VE GOT A GREAT STATE. WE'VE GOT TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL. GOD BLESS AND HAVE A GREAT DAY. WE THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AS WELL. THAT IS OUR SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO POST THIS SHOW AND NEXT WEEK'S \"CHRONICLE\" ON KETV.COM AND YOU CAN DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST NOT ONLY TO THEM BUT TO YOU. THE ELECTION IS NOVEMBER 4TH. MARK IT DOWN. NEXT WEEK WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE ISSUES YOU'LL BE ASKED TO VOTE FOR IN THE COMING CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING MINIMUM WAGE. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT WEEK.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sun, 19 Oct 2014 12:00:00 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "On this edition of KETV NewsWatch 7's Chronicle, we're focusing on the November election.
