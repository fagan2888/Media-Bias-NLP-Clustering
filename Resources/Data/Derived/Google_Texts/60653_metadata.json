One viewer said she did months of research before picking the plan that Blue Cross recommended. But it\u2019s still been a nightmare.\n\nKatherine Cadman says her emails and calls aren\u2019t getting anywhere. She says she signed up for an Anthem Blue Cross Plan, but doctors keep refusing to see her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does make you feel like you\u2019re a second-class citizen.\u201d\n\nChris and Tammy Dunn told us the same exact thing about their experience trying to find a doctor to fix Chris\u2019 back. He says an in-network doctor turned him down.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t slept in four months,\u201d said Chris.\n\nWhen we again reached out to Anthem again for answers on Wednesday and they issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cOur records indicate that this doctor has a contract with Anthem Blue Cross to treat our Covered CA members, and we will reach out to him to determine what the issue is.\u201d\n\nThe doctor\u2019s office gave us a flat no comment.\n\n\u201cThe doctors get to pick who they want,\u201d said Tammy.\n\nBut what\u2019s really going on here? The bottom line in both cases is money.\n\nWe went in search of answers and learned some doctors won\u2019t accept patients with insurance through Covered California\u2014the state-run implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, doctors say they reimbursement rates are lower.\n\nAnthem tells CBS13 it can\u2019t force an in-network doctor to give care, and that the doctor can terminate its contract.\n\nThis leaves the Dunns and Cadman feeling like they\u2019re left with few options.\n\n\u201cAnthem\u2019s a big umbrella, but we\u2019re standing at the edge of the umbrella and we\u2019re getting wet, because we\u2019re not getting what regular subscribers are getting,\u201d Cadman said.\n\nCovered California has no authority over insurance companies, but they say, \u201cUnder Covered California agreements and state regulation, plans are required to provide adequate networks in a reasonable time frame, and Covered California is reaching out to Anthem to make sure that\u2019s happening.\n\nViewers on back-to-back nights have complained to us it isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhat are we left with as far as being Covered California subscribers?\u201d Cadman asked. \u201cThe bottom of the barrel?\u201d\n\nThe other issue we\u2019ve reported on are inaccurate doctors lists. Several times, Covered California has taken down its online director because the lists they were getting from providers had too many mistakes.\n\nMORE NEWS", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some doctors won\u2019t accept patients with insurance through Covered California\u2014the state-run implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
