Game 1 is Monday night in San Antonio. Thunder general manager Sam Presti called it a Grade 2 strain of the plantaris, which takes time to heal and strengthen because of a high re-injury rate.\n\nIbaka was injured during the third quarter Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI just want to express our disappointment for Serge, who, as we all know, is an elite competitor and someone that has proven to be a tremendous teammate,\u201d Presti said. \u201cHe was playing great basketball throughout the season. He\u2019s had a huge impact on our season to date.\u201d\n\nLast year, All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook was knocked out of the playoffs with a torn ACL in the first round against Houston. The Thunder rallied to win that series before losing to Memphis in the next round. Presti believes the Thunder can rally and be ready for the Spurs.\n\n\u201cWe have had this group together for a while, and they\u2019ve been through some ups and downs, and this is just another one that hopefully is only going to make us better,\u201d Presti said.\n\nIbaka\u2019s athletic ability and mid-range jumper have been keys for the Thunder. He averaged 12.2 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 13 postseason games. During the 2013-14 regular season, he had career highs with averages of 15.1 points and 8.8 rebounds while leading the league in total blocks for the fourth consecutive season with 219.\n\nDuring his emotional MVP acceptance speech, Kevin Durant singled out Ibaka for stepping up and erasing many of the team\u2019s mistakes while Westbrook recovered from his most recent knee surgery. While Westbrook was out, the Thunder went 20-7, and Ibaka\u2019s numbers jumped to 15.7 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.8 blocks with 57 percent shooting from the field.\n\n\u201cFor us, we as an organization have been in some situations in the past, and how we respond to those has always been the measure of the teams that we\u2019ve had in Oklahoma City,\u201d Presti said. \u201cOur expectation going forward is that we\u2019ll respond admirably.\u201d\n\n__\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Thunder\u2019s Serge Ibaka expected to miss rest of playoffs with calf injury", "title": "Thunder\u2019s Serge Ibaka expected to miss rest of playoffs with calf injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/16/thunders-serge-ibaka-expected-to-miss-rest-of-playoffs-with-calf-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__serge-ibakap1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__serge-ibakap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T20:12:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:40:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdefa\"", "article_summary": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Oklahoma City defensive specialist Serge Ibaka is expected to miss the rest of the NBA playoffs because of a left calf injury.\n\u201cFor us, we as an organization have been in some situations in the past, and how we respond to those has always been the measure of the teams that we\u2019ve had in Oklahoma City,\u201d Presti said.\nHe averaged 12.2 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 13 postseason games.\nWhile Westbrook was out, the Thunder went 20-7, and Ibaka\u2019s numbers jumped to 15.7 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.8 blocks with 57 percent shooting from the field.\nThunder general manager Sam Presti called it a Grade 2 strain of the plantaris, which takes time to heal and strengthen because of a high re-injury rate."}
