And she is now salting her campaign speeches with populist rhetoric in deference to Warren\u2019s appeal.\n\nAnd Republicans don\u2019t have an attractive response to Warren or Clinton.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nRepublicans have been slow to learn that the hard left\u2019s prescriptions may be wrong but their sense of what angers Americans is spot on.\n\nNew technologies have made the world terribly more difficult for American foreign policy to manage. Cell phones permit revolutionaries to organize, as they did in Egypt, under the noses of national leaders, and cheap software permits North Korea hackers to dictate to Sony and snatch ordinary folks\u2019 most private information.\n\nUnless Americans are willing to use lethal force\u2014for example by shutting down North Korea\u2019s power grid\u2014they are going to have to accept a lot of grief from dictators likes Kim.\n\nSenator John McCain is correct that cyber attacks are a new form of warfare, but Americans are simply not willing to bloody many noses. Democrats like Senator Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton will play on that in 2016.\n\nBut more importantly, though, Warren\u2019s harpings about big business and even bigger banks ring true to Americans\u2014because they are true\u2014even if misadventures like Obamacare and Dodd Frank have proven the most robust of failures of liberalism in our post-modern age.\n\nHealth care is too expensive\u2014as are so many other things\u2014and banks do abuse most Americans, because Democrats have cynically supported monopolies for those who generously contribute to their political campaigns.\n\nThose monopolies enrich friends of the party that fancies itself friend of the common man. For example, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts is a big fund raiser for Obama and pays Al Sharpton\u2019s MSNBC salary, and has leveraged a dull utility into a media empire.\n\nSenator Schumer is legend for mining Wall Street to support Democratic candidates.\n\nGOP leaders like Paul Ryan need to go after those insidious alliances and their connections to high prices, low wages and negligible interest most Americans earn on their savings, instead of apologizing for free markets and offering vouchers to fix health care.\n\nOrdinary Americans would profit from a competitive market place, but Elizabeth Warren\u2014and the likely Democratic standard bearer in 2016 Hillary Clinton\u2014is right. These days, the American marketplace is hardly competitive.\n\nWhat should separate the GOP from Democrats is not middle class angst but that Warren, Clinton and other Democrats want even more government regulation. That will permit them to dole out even more favors to their friends in business in exchange for campaign largess, keeping American families pinned down, dependent on government largess and more likely to vote Democratic.\n\nThe GOP should take a page from Republican Teddy Roosevelt\u2014become trust busters. Advocate breaking up the big health insurance, drug and cable companies\u2014and the worst offenders, Wall Street\u2019s banks\u2014to reinvigorate growth and make essentials like health care affordable again.\n\nGive the economy back to Americans\u2014and they will make it run and run well again.\n\nPeter Morici served as Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1993 to 1995.
