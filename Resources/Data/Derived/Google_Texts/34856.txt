Wait … we're supposed to like these people?

Yes, indeed, because as we're repeatedly reminded, they're really just products of their mobbed-up environment. They hug each other warmly and share their feelings openly. Dad is even getting in touch with his inner self, writing a confessional autobiography on a typewriter he's found.

And so when a hit squad shows up in the village to rub them all out, we're expected to root for them to escape, even if it means a steadily mounting body count of innocent bystanders. Neighbors take bullets to the head, a fireman is assassinated, an entire police station is brutally shot down.

From a humane standpoint, our only hope is that Tommy Lee Jones — who plays the U.S. government operative charged with keeping the family alive — might at some point turn his craggy face to the camera and drawl, "You know what? These people are just not worth it! I'm outta here!"

Never happens, of course. The Family thunders along, following the witness protection story arc of Steve Martin's My Blue Heaven by way of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. As cinema, it's an interesting experiment. As a movie, it's a bloody mess.
