David McIntosh under the auspices of the Conservative Action Project. Attendees included a who\u2019s-who of the conservative movement, from Sen. Ted Cruz to the Family Research Council\u2019s Tony Perkins.\n\nAttendees agreed on a nine-page document outlining the \u201cconstitutional conservative\u201d principles for which they believe the Republican Party needs to stand, including lower taxes, a stronger military and opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\u201cA Constitutional conservatism unites all conservatives through the natural fusion provided by American principles,\u201d the document states. \u201cIt reminds economic conservatives that morality is essential to limited government, social conservatives that unlimited government is a threat to moral self-government, and national security conservatives that energetic but responsible government is the key to America\u2019s safety and leadership role in the world.\u201d\n\nThe document, developed off a similar declaration adopted before the 2010 tea party wave, calls for congressional rules requiring balanced budgets, passing legislation to end bank subsidies and \u201cpermanent bank bailouts,\u201d and for cutting taxes and regulations. Other proposals include repealing and replacing Obamacare, enhancing protections for those who oppose same-sex marriage, ending \u201cefforts to stop public prayer\u201d and shutting down the Export-Import Bank.\n\nThe meeting and manifesto come as establishment-backed Republicans have gone on to win contested primaries against more conservative opponents across the country, helped by investments from groups like the Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads. The business wing of the party believes that flawed and overly conservative candidates cost the party seats in Congress in 2012 and 2010.\n\nConservatives hope that the document will serve as a guide for the party going into this fall\u2019s midterm elections and the 2016 presidential race.\n\nRead the full document below:", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Conservative Republicans gathered privately outside of Washington Thursday to fight back against an attack from the GOP establishment.
