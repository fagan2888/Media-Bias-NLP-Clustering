Kasich applauded the legislature for adding another big welfare program in the state. Unfortunately Kasich also lied about the program.\n\nRight out of the gate Kasich talks about Medicaid Expansion being for the poor and disabled. He\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s straight up Medicaid which already exists. Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion specifically targets able-bodied adults without children who can work. As discussed over and over again, the majority of the people eligible in New Hampshire were already getting health insurance through their employers. The others chose to work part-time or not at all but were able to.\n\nIf you talk to people who actually live in Ohio, you\u2019ll know that Kasich has been lying about Medicaid Expansion from the get go. In a recent article by Jason Hart, he explains that Kasich completely underestimated the costs of the program to the tune of at least $10 billion. From HotAir:\n\nSince January 2014, Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities has added 5% of Ohio\u2019s population to the welfare rolls and has cost federal taxpayers $6.4 billion. In 2013, before Kasich vetoed the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s ban on Obamacare expansion and expanded Medicaid unilaterally, critics said costs and enrollment would be higher than expected. Who was right? Kasich projected enrollment would reach 447,000 in 2020. He underestimated costs for the first 18 months by $1.5 billion. In a speech this week to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Kasich boasted about saving lives by spending $14 billion to put more Ohioans on Medicaid\u2026 and then, seconds later, he bragged about slowing Ohio Medicaid spending growth. Kasich\u2019s $14 billion figure \u2014 the amount of \u201cOhio money\u201d he says he\u2019s \u201cbringing back\u201d \u2014 is an old estimate of Obamacare expansion costs through 2020. Based on actual spending, Kasich is understating costs by at least $10 billion.\n\nKasich lied to New Hampshire\u2019s legislature as he lied to his own Ohio constituents. New Hampshire legislators are following the same path. Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion was supposed to \u2018sunset\u2019 when the federal funds (also known as New Hampshire taxpayer dollars) started drying up under the 100% mark.\n\nOn Thursday, a public hearing will be head on House Bill 1696 which will re-authorize this medical welfare program by pretending to use gimmicks to pay the ever-increasing costs not paid for by the feds. Unfortunately, the legislators who are supporting this bill are again lying to constituents.\n\nIt seems to be a pattern for people who support Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion. Kasich did it just like Governor Hassan has done it and those who support continuing this program are doing it. A little truth goes a long way but taxpayers dollars do not. There does indeed come a time when the political class eventually runs out of other people\u2019s money.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Saturday a video clip from C-SPAN was posted of Presidential candidate John Kasich speaking to the New Hampshire House Legislature about Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/john-kasich-lied-to-the-nh-house-about-ohio-s-medicaid-expansion", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/6a/ec/6aec928eb534b9f864d8cff6071b2d6f.jpg?itok=k_jK5pgB", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "title": "John Kasich lied to the NH House about Ohio\u2019s Medicaid Expansion"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Saturday a video clip from C-SPAN was posted of Presidential candidate John Kasich speaking to the New Hampshire House Legislature about Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion.", "title": "John Kasich lied to the NH House about Ohio\u2019s Medicaid Expansion", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/6a/ec/6aec928eb534b9f864d8cff6071b2d6f.jpg?itok=k_jK5pgB", "creator": "@conservativeind", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2016-01-25T11:06:10-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Political Buzz, John Kasich, Medicaid expansion, NH Legislature, Obamacare, HB 1696", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-25T11:06"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday a video clip from C-SPAN was posted of Presidential candidate John Kasich speaking to the New Hampshire House Legislature about Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion.\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion specifically targets able-bodied adults without children who can work.\nRight out of the gate Kasich talks about Medicaid Expansion being for the poor and disabled.\nIt seems to be a pattern for people who support Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion.\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion was supposed to \u2018sunset\u2019 when the federal funds (also known as New Hampshire taxpayer dollars) started drying up under the 100% mark."}
