Charlie Baker weighed in on an issue that has divided his party\u2019s field of president candidates, backing a ban on the sale of guns to anyone of the terror watch list.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mostly interested in what the gun laws are here in the Commonwealth, but I do think if it\u2019s possible for somebody who\u2019s on the terrorist watch list to buy a weapon in the United States that should get fixed, period,\u201d Baker said after speaking to a group of Massachusetts newspaper executives.\n\nBaker said that since the shootings in Paris there has been a considerable uptick in the flow of information between federal, state and local law enforcement, but said that there has been no new credible threats to Massachusetts since the San Bernardino, California killings.\n\nThe Republican field of White House contenders has split on the issue of banning guns for those on the F.B.I. terror watch list, with frontrunner Donald Trump supporting a prohibition, but others, including Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina opposed.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report from March found that individuals on the watch list were approved 91 percent of the time they sought to buy guns from 2004 to 2014 and purchased 2,043 firearms, according to CNN.\n\nBaker gave the keynote address on Thursday at the Massachusetts Newspaper Publishers Association\u2019s annual meeting in South Boston, sitting down for lunch at Bastille Kitchen with newspaper executives before recounting some of the challenges he\u2019s faced and goals that remain after 330 days in office.\n\nAcknowledging that much of his administration\u2019s attention in its first year was directed toward solving inherited problems such as fixing the MBTA\u2019s service reliability and repairing computer systems at the Health Connector Authority, Baker said he hopes moving forward to be \u201cmore proactive and not just fixing the stuff that needed to get fixed.\u201d\n\nHe spoke specifically about getting something through the Legislature to address the opioid crisis and confronting the state\u2019s energy supply issues, telling the media representatives that any energy bill must include provisions for large-scale hydropower procurement.\n\nThe governor compared fighting opioid addiction to the financial problems he encountered when he took over Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, suggesting that radical change would be needed to make a dent in the crisis.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake on this opioid problem, playing around the margins is just not going to get us anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nBaker offered plenty of praise for the work of newspapers and other media, recalling his own days as an aspiring sports writer for the Dedham Daily Transcript.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever let any public official, or any politician or any elected official tell you that what they read and what they see in the news doesn\u2019t affect the way they think about the issues,\u201d Baker said, adding, \u201cI learn a lot from what come in over the transom.\u201d\n\nThe governor did not address public records reform \u2013 one of the MNPA\u2019s signature issues \u2013 until he was asked about the bill moving through the Legislature and his opinion on whether his office should be exempt.\n\n\u201cWe basically follow the law, and under the current law and every governor before us the governor\u2019s office is treated differently than the rest of the executive branch,\u201d Baker said. He also said, \u201cIf the law changes on this stuff, then we\u2019ll change with the law.\u201d\n\nBaker cited some of the steps he has taken to make other executive branch agencies more responsive to public records requests, including the ongoing work of developing a software solution that will make it easier to respond to requests for bulk data with records in searchable formats.\n\nThe governor declined to say whether he believes the governor\u2019s office or the Legislature should be subject to the public records law, saying he didn\u2019t want to comment on specifics of legislation under consideration in the House and Senate. He did say he hopes to sign a bill next year.\n\n\u201cI fully expect that we\u2019ll probably see public records reform at some point in the legislative session when they come back in January and as a general rule we\u2019re supportive of public records reform. Some of it obviously depends on the details,\u201d Baker said.\n\nSenate President Stanley Rosenberg said Thursday that senators are currently discussing the legislation the House passed just before the November recess to make it cheaper to access public records and provide legal recourse in cases when requests are improperly denied. Rosenberg said he expects a version of the bill to come up for vote early next year and move into conference committee with the House.\n\nBaker said the State Police, often held out as one of the most secretive and difficult to penetrate public agencies in the state, are subject to the same disclosure guidelines he put in place for all other executive branch departments, and cited the plethora of paper, rather than electronic records that make it more difficult for the State Police to respond to requests.\n\n\u2014 Written by Matt Murphy\n\nCopyright State House News Service\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/04/with-publishers-baker-weighs-in-on-guns-media-and-public-records/", "article_author_name": "State House News Service", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CharlieBaker-2.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Beacon Hill, boston, Charlie Baker, guns, Massachusetts, media, public records, publishers, republican, terror watch list"}, "description": "Gov.
