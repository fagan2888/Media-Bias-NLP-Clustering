[Barack] Obama was heating up, but they called first, so I said OK. You have to play by those rules. And then, the week of, they bailed. I went, \u2018Really? You called us, and we gave it to you.'\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI think every now and then I get carried away and think we actually do have influence. And then, after that, we put Obama on the date when Hillary was supposed to be on. The sense of entitlement which was following her everywhere at that point peaked for me at the bailing.\u201d\n\nFormer vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who was famously portrayed by Tina Fey, also had a lot of choice words about the \u201ccoverage\u201d of the 2008 campaign by SNL.\n\n\u201cI think \u201cSNL\u201d is egotistical if they believe that it was truly an effect on maybe the public debate about who should lead the country in the next four years,\u201d Palin said.\n\n\u201cIf I ran into Tina Fey again today, I would say: \u201cYou need to at least pay for my kids\u2019 braces or something from all the money that you made off of pretending that you\u2019re me! My goodness, you capitalized on that! Can\u2019t you contribute a little bit? Jeez!\u201d\n\nApparently \u201cSNL\u201d had some trouble with the Obama impersonations on the show for laughable reasons.\n\n\u201cIf I had to describe Obama as a comedy project, I would say, \u201cDegree of difficulty, 10 point 10.\u201d It\u2019s like being a rock climber looking up at a thousand-foot-high face of solid obsidian, polished and oiled. There\u2019s not a single thing to grab onto \u2014 certainly not a flaw or hook that you can caricature,\u201d James Downey, a producer and writer.\n\n\u201c[Al] Gore had these \u201chandles,\u201d so did Bush, and Sarah Palin, and even Hillary had them. But with Obama, it was the phenomenon \u2014 less about him and more about the effect he had on other people and the way he changed their behavior. So that\u2019s the way I wrote him.\u201d\n\nThe show once had to change its direction on a skit at the order of then-Senator and candidate Obama.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until my last season that the network refused to air a \u2018TV Funhouse.\u2019 It was a live-action one that was meant to be about racism and profiling, an airline-safety video with multilingual narration, and whenever you heard a different language, they would cut to people of that nationality. First, typical white Americans, then a Latino family, then a Japanese family, all being instructed about seat belts, overhead compartments, et cetera. Then it cuts to an Arab man, and the narrator says, in Arabic, \u201cDuring the flight, please do not blow up the airplane. The United States is actually a humanitarian nation that is rooted in the concept of freedom,\u201d and so on. \u2026 When the standards people freaked, Lorne fought them. Standards pushed back hard. They even got someone at NBC human resources to condemn it. \u2026 Lorne said, \u2018I have a plan,'\u201d said Robert Smigel, a writer for the show.\n\n\u201cObama was doing a cameo in the cold open. Lorne told me he would show my sketch to Obama. \u2018If Obama thinks it\u2019s OK, they won\u2019t be able to argue it.\u2019 I thought it was a brilliant idea, except why would Obama ever give this thing his blessing? What if word got out? \u2018Hey, everybody, that guy over there said it was cool. The one running for president of the country.'\u201d\n\nRead the full excerpt at The Hollywood Reporter.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via SNL Presidents, first ladies and all types of political candidates have been both frequent guests and the butt of jokes on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The Hollywood Reporter published an excerpt Wednesday of the updated edition of the Saturday Night Live oral history, \u201cLive From New York,\u201d...", "title": "'SNL' stars dish on sketch Obama vetoed, why Lorne Michaels finds...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/08/tina-fey-palin-600x334.png", "height": 334}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/20/snl-stars-dish-sketch-obama-vetoed-lorne-michaels-finds-hillary-entitled-political-skit-secrets-new-book/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "tina-fey", "published_time": "2014-08-20T15:37:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T17:17:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0975\"", "article_summary": "And then, after that, we put Obama on the date when Hillary was supposed to be on.\n[Barack] Obama was heating up, but they called first, so I said OK.
