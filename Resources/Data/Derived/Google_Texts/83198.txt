MUMBAI, February 20, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --

Bharat Book Bureau presents The U.S. Weight Loss Market: 2014 Status Report & Forecast. This new report presents a wrap-up of 2013 performance for the U.S. weight loss market. (http://www.bharatbook.com/healthcare-market-research-reports/the-us-weight-loss-market-2014-status-report-forecast.html)

The value of the market actually declined by 1.8% to $60.5 billion, largely as a result of slumping diet soft drink sales, and flat performance in most other market segments-including the large chains. The market is forecast to grow only 1.2% this year, as the DIY dieting trend continues, more competitors appear, and diet companies try to sort out the effects of the Affordable Care Act.
