As it got bigger and bigger, however, it became clear that something was wrong.\n\nIn just two months, the 59-year-old woman\u2019s stomach ballooned to the size of a beach ball.\n\n\u201cIt's getting bigger every day,\u201d Lewis told WSB-TV. \u201cI can feel it on my body. My heart hurts a little bit.\u201d\n\nWhen Lewis made the rounds at multiple hospitals, she said doctors were shocked at the size of the benign but painful tumor, which was found to be wrapped around her ovaries\n\n\u201cSome of the guys looked at me and said, 'You got a tumor in there that is so big it\u2019s about to pop,'\u201d she recalled.\n\nDespite the surprised looks on the doctors\u2019 faces, though, they all turned her away when the topic of surgery came up. Since Lewis did not have health insurance, they would not perform the operation, leaving her daughter to express concern over her mother\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cI don't know how long that she has to be able to live with this thing in her,\u201d Sarina Lewis said to WSB.\n\nAccording to Lewis, her health coverage was lost in the wake of her husband\u2019s death years ago. Before the tumor began growing, though, she did not feel that seeking out insurance was a priority. Lewis added she\u2019s been trying to get insurance again but has been unsuccessful in her attempts. When Lewis tried to purchase coverage under the Affordable Care Act, she was told the deadline had passed.\n\n\n\nThe situation came to a head recently when the tumor was causing Lewis so much pain she had to call 911. She was taken to Emory University Hospital, where a doctor told her she\u2019d finally be able to get surgery done.\n\n\u201cHe said, 'You will see a doctor \u2013 with or without money,'\u201d Lewis added.\n\nWith the operation scheduled for June 10, Lewis \u2013 also a grandmother \u2013 said she\u2019s looking forward to losing a lot of weight and getting back to living a life with far less pain.\n\n\u201cIt would feel great, now, if I could get it out today. Right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a blessing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Life without health insurance has become extremely painful for one Georgia woman, who recently described how four different hospitals declined to treat her for a tumor that had grown to the size of a beach ball.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Life without health insurance has become extremely painful for one Georgia woman, who recently described how four different hospitals declined to treat her for a tumor that had grown to the size of a beach ball.", "title": "4 hospitals turn away patient with beach ball-sized tumor due to absence of insurance", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/26/f0/80/00/beach-ball-tumor-turn-patient-.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/159496-beach-ball-tumor-turn-patient/", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimzied": "width", "twitter": {"description": "Life without health insurance has become extremely painful for one Georgia woman, who recently described how four different hospitals declined to treat her for a tumor that had grown to the size of a beach ball.", "creator": "@RT_com", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/26/f0/80/00/beach-ball-tumor-turn-patient-.si.jpg", "title": "RT International", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "navigation": "tabbed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb46a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt's getting bigger every day,\u201d Lewis told WSB-TV.\nSince Lewis did not have health insurance, they would not perform the operation, leaving her daughter to express concern over her mother\u2019s fate.\nAs it got bigger and bigger, however, it became clear that something was wrong.\nBefore the tumor began growing, though, she did not feel that seeking out insurance was a priority.\nLife without health insurance has become extremely painful for one Georgia woman, who recently described how four different hospitals declined to treat her for a tumor that had grown to the size of a beach ball."}
