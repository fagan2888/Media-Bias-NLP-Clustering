The lowest number (13,194) was reported in President Obama\u2019s home state of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cPlan selections include those consumers who are automatically re-enrolled into their current plan or another plan with similar benefits, which occurs at the end of December,\u201d CMS stated. \u201cWeekly net new plan selections take into account new plan selections minus any consumer or insurer-initiated cancelations for new plan selections.\u201d\n\n\u201cCBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that about 11 million people will receive exchange subsidies, on average, during calendar year 2016, compared with an average of 8 million in 2015,\u201d page 69 of the CBO report stated.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the agencies project that about 2 million other people will purchase coverage through an exchange but will not be eligible for subsidies\u2014for a total of 13 million people, on average, enrolled in policies purchased through exchanges.\u201d\n\nIn October, a report by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation also came up with a \u201cbottom up\u201d estimate of \u201c9.4 to 11.4 million effectuated enrollees in the Marketplace at the end of 2016,\u201d based on \u201cprevious enrollment periods and analysis of the broader insurance market.\u201d\n\nDespite the pared-down enrollment estimates, government subsidies are slated to increase $18 billion in 2016, the CBO estimates.\n\n\u201cSubsidies for health insurance purchased through the exchanges that were established under the ACA [Affordable Care Act], as well as related spending, increased by $23 billion in 2015, to a total of $38 billion,\u201d the CBO report stated.\n\nIn a footnote on page 16, the CBO stated that \u201csubsidies that help people who meet income and other eligibility criteria to purchase health insurance through exchanges and to meet their cost-sharing requirements, along with related spending, are expected to increase by $18 billion in 2016, reaching a total of $56 billion.\u201d\n\nCBO also predicted that the tax subsidies to insurers participating in the exchanges will cost taxpayers $4,308 per each of the 11 million subsidized enrollees. In 2010, the agency estimated that it would cost $2,810 to cover each of 21 million enrollees expected to sign up by 2016.\n\n\u201cThis leads to the conclusion that Obamacare exchanges are, in fact, high-risk pools for sick individuals who cannot get coverage elsewhere. They are not a properly functioning, broad-based market for health insurance,\u201d writes John Graham, senior fellow at the Independent Institute.\n\nRelated: Double-Digit Premium Hike Requests Signal Start of Obamacare \u2018Death Spiral\u2019", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Taxpayers will have to shell out an estimated $18 billion more to subsidize Obamacare in 2016 despite lower than expected enrollment in the health care exchanges, according to a forecast by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "title": "CBO: Obamacare Costs to Increase in 2016 As Millions More Get Subsidized Insurance", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/cbo-obamacare-costs-increase-2016-despite-lower-expected", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/obamacare_2016_cms.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-03T10:23:36-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-02T16:40:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T10:23:36-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taxpayers will have to shell out an estimated $18 billion more to subsidize Obamacare in 2016 despite lower than expected enrollment in the health care exchanges, according to a forecast by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "title": "CBO: Obamacare Costs to Increase in 2016 As Millions More Get Subsidized Insurance", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/cbo-obamacare-costs-increase-2016-despite-lower-expected", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/obamacare_2016_cms.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Taxpayers will have to shell out an estimated $18 billion more to subsidize Obamacare in 2016 despite lower than expected enrollment in the health care exchanges, according to a forecast by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But that figure is 40 percent lower than the 21 million enrollees CBO predicted last year would sign up.\nThey are not a properly functioning, broad-based market for health insurance,\u201d writes John Graham, senior fellow at the Independent Institute.\nA CMS spokesperson told CNSNews.com on Tuesday that the total number of Obamacare enrollees for 2016 was not yet available.\n\u201cThis leads to the conclusion that Obamacare exchanges are, in fact, high-risk pools for sick individuals who cannot get coverage elsewhere.\nIn 2010, the agency estimated that it would cost $2,810 to cover each of 21 million enrollees expected to sign up by 2016."}
