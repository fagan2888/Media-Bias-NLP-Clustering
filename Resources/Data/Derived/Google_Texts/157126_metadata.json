For more information, call 714-993-5075.\n\nFullerton is a One Degree of Separation town.\n\nYou don\u2019t know everybody, but you\u2019re only one person away from knowing everybody.\n\nThat might be a bit of an exaggeration, but not much of one.\n\nRecently I had a real One Degree of Separation experience. A friend of mine, Kristine Taylor, who I met in a business group about 10 years ago, posted a cartoon on her Facebook page that was drawn by syndicated editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez.\n\nAs a fan of political humor, I\u2019ve long admired his work. His sense of humor and topic choices are in sync with mine. I commented about how much I enjoyed his work, and she responded, \u201cHe\u2019s my neighbor. You should come out to do karaoke with us sometime.\u201d\n\nWow, just that fast I discovered that I was just One Degree of Separation away from a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.\n\nFor my birthday that year, she gave me an autographed copy of Ramirez\u2019s first compilation book, \u201cEveryone Has A Right To My Opinion.\u201d After looking through his life\u2019s work, I was even more impressed by the volume and consistent quality.\n\nTo be a good editorial cartoonist you have to be bold. Ramirez is certainly that, as well as creative and controversial. His work appears worldwide in hundreds of newspapers and magazines (including the Orange County Register) and is seen weekly by an audience of millions.\n\nHe\u2019s been presented with many prestigious awards including two Pulitzer Prizes, but he\u2019s also been visited by the Secret Service, and his column was dropped by the Los Angeles Times. As Robert Frost wrote, \u201cFreedom lies in being bold.\u201d\n\nLast week, I was invited to play on Michael Ramirez\u2019s seven-member team at a charity bowl-a-thon. Hands of Hope International and Kristine Taylor Philanthropies are two local charities that have done fantastic work for cancer patients. They help with surgical reconstruction, providing medical equipment, wigs for cancer patients who have lost their hair during chemotherapy, transportation to and from treatments, and helping to rebuild lives.\n\nI was excited for the charity bowl-a-thon and wanted to look the part. I bought from a vintage clothing store a brown polyester bowling shirt with \u201cMarkstein Beverage Co., Sacramento\u201d stitched on the back, and the name \u201cHal\u201d stitched over the front pocket.\n\nThe bowl-a-thon was held at the Tavern Bowl at The Triangle in Costa Mesa. It was a smaller underwriting event to provide the \u201cseed money\u201d for their big fundraiser next March. Last year, their gala raised $80,000 to help cancer patients.\n\nWhen I saw Michael Ramirez for the first time at the bowling alley, he was wearing a Yankees baseball cap and looked considerably younger than his 54 years. We talked about baseball and growing up in Orange County. He graduated from Capistrano Valley High School and from UC Irvine.\n\nI knew that Michael was very talented with his pen, now I wanted to see if he was as talented knocking down the pins. Let me tell you, he knows his way around the alleys, just like he knows his way around the galleys (had enough cartoon-bowling jokes yet?)\n\nOur conversation continued in-between rolls. Michael told me a little bit about his recent USO tour, on which he went to several undisclosed military bases in the Persian Gulf with a contingency of other famous cartoonists, visiting our troops.\n\n\u201cMichael has such a huge heart. He is a great supporter of what we do at Kristine Taylor Philanthropies,\u201d Kristine Taylor said. \u201cHe donates his time and talent to help us improve the lives of cancer patients.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Team Ramirez showed the other teams no mercy. Hey, charity stops at the foul line! Our team won the championship, and a restaurant gift certificate for our efforts. We should have dumped a bucket of Gatorade on Michael\u2019s head and carried him off on our shoulders, but instead we settled for a few high fives and \u201cThat-a-boys\u201d and a team picture.\n\nMeeting my favorite cartoonist in a casual setting while wearing rental shoes was a great experience. Plus, I was able to cross-off my long held bucketlist goal of \u201cBowling with a Pulitzer Prize Winner.\u201d Next up: \u201cPlay Ping Pong with a Nobel Prize Winner\u201d (story to follow).\n\nEmail David Jerome at dave@mrbucketlist.com.", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "news", "description": "News: Mr. Bucketlist: Bowling with a Pulitzer Prize winner | michael, ramirez, one, bowling, work, taylor, team, bowl, pulitzer, cancer", "author": "DAVID JEROME", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Fullerton is a One Degree of Separation town.", "title": "Mr. Bucketlist: Bowling with a Pulitzer Prize winner", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/michael-689257-ramirez-one.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nwus87-b88550824z.120151026173151000gb8cq6e4.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nwus87-b88550824z.120151026173151000gb8cq6e4.10.jpg"}, "description": "Fullerton is a One Degree of Separation town.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mr. Bucketlist: Bowling with a Pulitzer Prize winner"}, "content_author": "DAVID JEROME", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nwus87-b88550824z.120151026173151000gb8cq6e4.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "michael, ramirez, one, bowling, work, taylor, team, bowl, pulitzer, cancer", "publication_date": "2015-10-26", "access-type": "paid", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Mr. Bucketlist: Bowling with a Pulitzer Prize winner"}, "article_summary": "Plus, I was able to cross-off my long held bucketlist goal of \u201cBowling with a Pulitzer Prize Winner.\u201d Next up: \u201cPlay Ping Pong with a Nobel Prize Winner\u201d (story to follow).\nHe is a great supporter of what we do at Kristine Taylor Philanthropies,\u201d Kristine Taylor said.\nYou should come out to do karaoke with us sometime.\u201dWow, just that fast I discovered that I was just One Degree of Separation away from a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner.\nWhen I saw Michael Ramirez for the first time at the bowling alley, he was wearing a Yankees baseball cap and looked considerably younger than his 54 years.\nHands of Hope International and Kristine Taylor Philanthropies are two local charities that have done fantastic work for cancer patients."}
