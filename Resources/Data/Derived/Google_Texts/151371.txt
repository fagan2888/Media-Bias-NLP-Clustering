The intersection of US-41 and Pine Ridge Road is open and the all-clear notification has been given after the Collier County Sheriff's Office investigated a suspicious item left near a light pole outside a 7-Eleven store at 5320 Tamiami Trail North.

A CCSO spokesperson said it resembled "some type of hand-held radio with an item attached."
