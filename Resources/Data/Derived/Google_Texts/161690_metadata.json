Some of the differences stem from biology; other differences are behavioral. But though many of these seem to give men a head start, they shouldn\u2019t be taken to imply that guys have it easy.\n\nNo matter who you are or where you\u2019re starting, the road to your ideal weight is difficult at best, and confusing for most.\n\nInformation that researchers are unearthing about the differences in the way that men and women lose weight inspires hope that the next generation of weight-loss advice will be more tailored and effective than the generic tips that have gotten Americans no closer to sliding into their dream jeans.\n\nMore than a quarter of Americans are obese, according to a May Gallup poll, a number that has been ticking upward for years. Although experts have long insisted that losing weight is simply a matter of burning more calories than you consume, they now say that it\u2019s much more complicated than that.\n\nFirst, there is the matter of muscles and metabolism. Men tend to have more muscle than women, and because muscle burns more calories than fat, men tend to have a faster metabolism, too \u2014 anywhere from 3 percent to 10 percent higher than women, studies have shown.\n\nAnd at the gym, that difference just gets exacerbated. Women, worried about bulking up, tend to lift lighter weights and focus more on cardiovascular fitness, while men tend to gravitate toward the kind of heavy lifting that boosts muscle composition and metabolic rate, says Jim White, a nutrition expert and certified personal trainer.\n\nWhen it comes to food, there is evidence that men and women\u2019s brains are wired differently. In a study published in the January 2009 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, even though women said they weren\u2019t hungry when asked to smell, taste and observe treats such as pizza, cinnamon buns and chocolate cake, brain scans showed activity in the regions that control the drive to eat \u2014 not the case for men.\n\nHORMONES, PLUS\n\nThen, there\u2019s biochemistry. In women, ghrelin \u2014 the \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d hormone \u2014 spikes after a workout, while leptin \u2014 which tells the brain \u2018I\u2019m full!\u2019 \u2014 plummets, according to a 2009 study in the American Journal of Physiology \u2014 Regulatory, Integral and Comparable Physiology.\n\nNot so in men.\n\nSo post-workout, women tend to eat more, which puts them at risk to gain weight. Men don\u2019t experience this same hormonal fluctuation.\n\nResearchers speculate that this is basically a Darwinian issue, in that it\u2019s the female body\u2019s natural way of fighting energy deficits in order to preserve fertility and perpetuate the species. When women aren\u2019t getting enough calories, ovulation and hormones that make reproduction possible get suppressed.\n\nBut there\u2019s more than just biology at work here. A motley complex of emotional and behavioral issues have a powerful impact on the way men and women approach weight loss.\n\nCynthia Sass, a registered dietitian and co-author of \u201cThe Flat Belly Diet!,\u201d says she has seen many women gain weight as soon as they get into a relationship with men \u2014 because they start eating as much and as often as their male partners.\n\n\u201cThat turns out to be too much,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of what drives men and women to eat: hunger for food, or some more profound craving. A 2013 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition established that women are more commonly emotional eaters than men.\n\nAnd some emotional eaters, in an effort to feel better, are prone to reach for foods that will ignite the reward center of the brain, which tend to be the sugary, fatty, salty, hyper-palatable foods that can lead to weight gain, says Pamela Peeke, author of the \u201cThe Hunger Fix: The Three-Stage Detox and Recovery Plan for Overeating and Food Addiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not bingeing on arugula,\u201d says Peeke, who is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland. But a sugar high is shortlived, of course. Shame quickly floods in as food wrappers pile up.\n\nBoth men and women are prone to an all-or-nothing approach to weight loss. For example, after a binge, they may figure, \u201cWell, I blew it. I might as well go all out!\u201d\n\nBut Sass says she sees more women take extreme measures to get back on track, with tactics such as juice cleanses, skipping meals or extreme dieting \u2014 not the most sustainable methods.\n\n\u201cMost but not all men tend to just try to get back on track with the original plan, or build in a little more exercise,\u201d she says.\n\nThat is, they take a more balanced approach to getting back on track, just trying to regroup and get back on the diet, or build in a little more exercise.\n\nOne area where women get a boost, however, is in support systems: Men tend to \u201cgo it alone,\u201d Peeke says, which could lead them to give up in times of stress. Women are more likely to reach out to friends, family, a dietitian or a group such as Weight Watchers.\n\nSo what can we do with all this knowledge? Tempting as it is to get discouraged, we can actually find it encouraging. Biology is not destiny, after all.\n\n\u201cLifestyle choices are immensely powerful,\u201d Peeke says.\n\nAnd on the heels of any tidal wave of new research is sure to come a trickle of weight-loss advice that can be more customized and more effective to help men and women with their weight-loss obstacles, no matter what they are.\n\nGENDER-NEUTRAL TIPS\n\nThese steps can help you overcome your weight-loss obstacles, regardless of your sex.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/08/shutterstock_121644499.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "A motley complex of emotional and behavioral issues have a powerful impact on the way men and women approach weight loss.\n\u201cMost but not all men tend to just try to get back on track with the original plan, or build in a little more exercise,\u201d she says.\nThe Washington PostYou\u2019re not imagining it: There really are differences between the way men and women diet, lose weight and respond to exercise.\nSo post-workout, women tend to eat more, which puts them at risk to gain weight.\nMen tend to have more muscle than women, and because muscle burns more calories than fat, men tend to have a faster metabolism, too \u2014 anywhere from 3 percent to 10 percent higher than women, studies have shown."}
