ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) President Obama wants Americans to know the Affordable Care Act is "making a difference." In his weekly address, Obama said progress has been made through his signature healthcare law, giving 17.6 million more Americans coverage. "That's what the Affordable Care Act did. This is health care in America today. Affordable, portable security for you and your loved ones. It's making a difference for millions of Americans every day. And it's only going to get better," Obama said. He also encouraged people who haven't signed up to do so before the January 31st deadline.
