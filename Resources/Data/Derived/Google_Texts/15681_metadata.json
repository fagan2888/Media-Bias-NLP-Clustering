Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo banned all nonessential travel to the state over the so-called bathroom bill, corporations have denounced the law, the NBA has said it could impact the state\u2019s ability to host the 2017 All-Star game, and now, even the Obama administration is weighing in.\n\nThe New York Times reports:\n\nThe Obama administration is considering whether North Carolina\u2019s new law on gay and transgender rights makes the state ineligible for billions of dollars in federal aid for schools, highways and housing, officials said Friday.\n\nCutting off funding, or simply just the threat of doing so, could force the state to repeal the law. But experts say taking such drastic measures is unlikely. Still, a number of federal agencies are currently reviewing the law.\n\nAnthony Foxx, the secretary of transportation, first raised the prospect of a review of federal funding in public remarks on Tuesday in North Carolina. The Department of Transportation provides roughly $1 billion a year to North Carolina. The New York Times then asked other federal agencies whether they were conducting similar reviews. A Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, said on Friday that her agency was also reviewing the North Carolina law \u201cto determine any potential impact on the state\u2019s federal education funding.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will not hesitate to act if students\u2019 civil rights are being violated.\u201d [\u2026] The Department of Housing and Urban Development said it was doing a similar evaluation. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the effects of the law on HUD funding allocated for North Carolina,\u201d said Cameron French, a department spokesman.\n\n\u201cIt would be a long process of negotiation,\u201d Jane R. Wettach, an education law specialist at the Duke University School of Law told the Times. \u201cI think the federal government would be loath to do it and would give North Carolina every possibility, every chance to change their position, to change the law, to negotiate, to make some exceptions. I think they\u2019d go back and forth for a while and try to come to a negotiated settlement.\u201d\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest said the state complied with federal laws and the Constitution in writing the law. Thus, he was not convinced federal aid would be pulled.\n\n\u201cIt would be wrong \u2014 even illegal \u2014 to single out North Carolina for unfavorable treatment,\u201d Forest told the Times. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we will continue to receive this federal money despite the threats from a few in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, who\u2019s had enough when it comes to the widespread criticism the law has received, addressed critics in a video message last week.\n\n\u201cSome have called our state an embarrassment,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cThe real embarrassment is politicians not publicly respecting each others\u2019 position on complex issues. Unfortunately, that has occurred when legislation was passed recently to protect men, women, and children when they use a public restroom, shower, or locker room. That is an expectation of privacy that must be honored and respected. Instead, North Carolina has been the target of a vicious nationwide smear campaign.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cDisregarding the facts, other politicians \u2014 from the White House to mayors to state capitals and City Council members and even our attorney general \u2014 have initiated and promoted conflict to advance their political agenda and tear down our state, even if it means defying the Constitution and their oath of office.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pulling federal funds. .05/27/2016 5:24:35AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Pulling federal funds.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Obama Administration Considers Punishing North Carolina Over 'Bathroom Bill'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/05/obama-administration-talks-of-punishing-north-carolina-for-religious-protection-law-n2143446", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/39/d1a0f513-0982-4ec4-a4f4-7714f571d6da.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Pulling federal funds.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Obama Administration Considers Punishing North Carolina Over 'Bathroom Bill'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/04/05/obama-administration-talks-of-punishing-north-carolina-for-religious-protection-law-n2143446", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/39/d1a0f513-0982-4ec4-a4f4-7714f571d6da.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Administration Considers Punishing North Carolina Over 'Bathroom Bill', Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Anthony Foxx, the secretary of transportation, first raised the prospect of a review of federal funding in public remarks on Tuesday in North Carolina.\n\u201cIt would be wrong \u2014 even illegal \u2014 to single out North Carolina for unfavorable treatment,\u201d Forest told the Times.\n\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the effects of the law on HUD funding allocated for North Carolina,\u201d said Cameron French, a department spokesman.\nThe Department of Transportation provides roughly $1 billion a year to North Carolina.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that we will continue to receive this federal money despite the threats from a few in Washington, D.C.\u201dNorth Carolina Gov."}
