A first-generation American whose parents came from Cuba, Meklas is a registered Republican who says she\u2019s against tax increases. When canvassers knocked on her door on March 12 and asked whom she planned to support in North Carolina\u2019s March 15 primary, she was candid: \u201cAnybody but Trump would be my actual answer.\u201d\n\nThe Libre Initiative courts support among Latinos such as Meklas for reducing the size of government, rolling back Obamacare, and promoting school voucher programs. Since 2011, Libre\u2014a nonprofit funded in part by groups affiliated with the conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch\u2014has opened offices in 10 states, including Arizona, Florida, and Texas. It had a budget of about $9 million in 2014, the most recent year for which records are available, and employs about 125 people who have recruited thousands of volunteers. \u201cThere are 15 million Latinos who make over $50,000 in America,\u201d says executive director Daniel Garza. \u201cIf they\u2019re already prone to vote for free-market or freedom-oriented issues or candidates, well, that\u2019s good information to know. We want those people to get out and vote.\u201d\n\nFrom left to right, Libre Initiative volunteers George Faura, David Silva, and Carmin Chavez canvass neighborhoods in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 12, 2016.

This year, the group says, its volunteers will contact about 5 million eligible voters through knocking on doors and making phone calls. Details of those visits and calls are shared with i360, a voter database for conservative candidates that\u2019s also funded by the Koch network. The goal is to raise turnout among Latinos sympathetic to conservative economic ideas. (As a nonprofit, Libre can\u2019t explicitly advocate for the Republican Party.) Libre also hosts social events, including seminars on personal finance.\n\nLibre\u2019s mission has been complicated by Donald Trump\u2019s emergence as the Republican front-runner. The candidate kicked off his campaign with a speech characterizing undocumented Mexican immigrants as rapists, and he\u2019s vowed to force Mexico to pay for a wall along the southern U.S. border. In early March a consortium of liberal groups announced an effort to raise $15 million, including $5 million from billionaire George Soros, to register 400,000 Latino voters this year in several states, including Colorado, Florida, and Nevada. \u201cOur intention is to take the fear and anger in our community and turn it into votes,\u201d says Crist\u00f3bal Alex, president of Latino Victory Project, a liberal group founded by actress Eva Longoria. Its super-PAC is backed by hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nFrom left to right, Libre Initiative volunteers Virginia Faura, George Faura, David Silva, and Carmin Chavez canvass neighborhoods in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 12, 2016. Photographer: Andy McMillan for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGarza, the son of migrant farmworkers, acknowledges the frustration among Latinos with Trump, whose statements he describes as \u201ccruel.\u201d But he says Trump\u2019s rise isn\u2019t a reason for him to stop his work. \u201cWe know that this is going to be a long-term play,\u201d Garza says. Libre volunteers say they also remain committed to spreading the word about free-market economics. \u201cThe principles are the same\u201d as the ones she learned as a child in Peru, says Claudia Faura, who helped knock on doors in Charlotte. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be depending upon the government.\u201d\n\n\u2014With assistance from Zachary Mider.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tim Higgins", "description": "The billionaires\u00a0are funding the Libre Initiative, a non-profit\u00a0with offices in\u00a0Arizona, Florida, and Texas that hopes to\u00a0cut into Democratic dominance among Latino voters.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipSt8kOln9WU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The billionaires\u00a0are funding the Libre Initiative, a non-profit\u00a0with offices in\u00a0Arizona, Florida, and Texas that hopes to\u00a0cut into Democratic dominance among Latino voters.", "title": "Koch Brothers Nurture Rise of Hispanic Republicans", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-17/the-koch-brothers-are-nurturing-the-rise-of-hispanic-republicans", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipSt8kOln9WU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The billionaires\u00a0are funding the Libre Initiative, a non-profit\u00a0with offices in\u00a0Arizona, Florida, and Texas that hopes to\u00a0cut into Democratic dominance among Latino voters.", "title": "Koch Brothers Nurture Rise of Hispanic Republicans", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-17/the-koch-brothers-are-nurturing-the-rise-of-hispanic-republicans", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipSt8kOln9WU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "The billionaires\u00a0are funding the Libre Initiative, a non-profit\u00a0with offices in\u00a0Arizona, Florida, and Texas that hopes to\u00a0cut into Democratic dominance among Latino voters."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Koch Brothers Nurture Rise of Hispanic Republicans", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "O46EC76KLVRD01", "parsely-author": "Tim Higgins", "date": "2016-03-17T09:00:07.130Z", "keywords": "Arizona,Florida,Conservative,Republicans,Billionaires,Hispanic Vote,The Koch Brothers,Donald Trump", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Arizona,Florida,Conservative,Republicans,Billionaires,Hispanic Vote,The Koch Brothers,Donald Trump", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-17T09:00:07.130Z", "parsely-tags": "Arizona,Florida,Conservative,Republicans,Billionaires,Hispanic Vote,The Koch Brothers,Donald Trump,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-17/the-koch-brothers-are-nurturing-the-rise-of-hispanic-republicans"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere are 15 million Latinos who make over $50,000 in America,\u201d says executive director Daniel Garza.\nLibre volunteers say they also remain committed to spreading the word about free-market economics.\nFrom left to right, Libre Initiative volunteers Virginia Faura, George Faura, David Silva, and Carmin Chavez canvass neighborhoods in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 12, 2016.\nIn early March a consortium of liberal groups announced an effort to raise $15 million, including $5 million from billionaire George Soros, to register 400,000 Latino voters this year in several states, including Colorado, Florida, and Nevada.\nLisa Meklas, a 30-year-old insurance underwriting assistant in Charlotte, is exactly the kind of person the Libre Initiative wants to get excited about the conservative movement."}
