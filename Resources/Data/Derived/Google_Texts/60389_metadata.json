Green of the humanities and medicine departments at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWhen we talked to the oncologists about it, a response we heard again and again is, \u2018it\u2019s not appropriate at this time, it\u2019s going to make them anxious, take away their hope\u2019,\u201d Green told Reuters Health.\n\nHe and his team set out to see if it was true that working through end of life planning took away cancer patients\u2019 hope or raised their anxiety levels.\n\nThey used an interactive decision aid with audio and video elements called \u201cMaking Your Wishes Known: Planning Your Medical Future,\u201d (MYWK) which is available online.\n\nIt includes education modules on common medical conditions that can result in decisional incapacity, as well as medical treatments often introduced in life or death situations. Patients can choose a spokesperson, prioritize values and goals, match treatment options with priorities and generate a printable advance directive document articulating their wishes.\n\nFor the study, the researchers divided 200 advanced-stage cancer patients with anticipated life expectancy of two years or less into two groups. One engaged in advanced care planning with the online tool, while the other used only a state-approved advance directive form and American Hospital Association educational materials.\n\nThose who used the MYWK online tool spent an average of 70 minutes in their advance care planning, compared to 26 minutes in the comparison group.\n\nBefore and after the advanced planning sessions, researchers measured the patients\u2019 anxiety, hopefulness and hopelessness with validated questionnaires. Hopelessness levels have been linked to suicide risk for the terminally ill, the authors note.\n\nNeither group had a decrease in hope or an increase in hopelessness after their advance care planning sessions, according to results in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management.\n\nAnxiety levels decreased slightly for the MYWK group and stayed the same for the comparison group. Knowledge of advance care planning and feelings of self-determination increased slightly for both groups.\n\n\u201cPeople worry about what\u2019s going to happen, 'am I going to be a burden, how are people going to know what I want',\u201d Green said. \u201c'If I get sick how am I going to get the treatment that I want and not get treatment I don\u2019t want'.\u201d\n\nTerminally ill people are often already thinking about death, so there is little reason to avoid having an explicit conversation about it, he said.\n\n\u201cMany health professionals suggest that (advance care planning) may make patients anxious, however like this study there is no evidence this is the case \u2013 there is some evidence suggesting the opposite,\u201d said Dr. Karen Detering of the Respecting Patient Choices Program at Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\u201cIn my experience I think the health care professionals often feel helpless, and are often reassured when they see patients are helped by (advance care planning),\u201d Detering, who was not involved in the new study, told Reuters Health by email.\n\n\u201cIn our experience \u2013 only approximately half of the patients who are offered and undertake (advance care planning) will complete formal advance directives, but many others will have a useful discussion regarding what they would want in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nDoctors who initiate these conversations can do a lot to decrease patient stress and anxiety, but many physicians are hesitant and are also pressed for time, he said. The MYWK decision aid was modeled on what a conversation with your doctor should look like, he said.\n\n\u201cTo have a meaningful conversation about these end of life concerns takes a lot of time and physicians are incredibly busy, they often put off initiating these conversations,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe low levels of anxiety and hopelessness even before the planning sessions were surprising, although they did not include patients with severe depression, he said.\n\n\u201cThe presumption of the medical profession is unless you tell us otherwise we\u2019re going to do everything,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt does put some responsibility on the patients to speak up and say what matters to them.\u201d\n\n(Written by Kathryn Doyle)\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1Bdto8P Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, online December 23, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "end of life planning, cancer, advance directive", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study suggests that offering cancer patients the opportunity to make end-of-life medical decisions did not take away their hope or raise their anxiety levels.", "title": "Talking About Death Doesn't Make Cancer Patients Hopeless", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/end-life-planning-does-not-cause-anxiety-or-hopelessness-cancer-patients-despite-316100", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/shutterstock229179358.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study suggests that offering cancer patients the opportunity to make end-of-life medical decisions did not take away their hope or raise their anxiety levels.", "title": "Talking About Death Doesn't Make Cancer Patients Hopeless", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/end-life-planning-does-not-cause-anxiety-or-hopelessness-cancer-patients-despite-316100", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/shutterstock229179358.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/shutterstock229179358.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-01-02T18:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T18:10:22-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study suggests that offering cancer patients the opportunity to make end-of-life medical decisions did not take away their hope or raise their anxiety levels."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4a5\"", "article_summary": "Before and after the advanced planning sessions, researchers measured the patients\u2019 anxiety, hopefulness and hopelessness with validated questionnaires.\nKnowledge of advance care planning and feelings of self-determination increased slightly for both groups.\nNeither group had a decrease in hope or an increase in hopelessness after their advance care planning sessions, according to results in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management.\nThose who used the MYWK online tool spent an average of 70 minutes in their advance care planning, compared to 26 minutes in the comparison group.\nA new study shows that end-of-life planning does not lead to anxiety or hopelessness."}
