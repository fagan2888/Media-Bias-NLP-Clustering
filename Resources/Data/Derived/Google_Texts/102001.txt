Since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and maybe even before then, there have always been U.S. Presidential celebrity impersonators.

Mind you, not that it’s a really lucrative career. After all, you have only 4 years of work, or maybe 8, if you’re really lucky. So you try to take advantage of it as much as you, while you can, since you have a limited shelf life.

Which brings us to Puerto Rican Bronx native, Louis Ortiz, an unemployed father of three, trying to make ends meet, who, one day, looked in the mirror and realized that he looked sort of familiar.

Ortiz then started on his strange journey as the “look of a lifetime,” as a President Obama impersonator, trying to cash in on his good (or maybe bad) fortune, until 2016.

But it's also a story about one guy living his own version American Dream, and if doing Obama skits at business conventions and mall openings, is the way to do it, who’s going to complain?

It's a story that definitely intrigued filmmaker Ryan Murdock for his new documentary, "Bronx Obama," which is about Ortiz and the joys, sorrows and struggles it takes to be an Obama impersonator.

The film has just completed a successful film festival circuit run, and will coming to VOD, on ITunes, Vimeo, Amazon Instant Video and other digital platforms, on October 7, before its national television debut, on Oct. 29, just before the November midterms elections.

Here’s the trailer for "Bronx Obama:"
