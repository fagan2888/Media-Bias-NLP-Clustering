The monthly median rent in Mountain View is $4,211.\n\nThe city council is considering several policy options to assist renters, and the Mountain View Tenants Coalition aims for another big turnout at the Dec. 1 meeting. \u201cOur one hope for action soon is this December 1 meeting,\u201d tenants\u2019 coalition member Edie Keating said.\n\nVice Mayor Pat Showalter expects an expanded subsidy program to pass but said she could not predict the extent of the expansion or when it would go into effect because state law prohibits private discussions among a majority of council members on matters before the council.In a report it prepared for the Dec. 1 meeting, city staff have outlined possible programs for the council to discuss and recommended appropriating $150,000 to pilot an enhanced rental assistance program with Community Services Agency, which already runs a limited subsidy program with $36,000 in funding.Three options are to be considered, ranging from scaling up the existing program to adding more comprehensive services, in line with best practices. The proposed programs would extend assistance to 27 to 40 additional households. Full implementation of these programs would range from $215,000 to $420,000, including the recommended $150,000 for a pilot phase.The city council will also consider a potential mandatory mediation program, which would give tenants the right to compel landlords to attend mediation when rent increases by a certain amount.Mediation is optional in Mountain View today, but city staff detailed six local mandatory mediation programs \u2014 in Palo Alto, Los Gatos, Campbell, Fremont, San Leandro and Alameda \u2014 in its report for the Dec. 1 meeting.City Attorney Jannie Quinn focused on the program in Los Gatos during a meeting she held with tenants advocates on Nov. 19, according to Mountain View Tenants Coalition members Joan MacDonald and Mar\u00eda Marroqu\u00edn, who attended the meeting.Considered a form of \u201csoft rental control,\u201d the Los Gatos program permits tenants to request mediation for annual rent hikes that exceed 5 percent, or 70 percent of the rate of inflation, with the option of binding arbitration if mediation fails to produce a settlement.Martin Eichner, who was responsible by contract for the Los Gatos program as director of Dispute Resolution Programs for Project Sentinel from 2001 to 2013, said that the town does not require landlords to report rental rates. Rather, tenants must file a complaint with the mediation program to contest rent increases.At a League of Women Voters meeting about housing issues in Mountain View on Nov. 20, Eichner added, \u201cThe city might never learn about excessive rent increases,\u201d Eichner said.Marroqu\u00edn pointed out that the Los Gatos program does not provide adequate protection against unjust evictions but said, \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dThe Mountain View City Council will also revisit a proposed ordinance that would make it harder for landlords to evict tenants. This \u201cright-to-lease\u201d ordinance would require landlords to offer six-month or one-year leases and would only allow tenants to ask for month-to-month arrangements.Landlords have more opportunities to evict tenants with month-to-month leases than with longer-term leases because protections against evictions without cause last only for the term of the lease. At the end of the lease term, a landlord may evict a tenant for any reason, as long as he provides 30 to 60 days notice.The proposed lease requirement would bar landlords from charging higher rents for longer-term leases although landlord advocates argue that landlords usually charge more per month for month-to-month leases, which give both landlord and tenant less certainty.Depending on what the council decides on Dec. 1, the lease requirement could take effect as soon as Jan. 7.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "The Mountain View City Council is considering whether to expand rent subsidies for low-income households and whether to adopt a measure that would make it harder for landlords to increase rents.", "title": "Mountain View explores possible protections against crushing rents - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MountainViewRents.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-02T17:18:07+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/12/01/mountain-view-possible-protections-crushing-rents/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "News", "tag": "rents", "published_time": "2015-12-01T16:01:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-02T17:18:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mountain View City Council is considering whether to expand rent subsidies for low-income households and whether to adopt a measure that would make it harder for landlords to increase rents.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MountainViewRents.jpg", "title": "Mountain View explores possible protections against crushing rents - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The city council is considering several policy options to assist renters, and the Mountain View Tenants Coalition aims for another big turnout at the Dec. 1 meeting.\nThe monthly median rent in Mountain View is $4,211.\nThe Mountain View City Council will consider on Dec. 1 whether to expand rent subsidies for low-income households and whether to adopt a measure that would make it harder for landlords to increase rents.\n\u201cOur one hope for action soon is this December 1 meeting,\u201d tenants\u2019 coalition member Edie Keating said.\nThe proposed programs would extend assistance to 27 to 40 additional households."}
