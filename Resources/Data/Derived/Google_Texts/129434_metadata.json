General Assembly this week, and the Obama administration doesn\u2019t know what to do with him.\n\nThe Obama administration faces a challenge and the United Nations faces embarrassment now that Sudanese President Omar Bashir has applied for a U.S. visa to attend the annual General Assembly session, which opens Tuesday.\n\nAs the U.N. host country, the United States routinely grants visas to foreign leaders to travel to New York on U.N. business, but Gen. Bashir is under indictment for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. On Sunday, he said at a news conference in Khartoum that it is Sudan\u2019s right to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting.\n\nSEE ALSO: Foot-draggers: U.S. and Russia slow to destroy own chemical weapons amid Syria smackdown\n\n\u201cWe have made arrangement to participate and there is no law in America [that] gives the right of preventing us,\u201d he said, according to the official Sudan News Agency.\n\nSamantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and other administration officials want Gen. Bashir to surrender to the Netherlands-based tribunal, even though the United States does not recognize the authority of the court.\n\nThe court issued arrest warrants for the Sudanese leader in 2009 and 2010, accusing him of committing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan\u2019s western province of Darfur.\n\n\u201cGiving President Bashir a visa would be controversial. It would call the U.S. government\u2019s bluff on Bashir\u2019s indictment,\u201d said Andrew Natsios, who served as U.S. special envoy to Sudan in the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is pressing African and Arab governments to arrest him and send him to the [court] for prosecution. Why isn\u2019t the U.S. government arresting him if we support the indictment?\u201d said Mr. Natsios, who is currently director of the Scowcroft Institute of International Affairs at Texas A&M University.\n\nGen. Bashir\u2019s presence at the United Nations could embarrass the world body because the Security Council referred the conflict in Darfur to the International Criminal Court in 2005.\n\nJohnnie Carson, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said it would be a serious mistake for Gen. Bashir to address the General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is not simply a challenge for the Obama administration; this is a challenge to [U.N.] Secretary-General [Ban Ki-moon] and senior officials at the U.N. as well,\u201d said Mr. Carson, now a senior adviser at the United States Institute for Peace.\n\n\u201cIf they allow him a platform to speak, they will be allowing someone who has been referred to the [court] by the [U.N.] Security Council and accused of war crimes and atrocities to use the U.N. platform to disseminate his views.\u201d\n\nElise Keppler of Human Rights Watch, added: \u201cThe last thing the U.N. needs is a visit by an ICC fugitive.\u201d\n\nIf Gen. Bashir shows up at the United Nations, Mr. Ban would urge him to surrender to the court, said U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq. It is up to the Security Council to ensure Sudan\u2019s cooperation with the court, which has no police force and relies on international cooperation to arrest suspects.\n\nThe United Nations has hosted several world leaders with whom the United States had tense relations, including Presidents Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba.\n\nHowever, if Gen. Bashir is allowed to travel to New York, he would be the first person facing an International Criminal Court arrest warrant to enter the U.S. to attend a U.N. meeting.\n\n\u201cThe question of whether the United States is to grant President Bashir a visa is, first and foremost, a matter for the United States to determine, consistent with the applicable rules of international law,\u201d Mr. Haq said.\n\nU.S. officials have not said whether the court warrant is grounds to reject Gen. Bashir\u2019s visa application.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of considerations going into this request, including the outstanding warrant against him,\u201d State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Friday.\n\nThe International Criminal Court last week asked the United States to arrest Gen. Bashir and turn him over to its custody if the Sudanese leader enters the United States.\n\nAlthough the United States is not among the 122 nations that recognize the court, the Obama administration has established a working relationship with the tribunal.\n\nIn March, for example, the United States helped Rwanda arrange the transfer of Congolese rebel commander Bosco Ntaganda to the custody of the court.\n\nGen. Bashir denies the court charges and has refused to accept the legitimacy of the tribunal.\n\nSudan\u2019s government criticized the Obama administration for suggesting that Gen. Bashir turn himself over to the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe Sudanese Foreign Ministry said the U.S. has \u201cno legal right to object to the participation of any official from member states of the U.N. in activities of the U.N.\u201d\n\nThe United States also is \u201cnot morally, politically and legally qualified to provide sermons\u201d on international human rights and humanitarian law, it added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An accused war criminal wants to address the U.N.
