It was a relief when he finally died,\" the 80-year-old wife confesses, a month after her spouse finally succumbed to a slowly spreading lung cancer.\n\nBut then she adds, with a stricken look, \"I feel terrible about feeling relieved. It's as if I wanted him to die. I didn't!\"\n\nShe pauses again before saying, quietly, \"Not really.\"\n\nHer words reflect the uncomfortable mixture of feelings \u2014 mostly sad, sometimes mad, but a little glad \u2014 that many family caregivers struggle with after a care recipient dies and caregiving suddenly ends.\n\nThe relief is real. Few caregivers miss having to be on edge all the time, awaiting the next cry in the night, a fall or some other medical emergency. Few miss the anguish of seeing a loved one suffering and being unable to provide a remedy. With the care recipient's death comes greater freedom and the leisure time to enjoy grandchildren, old friends and hours absorbed in a book or lingering over coffee.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "Feeling Relief (and Guilt) at Caregiving's End", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-03-01", "Last-Modified": "2016-03-01T11:28:11.114-05:00", "keywords": "death, spouse, relief, guilt, caregiver", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Barry J.
