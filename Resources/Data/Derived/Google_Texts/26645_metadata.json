Jonathan Westbrook\u2019s father Theodis Westbrook drove nearly halfway across the country after learning his son was one of 16 wounded during Specialist Ivan Lopez\u2019s shooting spree. Three people also died during the rampage.\n\nHe told ABC News of the emotional roller coaster he and his wife went on while waiting to hear the married father of three was still alive. His wife also spoke to the traumatic hours until hearing from the father of their three children.\n\n\n\nInjured: Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook was shot during the Fort Hood rampage\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am as a dad, as the parent, that I am here to celebrate with my son\u2026 and not here to go the other way,\u2019 the relieved father said.\n\nHis son was shot four times \u2013 twice each in the arm and chest, he said.\n\nThe worried father admitted thinking \u2018how different it could have been\u2019 during his 10 hour drive from Mississippi to the Texas Army base.\n\n\u2018How much worst it could have been, how much worse the news could have been and how our lives would have been changed had it gone the other way,\u2019 all crossed his mind, he said.\n\nTheodis Westbrook told of how he felt helpless as the shooting raged on.\n\n\u2018Ever since my kids were very, very small, I was afraid that something [would] cause pain and hurt to them and I did everything in my power to prevent that\u2026 for this to happen, it is the realization of the worst nightmare.\u2019\n\nCocnerned: Theodis Westbrook, father of the injured soldier, said the wait to hear about his son was agonizing\n\nHappy couple: Renee and Jonathan Westbrook have three children together\n\nHis soldier son served last year in Afghanistan, but the pain caused by the Fort Hood shooting is more than had anything happened during combat, the father said.\n\n\u2018Bombs, missiles and all sorts of weapons used against him and he survived all of that and he came back here to a U.S. military installation that is secure and almost lost his life and got wounded.\n\n\u2018It is just unbelievable.\u2019\n\nThe injured soldier's wife, Renee Westbrook, said her husband did mainly administrative work after being blown several feet by a bomb while in Afghanistan.\n\nHe suffered minor nerve damage and received treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder but was otherwise okay, she explained.\n\n\n\nSeven hours passed before Jonathan was able to contact his parents.\n\n\u2018We walked the floor, we cried, we prayed,\u2019 said Theodis Westbrook. \u2018We had no information \u2026 we allowed ourselves to think the very worst.\u2019\n\nIn memorial: Flowers hang at the East Gate of the army base Friday at Fort Hood\n\nThe Sergeant\u2019s parents admitted that the longer time went by, the more they were convinced something very bad had happened.\n\n\u2018We have just been to hell and back,\u2019 he lamented.\n\nJonathan finally was able to call his parents, he told them of the terrifying ordeal.\n\n\u2018The very first person that was hit died,\u2019 Theodis Westbrook said his son told him. \u2018And, then the gun was turned on my son.\n\nPeople scrambled for cover, turning over desks and tables for protection, he was told.\n\nThe shooter soon left and started randomly shooting people he encountered.\n\nRenee Westbrook, was flown Friday by the military to Fort Hood to see her husband, and she couldn't wait to assure their children their father was okay.\n\n' I just thank God that he gave my husband a second chance,' she said.\n\n\n\nOfficials have since said the shooting likely happened after a verbal altercation caused Lopez to \u2018snap,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t premeditated.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Fort,Hood,shooting,rampage,survivors,family,details,terrifying,wait,call,injured,soldier",
