Thanks to Oliver, many of us learned about the intricacies of the criminal defense system, messed up bail requirements, municipal fines that can land you in jail if you can\u2019t pay and prisoner reentry complications when you get out.\n\nDespite being British, he\u2019s a damn national treasure. Here are the 13 stories that were the best and most important of 2015.\n\n1. Destroying Big Pharma\u2019s outrageous spending to influence doctors\n\n17-minutes of a scathing attack on the pharmacutical industry\u2019s bypass of the expertise of doctors and marketing straight to the consumer.\n\n\u201cDrug companies are like high school boyfriends,\u201d Oliver joked. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in getting inside you than in being effective once they are there.\u201d\n\n2. John Oliver on Big Tobacco: \u201cThe agricultural equivalent of U2\u2033\n\nIf there is one thing tobacco companies love to do it\u2019s finding new creative ways to put their products into the hands of new users who have long lives of usage ahead of them. Many countries are fighting back. There are fewer users and yet the tobacco industry is more profitable than ever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an aging product that\u2019s decreasing in popularity and yet it just can\u2019t stop making money,\u201d says Oliver. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the agricultural equivalent of U2.\u201d\n\n3. John Oliver eviscerates Congress over America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure\n\nOne of the most terrifying things John Oliver has covered. Our roads and bridges all over the country are falling apart. This will make you think twice before you drive over a river with a sketchy bridge.\n\n\u201cMuch like most Botox recipients and competitive cloggers, the average dam is 52 years old and has something deeply broken inside of it,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cInfrastructure is like Legos. Building is fun, destroying is fun, but a Lego maintenance set would be the most boring fucking toy in the world.\u201d\n\n4. John Oliver reveals the stunningly racist history behind why some U.S. territories can\u2019t vote\n\nOver 100-year-old racist rulings that decide that those born in the U.S. territories don\u2019t have the same constitutional rights as those born in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe American part of American Samoa is really a title that doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d said Oliver, \u201clike \u2018People\u2019s Choice award nominee\u2019 or \u2018social media expert.'\u201d\n\n5. A \u201cfuckbarrel\u201d of fines: John Oliver reveals the disturbing way police are preying on the working poor\n\nThere are far too many people living paycheck to paycheck who can\u2019t pay fines upfront when slapped with them. If you can\u2019t pay the fine you\u2019re issued another fine on top of that. Eventually, there are so many fines people go to jail. It\u2019s a never ending cycle that many can\u2019t get out of.\n\n\u201cThat situation is ridiculous,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe only people who should be that excited about people waiting in line to hand over way too much money are Apple executives. That\u2019s the only time.\u201d\n\n6. John Oliver perfectly sums up everything that\u2019s wrong with standardized testing\n\nThe scariest two words in any school among both students and teachers are \u201cstandardized tests.\u201d There are even parents who are opting their children out because the tests are so ridiculous. But apparently everything that you are as a kid boils down to one test. It\u2019s messed up and Oliver tells the world why.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong with our system when we just assume a certain number of kids will vomit,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cTests are supposed to be assessments of skills, not a rap battle on 8 Mile Road.\u201d\n\n7. John Oliver rips America\u2019s disgraceful maternity leave policy: Thanks for giving us life \u2014 \u201cnow get the fuck back to work\u201d\n\nFun fact: The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world that doesn\u2019t offer paid time off for new moms.\n\n\u201cThis is not how its supposed to work,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cMothers shouldn\u2019t have to stitch together time to recover from childbirth the same way that we plan a four-day weekend in Atlantic City.\u201d\n\n8.
