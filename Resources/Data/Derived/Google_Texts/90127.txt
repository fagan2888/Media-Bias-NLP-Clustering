Authorities say a shark bit a boy wading in the Gulf of Mexico.

Destin Fire Control District Capt. Mark Hutchinson says the boy was bitten on the right forearm Saturday afternoon.

Hutchinson says the boy had been about knee deep in the water. He says the bite "was not an amputation, but a pretty significant-sized laceration."

The boy was taken to a hospital. His name was not released.

Hutchinson says the boy never lost consciousness and was able to talk with authorities.

Last month, a shark bit a man on the foot in the waters off Pensacola and at Panama City Beach last month a 7 year old boy on vacation from

Georgia sustained a minor bite on his ankle while he was standing in 6 - 8 inches of surf.
