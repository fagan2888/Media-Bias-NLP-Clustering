The law protects established moving companies by allowing them to veto license applications of start-up businesses, such as the Loscos\u2019 College Hunks Moving franchise.\n\nFiled in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Loscos\u2019 lawsuit seeks an injunction and a declaration that Pennsylvania\u2019s anti-competition licensing law violates constitutional protections for free enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe targeted law \u2014 the state\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Public Convenience\u201d requirement, 66 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3310 \u2014 requires a person to get a Certificate before starting a moving business. But when someone applies for a license, existing moving companies are allowed to file a protest. If a protest is filed \u2014 and if the license applicant does not agree to reduce the area in which the new business will operate \u2014 the applicant is then required to somehow prove that the business is \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d to \u201cthe service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public.\u201d None of those terms is defined in the law.\n\n\n\nIn essence, existing moving companies can veto their own competition.\n\n\n\nThe Loscos are represented, free of charge, by Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), a public interest watchdog organization that litigates for limited government and free enterprise. This is the latest litigation in PLF\u2019s nationwide legal campaign against competitor\u2019s veto laws. PLF Principal Attorney Timothy Sandefur and staff attorney Anastasia Boden are litigating the case, with the assistance of attorney Mark Jakubik of The Jakubik Law Firm in Philadelphia.\n\nDerailing the Loscos\u2019 dream of owning a moving business\n\nAfter years of working for other people \u2014 Cosmo as manager of operations for a medical device manufacturer, and Mary Anne in human resources for several companies \u2014 the Loscos decided that they wanted to start a business of their own.\n\n\n\nThey chose College Hunks Hauling Junk and Moving, a company that provides experienced managers the opportunity to lead a small business as franchisees, and to hire and mentor ambitious young people. HUNKS is actually an acronym for Honest, Uniformed, Nice, Knowledgeable, Service. The core values of the company include building future leaders, and listening to and delighting customers. Belief in these values led the Loscos to this service-focused franchise.\n\n\n\nThis past February, Cosmo bought a College Hunks Hauling Junk franchise based in Hatfield, and entered an agreement to buy a College Hunks Moving franchise.\n\n\n\nThe hauling franchise is up and running \u2014 but not the moving business. When he started researching the process of getting the required government license for the moving franchise, Cosmo learned about Pennsylvania\u2019s competitor\u2019s veto law for the moving industry.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was a shock,\u201d said Cosmo. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense that existing moving companies get a \u2018vote\u2019 on who gets to do business. This system makes it nearly impossible to be approved for the license.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis law against competition isn\u2019t just harming my wife and me,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is hurting the people we want to serve. I was looking for an opportunity to be my own boss and hire and mentor young people. We can have a positive impact on future leaders and on our community.\n\n\n\n\u201cA native Pennsylvanian, I have lived in the Telford area all my adult life,\u201d he said. \u201cI have given back to my community in various ways, including coaching sports for over 30 years. Moving is stressful for people. Providing top-notch service was appealing to me, as a way to help others, and as a business challenge for myself.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe state should not be able to stop us from serving consumers and pursuing our dream, simply to protect other businesses from competition,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to Pacific Legal Foundation for helping us fight this unfair and unconstitutional law.\u201d\n\nStatement by PLF Principal Attorney Timothy Sandefur:\n\nPennsylvania is violating the constitutional right to earn a living\n\n\u201cPennsylvania\u2019s competitor\u2019s veto law is a flagrant abuse of regulatory power,\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney Timothy Sandefur. \u201cThe proper purpose of licensing is to protect the public from unsafe or dishonest business practices. Shielding well-connected businesses from new competition is not a valid government purpose. In fact, it\u2019s flat-out unconstitutional. As our lawsuit emphasizes, laws designed to create monopolies violate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process of law and the constitutionally protected right to earn a living. Economic protectionism can\u2019t be upheld by the courts, if they\u2019re properly exercising their function to protect constitutional rights, because anti-competition laws serve no legitimate government interest.\u201d\n\nPLF\u2019s nationwide \u201cFighting the Competitor\u2019s Veto\u201d campaign\n\nAs part of its mission to defend constitutionally protected free enterprise rights, PLF is challenging anti-competition, competitor\u2019s veto laws in states throughout the country. The motto of PLF\u2019s \u201cFighting the Competitor\u2019s Veto\u201d campaign is: \u201cBecause everyone has a right to earn a living.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his nationally syndicated New Year\u2019s column at the beginning of this year, Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator George F. Will highlighted PLF\u2019s 2014 federal court victory against Kentucky\u2019s competitor\u2019s veto law for the moving business. He called that ruling \u201ca blow for liberty and against crony capitalism,\u201d and the year\u2019s \u201cmost encouraging development in governance.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn three other states \u2014 Oregon, Missouri, and (just this month) Montana \u2014 PLF lawsuits have led to legislative repeals of competitor\u2019s veto laws.\n\n\n\nPLF\u2019s newly filed Pennsylvania case is Losco v. Powelson.
