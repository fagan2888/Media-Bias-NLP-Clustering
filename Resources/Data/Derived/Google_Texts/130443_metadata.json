A North Carolinian, she passed away on May 28 in her home in Winston-Salem at the age of 86.\n\nAt the age of 6, Nicole Johnson, Maya\u2019s great granddaughter, declared that \u201cpeople don\u2019t love my great grandmother because she is famous. They love her because she loves them.\u201d Indeed, both Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama stated that Maya had a significant impact on them through empowering their sense of identity as black women, helping to lead them to where they are today.\n\nBill Clinton spoke of how he discovered Maya in law school through her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. He was \u201cstruck dumb.\u201d Much of Maya\u2019s legacy stems from this book\u2013a coming-of-age story that chronicles her rise from trauma in a culture of racism and misogyny to self-empowerment and a new identity. Having experienced the trauma of rape, she analogizes it to the racist brutality directed against her ethnic community. Like the caged bird that sings, literature and language are discovered as tools for transcending cultural oppression.\n\nClinton spoke of how even in Maya\u2019s five year silence as a young woman, she continued to listen and pay attention to what was happening around her. He claimed that \u201cher great gift in her action-packed life was she was always paying attention.\u201d Thus her work was to call our attention toward things she paid attention to. She taught us that history does not need to be lived again. Every day we have a choice to choose light or darkness. Clinton expressed gratitude to Maya for \u201creminding us that on each new day we can give birth again to the dream, and that every day we should look into our sister\u2019s eyes and our brother\u2019s face, to all our nation, and say good morning.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama spoke of the ways in which Maya empowered her as a young black girl to embrace her own beauty and to be courageous and proud in the person she is. Obama said that it was the power of Maya\u2019s words that carried her \u201cfrom the south side of Chicago all the way to the White House.\u201d Maya taught young black women that it was okay for them to be themselves, to disregard the racist constructs propagated by a culture of white privilege.\n\nOprah described Maya as her \u201cspiritual queen mother\u201d and the \u201cultimate teacher.\u201d Maya taught her that God was already shining a light on her face\u2013that her enemies could not hold a candle to it\u2013and that she was a \u201cchild of God.\u201d Oprah proclaimed that Maya\u2019s great gift to us was that \u201cshe made every one of us feel like we were the one.\u201d Maya taught her that our legacy is every person we touch each and every day, not the glory of occasional things done in the spotlight.\n\nIn this way, Maya empowered all people to know that all of us have a legacy to leave in our daily lives whether we acknowledge it or not, and that we all have great dignity and worth as human beings. This truth is the bedrock of social justice.\n\nYou can watch the memorial service here:", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "At the age of 6, Nicole Johnson, Maya\u2019s great granddaughter, declared that \u201cpeople don\u2019t love my great grandmother because she is famous.\nMaya Angelou\u2019s life and legacy were celebrated on Saturday, June 7, in Wait Chapel at Wake Forest University.\nHe was \u201cstruck dumb.\u201d Much of Maya\u2019s legacy stems from this book\u2013a coming-of-age story that chronicles her rise from trauma in a culture of racism and misogyny to self-empowerment and a new identity.\nBill Clinton spoke of how he discovered Maya in law school through her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\nA North Carolinian, she passed away on May 28 in her home in Winston-Salem at the age of 86."}
