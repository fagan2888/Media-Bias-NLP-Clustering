I work full-time but we couldn't afford the group rates so we purchased a private plan through Rocky Mountain Health Plans.\n\nOur original plan was canceled. We were recently informed that our monthly health insurance premiums would increase from $627 to $1,350 in order to keep similar coverage. The increase is due to both adding a child and ACA requirements, but our plan without the third child would be $1,147.\n\nSo we signed up for the exchange and looked over plans. We were told we didn't qualify for any subsidies.\n\nThe only affordable plans through the Colorado exchange are with Kaiser, which would not allow us to keep our family doctors. The plans with low enough premiums have very high deductibles and minimal coverage.\n\nWe recognize the need for reform, and we are certainly glad that many families previously unable to obtain coverage will now be covered. However, we're in a group that's in a tough situation where all of a sudden we're not able to afford really quality health coverage. That's kind of a first for us. We're still scrambling to find some coverage that works for our family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many Americans with individual health insurance policies are getting termination notices.
