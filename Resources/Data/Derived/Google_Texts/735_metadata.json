Members of the 3-million-strong union who support Clinton\u2019s main rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have already protested the move, just as Sanders supporters from the American Federation of Teachers did when Clinton secured that union's endorsement in July.\n\n\"Clinton is a strong leader who will do what is best for America\u2019s students. For more than four decades, Clinton has fought to make sure all children have a fair opportunity to succeed regardless of their ZIP code,\" said Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the NEA, in a statement. \"Clinton will continue to advocate on behalf of students, educators and working families because she understands the road to a stronger U.S. economy starts in America\u2019s public schools.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Huffington Post, Garc\u00eda said that Clinton personally came and spoke to the organization's 175-person board of directors in a session that \"blew them away\" because of Clinton's understanding of what a president would have to do on certain education issues.\n\n\u201cAs a lifelong fighter for children and families, I am deeply honored to have earned the endorsement of the National Education Association and their nearly 3 million members,\" Clinton said in a statement after the endorsement was announced.\n\nThe NEA\u2019s campaign arm had said that it believed Clinton was the candidate best positioned to win in the general election next year. But both Clinton and Sanders had received \u201cA\u201d ratings on the group\u2019s congressional legislative scorecard.\n\nDespite not earning the endorsement of the national union, Sanders issued a statement on Saturday thanking the members who did support him.\n\n\u201cI am proud to have the support of many hundreds of thousands of members of the National Education Association and trade unionists all across America. We are going to win this nomination and the general election because of support from grassroots Americans. We are on track to do just that.\u201d\n\nThe NEA\u2019s early endorsement of Clinton is out of step with its 2008 process, when it waited to endorse President Barack Obama until after he had secured his party\u2019s nomination. Sanders supporters within the ranks of other unions that have endorsed Clinton have expressed frustration and anger that their respective unions decided to endorse in the primary at all.\n\nGarc\u00eda said that the decision not to get involved in the 2008 primary was a factor in the union's decision to back a candidate in the primary race this time around.\n\n\"People did talk about that. Were we there to impact the debate? Were we there to influence the candidates?\" she asked. \"I think what won the day on when [is that] people said, 'You know, if you don't get in when it counts, it doesn't count when you get in.'\"\n\nBut some of the NEA\u2019s state chapters hadn\u2019t waited until the national body made its decision. The Vermont NEA endorsed Sanders, while the New Hampshire chapter picked Clinton in September. Other chapters had urged the national board to wait longer before making an endorsement.\n\nBut the NEA chose Clinton, Garc\u00eda said, because she was the candidate who the union felt would be best able to highlight education issues in the presidential race.\n\n\"It was never a discussion about who's for education who's against education. People are gonna make up their own minds we get that, we understand that, we respect that,\" she said.\n\nThe NEA\u2019s interests include ending competitive block grant programs supported by Obama like \u201cRace to the Top,\u201d and scaling back federally mandated \u201chigh-stakes\u201d standardized testing that influences administrative decisions about teachers. Members of the Democratic Party have been divided over the merits of changes in public education, including more funding for charter schools and teacher evaluation systems influenced by standardized test scores.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just dead wrong to make teachers the scapegoats for all of society\u2019s problems,\u201d Clinton told the AFT earlier this year, according to The Washington Post. \u201cWhere I come from, teachers are the solution. And I strongly believe that unions are part of the solution, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the union members aren't that happy with the endorsement.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-10-04 15:06:18 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Some of the union members aren't that happy with the endorsement.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Earns Backing Of Nation's Largest Union", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-nea-endorsement_us_56101a93e4b0af3706e10eb5", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56101b391800002e00dc1168.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some of the union members aren't that happy with the endorsement.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Earns Backing Of Nation's Largest Union", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56101b391800002e00dc1168.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@SamLachman,@srl", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-03 15:06:18 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56101a93e4b0af3706e10eb5", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "hillary clinton nea,national education association,national education association endorsements,hillary clinton union endorsements, hillary clinton 2016,bernie sanders hillary clinton", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "hillary clinton nea,national education association,national education association endorsements,hillary clinton union endorsements, hillary clinton 2016,bernie sanders hillary clinton", "published_time": "2015-10-03 15:06:18 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-10-05 11:00:10 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- The National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest union, endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Saturday.\nDespite not earning the endorsement of the national union, Sanders issued a statement on Saturday thanking the members who did support him.\nBut both Clinton and Sanders had received \u201cA\u201d ratings on the group\u2019s congressional legislative scorecard.\n\u201cI am proud to have the support of many hundreds of thousands of members of the National Education Association and trade unionists all across America.\nThe NEA\u2019s campaign arm had said that it believed Clinton was the candidate best positioned to win in the general election next year."}
