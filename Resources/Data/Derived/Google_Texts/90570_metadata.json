Some are required by the Affordable Care Act and other recent federal laws, as well as the president\u2019s executive order directing agencies to simplify regulations and minimize the costs of compliance.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s measures set high standards for quality and safety in nursing homes and long-term care facilities,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. \u201cWhen a family makes the decision for a loved one to be placed in a nursing home or long-term care facility, they need to know that their loved one\u2019s health and safety are priorities.\u201d\n\nOfficials announced the update as the White House Conference on Aging convenes Monday. The once-a-decade conclave sets the agenda for meeting the diverse needs of older Americans, including long-term care options. This month also marks the 50th anniversary of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which cover almost 125 million older, disabled or low-income Americans. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries make up the majority of residents in the country\u2019s more than 15,000 long-term care facilities.\n\n\u201cThe existing regulations don\u2019t even conceive of electronic communications the way they exist today,\u201d said Dr. Shari Ling, Medicare\u2019s deputy chief medical officer. \u201cAlso there have been significant advances in the science and delivery of health care that just weren\u2019t imagined at the time the rules were originally written. For example, the risks of anti-psychotic medications and overuse of antibiotics are now clearly known, when previously they were thought to be harmless.\u201c\n\nThe proposed regulations include a section on electronic health records and measures to better ensure that patients or their families are involved in care planning and in the discharge process. The rules also would strengthen infection control, minimize the use of antibiotic and antipsychotic drugs and reduce hospital readmissions.\n\nRevised rules would also promote more individualized care and help make nursing homes feel more like home. For example, facilities would be required to provide \u201csuitable and nourishing alternative meals and snacks for residents who want to eat at non-traditional times or outside of scheduled meal times.\u201d\n\nResidents should also be able to choose their roommates. \u201cNursing facilities not only provide medical care, but may also serve as a resident\u2019s home,\u201d the proposed rules say. \u201cOur proposed provision would provide for a rooming arrangement that could include a same-sex couple, siblings, other relatives, long term friends or any other combination\u201d as long as nursing home administrators \u201ccan reasonably accommodate the arrangement.\u201d\n\nConsumer advocates are likely to be disappointed that officials are not including recommendations to set a federal nurse-to-resident ratio.\n\nHowever, the proposed changes would require that nurses be trained in dementia care and preventing elder abuse to better meet residents\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the focus should be on the skill sets and specific competencies of assigned staff,\u201d officials wrote in the proposed rules, \u201cto provide the nursing care a resident needs rather than a static number of staff or hours of nursing care that does not consider resident characteristics.\u201d\n\nNursing homes will be required to report staffing levels, which Medicare officials said they will review for adequacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a competency approach that goes beyond a game of numbers,\u201d said Ling. \u201cIf residents appear agitated, figure out why, get at the cause of the problem,\u201d she said, instead of resorting to drugs to sedate residents.\n\nAdvocates for nursing home residents argue that because of inadequate staffing, residents with dementia are often inappropriately given antipsychotic drugs, even though that can be dangerous for them. The new rules would help control the use of these drugs by requiring the facility\u2019s pharmacist to monitor drugs that are prescribed for excessive periods of time or other irregularities and require the resident\u2019s physician to address the problem or explain in the resident\u2019s medical record why the medication is necessary.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough nursing staff,\u201d Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, said before the rules were released. Federal law requires only one registered nurse on the day shift for a 20-bed facility or a 500-bed facility, licensed practical nurses around the clock and sufficient staff to meet residents\u2019 needs, she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at the specific staffing positions per se,\u201d said Greg Crist, a spokesman for the American Health Care Association, which represents 11,000 skilled nursing facilities. \u201cWe look at the needs of the individuals when determining staff levels, and that is best addressed in the resident\u2019s care plan.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are also no provisions addressing enforcement in the proposed rule, Ling said it \u201cwill permit detection of violations to enable enforcement by lessening the noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is that the rules we have now are not enforced,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cWe have a very weak and timid enforcement system that does everything it can to cajole facilities into compliance instead of imposing penalties for noncompliance.\u201d\n\nA report by the Center for Medicare Advocacy last year found that some serious violations often were not penalized.\n\n\u201cOnce the new rules are finalized, they will be added to the items nursing home inspectors check,\u201d Ling said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After nearly 30 years, the Obama administration wants to modernize the rules nursing homes must follow to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid payments.", "pubdate": 20150713, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "After nearly 30 years, the Obama administration wants to modernize the rules nursing homes must follow to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid payments.", "title": "Officials propose new rules for nursing home care", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-180694353.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/officials-propose-new-rules-nursing-home-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "After nearly 30 years, the Obama administration wants to modernize the rules nursing homes must follow to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid payments.", "title": "Officials propose new rules for nursing home care", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-180694353.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "medicare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, long-term care, medicaid, medicare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08ba\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNursing facilities not only provide medical care, but may also serve as a resident\u2019s home,\u201d the proposed rules say.\n\u201cToday\u2019s measures set high standards for quality and safety in nursing homes and long-term care facilities,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M.
