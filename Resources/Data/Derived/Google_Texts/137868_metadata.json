(Photo: Provided photo.)\n\nIn the age of giant conglomerates, Obamacare and e-medicine, Dr. James Pike still believes in taking a personal approach to health care.\n\nPike recently relocated Pike Medical Consultants from a northwest side business park to a former Walgreens at 79th Street and Michigan Road.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay in Pike Township not only because it\u2019s where I live, but because it\u2019s among the most medically underserved in Marion County,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to convert an abandoned building into a thriving medical facility.\u201d\n\nPike says his focus is twofold \u2014 to provide excellent care at a reasonable cost. Because his practice is an independent entity, Pike and his associates are able to deliver a variety of services to a wide range of patients from a centralized setting.\n\n\u201cWe have an urgent-care clinic, primary care, occupational health, weight care, X-rays and bone-density scans all under one roof,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother factor that makes us unique is we offer an element of transparency; most costs for our services are published on our website.\u201d\n\nAfter completing medical school on a health professional scholarship through the U.S. Army, Pike was an active-duty physician from 1984 until 1994, leaving the Medical Corps with the rank of major. He returned to Indianapolis, and in 2007, founded Pike Medical Consultants with his wife, Jan, a respiratory therapist.\n\n\u201cWe want to continue to grow UrgentCare Indy and WeightCare Indy, which we just launched in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal, to offer services that will help improve the lives of our patients.\u201d\n\nQuestion: What\u2019s been the most surprising thing you\u2019ve learned in your career?\n\nAnswer: \u201cLength of life and quality of life aren\u2019t synonymous. As patients age, they deal well with their sense of mortality, but often, their children do not. However, as we age, health-care decisions often are driven by children, who want their parents to live as long as possible and may want medical procedures that don\u2019t help improve quality of life. There has to be a balance between medical treatment to improve quality of life versus medical treatment that simply prolongs life.\u201d\n\nQ: Do you have a professional philosophy you try to follow?\n\nA: \u201cWhen we established Pike Medical, our goal was to establish a faith-based organization focused on caring for all people. We adhere to three basic principles: compassion, devotion and respect. It\u2019s how we treat our patients, our employers we work with, and how we treat each other.\u201d\n\nQ: What does being a leader mean to you?\n\nA: \u201cI truly believe that if you love developing and caring for your employees, they will respond with a greater sense of loyalty and work harder for you. I always wanted to create an organization that had a sense of co-ownership. As a leader, I believe I\u2019m working to not only treat my patients, but to serve my employees. My staff sees that my wife and I are here after hours, rolling up our sleeves and working alongside them.\u201d\n\nQ: What\u2019s the best piece of career advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nA: \u201cMy mentor, Dr. Raymon Dunkin, said to me that most people go to work every day with the intention of doing a good job, but then something goes amiss. When that happens, we\u2019re obligated to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019ve carried that with me throughout my career, whether I\u2019m working with patients, sitting on an advisory board or dealing with employee issues.\u201d\n\nQ: What are you most proud of accomplishing so far?\n\nA: \u201cCreating this practice. Jan and I love what we do. And, I\u2019m passionate about mentoring young adults, pre-med students and kids graduating from high school. I was especially proud when the Marian College of Osteopathic Medicine opened; I serve as the chair for the dean\u2019s advisory committee, and that\u2019s a really neat thing to be a part of. I love being able to lecture a couple of times a year. I find it a real accomplishment to know the lives I\u2019ve been able to touch through mentoring.\u201d\n\nMore about Dr. James Pike\n\nJob title: Owner and chief medical officer, Pike Medical Consultants.\n\nEducation: Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences; completed training in pulmonary and critical care medicine as part of the U.S. Army Medical Corp.
