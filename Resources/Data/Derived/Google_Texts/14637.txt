Two days after helping the U.S. pull away for a victory over Turkey in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried, again, had a big day as the Americans routed New Zealand, 98-71.

Faried posted a double-double of 15 points and 11 rebounds, with one steal and one block in the latest U.S. victory. Anthony Davis led the team with 21 points and nine rebounds in the win, which extended the Americans’ record in the tournament to 3-0 and puts them atop the Group C standings.

Faried’s is averaging 14.3 points on 80.8 percent and a team-high 8.3 rebounds per game over three matches in the tournament.
