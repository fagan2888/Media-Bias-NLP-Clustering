But it turns out Deen is firmly in the leave-everybody-alone camp on a bunch of issues:\n\nDeen has long been an outspoken activist against condom laws, and like many in the adult-film community, he grounds his rationale in an aggressive interpretation of First Amendment rights. \u201cI believe in freedom of speech,\u201d he says, arguing that mandating condoms and mandating testing, as the heterosexual porn industry does, \u201cboth moderate what you\u2019re doing with your genitals\u201d and, therefore, are \u201cequivalent to violating performers\u2019 civil rights.\u201d But Deen doesn\u2019t just want the government to stay out of his pants; he wants it to stay out, period. When I mention he\u2019s good at texting and holding eye contact, he launches into an unexpected tirade against texting and driving laws. \u201cWe live in a terrorist country. I text and drive looking over my shoulder, not because I think it is morally wrong. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to get in trouble,\u201d Deen says.\n\nThat doesn't make Deen a fan of Rand Paul, however. When Shire asked whether the libertarian-leaning Republican would get his vote, Deen said no: \"I don\u2019t vote for absurd people.\"\n\nShire, however, called Deen absurd for voicing strong opposition to \"Yes Means Yes\" affirmative consent laws. Here's what he said:\n\n\"That is the dumbest fucking law I\u2019ve ever heard of. We already have a law against rape. Just don\u2019t fucking rape people,\u201d he says, in full-on rant mode. \u201cMy mom tried to persuade me on it and told me about the coverups on college campuses,\u201d he explains. But in typical libertarian fashion, he doesn\u2019t think legislation is the answer. \u201cWe can\u2019t throw a law at it and think it\u2019s going to solve it.\u201d\n\nI'm with Deen. Mandating what drunk college students should say to each other before they have sex isn't going to make rape any less prevalent. It will, however, produce more lawsuits, as college administrators struggle to navigate the contradictions of federal anti-rape requirements and established due process.\n\nIn any case, he seems like a cool live-and-let-live kind of guy. He studiously refused to trash either Lindsay Lohan or Farrah Abraham\u2014even though Lohan was reportedly rude to him on the set of The Canyons and Abraham tried to trick people into thinking they were dating\u2014and declined to name the reporter who allegedly slept with him.\n\nShire concludes her interview by suggesting that he could run for office. Hey, that's not the worst idea. As long as the American people are going to be fucked over by the government, we might as well elect someone who knows what he's doing.\n\nReason TV has more on condom laws in the video below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "On Rand Paul: 'I don't vote for absurd people.'", "title": "Porn Star James Deen Is a Raging Libertarian, Hates Affirmative Consent", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/11/12/porn-star-james-deen-is-a-raging-liberta", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1415818519317.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "James Deen is a \"raging, hard-core libertarian.\"\nThat's according to The Daily Beast's Emily Shire, who\n\ninterviewed the most famous man in the porn industry about his\nviews on policy, Rand Paul, and affirmative consent.\nReason readers already know Deen to be a foe of California's\nnanny-state condom laws.
