And, while the theological complaints seem laughable for their rancor and predictability, it\u2019s time we thought harder about what they represent, because the Christian right\u2019s \u201cCosmos\u201d agita actually indicates a far deeper problem in religious conservatism \u2014 the selective acceptance of Enlightenment values. Religious conservatives have selectively adopted the legacy of liberal Enlightenment, from free speech to science, and jettisoned it when it does not suit their narrow ideological aims.\n\nThere is a nasty tendency for those arguing for their case to adopt a stance of enlightened empiricism on one issue to devolve into empirical nihilism on another. There is also the habit of shifting from a high praise of liberal values on one issue to utter contempt on another. Of course, our various liberal values will come into conflict frequently and must be weighed, but we must be disturbed at how quickly some, particularly on the religious right, are willing to twist these traditions for their own gain.\n\nThe odd conflict of science and religion has come to define modern religious fundamentalism. While most religious people happily accept scientific theories about gravity, claims about the age of Earth are subject to a strange scrutiny by those who believe that the literary creation narratives in the Bible describe actual events.\n\nThe scientific consensus about global warming must be untrue, because, as Dr. Innes writes in \u201cLeft, Right and Christ,\u201d the world is \u201cnot a glass ornament that we might accidentally destroy \u2026 we are not capable of destroying it, whether by nuclear weapons or carbon emissions.\u201d Young earth creationism is the ultimate attempt to both accept modern science, but also to deny it. Fundamentalists like Ken Ham argue that the world and laws we currently observe simply bear no resemblance to the past.\n\nIn truth, we cannot get fundamentalism without the scientific revolution. Fundamentalism does not exist independently, but rather defines itself in relationship to post-Enlightenment values. It is the odd melding of science and religion that creates fundamentalism \u2014 the belief that the Bible is ultimately both a scientific and religious text. Fundamentalists, like the conspiracy theorists they resemble, will build up reams of evidence creating the case for something that can be disproven with a simple logical proposition. Few thinkers have built such an impressive edifice of logic and evidence upon such a thin foundation of speculation.\n\nDinesh D\u2019Souza, for instance, has taken to using science as proof of religion \u2014 he argues, rather absurdly, that the Bible\u2019s explanation of the origins of the universe predates modern science. In his speech at Intelligence Squared, he claims:\n\nWhen the discovery of the big bang came \u2014 this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science \u2014 so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning. Why? because, in a way, it wasn\u2019t just that matter had a beginning, but space and time also had a beginning. In other words, this was something that the ancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago and without conducting a single scientific experiment. By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies. Other ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, \u201cNo, first there was nothing, and then there was a universe.\u201d\n\nBut this rhetorical flourish is a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of the creation narrative, and religion in general. Religion, ultimately, aims at truths deeper than science and trying to apply religious reasoning to the natural world is absurd. Augustine warned as much, telling Christians in \u201cDe Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim\u201d to avoid, \u201ctalking nonsense on these topics.\u201d\n\nMore worryingly, the idea that a rather tenuous reading of a literary work holds the same weight as centuries of scientific evidence is more than a little absurd. D\u2019Souza is trying to selectively apply science, but without its foundation \u2014 empirical, testable, repeatable propositions.\n\nWe see here the fundamentalist flaw: a mass of rhetoric, reason and evidence built on the utterly insane proposition that the Old Testament is meant to be a scientific account of the origins of the universe.\n\nThe reason any somewhat knowledgeable Christian is frustrated by these debates is that they simply pit one fundamentalist against another. One tries to use science to disprove religion, the other to prove it \u2014 both apparently unaware that belief is something that cannot be \u201cproven.\u201d That\u2019s the entire point! Too often, religious excursions into science resemble the thinking of the suicidal people described by Anne Sexton, \u201cThey ask only what tool, they never ask why build?\u201d Fundamentalism at its core is the misunderstanding of the proper relationship between science and religion \u2014 one practiced just as frequently by atheists as Christians.\n\nAnother form of this trend is the co-option of liberal values. The religious right cannot generally be found decrying freedom of speech or freedom of religion, instead they make a selective application of these values \u2014 much the way they\u2019ll talk science when you question nuclear power but deny a consensus about evolution or global warming on entirely spurious grounds.\n\nOne recent example of this illiberalism was the quickness with which Catholics decried a \u201cBlack Mass\u201d at Harvard. The \u201cBlack Mass\u201d is merely a satanic parody of the Catholic mass \u2014 which, while it may be offensive to some Catholics, is totally harmless in practice. Of course, the idea of Catholics demanding special privileges is not rare, but to be expected; one wonders if Satanist child abusers could claim that their church would deal with the matter internally.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The real reason conservatives are freaking out about Neil deGrasse Tyson: He's laying bare their worst hypocrisies", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson vs. the right: \u201cCosmos,\u201d Christians, and the battle for American science", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The real reason conservatives are freaking out about Neil deGrasse Tyson: He's laying bare their worst hypocrisies", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson vs. the right: \u201cCosmos,\u201d Christians, and the battle for American science", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/26/neil_degrasse_tyson_vs_the_right_cosmos_christians_and_the_battle_for_american_science/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/degrasse_tyson_limbaugh.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The real reason conservatives are freaking out about Neil deGrasse Tyson: He's laying bare their worst hypocrisies", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson vs. the right: \u201cCosmos,\u201d Christians, and the battle for American science", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/degrasse_tyson_limbaugh.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Christian Fundamentalism, Conservatism, cosmos, Neil degrasse Tyson, Religion, Religious Right, Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaee0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Christian Fundamentalism, Conservatism, cosmos, Neil degrasse Tyson, Religion, Religious Right, Science, Innovation News, News, Politics NewsThe religious right has been freaking out about Neil deGrasse Tyson\u2019s \u201cCosmos\u201d for what feels like an eternity.\nThe odd conflict of science and religion has come to define modern religious fundamentalism.\nReligion, ultimately, aims at truths deeper than science and trying to apply religious reasoning to the natural world is absurd.\nIt is the odd melding of science and religion that creates fundamentalism \u2014 the belief that the Bible is ultimately both a scientific and religious text.\nThere is also the habit of shifting from a high praise of liberal values on one issue to utter contempt on another."}
