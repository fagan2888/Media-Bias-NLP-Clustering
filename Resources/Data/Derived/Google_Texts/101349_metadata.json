Also, there is a steady increase of doctors retiring due to age, health care reform [or] reduction in reimbursable expenses, or just getting out of the business. If they can't sell their practice, then they just shut down and liquidate everything.\n\nLeaders saw an opportunity with the new division to provide furniture and equipment to health care organizations that may not have the financial means to purchase new items.\n\nChanges resulting from the Affordable Care Act are also prompting health care providers to look for ways to make their organizations lean and streamline costs, he said.\n\n\"Customer demand has driven our product and service expansion,\" Jerman said. \"When customers tell us their needs, we evaluate our expertise and if there is a viable business model. Our medical clients who were buying new and used office furniture started asking for refurbished medical furniture and equipment.\"\n\nCustomers can find clinical furniture items such as refurbished hospital beds and stretchers. Some specialized beds that sell for as much as $50,000 are available refurbished for $15,000.\n\nOFW+Med also has access to other items, including wheelchairs and surgical lighting systems for operating and procedure rooms.\n\nSupporting services include installation, space planning, furniture reconfiguration, touch-up, cleaning, reupholstery and hospital bed circuit board repair.\n\nOFW+Med currently has a large inventory of preowned Ritter exam tables in as-is condition for $750, or $900\u2013$1,000 with a reupholstered tabletop. Jerman said a new Ritter exam table retails for $3,000\u2013$4,000.\n\n\"Our program to reupholster existing exam tables and waiting room furniture is allowing and reducing the need to buy more expensive new furniture,\" he also said.\n\nAnd the new division has helped Office Furniture Warehouse create an additional stream of revenue. Jerman said the company has seen growth in revenue from this division.\n\nOFW+Med also kept the environment in mind with this new business model.\n\n\"Medical furniture and equipment that was disposed by health care organizations is now deferred from the landfill and put into our refurbishing program to extend its useful life,\" he said. \"A hospital bed alone can weigh 300 pounds up to 600 pounds. Those items take a toll on our landfill.\"\n\nIn 2014, Office Furniture Warehouse redeployed more than 600,000 pounds of used furniture and recycled approximately 20,766 pounds of metal.\n\nJerman said they are also working on an export program to ship these reconditioned beds to foreign countries.\n\nMeg Ferguson graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with two bachelor\u2019s degrees in English: creative writing and communication.
