Pepper Crutcher, Jr.\n\n\n\nThe most obvious point of controversy is that the rule exempts certain insurance plans, but not others, from the insurance tax (or \u201cfee\u201d in ObamaCare lingo) that takes effect next year. That tax will come to $63 per covered person in 2014, $42 per person in 2015, and $26 per person in 2016, after which it is scheduled to end.\n\n\n\nMoreover, when one examines which plans would be exempt under the regulation, it becomes clear that one and only one entity stands to reap huge gains from it: Big Labor.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018We were really scratching our heads about who actually benefits from this,\u2019\u2019 health insurance compliance attorney Ed Fensholt told the Associated Press. \u2018\u2018It certainly isn\u2019t aimed at employers because employers don\u2019t really self-administer their plans.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nMany unions, on the other hand, do. A significant number of union members belong to multiemployer health plans, also called Taft-Hartley plans. \u201cBargained by unions and jointly administered with employers,\u201d explained Labor Notes, such plans \u201ccover members and families not just while they are working intermittently but through periods of unemployment and even during retirement. They provide the same coverage for everyone, regardless of age, family status, or health status.\u201d In other words, they\u2019re a very good deal for union members.\n\n\n\nSince these plans are self-administered, they will be exempt from the ObamaCare insurance tax \u2014 albeit only for two of three years the tax will be in effect \u2014 if the proposed regulation is adopted, saving unions a bundle while leaving non-unionized individuals and employers in the lurch.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the Obama administration is ignoring the plain language of the law he insisted on to deliver another bailout to the union bosses,\u201d Fred Wszolek of the Workforce Fairness Institute told the Washington Examiner. \u201cEither follow the law and tax every insurance plan, or repeal the whole thing, but there\u2019s no legal basis for another expensive favor for big labor.\u201d\n\n\n\nLabor leaders, naturally, are trying to portray the rule\u2019s benefits to unions as simply a happy coincidence.\n\n\u2018\u2018It applies to self-administered funds, whether they are Taft-Hartley or not,\u2019\u2019 AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka told reporters.\n\n\n\nOf course, as Fensholt pointed out, employers generally farm out the administration of their health plans to third parties. Only among unions is the practice of self-administration widespread.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, noted Kaiser Health News, \u201celiminating the reinsurance fee was one of several resolutions adopted at the AFL-CIO\u2019s September convention, along with giving union plans access to ACA [Affordable Care Act] tax credits for lower-income members.\u201d While the Obama administration rejected the latter request, it appears poised to grant the former, at least in part \u2014 a wise political move in light of the fact that union members are so opposed to many of ObamaCare\u2019s provisions that the president, according to Forbes, \u201cpersonally intervened to prevent\u201d the AFL-CIO from passing a resolution demanding full repeal of the healthcare law.\n\n\n\nThe insurance tax, which is expected to raise $25 billion over the next three years, is supposed to help offset insurers\u2019 costs of covering the many individuals with pre-existing conditions they will now be forced to cover. Both unions and large businesses have argued that it is unfair to impose this tax on them when they will derive no benefit from it: Their plans already cover people with pre-existing conditions, and only insurance companies can receive the subsidy funded by the tax. Yet only unions, by and large, will be exempted from the tax under the proposed rule.\n\n\n\nThat inequity is not sitting well with businesses, the AP reported:\n\nGretchen Young, senior vice president for health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a group that represents large employers on benefits issues, said it would be \u2018\u2018very unfair\u2019\u2019 to single out one group of employers who are contributing money and not let everybody out of it.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018All self-funded plans are in the same position of having to pay this three-year fee but getting no direct benefit in return,\u2019\u2019 Young said.\n\n\n\nShe said hardly any employers in her group, which includes the nation\u2019s largest corporations, would benefit under the administration\u2019s language.\n\nCongressional Republicans are also unhappy with the proposal. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) tried to negotiate a similar union exemption during last month\u2019s budget negotiations but failed in the face of GOP opposition. The previous month, 21 Republican senators, led by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget director Sylvia Burwell urging her \u201cnot to authorize the release of any regulations that will create a special carve-out that benefits union workers at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt certainly looks like the Obama administration is looking at a special deal for unions, which is deeply concerning given the problems that all Americans are facing due to ObamaCare,\u201d Hatch told the AP after the rule proposal became public.\n\n\n\nShould the rule be finalized as described, it will be just the latest in a long line of regulatory exemptions for favored groups. \u201cAt this point,\u201d observed TownHall.com\u2019s Katie Pavlich,\n\nCongress has granted themselves an Obamacare waiver. The Obama administration has granted corporations and businesses an Obamacare waiver until 2015 by delaying the employer mandate. The average American citizen however, of whom millions are losing health insurance plans President Obama promised they could keep, is still required to comply with all aspects of the law and the individual mandate. And yes, this is still a requirement for individuals even with a broken and nonworking Obamacare website.\n\nAs unions and big businesses have learned, it pays to have friends in high places. And as the rest of us are learning, those without such pals do the paying.\n\nPhoto is of President Obama and Democrats cheering the passage of ObamaCare", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, unions, health insurance tax, exemption", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/16924-obama-admin-poised-to-exempt-unions-from-obamacare-tax", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/ebf7985535e5422f7b4ef670ca53b629_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In a recent regulation announcement, the Obama administration quietly let it be known that it plans to exempt labor unions from an ObamaCare tax on health insurance.
