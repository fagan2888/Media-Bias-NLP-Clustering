In the last eight weeks, she\u2019s supported a minimum-wage hike, dumped on Wall Street titans, supported Black Lives Matter and courted African-American women. Now, she\u2019s supporting universal voting registration, granting instant suffrage to all citizens on their 18th birthday, minimal identification necessary. Clinton, who announced the proposal in a speech in Texas on Thursday, went light on the details, including how it would actually happen if, as president, she miraculously got it past Republican vote-fraud hawks in Congress. Politically, though, it\u2019s a nice three-cushion bank shot to pocket Obama coalition voters: To youngs, it\u2019s hassle-free, instant access to the ballot box; to liberals, it\u2019s muscular pushback against the recent wave of Republican-sponsored voter ID laws; and to African-Americans \u2013 the vote she\u2019s arguably got to fight hardest to turn out \u2013 it\u2019s a tacit fence-mending gesture that puts the at-times bitter 2008 campaign further into her past.\n\nCall Me, Reince: The epic 2008 race between President Barack Obama and Clinton aside, black voters have arguably been the Democrats\u2019 most reliable constituency, practically before LBJ\u2019s signature was dry on the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The marriage has been on the rocks through the years, but come election season Democratic candidates show up with some roses and maybe chocolates, and black voters grumble and renew their vows anyway at the polls. The Republicans have made half-hearted attempts to break things up, but black voters have generally decided to stay together for the sake of the children, or something like that. Now, a black minister who preaches in one of South Side Chicago\u2019s toughest neighborhoods \u2013 the place where the first black president cut his political teeth \u2013 is giving the GOP some come-hither looks, inviting them to the \u2018hood for some dinner and maybe a movie. \u201cAfrican-Americans have been loyal to the Democratic Party,\u201d Pastor Corey Brooks tells The Daily Beast. \u201cBut there is a group of African-Americans that feel like the Democratic Party has not been loyal to us.\u201d So far, though, Rand Paul\u2019s been the only taker.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Clinton Wants Automatic Voter Registration", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Also: Rick Perry unveils his country-rap theme song.", "title": "Clinton Wants Automatic Voter Registration", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/06/04/clinton-wants-automatic-voter-registration", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e3/af/df223b0a42eb8f90c4a79ec4f3ae/150604-hillaryclinton-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Also: Rick Perry unveils his country-rap theme song.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Clinton Wants Automatic Voter Registration"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 4, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
