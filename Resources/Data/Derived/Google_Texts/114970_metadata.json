The suspects were booked at Sacramento County Jail.\n\n\u201cInside the house, officers found a large quantity of a GHB substitute drug disguised as, and sold under the guise of a massage oil,\u201d Roseville Police Spokeswoman Dee Dee Gunther said in a statement. \u201cThey also found more than $20,000 in cash, firearms, methamphetamine packaged for sale, and other evidence of illegal drug trafficking. Detectives later seized more large quantities of the drug at another related location.\u201d\n\nRoseville Police Lt. Josh Simon, who worked with VNET during its investigation, described the home as \u201ca known drug house.\u201d Simon also stated that Manoff and others arrested are familiar to other local law enforcement departments, especially in terms of alleged regional drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have specific information that he was doing business in Roseville,\u201d Simon said. \u201cHowever, we did have information he was a known drug dealer in the city of Rancho Cordova and in the area.\u201d\n\nGHB busts are considered rare because both the drug and its symptoms are especially difficult to detect.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re testing specifically for it, it can be odorless, tasteless, it looks like water\u2026most people conceal it as a small bottle of water and have it on the front seat of their car,\u201d Simon explained. \u201cAn officer wouldn\u2019t know any better by smelling it or looking at it, unless they specifically test that substance\u2026also, sometimes people would get stopped for being under the influence (of GHB) driving a car and would have some of the similar signs and symptoms for being under the influence of an alcoholic beverage; but unless you specifically test the blood for the elements that are found in GHB, you wouldn\u2019t come up with any type of result.\u201d\n\nSimon continued to say that officers are increasingly aware of the possibility that a DUI suspect may be under the influence of GHB, and are trained to identify further evidence of such cases. He also noted a common misconception that the dug\u2019s moniker, the \u201cdate rape drug,\u201d eludes to its primary use.\n\n\u201cI would say that\u2019s not accurate,\u201d Simon noted. \u201cIt\u2019s considered a party drug. There\u2019s many people that use this, and use it consensually. They call it the date rape drug because there have been cases, not necessarily in our jurisdiction; but there have been cases that gave it that name. Because it is odorless, because it is tasteless, because it\u2019s clear, someone could slip a couple of drops into a person\u2019s drink and they wouldn\u2019t even know what their consuming.\u201d\n\nRoseville's Crime Suppression Unit and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations assisted Roseville's VNET with the operation.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
