Eighty percent rated their financial condition as fair or poor, while four in ten said they had to sell some of their possessions in order to make ends meet.\n\nThey are mostly white (53 percent) or black (23 percent), they are relatively well educated, they at one time earned moderate to middle incomes, and they are more apt to live in the South and West than in the Northeast and Midwest. More than six in ten say they have experienced stress in family relationships and close friendships since losing their jobs. More than half said they would have to postpone their plans for retirement.\n\nRelated: Strong June Jobs Report Masks Woes of Long-Term Unemployed\n\n\n\nPerhaps most disheartening of all, 55 percent are so beaten down that they are convinced that \u201chard work and determination do not guarantee success in America.\u201d\n\nWhile the unemployment rate for the short-term unemployed has returned to pre-recessionary levels, \u201cthe levels of unemployment for workers who remain jobless for more than six month is among the most persistent, negative effects of the Great Recession,\u201d according to the report. As of August, three million Americans \u2013 or nearly one-in-three unemployed workers \u2013 had been unemployed for more than six months. Over two million Americans have been unemployed for more than a year \u2013 and in some cases for much longer than that.\n\nRelated: The Mental Anguish of the Long-term Unemployed\n\nSince the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, roughly 10 million private sector jobs were added back to the economy, including 2.5 million in the past year. The overall unemployment rate steadily dropped from 8.2 percent in March 2013 to 6.1 percent in August \u2013 although that still left nearly 9.6 million workers without jobs.\n\nWhile the percentage of unemployed workers who have been jobless for more than six months has declined from 46 percent in 2010, it is \u201cstill above the 26 percent level experienced in the worst previous recession in 1983 and more than double the pre-recession era,\u201d according to the new report.\n\nThe bottom line for many of these long-term unemployed Americans is bleak. For example:\n\nOne in five workers who lost their jobs during the past five years is still unemployed and looking for work.\n\nNearly half of laid off workers who were fortunate enough to find subsequent work were paid less in their new positions, while one in four said their new job proved to be only temporary.\n\nMore than seven in 10 said they have less in savings and income than they did five years ago.\n\nFifty-five percent say they will need to retire later than planned because of the recession, while five percent said the weak economy forced them into an early retirement.\n\nAbout half said it would take three to ten years for their families to recover financially \u2013 while others say they will never recover.\n\nFinally, only one in five said they received help from a government agency when looking for a job; only 22 percent enrolled in a government-sponsored training program to develop skills for a new job; and 60 percent received no government assistance beyond unemployment benefits.\n\nRelated: The Long-term Unemployed May Finally Get a Break\n\nCarl Van Horn, a professor of public policy at Rutgers and Director of the Heldrich Center, said that the last finding was highly emblematic of the state of mind of many of these long-term unemployed people. Van Horn said that either they were unaware that government assistance was available or they were too embarrassed or ashamed to ask for it.\n\nJust nine percent of the long-term unemployed said they received assistance from a government agency while they were hunting for work, and only four percent said they were enrolled in a government-funded training program.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of self-blame that the unemployed have, and they think it\u2019s their fault,\u201d Van Horn said in an interview on Friday. \u201cThey don\u2019t seek help and they don\u2019t even think it will help. They\u2019re very discouraged people.\u201d\n\nJust barely over half of those who were unemployed in the past five years said they received unemployment benefits at some point, according to the study. What\u2019s more, for almost half of those who did receive unemployment assistance, their benefits ran out before they were able to find work. Sixty-five percent of the long-term unemployed who were laid off between 2009 and 2014 received unemployment insurance benefits. That same percentage said their benefits ran out before they could find another job.\n\nNearly one in five \u2013 or 28 percent of the long-term unemployed \u2013 received food stamps.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of those who were laid off during and after the recession reported that they received no other form of government assistance,\u201d according to the report.\n\nRelated: GOP \u2018Runs Out the Clock\u2019 on Unemployment Insurance\n\nIn summing up the findings of the new survey, which was conducted July 24 through August 3, Van Horn said, \u201cWhile the worst effects of the Great Recession are over for most Americans, the brutal realities of diminished living standards endure for the three million American workers who remain jobless years after they were laid off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese long-term unemployed workers have been left behind to fend for themselves as they struggle to pull their lives back together.\u201d\n\nThe nationwide study of 1,153 Americans who are either short-term unemployed looking for work, long-term unemployed or people who currently hold jobs was conducted by researchers Van Horn, Cliff Zukin and Allison Kopicki of Rutgers\u2019 John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development. The research center is devoted to strengthening the nation\u2019s workforce during a time of global economic change.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A dismal picture of a highly troubled and disaffected slice of U.S.", "title": "Many Long-Term Unemployed Still Reeling from Recession", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/22/Many-Long-Term-Unemployed-Still-Reeling-Recession", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072012_unemployment_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/22/Many-Long-Term-Unemployed-Still-Reeling-Recession", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02072012_unemployment_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A dismal picture of a highly troubled and disaffected slice of U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f28\"", "article_summary": "As of August, three million Americans \u2013 or nearly one-in-three unemployed workers \u2013 had been unemployed for more than six months.\nNearly one in five \u2013 or 28 percent of the long-term unemployed \u2013 received food stamps.\nThe bottom line for many of these long-term unemployed Americans is bleak.\nSixty-five percent of the long-term unemployed who were laid off between 2009 and 2014 received unemployment insurance benefits.\nA dismal picture of a highly troubled and disaffected slice of U.S. society emerged on Monday in a detailed study of long-term unemployed Americans conducted by researchers at Rutgers University."}
