Anyone previously enrolled through the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector and who does not re-enroll will be not be insured.\n\n\u201cEveryone registered under the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector over the past two years needs to reapply or they won\u2019t be covered,\u201d said Dahlinger. \u201cI don\u2019t think they know that.\u201d\n\nIn addition to West Hawai\u2019i Community Health Center, the Arc of Hilo, Bay Clinic Hilo, Hamakua Health Center, Hawai\u2019i Island HIV/AIDS Foundation, Hawai\u2019i Island Workforce & Economic Development Ohana, Kalanihale, Project Vision Hawai\u2019i, are among kokua locations on the Big Island. A variety of insurance agents are also available to help.\n\nTo find contact information for the assistance sites, visit the previous Hawai\u2019i Health Connector website, where a list of resources remains active.\n\nEnrollment events for enrollment in a group setting are also scheduled prior to the deadline.\n\nIndividuals who miss the Sunday deadline will be unable to get health insurance through the marketplace until January 2017 unless they fall under a special category.\n\nIndividuals and families can enroll either online through the portal or by calling (800) 318-2596 by 10 p.m. on Jan. 31.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "Anyone previously enrolled who does not re-enroll will be not be insured.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2016/01/27/jan-31-deadline-to-enroll-for-2016-healthcare-coverage/", "type": "article", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/health.jpg", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  Jan. 31 Deadline to Enroll for 2016 Healthcare Coverage", "title": "Big Island Now: Jan. 31 Deadline to Enroll for 2016 Healthcare Coverage"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "theme-color": "#57ace2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "big island now,hawaii,health insurance,healthcare.gov,big island news,hawaii news,business,featured articles", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTEven those who previously enrolled via the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector in 2015 are required to re-enroll for 2016 through HealthCare.gov.\nAnyone previously enrolled through the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector and who does not re-enroll will be not be insured.\nTo find contact information for the assistance sites, visit the previous Hawai\u2019i Health Connector website, where a list of resources remains active.\nIndividuals who miss the Sunday deadline will be unable to get health insurance through the marketplace until January 2017 unless they fall under a special category.\n\u201cEveryone registered under the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector over the past two years needs to reapply or they won\u2019t be covered,\u201d said Dahlinger."}
