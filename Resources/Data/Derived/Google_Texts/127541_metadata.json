Even the president\u2019s longtime campaign guru, David Axelrod, was critical of the administration\u2019s handling of the issue.\n\n\u201cThis has been shrouded in a little bit of mystery. I don\u2019t quite understand why that is,\u201d Axelrod said in an MSNBC interview this week. He added that if he were at the White House, he would be \u201cvery, very tough on the people who are responsible.\u201d\n\nEven those who support the new healthcare law \u2014 and its promise of providing affordable insurance coverage to millions of Americans \u2014 suggested that aspects of it may need to be postponed unless changes can be put into place quickly. Some were calling on Obama to hold people accountable for the mistakes.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s got to man up here \u2014 get rid of these people,\u201d said Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), who stopped short of calling for the ouster of any specific administration official or contractor but characterized the president\u2019s response to the rollout as \u201cweak.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people like myself who supported the Affordable Care Act, but I\u2019m not oblivious to the fact that this layout has done harm and damage to the brand,\u201d Nolan said.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders also suggested that heads should roll, even while maintaining strong support for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe that somebody should be held accountable,\u201d said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), the No. 4 Democrat in the House.\n\nFor more on this LA Times story, click here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act again came under sharp criticism Wednesday, three weeks into the launch, but this time some of the loudest voices were among top Democrats, including President Obama's closest allies.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "b6228bea1d7671a78a13a75050035f3a"}, "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act again came under sharp criticism Wednesday, three weeks into the launch, but this time some of the loudest voices were among top Democrats,\u2026", "title": "Obama allies join in criticism of health care website", "url": "http://q13fox.com/2013/10/24/obama-allies-join-in-criticism-of-healthcare-website/", "image": "http://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/obama.jpg?w=300", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/obama.jpg?w=240", "site": "@q13fox", "card": "summary", "creator": "@q13fox"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Seattle and Western Washington's source for breaking news, weather, and sports.
