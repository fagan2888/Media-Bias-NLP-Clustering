The first six months of last year showed a nearly 70% increase in reported auto thefts and attempted thefts compared with 2013. After a series of arrests last fall, the rate slowed.\n\nThe department ended with about a 52% increase year-to-year \u2014 from 4,385 in 2013 to 6,657 in 2014.\n\nIt's been difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the jump. Some have argued that a 2010 department policy that requires tougher standards for police pursuits has contributed, but the rules were in place for several years before the spike.\n\n\"Immature teen brains know: Flee from the police...\" Flynn said. \"We don't chase stolen cars if that's all it is, if they haven't committed a violent crime.\"\n\nIn the past 14 months, Milwaukee police arrested 334 juveniles for driving, or riding in, stolen vehicles. Of those, 22% were arrested two or more times in the same period.\n\nTeens driving stolen cars contribute to the city's robbery rates, endanger other motorists and can put teens on the \"fast track to that very mass incarceration everybody's so concerned about,\" Flynn said.\n\n\"If doing felonies as a juvenile nets you nothing at all, neither systems nor services, why should we be surprised that by 19 or 20 you're in grown-up prison for a serious violent crime?\" the chief asked, acknowledging the problem is driven by a small percentage of youthful offenders.\n\nBarrett said he has contacted officials at Milwaukee County Children's Court, the district attorney's office and county juvenile probation \u2014 who are all part of the justice council \u2014 to help ensure there are meaningful consequences when young people steal cars.\n\nSuch collaboration already has led to change. For example, officers now may access some juvenile data and can know immediately whether a teen or child is on probation.\n\nThose conversations also led to a discovery even Flynn found surprising: Under the law, if an officer recognizes a teen driving a stolen car, but the teen drives away, the officer cannot get a juvenile arrest warrant.\n\nBarrett also said it's important for city residents to protect their vehicles. As cold weather hit the area, many cars reported stolen had been warming up in driveways. The SUV involved in the fatal crash was stolen when its owner left the keys in the ignition.\n\n\"There has to be some responsibility for people to recognize that you don't leave your car running out in front of your house,\" Barrett said.\n\nThe Police Department has long tried to warn people of the dangers involved in leaving cars unattended with keys inside, \"thus making them available for purposes of theft or 'joy rides,' which often leads to the commission of crime or serious injury or even death to innocent persons who become the victims of recklessness.\"\n\nThat text came from a department order issued in 1947.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Car thefts by teens illustrate shortfalls in criminal justice system", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/car-thefts-by-teens-illustrate-shortfalls-in-criminal-justice-system-b99453455z1-294532051.html", "image": {"width": 433, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99453102z.1_20150228221312_000_ggpa50ut.1-0.jpg", "height": 496}, "type": "article", "description": "An 18-year-old man accused of killing an elderly couple in a hit-and-run crash while driving a stolen SUV had been caught joy riding in stolen vehicles twice before.", "title": "Car thefts illustrate shortfalls in juvenile justice system"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99453102z.1_20150228221312_000_ggpa50ut.1-0.jpg", "description": "An 18-year-old man accused of killing an elderly couple in a hit-and-run crash while driving a stolen SUV had been caught joy riding in stolen vehicles twice before.", "card": "summary", "title": "Car thefts by teens illustrate shortfalls in criminal justice system"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"We don't chase stolen cars if that's all it is, if they haven't committed a violent crime.\"\nThe first six months of last year showed a nearly 70% increase in reported auto thefts and attempted thefts compared with 2013.\nTeens driving stolen cars contribute to the city's robbery rates, endanger other motorists and can put teens on the \"fast track to that very mass incarceration everybody's so concerned about,\" Flynn said.\n\"Our challenge ... isn't to throw darts at the rest of the system,\" Flynn said Friday.\nAs cold weather hit the area, many cars reported stolen had been warming up in driveways."}
