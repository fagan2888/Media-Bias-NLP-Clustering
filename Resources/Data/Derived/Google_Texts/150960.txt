An annual Cinco de Mayo fundraiser for the Laguna Beach Community Clinic was attended by nearly 200 supporters and raised $85,000 in support of its Women’s Health Programs on Sunday, May 3.

Board president George Heed announced that a $20,000 challenge grant of the board’s pooled gifts had been met quickly in April. He announced a new $25,000 grant from the Dover Family Foundation in memory of Nancy Dover, which runs through June 30.

More than 60% of the patients served at the clinic are women. “That equates to 2,500 women per year, many of whom we will see multiple times during the year,” said Dr. Tom Bent, the clinic’s medical director. “These women are artists, small business owners, part-time workers in local shops and restaurants, child care providers, and students; in other words, we’re caring for the friends and neighbors of our community,”

While the Affordable Care Act has brought greater accessibility to health insurance it hasn’t necessarily increased accessibility to quality medical providers. Still others can’t afford their high deductible. “We’re still working to close this gap,” said nurse Adriana Nieto-Sayegh, clinical director. “Regardless of a patient’s ability to pay, the clinic remains committed to providing everything from walk-in urgent care, to a full spectrum of OB/GYN services, to life saving health screenings,” she said.
