This makes antivirus software an ideal target for hackers.\n\nOne company in particular that the U.S. and U.K. have apparently targeted is Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based security firm behind several major reports exposing government-backed snooping in countries like the U.S. and China.\n\nThe company got specific mention in a GCHQ warrant renewal request from 2008.\n\n\u201cPersonal security products such as the Russian anti-virus software Kaspersky continue to pose a challenge to GCHQ\u2019s CNE [Computer Network Exploitation] capability and [software reverse engineering] is essential in order to be able to exploit such software and to prevent detection of our activities,\u201d the request said. \u201cExamination of Kaspersky and other such products continues.\u201d\n\nSoftware reverse engineering \u2014 essentially breaking down a program to determine how it works \u2014 is commonplace in the software developer community. It can also be used by security researchers to search for previously undiscovered vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to a 2008 NSA document, the U.S. spy agency also had Kaspersky in its crosshairs. NSA researchers planned to intercept the sensitive information that Kaspersky\u2019s software was sending back to the company's servers.\n\nIn a statement, the company denied that this data could be used to hurt its customers.\n\n\u201cThe information is depersonalized and cannot be attributed to a specific user or company,\u201d Kaspersky said. \u201cWe take all possible measures to protect this data from being compromised, for example through strong encryption.\u201d\n\nThe latest revelations come on the heels of Kaspersky announcing it had discovered an advanced attack on its own internal networks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite confident that there\u2019s a nation state behind it,\u201d company co-founder Eugene Kaspersky said in a blog post.\n\nThe company said the attack methods resembled the Stuxnet worm, a virus attributed to the U.S. and Israel that took down a significant portion of Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2009-2010.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "U.S. and British spy agencies have been working together to exploit flaws in the software.", "description": "U.S. and British spy agencies have been working together to exploit flaws in the software.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "U.S. and British spy agencies have been working together to exploit flaws in the software.", "title": "Spies are cracking into antivirus software, Snowden files reveal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/245689-snowden-docs-us-uk-undermining-antivirus-products", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/snowdenedward_040814getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/245689-snowden-docs-us-uk-undermining-antivirus-products", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-22T09:48-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-22T09:48:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/245689-snowden-docs-us-uk-undermining-antivirus-products", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "U.S. and British spy agencies have been working together to exploit flaws in the software.", "card": "summary", "title": "Spies are cracking into antivirus software, Snowden files reveal"}, "dcterms.title": "Spies are cracking into antivirus software, Snowden files reveal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae60\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTMany companies and individuals use antivirus and security software to protect their networks from criminal hackers and government snooping.\nThis makes antivirus software an ideal target for hackers.\n\u201cThe information is depersonalized and cannot be attributed to a specific user or company,\u201d Kaspersky said.\nAmerican and British spy agencies have been working together to exploit flaws in popular antivirus software to conduct surveillance, according to documents published by The Intercept from the cache of government leaker Edward Snowden.\n\u201cPersonal security products such as the Russian anti-virus software Kaspersky continue to pose a challenge to GCHQ\u2019s CNE [Computer Network Exploitation] capability and [software reverse engineering] is essential in order to be able to exploit such software and to prevent detection of our activities,\u201d the request said."}
