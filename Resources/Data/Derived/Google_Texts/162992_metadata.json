And should they be ... taxed like sales?\u201d\n\nIn other words, should something intangible, like a digital video stream, be taxed the same as \u201ctangible personal property,\u201d such as a video disc you buy?\n\nAnd is it fair to tax movies and music when they\u2019re downloaded to a computer for viewing again and again, as some states do, but not when they\u2019re streamed for one-time viewing?\n\nThe answers, so far, have been inconsistent.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you do, there are always going to be issues of tax fairness,\u201d said Robert S. Goldman, a Tallahassee-based tax attorney and one of the main drafters of Florida\u2019s telecommunications tax laws.\n\nAt the center of the issue is the Communications Services Tax, levied in every state and the District of Columbia. In Florida, services that are taxed include \u201cvideo streaming\u201d and \u201ctelevision programming,\u201d according to the Department of Revenue.\n\nService providers may bill and collect a total of 6.8 percent, the department\u2019s website says.\n\nAt the same time, Florida imposes a separate 6 percent use tax \u2013 a levy on something used or consumed here \u2013 for out-of-state purchases from vendors like Amazon.\n\nThe revenue department provides a form that consumers are supposed to fill out to pay this tax. Almost no one does and it is largely unenforceable.\n\nNow, once vendors establish a physical presence inside the state, Florida requires them to begin collecting and remitting sales taxes.\n\nThat\u2019s what Amazon intends to do, with new distribution centers planned for locations that could include south Hillsborough County. The centers would bring as many as 3,000 jobs and as much as $300 million in construction.\n\nGov. Rick Scott has said the company \u201cwill begin collecting Florida sales tax at such time as it is required under current Florida law.\u201d\n\nNetflix \u2013 which accounts for nearly a third of all Internet traffic entering North American homes nightly, according to BusinessWeek \u2013 collects the Communications Services Tax from Florida residents and hands it over to the state.\n\nOne Florida customer\u2019s invoice, for example, shows a 65-cent tax tacked onto his $7.99 monthly subscription fee for streaming service, though it did not specify what the tax was for.\n\nNetflix spokesman Joris Evers said the company \u201csought a ruling from the state tax authorities to clarify exactly what we need to do and are in full compliance with that ruling.\u201d\n\nThe tax does not apply to Internet access, which is not taxed by the federal or state government. But many customers have their Internet access bundled in with cable television, phone service or both, which are subject to the CST.\n\nSo, attorney Goldman explained, even if a customer pays the Communications Services Tax to his phone or cable company, he still pays the additional tax for Netflix because it\u2019s a separate service and transaction.\n\nThe tax applies to other paid video services, like Hulu Plus. Audio streaming also is subject to the tax because it\u2019s included in state law\u2019s definition of communications services. That would include Pandora One, the for-pay version of Pandora, the streaming radio site.\n\nHulu and Pandora did not respond to written questions, nor did Amazon, which offers AmazonPrime, a competing service.\n\nIn 2012-13, the state collected $2.2 billion in Communications Services Tax revenues, according to Department of Revenue spokeswoman Renee Watters.\n\nExcept for tax on direct-to-home satellite, the Communications Services Tax actually has two portions, one state and one local. The state tax is further broken down into the state tax portion and the gross receipts tax portion.\n\nIt gets even more complicated.\n\n\u201cThe local tax portion is comprised of the local tax rate adopted by each jurisdiction and a conversion rate for the discretionary sales surtax, if the county has a discretionary sales surtax tax for sales tax,\u201d Watters said. \u201cEach portion of the CST is distributed separately.\u201d\n\nHillsborough County\u2019s rate, for example, is 4 percent, according to county budget director Tom Fesler.\n\nHere\u2019s where that money goes: The state tax portion goes into general revenue and the gross receipts tax portion goes toward the Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, Fund. That pays for new school buildings and renovations.\n\nAn added wrinkle is that Congress is considering legislation to allow state governments to collect sales and use tax directly from online retailers who don\u2019t have a physical presence \u2014 that is, stores and warehouses \u2014 in a state.\n\nThe Marketplace Fairness Act passed the Senate 69-27 and is now in the House, where it\u2019s facing Tea Party opposition.\n\nIf passed, it would essentially override U.S. Supreme Court rulings, issued in the time of paper catalog and other mail-order sales, which said retailers who don\u2019t have a physical presence in a state don\u2019t need to collect that state\u2019s sales tax on purchases.\n\nThose decisions now apply to Internet purchases. But in Florida, it\u2019s the buyer\u2019s responsibility to pay any tax directly to the state.\n\nThe current system is \u201ctotally unfair to traditional retailers who have a store in Florida,\u201d said TaxWatch\u2019s Wenner, a point long echoed by the retail and small-business lobbies.\n\nBy some estimates, capturing tax on Amazon purchases by Florida residents could net the state about $200 million yearly, said Ritch Workman, chairman of the finance and tax subcommittee in the state House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big chunk, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d said Workman, a Melbourne Republican. \u201cIt solves one small part of the problem.\u201d\n\nFor instance, he mentioned the plethora of goods sold over thousands of virtual storefronts through eBay.com, the online auction and shopping site.\n\nStill other issues loom, attorney Goldman said, including whether to tax \u201csoftware as a service,\u201d referring to programs that reside on the Internet, or \u201ccloud,\u201d but not on your computer or on disks.\n\nUltimately, discussion about tax fairness is \u201cgreat for editorials but there are so many perspectives,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cIt\u2019s like religion.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 02 Sep 2013 15:18:03 -0400", "Description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Floridians are supposed to pay state tax whenever they buy \u201ctangible\u201d things like books and DVDs through Amazon, the online retailer.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Floridians are supposed to pay state tax whenever they buy \u201ctangible\u201d things like books and DVDs through Amazon, the online retailer.", "title": "Taxing online services, products challenges lawmakers", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/taxing-online-services-products-challenges-lawmakers-20130902/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130902/ARTICLE/130909900/AR/0/AR-130909900.jpg", "height": 689}, "updated_time": "2013-09-02T15:18:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Floridians are supposed to pay state tax whenever they buy \u201ctangible\u201d things like books and DVDs through Amazon, the online retailer.", "title": "Taxing online services, products challenges lawmakers", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130902/ARTICLE/130909900/AR/0/AR-130909900.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-09-02T15:18:03Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-09-02T15:18:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The state tax is further broken down into the state tax portion and the gross receipts tax portion.\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Floridians are supposed to pay state tax whenever they buy \u201ctangible\u201d things like books and DVDs through Amazon, the online retailer.\nHere\u2019s where that money goes: The state tax portion goes into general revenue and the gross receipts tax portion goes toward the Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, Fund.\nAt the center of the issue is the Communications Services Tax, levied in every state and the District of Columbia.\nExcept for tax on direct-to-home satellite, the Communications Services Tax actually has two portions, one state and one local."}
