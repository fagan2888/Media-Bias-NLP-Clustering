Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reacted to the Supreme Court’s decision to allow unlimited overall campaign contributions from individuals with a fiery statement Wednesday morning. “Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” Sanders said.

“What world are the five conservative Supreme Court justices living in?” Sanders continued. “To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with ‘freedom of speech’ is totally absurd. The Supreme Court is paving the way toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process.”

In a subsequent tweet, Sanders illustrated his point with an image of the American flag made out of dollar bills and corporate logos:

As the press release that accompanied Sanders’ statement explained, the senator has “proposed a constitutional amendment to overturn that ruling and make clear preventing quid pro quo corruption is not the only reason we should regulate campaign finance.”
