On the one hand, he said, \u201cProvider consolidation has been a rational response to market changes; and you\u2019ve seen the consolidation on the payer side, too. Provider consolidation is rational,\u201d he conceded, \u201cBut then it has in turn been used by providers to drive up prices, and that has led to increased costs.\u201d He argued for a new paradigm, one of continuous collaboration between payers and providers, with healthcare patients/members/consumers as the new center of focus.\n\nIndeed, Ondra told his audience, in the emerging healthcare system, health insurers like the Health Care Service Corporation and its fellow Blues plans and other health plans, are having to shift fundamentally from seeing themselves as \u201cclaims processors\u201d to something new. In that regard, he said, he and his colleagues at Health Care Service Corporation now see their organization as a \u201ccare management company,\u201d a term he stressed in his remarks.\n\nSo where will the common ground of collaboration be? It will be in the form of technology-facilitated partnerships around population health management, care management, and various forms of accountable care, Ondra said. Indeed, he noted, \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward strongly to build alternative payment models in all of our markets. But the idea that what works in rural Montana will work in downtown Chicago is na\u00efve. On the other hand,\u201d he offered, \u201cyou can\u2019t have all one-offs [with regard to wildly customized risk-sharing contracts], either. So we\u2019re bringing a set of solutions and set of capabilities to all our markets. What\u2019s driving this? Purchasers are seeking this,\u201d he emphasized, noting that he was referring both to large corporations like Boeing, and to masses of individuals who are enrolling in high-deductible health plans.\n\nOne important point that Ondra made with regard to stimulating value-based care delivery was around the outcomes quality measures that they\u2019re asking providers to submit. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to a uniform set of quality measures,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe want to reduce the variability, refine the collection capability, and make it all clinically relevant. So we\u2019re working very quickly to try to get to measures that are more relevant to the consumer, and less process-oriented.\u201d\n\nIn that regard, Ondra referenced the fact that he and his colleagues have been developing and refining what he called a \u201ctoolbox for alternative payment,\u201d which includes supports for providers partnering with the Health Care Service Corporation in alternative-payment contracts. He added that \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about our networks differently. The classic Blue network,\u201d he noted, \u201cis big and broad and everyone gets to buy in. That\u2019s not necessarily the way to go. We want narrow networks, which should be high-value and high-quality\u2014and not necessarily low-cost. So we\u2019re looking at redesigning our networks, and this is happening this year. We\u2019re looking at more tailored networks for markets.\u201d\n\nOndra asked, \u201cWhat can we do to facilitate provider success?\u201d His answer? \u201cProvide information, identify and promote technology, develop and use quality measures and cost measures, and focus on the member experience. Right now, we have a healthcare system that\u2019s efficient and convenient for itself. We need to make the system efficient and convenient for consumers.\u201d He reiterated his organization\u2019s commitment to working with providers as true partners going forward, leveraging electronic health records and all other tools available to them, including emerging technologies such as wearables, to refocus the healthcare system with plan members/patients/consumers at its center. And he emphasized that he remains optimistic that the U.S. healthcare system, through intensive work driven by healthcare reform and broader societal trends, can re-vision itself into a system that is of higher quality, better clinical outcomes, more efficient, more cost-effective, and more person-centered, going into the future, and that health plan-provider collaboration will prove to be a core engine helping to drive forward that positive change.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Right now, we have a healthcare system that\u2019s efficient and convenient for itself.\nIn that regard, he said, he and his colleagues at Health Care Service Corporation now see their organization as a \u201ccare management company,\u201d a term he stressed in his remarks.\nIt will be in the form of technology-facilitated partnerships around population health management, care management, and various forms of accountable care, Ondra said.\n\u201cProvide information, identify and promote technology, develop and use quality measures and cost measures, and focus on the member experience.\nIndeed, Ondra told his audience, in the emerging healthcare system, health insurers like the Health Care Service Corporation and its fellow Blues plans and other health plans, are having to shift fundamentally from seeing themselves as \u201cclaims processors\u201d to something new."}
