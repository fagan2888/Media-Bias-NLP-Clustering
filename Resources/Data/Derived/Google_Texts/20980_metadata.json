We asked lots of our favorite authors to tell a story in only two sentences, with just this one rule -- it had to include the word thanks, thankful, Thanksgiving or some variation.\n\n\n\nShe was to have been home hours ago, having snuck from the house wearing only slippersocks to pick up the chestnuts and a jar of bayleaves without moths, leaving twelve relatives (including one from her own loins still teething wildly) all waiting for her to drag that beer-car turkey from the oven, but, coming on five o\u2019clock, she\u2019d landed instead at the Two-Way Inn on Mt. Elliott and was drinking her second Brass Monkey just as one of the regulars, a redheaded guy with a mean squint, came spinning in with a Ritz mock-apple pie on a milk-glass pie stand, for which all the patrons were thankful. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that can\u2019t be explained,\u201d she found herself saying, licking the plastic fork and ignoring her buzzing phone, \u201chow this works.\u201d\n\nMegan Abbott\u2019s novels include \u201cThe Fever,\u201d \u201cDare Me\u201d and \u201cThe End of Everything\u201d\n\n\n\nLast Thanksgiving, Jack, sixteen years old, son of Blue Devil and Jessica, sister to Lucy, with most of his teeth and appetite intact, a fine downy gray fuzz around his snout, miraculous re-bounder from seizures, mini strokes, arthritic hips, vertigo and Lyme disease, died somewhere between the time grandmother\u2019s Staffordshire and sterling was cleared, cleaned, counted, put away, club soda was dabbed upon the lace tablecloth, leftovers pressed into hands, flushed faces kissed goodbye, moth-bitten Pendleton blankets tucked around shoulders of those who had drunk too much, flames in the massive stone fireplace that great grandfather built with his own hands, extinguished, the last slice of pecan pie eaten straight from the tin under the low light of the refrigerator bulb as a fine snow sifted over frozen leaves and the lavender-hued slate patio.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, one fianc\u00e9, one widowed neighbor, and an old college roommate added, one dog less, all together twenty-five gathered around the table, gravy spilled and cranberry smeared and dark was chosen over white, the port was decanted and glasses were raised in Jack\u2019s memory as wishes for Lucy\u2019s longevity were offered and the bowls of potato and stuffing crusted and bellies swelled and buttons unbuttoned and one sister wondered why the other sister was the keeper of their grandmother\u2019s sterling and yet another sister wondered when her parents were going to move to a condo in Florida and leave her this drafty home, a lone pilgrim slid off her chair, disrupting the tower of pillows she had been sitting on in search of a shiny black party shoe beneath the table where instead she found Lucy and forgetting her shoe she curled against the old dog in their lace-walled hideaway, tossing a tiny crooked arm around her back as Lucy rose up on her front paws in greeting and enthusiastically gave thanks as she licked the gravy dried upon the pilgrim\u2019s rosy cherubic cheeks\n\nRobin Antalek is the author of the novels \u201cThe Summer We Fell Apart\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cThe Grown Ups\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cThank You, Anyone\u201d\n\nSo cold everyone must hurry and does \u2014 and I hurry \u2014 and before me in the street something like \u2014 it must be \u2014 a thousand pigeons all the same color \u2014 or it is so cold they seem colorless and shining \u2014 a thousand pigeons rise and wheel in the air and in every pigeon a beak and an eye, and a world also wheeling.\n\nJesse Ball\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cSilence Once Begun\u201d (currently available as a Vintage trade paperback)\n\n\n\nMy great-aunt Madeleine, who looked like a porcelain doll, received as a gift from her husband: a supposedly unbreakable table-top waste-bin. \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d she said, smiling amiably, as she went to fetch a hammer in the kitchen to check that they hadn\u2019t been swindled.\n\nAnne Berest is the co-author of \u201cHow to Be Parisian Wherever You Are: Love, Style, and Bad Habits\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis Fleeting Quality of Everything\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and by the way, thanks!\u201d\n\nShe timed it, virtuosic, so that final note of sarcasm chimed precisely as her car door slammed, seeming to roll into the roar of her engine, to fill the air with fumes, leaving him inhaling the poison and the sentiment, wondering, as she disappeared, when last finality had announced itself so thoroughly, had assaulted so many of his senses all at once; the noise, the smell, the dwindling sight, and the chill of the day on his skin, while he breathed a little rapidly, while he contemplated her exit, which through a certain loose logic (he was still a little drunk) became all exits, and then all ends, became the fact that nothing can last, that life itself \u2013 life most of all \u2013 can never last, that you have to be all right with that fact (as he glanced at the vast and clouded sky) that you have to accept this fleeting quality of everything, and that there\u2019s joy to be found in the acceptance, in a feeling of gratitude for every doomed moment; and that he should start right now with her departure, should let it push him onto this course of embracing that it isn\u2019t in The Great Plan for anything to last; even endings it seemed, even endings didn\u2019t last, her car materializing in his view, a glimmer first, and then, unmistakable, a change of heart, so his musings on finality and endings and mortality, all of that, became only the pretentiousness of drink, unguarded existential elasticity snapped out of its existence by her voice, as she emerged, and slammed the door again, and muttered, walking past him, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\nRobin Black is the author of the novel \u201cLife Drawing\u201d and the story collection \u201cIf I Loved You, I Would Tell You This\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd from Hong Kong he flew home to Pittsburgh for the holiday, knowing Lorelei would be there, newly divorced, beautifully wounded and, at long last, able to reciprocate. In Arrivals, giddy with anticipation, he texted her and a phone, on the lip of the hot tub in Ojai, buzzed with a turkey emoji and the message \u201cHT!!!!!\u201d from an unknown number.\n\nAustin Bunn wrote the film \u201cKill Your Darlings\u201d and is the author of the forthcoming collection \u201cThe Brink\u201d\n\n\n\nSadie, unhappy about the vegans, refused to cook the bird. They can be thankful for green beans, she said, and goddamned margarine pie.\n\nRachel Cantor is the author of the novel \u201cA Highly Unlikely Scenario, or a Neetsa Pizza Employee\u2019s Guide to Saving the World\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLosing The Gown\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a real visitor,\u201d May called after me; she was my night nurse, a middle-aged Chinese woman, kind and eccentric.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I called back, my street clothes too big for my shrinking frame, my boots heavy, as I escaped from the hospital into the crisp, cool November night.\n\nLori Carson is the author of the novel \u201cThe Original 1982\u2033 as well as an acclaimed singer/songwriter and former member of the Golden Palominos\n\n\n\n\u201cStuffing\u201d\n\nAfter the fuss over his mother\u2019s misplaced serving spoon, a sketchy Native American heritage claim from uncle Walt, a bullying life coach session from his sister Gretchen, while his father slithered into the pantry for quick hands of Full Tilt Poker on his phone, Bruce rose from his chair, scooped the half-carved, stuffing-evacuated turkey from its decorative platter, then yanked its empty cavity down snugly over his head like a warm football helmet. His mother\u2019s shriek came muffled through the birdflesh, as briny juices of sausage and sage wept into his eyes, and Bruce\u2019s only wish was that these sad strangers could see how truly thankful he was, now that he was going back to the hospital.\n\nMichael Christie\u2019s debut novel, \u201cIf I Fall, If I Die\u201d is forthcoming from Hogarth.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome On, DJ\u2019s Son!\u201d\n\nMy father is a DJ, a professional DJ, bringer of joy to weddings, proms, celebratory gatherings of all sorts, including our own family gatherings, Thanksgiving, for instance, every Thanksgiving, all sixteen of my Thanksgivings, including this one, he puts on his headphones and spins the tunes, before dinner, during, and after, encouraging my mother, my aunts and uncles and cousins, the weird guy from Israel my uncle knows from work or something and feels obliged to bring to Thanksgiving because the poor guy has nowhere else to go, encouraging all of them to put their hands in the air, etc. from behind his raised turntable, which they do, or at least I\u2019ve been told they do, because I spend Thanksgiving in my bedroom closet, and in fact I\u2019m in there right now, and from the closet, even behind the closed door, I can hear the end of \u201cRich Girl\u201d and I know what\u2019s coming next, know that after \u201cRich Girl\u201d my father always lists, through his microphone, all the things for which he is thankful, including me, his only child, whom he hopes will some Thanksgiving soon, maybe even this one, leave the closet and join them, and maybe I will even take my rightful place behind the turntable, which my father knows that I, deep in my hearts of hearts, really want to do, and he\u2019s right, deep in my heart of hearts, that is exactly what I want to do, and that scares me, which is why I\u2019m in the closet, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thankful for, the closet, and its closed door, although the door is too thin, and through it I can hear everyone and everything from downstairs, including, and especially, my father. \u201cCome on, DJ\u2019s son!\u201d he calls to me, through his microphone.\n\nBrock Clarke is the author of the novels \u201cThe Happiest People in the World,\u201d \u201cExley,\u201d \u201cAn Arsonist\u2019s Guide to Writers\u2019 Homes in New England\u201d and \u201cThe Ordinary White Boy\u201d\n\nShe told herself there was a lot to be thankful for here, in the middle of nothing: the wild rice they\u2019d found which made deer meat taste more festive, the crowded night sky purpled by far off galaxies, the fact that no bear had mauled her family, and that by their wits and skills they were not yet starved to death. Of course, there was also plenty to bemoan: this deer hide smock still stank of dead musk, her only pillow had lost its down and the dried grasses she\u2019d stuffed it with crackled under her head, there was no bedroom to escape to like in the homes of her memory, and she could never shake the feeling that they\u2019d fallen\u2014or at least were dangling\u2014and were once again no different from the animals bedding down close around them as though in search of warmth, comfort or safety in this ugly new world.\n\nDiane Cook is the author of the story collection \u201cMan V. Nature\u201d\n\n\n\nMoments before the first guests arrived, Rebecca stood at the front of the sanctuary \u2014 she didn\u2019t cry. She placed her hand on her daughter\u2019s closed casket, thankful that she finally knew where she was.\n\nJean Love Cush is the author of the novels \u201cEndangered\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cThe Missing\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Missing My Flight Home for the Holidays\u201d\n\nI slept through Thanksgiving, again, because, as I am told, I am \u201cungrateful\u201d (my mother) \u201cnot my daughter\u201d and \u201cno daughter of mine\u201d (my father) and ultimately \u201can ungrateful bitch\u201d (my big brother who hosts at his seaside atrocity) and though I am starving, I say, \u201cPut my nephew on the line,\u201d because he\u2019s the only one I wanted to visit with anyway and when the little tyke props the cellphone that I fear will bloom cancer against his perfect ear and asks what gifts I\u2019m bringing for only him, I say, \u201cPromise you will never grow up to be one of those wolf boys who rides the late-night party train home from boarding school, spikes the Jack and Coke then lies in wait with his sharp teeth as all of the girls (who have yet to learn the sober art of pretending to be drunk) drink that poisoned syrup then stagger and pass out in the train\u2019s observation deck like so many wasted beauties stuffed inside a glass coffin and don\u2019t be the conductor who looks away as the wolf boys have their way with the girls in the coffin and why are there so many glass coffins in fairy tales and why are the princesses always slipping into sweet drug-induced comas only to wake with boys and their goofy not-guilty smiles lording over them and maybe that\u2019s why I can\u2019t wake up in time to catch a flight and why I live so far away from the scene of the crime but understand, dear nephew, I love you best and there is more to me than this cautionary tale and that mostly, I am thriving, until \u2014 out of nowhere \u2014 I\u2019ll be hit by what feels like (I hate to say it) a freight train and am unable to push back against its weight, and tell your father, my brother, that I know he\u2019s sorry he took an earlier train home that day and upset that he\u2019s failed so often to untie me from these tracks,\u201d and before my nephew, the prodigy, who I am told is able to say \u201cThank You\u201d in a 160 different languages, before he can say, \u201cThank you, for my bedtime story,\u201d his mother, my sister-in-law, lifts the phone away from his soft cheek and whispers, \u201cI made the gingerbread men you love so much, the ones with the royal icing,\u201d and I say, \u201cThank you for thinking of me,\u201d and I\u2019m about ready to hang up and close the lid on my glass coffin when she says, \u201cThe funny thing about those observation cars is not how filthy they are in daylight but how, at night, after all of the boys buckled up and went to bed, how the stars above always looked so pretty through those dirty windows.\u201d And reaching out from 1,693 miles away, my sister-in-law hands me a broken gingerbread man and, like a wolf, I lick off all of the icing.\n\nAmber Dermont is the author of the novel \u201cThe Starboard Sea\u201d and of the short story collection \u201cDamage Control\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks, but no thanks,\u201d she said when he passed her his mother\u2019s grey oyster stuffing. She\u2019d had enough of the old woman\u2019s how-tos and what-fors, and with the help of three Dubonnet twists and a class at the Y, had worked up the nerve to sit at the head of her own dining room table.\n\nHelen Ellis is the author of the novel \u201cEating the Cheshire Cat\u201d\n\n\n\nAlice went online looking for a used copy of the first novel she\u2019d ever written \u2014 now out of print. She was thankful to find one for sale, even though it contained a handwritten dedication from her to her uncle in which she\u2019d said things like, \u201cFor Paul, my dear uncle,\u201d and \u201cIt was great to spend Thanksgiving together,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m so touched by your enthusiasm for my novel.\u201d\n\nAmanda Filipacchi\u2019s fourth novel, \u201cThe Unfortunate Importance of Beauty,\u201d is forthcoming from W. W. Norton in February.\n\n\n\nOutside his office door, you, with that resplendent red hair, recounted stories of your Italian mother with dementia, of your brother who wouldn\u2019t visit, of midnight dinners with old friends and solo travels to make new ones, of one past love and no regrets, for your life was full \u2014 full of laughter (that big Village-girl laugh), full of wonder, as you refused to be sorry for not finishing Third Year, refused to be anyone but an awe-filled woman born into some decade I still do not know, you, this white woman, who made an insecure girl feel like a worthy lawyer.\n\nThen years after I\u2019d abandoned New York City for nuptials and motherhood, you called to tell me news of the Big C forcing the tireless to bed, and I was sorry you were alone, sorry there were no decorative diplomas nailed to your walls, only two aging cats to witness the wretchedness, until you laughed at a silly joke of mine, said you were thankful, and I was sorry for feeling sorry, because you were not sorry, not even when it left and returned, not even when the laughter burned your lungs, and not, I hope, today, as I write these two grateful sentences, hoping, praying, that the reason you haven\u2019t returned my calls is because you\u2019re out in that crazy city of yours still not being sorry.\n\nLauren Francis-Sharma is the author of the novel \u201c\u2018Til the Well Runs Dry\u201d\n\n\n\nFlanders. 27 November, 1914\n\nPrivate Dawson smiled through his tears as he cradled the contents of the small package in his lap, so very grateful for these wonderful treasures from his much-missed home: the badly knitted socks, the packet of smokes, the photograph \u2014 so beautiful he almost couldn\u2019t bear to look at it \u2014 and the letter, bursting with sentiments of love and yearning, hope and fear. Only the melody of sudden birdsong could stir him from his meandering thoughts, and as his eyes flickered wearily to the eastern sky, where the first faint shades of pink and peach quietly dusted the clouds, he offered his thanks for the greatest treasure of all \u2014 the chance to watch the dawning of another day.\n\nHazel Gaynor is the author of the novels \u201cThe Girl Who Came Home\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cA Memory of Violets\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cAWOL\u201d\n\nIt was the first time she had seen her father since she was eleven years old. Over dinner, he told her how to correctly cut her steak and why hummingbirds can fly backwards and the derivation of certain military acronyms, and when the bill came she blushed furiously as she paid, telling him it was nothing, it was no problem, she was happy to do it, she was thankful even, and the next time he was in town \u2026 the lies hovered all around her, impossibly buoyant, as she ran for the taxi.\n\nPanio Gianopoulos is the author of \u201cA Familiar Beast\u201d\n\n\n\nNick Campbell, my boss and mentor, the greatest hot-rod mechanic in New England, diagnostic demigod and diviner of high compression, sits at the tan Formica table flicking cigarette ash like a lifter on a slow cam, his head framed by the doorway to where, on a braided rug, I gave his wife Mary Ann the first orgasm I ever gave anyone other than myself. As I slice off a disc of can-ribbed cranberry sauce, offering silent thanks for this idling moment with the two people who matter to me most, Mary Ann leans back in the chrome-legged chair, watching her husband with arctic blue eyes that deepen before the sudden burst of her voice stalls my heart: \u201cNick, it\u2019s time for you to listen.\u201d\n\nWayne Harrison is the author of the novel \u201cThe Spark and the Drive\u201d\n\n\n\nThe late November morning broke raw, dark and cold and at first the fog in the distant hills was dense, and as Big Ray and his older brother Little Ray and I strolled down the road toward what little sunlight there was, I couldn\u2019t remember a thing about the night before, but then, as the fog around us thinned out and turned to fluttery wisps, so too did the vat of pea soup inside my head, and everything became clearer and clearer with each step and suddenly I realized I\u2019d behaved appallingly the night before, I\u2019d humiliated myself in front of friends and family and strangers, I\u2019d had way too much to drink and smoke and snort and I\u2019d made passes at men and women and their children and possibly even domesticated animals, and as all of this came back to me in a combination of jump cuts and freeze frames, a lukewarm lump the size of a softball began to ascend from my gut into my throat, and I stopped walking and reeled over to the side of the road to retch, but just as I bent down to heave out every meal I\u2019d ever eaten (and then some), I heard Big Ray whisper to Little Ray, \u201cOkay, bro, now\u2019s as good a time as any\u201d and through squinting, burning eyes I could make out Little Ray pulling out a handgun from his floor-length chinchilla coat and putting it up to my throbbing temple.\n\n\u201cThanks, Little Ray,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re doing me a HUGE favor.\u201d\n\nTed Heller is the author of the novels \u201cWest of Babylon,\u201d \u201cPocket Kinds,\u201d \u201cFunnymen\u201d and \u201cSlab Rat\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTurkey Shoot\u201d\n\nWhen my neighbor field dressed his kill, he thought he had removed all the turkey shot, but the bird still held the last pellets, a secret hidden between wishbone and nerve, which during those weeks in the deep freeze turned to ice. On Thanksgiving, when dropped into the rolling boil of the fryer\u2019s grease, up jumped the turkey, the proud bird poking its chest out one last time as the fire in its belly \u2014 peanut oil, propane heat, ice crystals \u2014 turned its cavity to musket and sent its load \u2014 gristle, lead shot, pneumatic bone \u2014 so close to my neighbor\u2019s skull that if he had worn a pilgrim\u2019s hat, it would have flown clean off, dead-bird twirling in the same wind where that grease-fire phoenix rose into the tree branches, brightening a morning that was otherwise gray.\n\nRavi Howard is the author of the novels \u201cDriving the King\u201d (forthcoming in January) and \u201cLike Trees, Walking\u201d\n\n\n\nInto the pie shell, Mrs. Sen poured a mixture of salt, sugar, doubt, cinnamon, pumpkin, ginger, denial, cloves, pleas, therapy, the glittery bindi (not hers) which she\u2019d found on the shower door that morning, 1/2 cup antifreeze, and two well beaten eggs. She baked the pie at 425 degrees, then served him a slice on a spotless plate, and when he offered her a bite, she said no thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "45 tiny, new stories from top writers, just two sentences and one rule: Include \"thanks\" in an interesting way", "title": "Two-sentence Thanksgiving fiction: New stories from Mona Simpson, Megan Abbott, Lydia Millet, Rebecca Makkai and many more", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "45 tiny, new stories from top writers, just two sentences and one rule: Include \"thanks\" in an interesting way", "title": "Two-sentence Thanksgiving fiction: New stories from Mona Simpson, Megan Abbott, Lydia Millet, Rebecca Makkai and many more", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/27/two_sentence_thanksgiving_fiction_new_stories_from_mona_simpson_megan_abbott_lydia_millet_rebecca_makkai_and_many_more/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/thanksgiving_authors2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "45 tiny, new stories from top writers, just two sentences and one rule: Include \"thanks\" in an interesting way", "title": "Two-sentence Thanksgiving fiction: New stories from Mona Simpson, Megan Abbott, Lydia Millet, Rebecca Makkai and many more", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/thanksgiving_authors2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Daley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alexi Zentner, Amber Dermont, Bret Anthony Johnston, Brock Clarke, Celeste Ng, Darin Strauss, EC Osondu, Elissa Schappell, Fiction, Hannah Pittard, Helen Ellis, Jesse Ball, Justin Taylor, Kyle Minor, Lori Carson, Lydia Millet, Megan Abbott, Mona Simpson, nathaniel rich, Panio Gianopoulos, Rebecca Makkai, Robin Antalek, Robin Black, Simon Rich, Tania James, Ted Heller, teddy wayne, Two sentence fiction", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa28\"", "article_summary": "We asked lots of our favorite authors to tell a story in only two sentences, with just this one rule -- it had to include the word thanks, thankful, Thanksgiving or some variation.\n\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d she said, smiling amiably, as she went to fetch a hammer in the kitchen to check that they hadn\u2019t been swindled.\nAustin Bunn wrote the film \u201cKill Your Darlings\u201d and is the author of the forthcoming collection \u201cThe Brink\u201dSadie, unhappy about the vegans, refused to cook the bird.\nShe placed her hand on her daughter\u2019s closed casket, thankful that she finally knew where she was.\nLauren Francis-Sharma is the author of the novel \u201c\u2018Til the Well Runs Dry\u201dFlanders."}
