Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has called on the White House to change the image of Obamacare by giving it a new name, according to Politico "Obamacare, no question, has a very bad brand that has been driven intentionally by a lot of misinformation and a lot of paid advertising," Sebelius said at the "Lessons from Leaders" event thrown by the political news website."I think we may need to call it something, in the future, different, but it is working. Not only are people getting coverage, [but also] the largest drop in uninsured rates in this country, the lowest healthcare cost growth in this country ever recorded."So it’s actually doing what it’s supposed to do and creating a competitive market for people who had no choice."Sebelius told the audience that the problems facing Obamacare are more about its commonly used name than the actual product, according to Politico.President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform legislation is actually called the Affordable Care Act, but was quickly dubbed Obamacare because it’s his pet project.Sebelius resigned as secretary in April, seven months after the bungled rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace for millions of American seeking healthcare insurance.
