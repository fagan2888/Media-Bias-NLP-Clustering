And she wasn\u2019t even born when Germany last failed to have a woman reach the medal podium after a race on tour.\n\nImprobable as it sounds, both things happened Saturday. The 21-year-old Hansen capped her win with a track-record run in the second heat, while Germany - which in fairness kept its top three sliders, including World Cup champion Natalie Geisenberger, out of the competition so they could prepare for the Olympics instead - had no one finish better than seventh, an absolute rarity for the deepest team in the world.\n\nHansen\u2019s gold is the first for the U.S. in any major international race since Erin Hamlin won the world championship in 2009.\n\n\u201cThis is a momentous occasion,\u201d USA Luge spokesman Sandy Caligiore said.\n\nHansen\u2019s two-run time was 1 minute, 23.976 seconds. Canada\u2019s Alex Gough led after the first run but finished second, 0.076 seconds off Hansen\u2019s pace. Natalia Khoreva of Russia took third, 0.176 seconds back and Hamlin was fourth for the Americans.\n\nThe other U.S. slider in the race, Summer Britcher, took 12th.\n\nGermany\u2019s top slider was Dajana Eitberger, about a half-second behind Hansen. Germany had medaled in every World Cup women\u2019s singles race since 1988.\n\nWhether the German best were there or not, it was still a breakthrough for Hansen.\n\nThe U.S. national champion held the lead at the midway point of the season-opening race at Lillehammer, Norway, then slipped all the way back to 12th in the second heat. And before Saturday, she had never even medaled in a World Cup race.\n\nNow she\u2019s heading to her first Olympics knowing how winning feels.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the pressure with regard to the upcoming Olympic Games will be greater now,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good question. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nGeisenberger, who clinched the World Cup title a week earlier, finished the season with 785 standings points. Gough was second with 626, Germany\u2019s Tatjana Huefner was third with 551, followed by Germany\u2019s Anke Wischnewski (493) and Eitberger (432).\n\nHamlin was sixth for the U.S. with 415 points, one spot ahead of Hansen with 384. Britcher, the third American women\u2019s luger heading to the Sochi Games, was 14th in the seasonlong race with 249 points.\n\nIn the doubles race later Saturday, Italy\u2019s Christian Oberstolz and Patrick Gruber prevailed with a two-run time of 1:23.388, their first win of the season.\n\nVladislav Yuzhakov and Vladimir Makhnutin of Russia were second in 1:23.434, and the Austrian duo of Andreas Linger and Wolfgang Linger were third in 1:23.467.\n\nMatthew Mortensen and Preston Griffall were 13th for the U.S., one spot ahead of countrymen Christian Niccum and Jayson Terdiman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kate Hansen is going into the Sochi Olympics on a winning streak, after giving USA Luge something it chased for 16 years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Kate Hansen is going into the Sochi Olympics on a winning streak, after giving USA Luge something it chased for 16 years.", "title": "Hansen gives US 1st World Cup luge win since 1997", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/hansen-gives-us-1st-world-cup-luge-win-since-1997/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/c17306a487d6ec03490f6a7067009d96.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/c17306a487d6ec03490f6a7067009d96.jpg", "description": "Kate Hansen is going into the Sochi Olympics on a winning streak, after giving USA Luge something it chased for 16 years.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hansen gives US 1st World Cup luge win since 1997"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Kate Hansen, Germany, Erin Hamlin, Olympic Games"}, "article_summary": "Germany had medaled in every World Cup women\u2019s singles race since 1988.\nAnd before Saturday, she had never even medaled in a World Cup race.\nBut we\u2019ll see.\u201dGeisenberger, who clinched the World Cup title a week earlier, finished the season with 785 standings points.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never dreamed of winning the event.\u201dHansen was a 5-year-old when Cameron Myler gave the U.S. its most recent singles victory on the World Cup circuit, which also came in Sigulda.\nSIGULDA, Latvia (AP) - Kate Hansen is going into the Sochi Olympics on a winning streak, after giving USA Luge something it chased for 16 years."}
