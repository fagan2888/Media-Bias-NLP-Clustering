Everyone knows the real reason is the conservative base has never accepted that a black Democrat could be a legitimately elected President, and after 7 years of having to live with a President the majority of white voters voted against, Republicans are going to use this as a chance to throw a nationwide temper tantrum.\n\nThe next few weeks, possibly months (possibly 11 months!) are going to suck for whatever sacrificial lamb (or lambs) Obama throws up for the Republicans to reject in an impotent attempt to register their continuing anger that he just keeps sitting in the White House like the duly elected President he is. But for the rest of the Democrats, this is going to be a political boon.\n\nThis goes double for Hillary Clinton, who will be able to use the ongoing fight over the Supreme Court to push her argument that her brand of liberal politics is the best fit for our current political climate, better both than the idealism offered by Bernie Sanders and than the politics of obstruction and resentment that define all her Republican opponents.\n\nIt says a lot about our current political situation that the best outcome for the Democrats is almost surely what the Republicans are threatening to do, which is to stonewall anyone Obama nominates, just because he\u2019s Obama and they have a superstitious belief that everything he touches is unclean. While it\u2019s going to be a policy disaster to have a court that is set up to tie so many important decisions, having the Republicans loudly proclaim that they prioritize impotent insults aimed at the President over actual governance is a political boon of the sort that you can\u2019t buy even with Citizens United money. Every day this drags out, the news will be a glorious reminder to the voters that the Republicans are such babies that they shouldn\u2019t be trusted to run a small town McDonald\u2019s franchise, much less be given so much power in the U.S. government.\n\nThis is especially delicious since the only Republican candidate who has a chance to walk away from this unscathed \u2014 maybe even finding a way to turn it to his advantage\u2014 is Donald Trump. The two candidates who are currently best positioned to unseat Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are both senators and both have indicated their willingness to join their fellow Republicans in the Senate in blocking whoever Obama nominates, just because he nominated them. The bad loser vibe, where Republicans punish not just Obama but the whole country because they refuse to accept he won the 2012 election fair and square, will rub off on them.\n\nTrump, however, has a real chance here to score some points. Vague promises that he will straighten up D.C. and end all this pointless bickering and gridlock\u2014 because he\u2019s a winner who gets things done or whatever empty braggadocio he wants to throw out\u2014 and he can set himself apart from Cruz and Rubio, all without actually having to commit to either offending the Obama-hating base or having to endorse the astounding immaturity that has infected every last member of the congressional Republican caucus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans plan to block Obama's SCOTUS nominee, but doing so will hurt their already tattered reputation", "title": "The Republican Supreme Court tantrum is a gift to Democrats, especially to Hillary Clinton", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans plan to block Obama's SCOTUS nominee, but doing so will hurt their already tattered reputation", "title": "The Republican Supreme Court tantrum is a gift to Democrats, especially to Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/15/the_republican_supreme_court_tantrum_is_a_gift_to_democrats_especially_to_hillary_clinton/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/dem-2016-clinton.jpeg32-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans plan to block Obama's SCOTUS nominee, but doing so will hurt their already tattered reputation", "title": "The Republican Supreme Court tantrum is a gift to Democrats, especially to Hillary Clinton", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/dem-2016-clinton.jpeg32-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Election 2016, Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, republicans court, scalia death, Supreme Court, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02ed\"", "article_summary": "But for the rest of the Democrats, this is going to be a political boon.\nThe disingenuous posturing about how a president who has an entire year left in his term should simply stop doing his job is even more transparent than usual.\nTrump, however, has a real chance here to score some points.\nThis is especially delicious since the only Republican candidate who has a chance to walk away from this unscathed \u2014 maybe even finding a way to turn it to his advantage\u2014 is Donald Trump.\nThe next few weeks, possibly months (possibly 11 months!)"}
