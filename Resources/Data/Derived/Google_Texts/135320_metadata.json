The index has tumbled 18 percent so far this year and more than 20 percent since its recent high in late December, putting it in bear market territory.\n\nThis is the third time it\u2019s surpassed the 20 percent threshold in just six months\u2014first at the beginning of July and later in mid-August. It\u2019s no shock that three bear markets erasing trillions of dollars in half a year in the world\u2019s second-largest economy would send shocks through global markets on the whole. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 benchmark is inching dangerously close to bear territory. The S&P 500 and Dow had both wiped out about 8 percent so far this year as of Friday morning .\n\nEveryday Americans may not yet be feeling the pinch. But those gunning for a 2016 presidential win should be, as this would be the sort of unstable, teetering world economy they could inherit the second the moving trucks pull up to the White House next January.\n\nSo it was a good thing, then, that China came up in Thursday night\u2019s G.O.P. debate. Only, no one brought up the bear market. No one brought up markets at all.\n\nBillionaire businessman Donald Trump kicked off the display of absolute lack of concern for current market conditions, answering moderators\u2019 questions about his plan to impose a tariff on China with a winding response that gave no indication that he\u2019s looked at the top business headline since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cChina is ripping us on trade. They\u2019re devaluing their currency and they\u2019re killing our companies,\u201d he said, without mention of what\u2019s been going on in markets. \u201cI\u2019m totally open to a tariff. If they don\u2019t treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.\u201d\n\nNow, in fairness to Trump, he was asked a specific question about tariffs and trade, so if he chose not to dive into markets, it could be chalked up to him sticking closely to the subject at hand. But this left the door wide open for a candidate\u2014any candidate, every candidate\u2014to jump in with a salient point about the crush in Chinese markets, a nation on the brink of a devastating slowdown that could boomerang to the U.S. economy and economies all around the world. They were all getting the chance to slam Trump, the front-runner, their main opponent, for focusing on an issue that maybe would have been important nine months ago, but its significance had dropped dramatically, just as Chinese indexes have at the start of the year.\n\nYet, that\u2019s not what happened, not nearly. Instead, nearly every single candidate weighed in with canned gobbledygook\u2014a collection of rehearsed responses that used the word China, but only as a way to pivot back to talking points they were more comfortable with, like blue-collar workers and Obamacare and tractor drivers.\n\nJohn Kasich interrupted Trump to give his take on \u201cChina,\u201d which was actually sort of about free trade and fair trade and not making China an enemy. But how does Kasich know \u201cthis\u201d? (Mind you: it\u2019s unclear what the \u201cthis\u201d meant, but that\u2019s irrelevant. He had a pre-planned point to get to, and he wasn\u2019t going to let the current conversation on China get in the way.) \u201cBecause so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn\u2019t work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they\u2019re hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they\u2019re Americans and they carry the load. So let\u2019s demand open trade but fair trade in this country.\u201d Got it?\n\nRubio piped up next. Hopes were high that he\u2019d circle back to what\u2019s been going on the last few weeks in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, when he began by saying, \u201cWe are all frustrated with what China is doing.\u201d It devolved from there. His \u201cbetter approach\u201d: tax reform, regulatory reform, repealing the \u201ccertified job killer\u201d that is Obamacare. \u201cThat is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s main point about China? Soybeans. \u201cApart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation. So the soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes\u2014the equivalent of it goes to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would be devastating for the economy. We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz went a different route. \u201cChina is running over President Obama like he is a child,\u201d that\u2019s the problem. He then turned to an anecdote about a meeting he had with senior leadership at John Deere who told him how hard it is to sell tractors in China. Maybe that would have been a way to talk about how China is getting hammered, and maybe no one is buying tractors because the economy is in the brink. No dice. The rest of his response mostly focused on his plan for a flat tax in the U.S. and abolishing the I.R.S.\n\nTrump, incidentally, may have made the truest, most apt statement on the issue without once mentioning current conditions.\n\nIn referring to powerful businessmen he deals with, he said, \u201cThese are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and we have problems like this.\u201d Hopefully, all of the candidates onstage were listening.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chinese markets are on the brink, but that didn't fit the candidates' narratives.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Emily Jane Fox", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "Chinese markets are on the brink, but that didn't fit the candidates' narratives.", "title": "Everyone at the Fox Business Debate Ignored the Biggest Financial Story of the Year", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/fox-business-debate-markets-china", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/569906d4b39d7eea4aca19ba/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/global-markets-china-gop-debate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "Chinese markets are on the brink, but that didn't fit the candidates' narratives.", "title": "Everyone at the Fox Business Debate Ignored the Biggest Financial Story of the Year", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/569906d4b39d7eea4aca19ba/master/pass/global-markets-china-gop-debate.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "chinese markets,global markets,bear markets,gop debate,2016 presidential election", "pubdate": "2016-01-15T10:20:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s no shock that three bear markets erasing trillions of dollars in half a year in the world\u2019s second-largest economy would send shocks through global markets on the whole.\n\u201cThat is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.\u201dJeb Bush\u2019s main point about China?\nThey\u2019re devaluing their currency and they\u2019re killing our companies,\u201d he said, without mention of what\u2019s been going on in markets.\nThe S&P 500 and Dow had both wiped out about 8 percent so far this year as of Friday morning .\nAnother dreadful week for global markets drags on, as concerns over China\u2019s lagging economy and its sinking currency continue to loom."}
