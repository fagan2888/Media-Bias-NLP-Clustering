Baker reported, the Railroad Commission is considering shutting down a couple of wells that the report identified as likely causing the earthquakes. The companies operating those wells will appear before the commission in June to give reasons why their wells shouldn't be shut down.\n\nThe commission adopted rules last year to stop a well if it is causing seismic activity. Commission Chairwoman Christi Craddick told the Star-Telegram, \"In light of SMU\u2019s study linking disposal well activity to earthquakes in 2013, it is important to assess this new information in relation to the continued operational safety of the wells.\u201d\n\nBaker also reported that the House Energy Resources Committee will hold a hearing next Monday on the issue. Panel Chairman Drew Darby, R-San Angelo, said, \u201cThose studies indicate there is [a connection]. I\u2019m not a scientist. I\u2019m going to let the data drive the discussion.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Southern Methodist University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
