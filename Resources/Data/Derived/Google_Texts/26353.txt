PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — New York Yankees prospect Jose Pirela was taken to a hospital after crashing into the center field wall on a play in the first inning that ended up an inside-the-park home run for the Mets’ Juan Lagares.

Lagares’ drive off CC Sabathia — the left-hander’s third pitch of the game Sunday — was just out of Pirela’s reach on the warning track. The center fielder’s momentum carried him into the wall, where he appeared to crash face first. Pirela then fell and hit the back of his head on the track. He tried sitting up but went onto his back.

With manager Joe Girardi looking on, a Yankees trainer examined Pirela, a versatile 25 year old who has played several positions this spring. Pirela was able to walk and was helped into a golf cart.
