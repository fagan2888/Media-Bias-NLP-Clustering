By comparison, the state's average adult smoking rate is 16.2 percent and the national rate is 18.1 percent. The report is based primarily on state Health Department data.\n\nEven though smoking across upstate New York has declined since 2004, upstate residents are still lighting up at higher than average rates.\n\nNew York has the 11th lowest smoking rate in the nation.\n\nBut if upstate were a separate state, it would have the 17th highest adult smoking rate in the country, according to the report.\n\n\"We've issued this report now with the hope that people who are considering a New Year's resolution to quit smoking will find in it another strong incentive to walk away from this life-shortening habit,\" Dr. Arthur Vercillo, regional president of Excellus, said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, requires most private health insurance plans to cover tobacco cessation, including up to two quit attempts per year at no cost to consumers. Smoking-cessation drugs and counseling are covered. Medicare also covers smoking cessation.\n\nThe insurer's report shows smoking among New York adults varies by socio-economic groups.\n\nAdults who have not earned a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma are more than three times as likely to smoke than college graduates.\n\nAdults with annual incomes below $15,000 are more than twice as likely to smoke than those with incomes of $50,000 or more.\n\nContact James T.
