The Donald versus everybody! Mr. Universe takes on The Nine Dwarves! The Boss schools nine quaking little Apprentices!\n\nIn your mind, you can see the lighted-up marquee outside the arena with searchlights scanning the skies and hear the pro wrestling announcer intoning the combatants with grand hoopla. Truly, a Lincoln/Douglas-style debate for modern American masses!\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nAnd by the look on Republicans\u2019 faces today and the faces of expert political journalists everywhere, you would think something rotten had died and begun leaking.\n\nNow I do not envy the Fox News debate moderators. It will be no easy task containing the uncontainable.\n\nI mean, what are they going to do? Cut off Donald Trump\u2019s mic?\n\nWhen somebody tried that on Ronald Reagan, he famously bellowed that he had, in fact, paid for the microphone. His impolitic outburst helped cement his 1980 landslide election and assured a presidency that remains a guiding vision for Republicans still today.\n\nBut before Ronald Reagan became one of the GOP\u2019s most enduring political forces of the century, he was dismissed and scoffed at by all the political experts as a vulgar outsider who needed not to be taken seriously.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSo what exactly does happen when somebody cuts Donald Trump\u2019s mic?\n\nHard to say, since it has probably never happened before. He generally owns all the mics he talks into or is saying something so interesting or shocking that nobody wants to turn it off.\n\nI would imagine cutting Donald Trump\u2019s mic would be something like taking a banana away from a gorilla. This alone is enough to spark something entertaining. But what makes this exact situation so watchable is that there will be nine other slightly terrified politicians in the cage with the gorilla when they take away his banana.\n\nAnd not only will there be nine politicians in the cage with the hungry and increasingly agitated gorilla, but each of those politicians will have a banana of their own that they must protect if they want to stay in the debate.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump charges, how quickly do you think these pressure-washed, blow-dried, lip-plumped, whisker-waxed little sissies hold onto their little bananas before giving them up?\n\nI predict that within the first 15 glorious minutes of this most glorious debate, Donald Trump will be standing at a podium \u2014 perhaps the podium he was assigned, perhaps not \u2014 and he will be holding his broken microphone. On the lectern before him will be nine more working microphones.\n\nTrying to maintain normalcy, debate moderators dutifully turn to Marco Rubio with a question about his dizzying flip-flops on illegal immigration. Mr. Rubio starts to answer, but nothing comes out of his throat. He looks to Mr. Trump, who glares.\n\nThe camera pans back to Mr. Rubio, who dives out of the camera shot for a glass of water. When he leans back into the frame, and he says, \u201cUh, you know, whatever Mr. Trump says. You know, somebody\u2019s doing the raping.\u201d\n\nBut since he has no microphone, only the first few rows of the live audience can hear him.\n\nModerators then ask ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry where, exactly, in his shorts he kept the gun he used to shoot a coyote while jogging a few years back.\n\nLong silence. Blinking behind his European-style rectangular eyewear. More silence.\n\n\u201cOops, I forgot,\u201d Perry says.\n\nMr. Trump rolls his eyes and looks at the moderators. \u201cHe put glasses on so people think he\u2019s smart. People can see through the glasses.\u201d\n\nThen he turns back to Mr. Perry and reminds him how he had instructed him to take an IQ test before participating in another debate.\n\nThen Mr. Trump informs Mr. Perry he is, in fact, fired.\n\nJeb Bush interrupts to defend his fellow governor and tells Mr. Trump he has no qualifications whatsoever to fire a real-life governor.
