Bailey missed the first two games with a bum left foot, and his return remains questionable.\n\nYet two games into 2013 without their biggest defensive stars, the Broncos are 2-0 with six combined interceptions against the past two Super Bowl MVPs.\n\nThey picked off Joe Flacco, last season\u2019s postseason hero, twice in the season-opener last week, and notched four interceptions Sunday against Eli Manning, who picked up the 2012 Super Bowl hardware.\n\n\u201cThose two guys have played at a high level in this league, so you would expect a drop-off,\u201d said Broncos defensive tackle Terrance Knighton. \u201cBut it\u2019s on us to pick it up without Von or Champ, and I think we\u2019re doing a good job of that.\u201d\n\nChris Harris has been starting in place of Bailey at an outside cornerback position and though he got burned by Victor Cruz for a 51-yard completion on the Broncos\u2019 first defensive play of the game, he bounced back to get his second interception in two games.\n\n\u201cWe can play, man,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate those guys aren\u2019t playing, but its fortunate that other guys are able to show what they can do.\u201d\n\nOne player who is getting a chance is Malik Jackson. A defensive end who plays tackle in the nickel, Jackson twice hit Eli Manning as he threw. A fifth round pick in the 2012 draft, this was easily Jackson\u2019s best game as a pro.\n\n\u201cI wish I would have got him to the ground, but I\u2019ll keep working,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nWeakside linebacker Danny Trevathan led the Broncos with 10 tackles, including a 9-yard sack of Eli Manning on the first play of the second half.\n\nNot that Denver\u2019s defense has been perfect. It has given up 50 points in two games.\n\n\u201cThey had a lot of chances in the red zone, but we held them to three, instead of seven,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cWe did a good job in the running game. I think overall the defense did a good job. Our DBs did a great job.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos defense steps up again without Von Miller, Champ Bailey", "title": "Broncos defense steps up again without Von Miller, Champ Bailey", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/broncos-defense-steps-up-again-without-von-miller-champ-bailey/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__rahim-moore-interception-broncos-giants-091513p1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__rahim-moore-interception-broncos-giants-091513p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T19:59:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:53:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cd9\"", "article_summary": "I think overall the defense did a good job.\n\u201cThose two guys have played at a high level in this league, so you would expect a drop-off,\u201d said Broncos defensive tackle Terrance Knighton.\n\u201cWe did a good job in the running game.\n\u2014 Von Miller and Champ Bailey, their only returning defensive Pro Bowlers.\nYet two games into 2013 without their biggest defensive stars, the Broncos are 2-0 with six combined interceptions against the past two Super Bowl MVPs."}
