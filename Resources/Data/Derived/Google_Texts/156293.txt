A doctor is suing HCA Inc. claiming she was fired from a physician staffing company after complaining about low staffing levels in the emergency room at Brandon Regional Hospital, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

Dr. Wanda Espinoza-Cruz names her former employer, Florida EM-I Medical Services, and its parent company, EMCare Inc. in the lawsuit along with HCA. According to the Times, she claims that in January 2014, low staffing led to a patient with stroke symptoms and another with high blood sugar being forced to wait several hours for care.

The physician staffing company and the hospital called the claims untrue, the Times reports.
