It\u2019s not every day that an attorney states openly to a reporter that he thinks he\u2019s going to win his case because he expects the justices to behave like partisan hacks.\n\nAnd, yet, that\u2019s more or less what Michael Carvin, the lead attorney behind a last ditch effort to gut the Affordable Care Act, told Talking Points Memo\u2019s Sahil Kapur on Wednesday. According to Kapur, Carvin expects the Supreme Court to take up his case because there will be four justices \u2014 the amount needed for the Court to take a case \u2014 who aren\u2019t \u201cgoing to give much of a damn about what a bunch of Obama appointees on the D.C. Circuit think.\u201d He added that he does not expect to \u201close any Republican-appointed judges\u2019 votes\u201d in the D.C. Circuit, an appeals court that is currently considering the case, and that he expects the Republicans on the Supreme Court to follow their fellow Republicans\u2019 lead.\n\nWhen asked if he thinks he could lose any of the Supreme Court\u2019s five Republicans, Carvin \u201csmiled and said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think so.'\u201d\n\nLast July, two Republican members of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered much of Obamacare defunded at Carvin\u2019s request. The full DC Circuit withdrew this decision earlier this month, and announced that the case would be heard again by the full court in December.\n\nAlthough Carvin attributes this fact to \u201ca bunch of Obama appointees on the D.C. Circuit,\u201d the truth is that the Obama appointees on this court could have only played a partial role in the decision to withdraw the two GOP judges\u2019 decision. All eleven of the DC Circuit\u2019s active judges considered whether to rehear the case, and a majority of six was required to withdraw the two Republicans\u2019 decision. President Obama, however, appointed only four members of the court. Thus, even if all four of the Obama appointees voted to rehear the case, at least two judges who were appointed by a different president must have agreed with them or the original decision would not have been withdrawn.\n\nThe DC Circuit does not announce how each judge votes when a request to rehear a case is filed, so, while it is likely that President Obama\u2019s four appointees disagreed with the legally doubtful reasoning in the two Republican judges\u2019 decision, no one except the judges themselves and some members of the court\u2019s staff are aware of how the court\u2019s members voted on this matter. Carvin\u2019s claim that the Obama appointees voted against him is speculation.\n\nCarvin is correct, however, that his best chance of winning this case is to hope that the justices will place their partisan preferences before the law, as the legal arguments presented in his briefs are weak. As ThinkProgress previously explained, Carvin\u2019s legal theory misreads the Affordable Care Act by fixating on one line of the statute to the exclusion of other text that cuts against his claim that the law should be defunded. This method of reading a statute defies the Supreme Court\u2019s command that \u201ca reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation\u201d as the \u201cmeaning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d\n\nCarvin also asks the courts to read Obamacare in a way that would render much of its language virtually meaningless. As we explained in a lengthy examination of the flaws in his lawsuit, Carvin \u201cexpect[s] the courts to believe that Obamacare is supposed to create barren health exchanges where little or no health insurers offer exorbitantly priced insurance that hardly anyone can afford.\u201d This claim, among other things, cannot be squared with the law\u2019s declaration that it will achieve \u201cnear-universal coverage by building upon and strengthening the private employer-based health insurance system.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the fact that Carvin\u2019s legal arguments lack merit does not necessarily mean that he is wrong about how the justices will view his case. In August, the Washington Times examined the voting patterns of judges in cases involving the Affordable Care Act. They found that \u201cDemocratic appointees ruled in favor of Obamacare more than 90 percent of the time, while Republican appointees ruled against it nearly 80 percent of the time.\u201d Pure partisanship, not the merits of a particular legal argument, has been the greatest predictor of how judges will decide cases involving this politically charged law.\n\nBut if judges cannot set aside their partisan preferences, then that is an indictment of the very legitimacy of the judiciary. Elected officials are empowered to govern because their authority flows from the will of the people. Federal judges, by contrast, enjoy no popular mandate and they cannot be removed from office in a future election if they abuse their power or otherwise to harm to the law. Nevertheless, the Constitution entrusts them with significant authority because it expects judges to objectively apply the law regardless of their political views.\n\nYet, if judges behave just like ordinary politicians, then the case for giving them any power whatsoever breaks down. Between giving an elected official who can be removed from office the power to set policy based solely on that official\u2019s own political views, and giving that same power to an unelected official who serves for life, it is better to leave that kind of power in the hands of people who are actually accountable to the people. Placing that kind of power in the hands of unelected officials with life tenure, at least if those officials do not restrain themselves by following objective legal principles, is akin to oligarchy.\n\nSo Carvin\u2019s prediction that Republican justices can be trusted to advance Republican policies even in a case such as this one, where the legal arguments for doing so are weak, may in fact prove correct.
