Ben Sasse spent much of his freshman year without taking the podium. In a studied decision to use his previous reticence as leverage, the Nebraska Republican devoted his first speech on the Senate floor Tuesday to sounding the alarm on the rapid expansion of an \u201cadministrative state\u201d comprised of unelected federal bureaucrats.\n\n\u201cThe growth of the administrative state, the fourth branch of government, is increasingly hollowing out the Senate and the entire Article I branch, the legislature,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cOddly, many in the Congress have been complicit in this hollowing out of our own powers.\u201d\n\nThis unofficial fourth branch of government, he explained, emerged over the past century as legislators from both parties gradually relegated lawmaking authorities to the executive branch of the president to avoid taking on tough issues. (See the speech here.)\n\nDavid Azerrad, director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Simon Center for Principles and Politics, said this shift has placed nearly unlimited power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats to make policy, creating a \u201cdeeply entrenched\u201d administrative state that exists largely beyond the constraints of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBecause this administrative state is to a considerable degree insulated from [the president\u2019s] political control, and that\u2019s by design, the next president will need to establish his authority over the bureaucracy, parts of which are comprised of independent regulatory agencies that are not formally housed in the executive branch of government,\u201d Azerrad said Wednesday during a Heritage event on the subject.\n\nThis power shift, he said, created an \u201curgent problem\u201d that needs to be addressed to restore the separation of powers.\n\nFirst, Azerrad said, the \u201cunusual excesses\u201d under President Barack Obama have exacerbated the problem, in particular his \u201cexecutive unilateralism\u201d on issues ranging from health care to immigration to environmental law.\n\nPassage by Congress of \u201cmammoth\u201d laws such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, he said, delegated immense powers to agencies to create costly regulations.\n\nFinally, he said, the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in City of Arlington v. FCC extended the ability of agencies, rather than Congress, to interpret their own statutory requirements.\n\nChristopher DeMuth, a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute, said the candidate who wins the White House in 2016 should take bold steps right after taking office to show bureaucracies that he or she is willing to scale back bureaucratic power.\n\nSpecifically, he said the next president should approve the Keystone XL pipeline, undo the \u201cdangers\u201d of Dodd-Frank to the extent that can be done, and immediately take steps to remove the \u201chighly perverse imposition\u201d of federal regulation over the Internet.\n\nBut, DeMuth said, such a \u201cradical change\u201d will take time and demands strong presidential leadership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to require, to get out of the morass we\u2019re in, an individual in the Oval Office who has a larger vision of things,\u201d he said, \u201cand can understand the interest of the good health of the constitutional order as going beyond his exercise of his prerogatives while he\u2019s there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
