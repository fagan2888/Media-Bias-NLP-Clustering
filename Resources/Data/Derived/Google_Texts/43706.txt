Thousands of children are estimated to be victims of sex trafficking and according to one organization, it's happening right here in Tucson.

The group is called Sold No More, and it teamed up with a group of students from Desert View High School and held a fashion show Saturday to raise money for anti-sex trafficking efforts.

"We as a culture have made this mess and it's going to cost us a lot to fix it," said Sold No More program manager Lisa Hansen.

Roseanna Gonzalez, a teacher at Desert View High School, facilitated the #Youth4Freedom Youth Fashion Show, and she said Sold No More puts on presentations for schools about sex trafficking. It’s made students more aware and eager to help make a difference, she said.

"They just couldn't fathom the idea of them being, you know, sold for sex trafficking."

Other Tucson high schools also will contribute efforts to the fashion show. And though some victims may not have the courage to speak out, Sold No More's Hansen, who is a sex trafficking victim herself, said she wants to give them a voice.

"What it took for them to walk away was to actually begin to understand that they have value and that they have worth," said Hansen.

Hansen said they’re working on a campaign soon to get more people on board so more students can hear Sold No More's message.
