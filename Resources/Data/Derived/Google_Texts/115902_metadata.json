IAM organizers say they will continue to recruit workers and will file for a new election, possibly in six months.\n\nBoeing denies the union\u2019s allegations, with company spokeswoman Candy Eslinger calling them \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nBeverly Wyse, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina, in a statement thanked workers for their \u201cpatience and professionalism\u201d during the union organizing process.\n\n\u201cWe now have the opportunity to make Boeing South Carolina and our local community an even better place to work and live,\u201d Wyse said.\n\nMichael Carrouth \u2014 a labor lawyer with Fisher & Phillips in Columbia \u2014 said the IAM\u2019s future \u201cwill be extremely hard\u201d now that next week\u2019s vote has been canceled.\n\n\u201cBoeing\u2019s workers, whether they supported the union or not, were looking forward to resolving this issue with a vote on April 22,\u201d said Carrouth, who has worked against union organizing campaigns across the country. \u201cWorkers are disappointed, and they\u2019re going to remember that they had a chance to let the majority decide but the union took it away.\u201d\n\nThe IAM can file a new petition in six months, but first it would have to get new signatures from at least 30 percent of the 3,175 union-eligible workers \u2014 at least 953 people \u2014 expressing interest in a new election. If the IAM had lost next week\u2019s election, the union would have had to wait one year to file a new petition.\n\nAll told, Boeing employs more than 7,500 people in the Charleston region.\n\nCarrouth said organizing Boeing workers is a long-term business issue for the IAM, while most workers see it as a more immediate and personal decision.\n\n\u201cWorkers have learned a valuable lesson here \u2014 it\u2019s all about the union and not the employees,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process can be manipulated so the union won\u2019t have to take a loss.\u201d\n\nIn addition to withdrawing its petition, the IAM filed unfair labor practices charges against Boeing and halted its door-to-door visits with workers after what it called \u201chostile and near-violent confrontations,\u201d according to a union news release. The charges allege Boeing encouraged harassment, assaults and threats of violence against union supporters. Boeing denies the charges, with a spokesman calling them \u201cfrivolous.\u201d\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board will investigate the allegations by reviewing affidavits and witness reports from both sides. If the NLRB believes Boeing might have violated federal law, the agency will issue a complaint and a formal hearing will be held.\n\nThe IAM could have delayed next week\u2019s vote simply by filing the charges, which would have to be resolved \u2014 possibly months later \u2014 before a vote could be held. Instead, IAM officials also withdrew their petition, a move they say is designed to help the union regroup and re-educate Boeing workers.\n\nCarrouth said the withdrawal, instead of delaying the vote with a complaint, indicates the IAM wants the next vote to be scheduled under new NLRB rules that call for expedited elections. Previously, it could take up to six weeks for a vote to be held once a petition is filed. Under the new rules, approved this month, a vote could be scheduled in two weeks.\n\nCompanies are held to a much higher legal standard regarding what they can say about union organizing once a petition is filed, called the \u201ccritical period.\u201d Carrouth said that gives unions an advantage, because they are not held to the same standards.\n\nMike Evans, the IAM\u2019s lead local organizer, said visits to Boeing workers\u2019 homes helped the union determine \u201cnow is not the right time for an election.\u201d\n\nThe IAM received a list of the names and addresses of workers eligible to vote in the election earlier this month, and organizers spent the past week in an intense effort to gauge their support.\n\nEvans said the visits showed many workers were confused by \u201coutright lies\u201d Boeing had told them.\n\nEslinger denied the company has lied to workers, adding Boeing has \u201ctaken a very transparent approach to informing our teammates and the community about what it means to be represented by the IAM.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have provided factual information backed up by data throughout this entire process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have not sought to spread rumors or intruded on the privacy of employees and their families at home.\u201d\n\nCynthia Ramaker, a quality inspector at the North Charleston plant who led a worker campaign against the organizing effort, told The Seattle Times she saw no intimidation of anyone interested in voting for the union during the current campaign, but said she\u2019s not surprised IAM organizers met open hostility on area doorsteps.\n\n\u201cSure, there\u2019s a lot of people that didn\u2019t want the union,\u201d Ramaker told the newspaper. \u201cThey probably met those people that weren\u2019t too happy about them knocking on their door.\u201d\n\nRamaker added that the union \u201cblamed everybody and everything but themselves. Not having enough people for the vote, that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\nCarrouth called the union\u2019s claims of violence a \u201cface-saving\u201d measure. He said there is no doubt the IAM will file another petition to hold a union election at Boeing. An estimate by Boeing showed the union could make up to nearly $1.6 million per year in dues based on current salary levels at the North Charleston facilities.\n\n\u201cThey will have to continue trying to organize these operations because their long-term survival depends on it,\u201d Carrouth said. \u201cThey have no choice. They\u2019ll die if they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe petition for a union election was filed on March 16 after what the union termed a \u201csignificant number\u201d of Boeing workers who signed authorization cards expressing interest in union representation. The IAM said workers at Boeing had reached out to the union regarding workplace concerns including forced overtime, rising health care costs and what they termed a lack of respect on the shop floor.\n\nSouth Carolina has the nation\u2019s second-lowest rate of union participation at 2.2 percent of the private workforce. North Carolina has the lowest rate at 1.9 percent.\n\nReach David Wren at 937-5550 or on Twitter at @David_Wren_", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Vote withdrawal at Boeing could mean tougher road ahead for Machinists union, Boeing/Aerospace, \r\nBoeing/AerospaceFP LatestNews, \r\nBusiness-Local, \r\nIndustry, \r\nIndustry, 787,Boeing,Dreamliner,International Association of Machinists,North Charleston,Union organizing", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The International Association of Machinists says it isn\u2019t giving up on efforts to hold a union election for Boeing Co. workers in North Charleston, but a national labor law expert says the chances of a union victory are now lower than ever.", "title": "Vote withdrawal at Boeing could mean tougher road ahead for Machinists union", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150417/150419429/vote-withdrawal-at-boeing-could-mean-tougher-road-ahead-for-machinists-union", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150417/PC05/150419429/AR/0/AR-150419429.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150417/PC05/150419429/AR/0/AR-150419429.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The International Association of Machinists says it isn\u2019t giving up on efforts to hold a union election for Boeing Co. workers in North Charleston, but a national labor law expert says the chances of a union victory are now lower than ever.", "title": "Vote withdrawal at Boeing could mean tougher road ahead for Machinists union", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150417/PC05/150419429/AR/0/AR-150419429.jpg?201504171849", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150419429}}, "keywords": "Vote withdrawal at Boeing could mean tougher road ahead for Machinists union , Boeing/Aerospace, \r\nBoeing/AerospaceFP LatestNews, \r\nBusiness-Local, \r\nIndustry, \r\nIndustry, 787,Boeing,Dreamliner,International Association of Machinists,North Charleston,Union organizing", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-17T10:16:07Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T18:49:00Z", "author": "David Wren"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The International Association of Machinists says it isn\u2019t giving up on efforts to hold a union election for Boeing Co. workers in North Charleston, but a national labor law expert says the chances of a union victory are now lower than ever."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb3e\"", "article_summary": "The International Association of Machinists union on Friday withdrew its petition for an April 22 vote on whether Boeing Co. workers in North Charleston want union representation.\nCarrouth said organizing Boeing workers is a long-term business issue for the IAM, while most workers see it as a more immediate and personal decision.\nHe said there is no doubt the IAM will file another petition to hold a union election at Boeing.\nInstead, IAM officials also withdrew their petition, a move they say is designed to help the union regroup and re-educate Boeing workers.\nThey\u2019ll die if they don\u2019t.\u201dThe petition for a union election was filed on March 16 after what the union termed a \u201csignificant number\u201d of Boeing workers who signed authorization cards expressing interest in union representation."}
