Any leftovers were packed for lunch the next day.\n\n\"Before, we were getting bored of our recipes, like pastas and roasts,\" Ms Honan said. \"Shopping was haphazard and there was angst about what buy and cook.\"\n\nCompetition is coming. My Food Bag in New Zealand was also attracted by the growth potential of Australia's \"infant\" market and will open a local arm on Monday. It amassed 6000 customers within a year of its launch in Auckland early last year.\n\nThe dinner kit category has only flourished around the world in the past three years. HelloFresh, which delivers 1 million meals a month across Europe and the US, received another $53 million from US investors involved in Twitter and Tumblr last month.\n\nIn the US, Blue Apron hit 600,000 meals a month in two years and is now competing with start-ups such as Plated, Chefday! and Munchery.\n\n\"People work what used to be 9 to 5. Now it seems like 8 to 6 and then they go to the gym, pick up the kids,\" said HelloFresh's Australian chief executive Tom Rutledge, who once enjoyed a stint on MasterChef. \"It doesn't leave much time for cooking a healthy dinner, but people want to still do it.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Rutledge delivered a couple of hundred ready-to-cook kits to Sydney homes in a van each week. Now, he orchestrates a fleet of 50 trucks across NSW, Queensland and Victoria and expects the fast-emerging category to \"grow and grow and grow\".\n\nMy Food Bag has aggressive expansion plans in Australia,\n\n\u201cWe have 8000 subscribers in New Zealand now, which has 4.4 million people \u2013 that's about the population of Sydney,\" said Tim Elwin, general manger of the local arm.\n\nHelloFresh customers can adjust boxes to receive three-night or five-night menus for two, four or six people, but have no choice over the dishes.\n\nMy Food Bag offers three bags tailored to different types of households, including the \"gourmet\" bag for \"restaurant-quality dishes\" and the \"family\" bag for those who relish pizzas, sliders and burgers.\n\nThe \"classic\" bag, which has five meals for four adults, is the priciest at $199 a week or $10 a head. But Mr Elwin said the benefits justified the price, with a product-to-product comparison showing it matched or came under that of supermarkets.\n\n\u201cConvenience aside, the produce we supply is free-range, preservative-free, and exceptional,\u201d he said.\n\nMy Food Bag has enlisted Miguel Maestre of Channel Ten's The Living Room to design its recipes and promote its products. Alongside him are dieticians, recipe testers and food stylists.\n\n\"This is going to change how Australians have dinner,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t have to go to the supermarket and buy one kilogram of rice, because I\u2019ll give you the 200 grams you need, the quail, the star anise, a head of garlic. I\u2019ll put it in your fridge.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "hellofresh, my food bag, deliveries, online shopping, tom rutledge, miguel masetre, blue apron, plated, meal kit, cooking", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "A booming number of Sydney families have abandoned their weekly grocery runs, instead opting for services that drop a box of recipe cards and fresh, pre-measured ingredients at their doorstep each week.", "title": "Cook-at-home meal kits on the rise as second business enters Australian market", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/cookathome-meal-kits-on-the-rise-as-second-business-enters-australian-market-20140724-zwbhn.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "title": "Cook-at-home meal kits on the rise as second business enters Australian market", "description": "A booming number of Sydney families have abandoned their weekly grocery runs, instead opting for services that drop a box of recipe cards and fresh, pre-measured ingredients at their doorstep each week.", "card": "summary", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "A booming number of Sydney families have abandoned their weekly grocery runs, instead opting for services that drop a box of recipe cards and fresh, ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce544\"", "article_summary": "My Food Bag has enlisted Miguel Maestre of Channel Ten's The Living Room to design its recipes and promote its products.\nMy Food Bag offers three bags tailored to different types of households, including the \"gourmet\" bag for \"restaurant-quality dishes\" and the \"family\" bag for those who relish pizzas, sliders and burgers.\nMy Food Bag in New Zealand was also attracted by the growth potential of Australia's \"infant\" market and will open a local arm on Monday.\nHelloFresh, which delivers 1 million meals a month across Europe and the US, received another $53 million from US investors involved in Twitter and Tumblr last month.\nTwo years ago, Rutledge delivered a couple of hundred ready-to-cook kits to Sydney homes in a van each week."}
