He said he didn\u2019t help them draft a manifesto challenging Colorado\u2019s CMAS and PARCC tests.\n\nThe students gave speeches and waved multicolored cardboard placards including one that read, \u201cGood, Better, Best, We must Reform Our Test!\u201d and \u201cAnalyze this: A, B, C, D.\u201d\n\nThey passed out their seven-page manifesto asking for a three-year moratorium on standardized testing in Colorado so that flaws in the system can be fixed.\n\n\u201cWe ask that standardized tests in Colorado be owned and operated by the state, written by teachers, and be transparent to those who design the standard, and to teachers, who must design curriculum to meet the standard,\u201d the document says.\n\n\u201cWe feel like student voices aren\u2019t heard as much as they ought to be,\u201d senior Leigh Francia said just before the rally began.\n\nShe later gave a speech, in which she said Colorado teachers should write state tests, not Pearson, a \u201cgiant corporation,\u201d which has national rather than Colorado testing standards in mind.\n\n\u201cWe are being sold a test,\u201d Francia said. \u201cI would argue that the reason capitalism works is that there are winners and losers, and therefore an incentive to succeed. But public education is meant to serve everyone; we don\u2019t want winners and losers.\u201d\n\nPoudre High School student Anson MacKinney said studying for the CMAS and PARCC tests and taking the tests is too time-consuming.\n\n\u201cI witnessed firsthand how detrimental over 10 hours of testing spread over three days was,\u201d MacKinney said. \u201cFor months I\u2019ve been seeing how behind we are and only recently have we caught up.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Mariner Gonzalez, a senior, said the CMAS tests require students to regurgitate facts and don\u2019t test a student\u2019s ability to analyze or create.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if they are trying to make sheep rather than students,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nAya Ahmad said that the state\u2019s testing program doesn\u2019t necessarily test what students have actually been studying.\n\n\u201cBut what if you have been taking chemistry for the past year, and are asked a physics question about kinetic energy? Or a trigonometry question when all you\u2019ve been doing is calculus?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fort Collins student test protesters: \u201cThink Outside the Bubble\u201d", "title": "Fort Collins student test protesters: \u201cThink Outside the Bubble\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/07/fort-collins-student-test-protesters-think-outside-the-bubble/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150307_012331_test-protest-sign-making.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150307_012331_test-protest-sign-making.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-07T13:00:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T15:05:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda12f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey wanted to make a statement by coming on a weekend,\u201d said Poudre High School history teacher Russell Brown.\nAbout 50 Fort Collins high school students took time out of a gloriously warm Saturday to protest Colorado\u2019s \u201ccorporate\u201d testing system that they say relies too heavily on rote-memory \u201cbubble\u201d questions.\nShe later gave a speech, in which she said Colorado teachers should write state tests, not Pearson, a \u201cgiant corporation,\u201d which has national rather than Colorado testing standards in mind.\nAya Ahmad said that the state\u2019s testing program doesn\u2019t necessarily test what students have actually been studying.\nHe said he didn\u2019t help them draft a manifesto challenging Colorado\u2019s CMAS and PARCC tests."}
