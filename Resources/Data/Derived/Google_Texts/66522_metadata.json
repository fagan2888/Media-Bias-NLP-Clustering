This way of thinking is known as the Triple Bottom Line model, referring to the effects on the community beyond traditional profit and loss.\n\nIn 2010, city staff presented a draft plan to council after two years of working with a consultant and soliciting feedback from a wide range of community members and organizations.\n\nThe council discussed the plan extensively, some council members singling out a draft objective to ensure all members of the community are able to meet their basic needs as not the role of a municipal government.\n\nThe City Council shelved the plan indefinitely in 2011 until a council with mostly new members resurrected it in May, directing staff to bring it back with a timeline and measurable goals.\n\nNow the plan must be further updated from its 2011-stage, complete with new rounds of public involvement which would piggyback on to the Envision Longmont planning already underway.\n\nThe problem: Longmont public works and natural resources staff are already busy with flood recovery work, and no one has time to also serve as sustainability coordinator to implement the plan, public works manager Dale Rademacher wrote in a council memo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo start implementing the plan, the council has the options of hiring both a consultant and a new sustainability coordinator this year, hire a consultant this year and the coordinator in 2016 or to hire a consultant and a temporary sustainability staff member this year and evaluate the temporary position when the plan is done.\n\nStaff are estimating that the consultant would cost anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 that can be offset with a $10,000 grant from Boulder County. A draft scope of work for the position specifies that the prospective consultant should come up with concrete goals that \"acknowledge community values and input\" and are \"realistic and achievable.\"\n\nAdditionally the consultant would be expected to meet with each of the city's five advisory boards as well as with staff in the public works and natural resources, power and communications, community services and planning departments.\n\nIf the sustainability coordinator is hired, that position will be funded from water, stormwater, power and communications, sanitation, wastewater and street revenues.\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28569053/longmont-council-look-at-sustainability-staffing-questions", "modificationDate": "2015-08-02T10:05:39-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By Karen Antonacci \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Longmont city council on Tuesday will discuss how many people to hire to start the oft-discussed but never-implemented sustainability plan.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28569053:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-02T11:00:00-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28569053/longmont-council-look-at-sustainability-staffing-questions", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Longmont city council on Tuesday will discuss how many people to hire to start the oft-discussed but never-implemented sustainability plan.", "title": "Longmont council to look at sustainability staffing questions"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Longmont city council on Tuesday will discuss how many people to hire to start the oft-discussed but never-implemented sustainability plan.", "title": "Longmont council to look at sustainability staffing questions", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28569053/longmont-council-look-at-sustainability-staffing-questions", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-02T11:00:00-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-02T07:21:52-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont council to look at sustainability staffing questions", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Karen AntonacciStaff", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-07-31T19:24:17-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Longmont city council on Tuesday will discuss how many people to hire to start the oft-discussed but never-implemented sustainability plan.\nIf the sustainability coordinator is hired, that position will be funded from water, stormwater, power and communications, sanitation, wastewater and street revenues.\nIn 2010, city staff presented a draft plan to council after two years of working with a consultant and soliciting feedback from a wide range of community members and organizations.\nThe City Council shelved the plan indefinitely in 2011 until a council with mostly new members resurrected it in May, directing staff to bring it back with a timeline and measurable goals.\nThe council discussed the plan extensively, some council members singling out a draft objective to ensure all members of the community are able to meet their basic needs as not the role of a municipal government."}
