The mortgage companies have to shrink their large investment portfolios that have traditionally been a key profit engine.\n\nAs a result, \u201ceven if truly rehabilitating the [companies] were possible, recapitalizing them adequately would take at least 20 years,\u201d Ms. Miller said.\n\nThe uncertain future of the companies has also contributed to the mortgage industry\u2019s reluctance to extend loans to borrowers without perfect credit, she said, which has \u201ceffectively shut many Americans out of the [housing] market.\u201d In opting for an administrative revamp of the companies, \u201cwe would also be signing up for another 20 years of under-serving responsible credit-worthy Americans seeking to buy a home,\u201d she said.\n\nTwenty years is a long time, and Ms. Miller didn\u2019t address the assumptions behind that time frame, such as what would constitute an adequate level of capitalization. Many industry officials have said Fannie and Freddie would have withstood the latest crisis with at least 5% capital. The comments also hint at a long transition no matter what is done to resolve the limbo status of the companies.\n\nMs. Miller also defended a controversial arrangement in which the Treasury last year began collecting all of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s profits as dividend payments, arguing that replacing an existing 10% dividend was necessary to assure markets that the companies wouldn\u2019t need to borrow money to fund those dividend payments.\n\nThe changes were \u201call designed for the purpose of protecting the [companies] and making sure that we could keep the doors open,\u201d she said. The Treasury Department is fighting around 20 lawsuits from investors challenging those changes.\n\nSome industry executives have suggested that pieces of Fannie and Freddie, such as their apartment-financing units, could be sold off while the companies remain in a government-run conservatorship, but Ms. Miller said those ideas were a nonstarter with Treasury. \u201cWe would not consider any spin-off without legislation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Treasury on Thursday said that Ms. Miller would leave the administration in early September after more than four years at the department.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "It would take at least 20 years to adequately recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a top Treasury official said Friday.", "title": "Official: Recapitalizing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Would Take 20 Years", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/13/official-recapitalizing-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-would-take-20-years/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Official: Recapitalizing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Would Take 20 Years", "description": "It would take at least 20 years to adequately recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a top Treasury official said Friday.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Nick Timiraos and Joe Light", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "It would take at least 20 years to adequately recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a top Treasury official said Friday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-13T16:26:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/13/official-recapitalizing-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-would-take-20-years/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-26091", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "It would take at least 20 years to adequately recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a top Treasury official said Friday.", "title": "Official: Recapitalizing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Would Take 20 Years", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/13/official-recapitalizing-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-would-take-20-years/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-26091", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-13T16:26:58-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde441\"", "article_summary": "As a result, \u201ceven if truly rehabilitating the [companies] were possible, recapitalizing them adequately would take at least 20 years,\u201d Ms. Miller said.\nMany industry officials have said Fannie and Freddie would have withstood the latest crisis with at least 5% capital.\nThe Treasury on Thursday said that Ms. Miller would leave the administration in early September after more than four years at the department.\nTwenty years is a long time, and Ms. Miller didn\u2019t address the assumptions behind that time frame, such as what would constitute an adequate level of capitalization.\nGetty ImagesIt would take at least 20 years to adequately recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a top Treasury official said Friday, the latest effort by the Obama administration to push back against arguments that the government-controlled mortgage-finance giants could be restored as private companies without legislation."}
