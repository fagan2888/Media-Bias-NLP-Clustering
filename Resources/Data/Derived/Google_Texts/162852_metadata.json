As if the following story isn\u2019t delicious enough, the icing on the cake is the source: Politico.\n\nCue the violins and break out the hankies. Time for a pity party, courtesy of Jonathan Allen and Jennifer Haberkorn:\n\nVeteran House Democratic aides are sick over the insurance prices they\u2019ll pay under Obamacare, and they\u2019re scrambling to find a cure.\n\n\u201cIn a shock to the system, the older staff in my office (folks over 59) have now found out their personal health insurance costs (even with the government contribution) have gone up 3-4 times what they were paying before,\u201d Minh Ta, chief of staff to Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), wrote to fellow Democratic chiefs of staff in an email message obtained by POLITICO. \u201cSimply unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIn the email, Ta noted that older congressional staffs may leave their jobs because of the change to their health insurance.\n\nIt goes without saying, but it\u2019s fun to say anyway: Gwen Moore voted for Obamacare.\n\nHere\u2019s the statement she made about it on March 21, 2010:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s vote caps off more than a year of debate and makes good on our promise to deliver health insurance reform for the American people. Every day people are denied coverage or kicked off insurance. This means life and death; this means bankruptcy; this means higher costs for everyone. This bill changes that.\u201d\n\nWould you care to amend that statement, Rep. Moore?\n\n\u201cSimply unacceptable\u201d sums up most of the country\u2019s longstanding attitude about the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s neither affordable nor caring. It is, however, an act. It\u2019s all an act.\n\nYou had to pass it to find out what was in it, you geniuses. Now you know. Now we all know.\n\nOne more wafer-thin mint of schadenfreude: The Affordable Care Act will survive. So said \u2026 Gwen Moore.\n\nLast Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jim Treacher", "description": "Boo-hoo", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Is it possible to overdose on schadenfreude?
