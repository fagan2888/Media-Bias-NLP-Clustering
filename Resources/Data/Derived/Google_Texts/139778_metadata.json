(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nThe political mind of former Arkansas governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee must be a very interesting place -- a place that looks and feels a lot like 2004.\n\nBuzzFeed spotted a video of Huckabee\u2019s February address at the 2015 National Religious Broadcasters Convention in Nashville, Tenn. The video was posted online this weekend by World Net Daily. In it, Huckabee shared some thoughts on transgender Americans.\n\n\"Now I wish that someone told me that when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in PE,\u201d said Huckabee. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that I would have found my feminine side and said, \u2018Coach, I think I'd rather shower with the girls today.\u2019 You\u2019re laughing because it sounds so ridiculous doesn\u2019t it?\"\n\nFor most people, Huckabee\u2019s comments seem a little out of date, perhaps even bigoted. This is a country in which a gold-medal-winning Olympian and one-time mascot of American masculinity just revealed that he is a transgender Republican, and then posed for the cover of Vanity Fair to share a new name, Caitlyn Jenner, along with a new gender identity and personal story.\n\nHuckabee's February comments might have gone over quite well back in 2004, when so-called \u201cvalues voters\u201d dominated most of the waking hours and dreams of political operatives and candidates alike. In 2004, a mostly-Republican contingent of lawmakers pushed constitutional bans on gay marriage onto state ballots, which the Karl Rove-led George W. Bush campaign ably leveraged to draw conservative voters to the polls. While casting a vote against gay marriage, Republicans could also cast a vote for Bush. And despite some post-election equivocation about the role that the gay marriage measures played in helping Bush return to the White House, Rove was utterly plain about the role that \u201cmoral values\u201d played in the 2004 election.\n\nRove told the New York Times:\n\n\"I do think it was part and parcel of a broader fabric where this year moral values ranked higher than they traditionally do,\" he said, adding: \"I think people would be well advised to pay attention to what the American people are saying. ... You're starting to see some growth of the Republican Party in places where you might not think there was a chance for growth.\"\n\nAnd \u201cmoral values\u201d did, in fact, rank among the top concerns and vote motivators in the 2004 contest.\n\nBut this is 2015, where what precisely the list of moral values should contain has, for much of the country, shifted. Somewhere around 2011, the share of American voters who believe that government should \u201cpromote traditional values\" slipped below the portion who think the state should not back any particular set of values. A December CNN/ORC International poll found that same split not only remains, but has grown.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the huge shift leftward on issues like gay marriage and marijuana. A recent Gallup poll shows the number of Americans who consider themselves socially liberal just hit a new high.\n\nSo Huckabee\u2019s on-stage befuddlement at that Christian broadcaster\u2019s gathering back in February \u2013 genuine or feigned \u2013 probably can't be described as an effort geared toward the general election.\n\nStill, an audience for Huckabee\u2019s version of traditional moral values does exist. And a lot of it lives in Iowa, a state Huckabee won in 2008. After Huckabee made some similarly questionable comments accusing Beyonce essentially of allowing Jay-Z to pimp her out, a poll showed about four in 10 likely Iowa caucus-goers were on the same page -- even as the state as a whole clearly wasn't.\n\n[40 percent of likely Iowa GOP caucus goers say Beyonce is \u2018mental poison\u2019]\n\nThis is increasingly part-and-parcel to Huckabee's appeals to social conservatives. Let us not forget that special moment in 2014 when Huckabee described the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control coverage mandate as \u201cUncle Sugar,\u201d a demeaning government effort to manage American womanhood\u2019s unwieldy libido.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of aw-shucks, flyover-country-versus-the freaky-coasts politics that a former Fix-er pointed out back in January. That dynamic amounted to central theme in Huckabee\u2019s book, and it seems to be a real part of Huckabee\u2019s 2016 GOP primary campaign strategy.\n\nEven if other candidates are backing out of the Iowa straw poll, or seem poised to do so, Huckabee appears to be going all-in. He wants the state to be as important as possible, for obvious reasons.\n\nWhat's most puzzling about all of this is that Huckabee has huge potential as a politician. But he always seems to be fighting yesterday's battles and aiming for an ever-shrinking constituency. Maybe that's where his heart is, but it's not helping his party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This campaign feels very 2004.
