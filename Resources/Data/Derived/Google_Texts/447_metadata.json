Bias based on skin color is clearly wrong because people are born that way. Political beliefs, on the other hand, are explicitly chosen.\n\nIf a political party in the United States advocated hate and violence in the streets, and other people shunned its members, no reasonable person would call this \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d\n\nLikewise, if a political party consistently commits harm by its actions, and you consistently vote for that party, it is reasonable for others to judge you for your votes.\n\nDANIEL BARRETT\n\nNewtonville, Mass., Oct. 28, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nDavid Brooks seems to think that party affiliation is a cancer that is degrading civil discourse and has become the new face of discrimination. But it is more a question of partisan ideology that morphs into extremism than party identity.\n\nIdeological extremism has replaced party affiliation.

We few Democrats and progressives have learned, sometimes in harsh circumstances, to remain quiet on many issues.\n\nA year ago, after I scrounged around to find female Democrats, seven of us gathered for lunch and to talk freely. The relief was palpable. Many of us had no outlet for our thoughts.\n\nIn three months the lunch ladies grew in number to 94, and we named ourselves \u201cthe Abigails,\u201d after Abigail Adams, who prevailed upon her husband, John, \u201cto remember the ladies\u201d when writing the Declaration of Independence, even though he didn\u2019t remember the ladies and it took almost 150 years to get the women\u2019s vote.\n\nThere are now 233 members of our group, and another group meets in Charleston, S.C. We have quietly found our cohort.\n\nBRENDA TURNER\n\nSavannah, Ga., Oct. 28, 2014", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141102184930, "twitter": {"description": "Readers take issue with a column by David Brooks.", "title": "Personal and Political: Judging People by Their Party", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/opinion/personal-and-political-judging-people-by-their-party.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003209186"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/opinion/personal-and-political-judging-people-by-their-party.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003209186", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/opinion/personal-and-political-judging-people-by-their-party.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Personal and Political: Judging People by Their Party", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 2, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-11-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2014-11-02", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Discrimination,Democratic Party,Republican Party,United States Politics and Government", "news_keywords": "Discrimination", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers take issue with a column by David Brooks.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Readers take issue with a column by David Brooks.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "org": "Republican Party", "slug": "l03brooks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141102230203, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/opinion/personal-and-political-judging-people-by-their-party.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Readers take issue with a column by David Brooks.", "title": "Personal and Political: Judging People by Their Party"}, "pdate": 20141102, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003209186, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Personal and Political: Judging People by Their Party", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde76a\"", "article_summary": "If a political party in the United States advocated hate and violence in the streets, and other people shunned its members, no reasonable person would call this \u201cdiscrimination.\u201dLikewise, if a political party consistently commits harm by its actions, and you consistently vote for that party, it is reasonable for others to judge you for your votes.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyLARRY HOFFNERNew York, Oct. 28, 2014To the Editor:\u201cPartyism\u201d can be extremely oppressive.\nBRENDA TURNERSavannah, Ga., Oct. 28, 2014\nTo the Editor:David Brooks\u2019s Oct. 28 column about \u201cpartyism\u201d mixes apples and oranges.\nDANIEL BARRETTNewtonville, Mass., Oct. 28, 2014To the Editor:David Brooks seems to think that party affiliation is a cancer that is degrading civil discourse and has become the new face of discrimination."}
