Typically in her backpack, Sophie carries two notebooks, 2 large binders and a lunch bag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to carry it all around\u2014sometimes I drop stuff,\u201d said Sophie. The middle school student says she also carries a couple of books because she loves to read.\n\nOverstuffed backpacks are quite common - just watch any group of children boarding a bus or walking around school.\n\nThe heavy bags are known to cause long-term issues with the natural curves of the spine. \u201cIf any of those curves are flattened, that can make the back less stable,\u201d said Chris Billiar, WakeMed physical therapist.\n\nBilliar says that the heavy bags put a strain on the tiny muscles of the back. He recommends choosing backpacks with padded straps and a padded back.\n\nThe bag also should be properly adjusted to fit the child\u2019s size. Billiar says, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be too long or too short with the straps. Ideally, the pack should have a waist strap and/or a chest strap to relieve some of the pressure.\u201d\n\nConsumer Reports recommends keeping the weight of backpacks to about 10 percent of the child\u2019s weight. If the child is 80 pounds, the pack should only weigh about 8 pounds.\n\nComputer bags, also called messenger bags, are gaining popularity among students. These bags only have one strap slung over the shoulder. Experts recommend backpacks with two straps, which distribute the weight more evenly.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-09-12 17:45:00", "description": "The heavy bags are known to cause long-term issues with the natural curves of the spine.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2013-09-12 18:33:07", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=12880854|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "The heavy bags are known to cause long-term issues with the natural curves of the spine.", "title": "For students, heavy backpacks carry potential dangers  :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/for-students-heavy-backpacks-carry-potential-dangers-/12880854/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2013/09/12/12881185/12881186-1379025107-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T17:45:00-04:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "The heavy bags are known to cause long-term issues with the natural curves of the spine.", "title": "For students, heavy backpacks carry potential dangers  :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/for-students-heavy-backpacks-carry-potential-dangers-/12880854/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2013/09/12/12881185/36122-ht-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9b3\"", "article_summary": "He recommends choosing backpacks with padded straps and a padded back.\nOverstuffed backpacks are quite common - just watch any group of children boarding a bus or walking around school.\nExperts recommend backpacks with two straps, which distribute the weight more evenly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to carry it all around\u2014sometimes I drop stuff,\u201d said Sophie.\nThe heavy bags are known to cause long-term issues with the natural curves of the spine."}
