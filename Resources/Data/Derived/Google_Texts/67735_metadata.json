And the three-day inaugural Women\u2019s USA Pro Challenge was a huge success.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so pleased to see this huge crowd like I got to experience for the women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe women gave a great show, we\u2019ve got some great talent here. There\u2019s a World Cup going on right now for women\u2019s cycling (in Sweden). You\u2019re not reading about that in the cycling news, you\u2019re reading about this race. Already it\u2019s No. 1 on the list.\u201d\n\nCarpenter-Phinney hopes the attention that comes from the Pro Challenge will benefit all cyclists in Colorado, not just those who race.\n\nPHOTOS: Women\u2019s USA Pro Challenge, Stage 3\n\n\u201cColorado is a cycling-friendly place,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual that you have this kind of a fan base because they like to ride bikes, they like to see the people they read about and hear about, they like to admire that level of that ability and aspire to that level. But I think more importantly, it\u2019s important for us in Colorado to keep the roads safe for the kids that are riding. My kids always rode their bikes to school. The bike is for everybody. We need to keep it safe for everybody. That includes our scenic roads as well as our town roads.\u201d\n\nGoing for it\n\nAfter an hour of frantic laps on a 1.5-mile course and averaging almost 24 mph in a lead pack of more than 20 riders, stage winner Coryn Rivera (UnitedHealthcare) made her move onto the downhill two turns from the finish.\n\n\u201cIt was a really fast finish,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI had a feeling that I wanted to be first out of the last corner, just because it was so fast and it was a little off-camber and wanted to take that risk on my own without anyone near me. I shot the second to the last corner and took the last corner on my own and just let it all out.\u201d\n\nBragging rights\n\nMara Abbott to the cycling world: Told you so.\n\nColorado came through just as she knew it would for the first Women\u2019s Pro Challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been amazing,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been really fun to be able to show off the place I\u2019m most proud of to the world, to show everyone that I\u2019ve raced against on a regular basis. Everyone in the bike world knows how obsessed I am about Colorado because I won\u2019t stop talking about it. To be able to bring them here and then to have these sorts of crowds, it\u2019s almost like a set-up of being able to say, \u2018Ha, ha, this is what I\u2019ve been talking about.\u2019 \u201c\n\nEmotional day\n\nA lot of people got emotional seeing the turnout in Golden for the third day of women\u2019s racing. That included women\u2019s racer directory Sean Petty.\n\n\u201cI looked up that hill today and seriously almost, tears came to my eyes, everybody out here for a women\u2019s race,\u201d Petty said. \u201cA lot of work went into this. We came in late on this decision, in April. Breckenridge, Fort Collins and certainly Golden not only stepped up but exceeded our expectations. I knew the women would put on a great, great three days of racing and they did.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Connie Carpenter-Phinney: Colorado is talk of women\u2019s cycling world", "title": "Connie Carpenter-Phinney: Colorado is talk of women\u2019s cycling world", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/connie-carpenter-phinney-colorado-is-talk-of-womens-cycling-world/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_033937_women-pro-challenge.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_033937_women-pro-challenge.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T15:42:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:10:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf623\"", "article_summary": "Colorado came through just as she knew it would for the first Women\u2019s Pro Challenge.\nAnd the three-day inaugural Women\u2019s USA Pro Challenge was a huge success.\nPHOTOS: Women\u2019s USA Pro Challenge, Stage 3\u201cColorado is a cycling-friendly place,\u201d she said.\n1 on the list.\u201dCarpenter-Phinney hopes the attention that comes from the Pro Challenge will benefit all cyclists in Colorado, not just those who race.\nI knew the women would put on a great, great three days of racing and they did.\u201dJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer"}
