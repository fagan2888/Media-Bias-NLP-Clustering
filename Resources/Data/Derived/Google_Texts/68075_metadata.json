Budget lapses would be a thing of the past under a new proposal from a House Democrat who wants to put an end to them for good.\n\nRep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) said this week that he is seeking co-sponsors for a \u201cShut Down the Shutdowns Act\u201d that would automatically extend existing appropriations levels for another fiscal year whenever Congress fails to fund agencies before their money expires.\n\n\u201cIt changes the default from shutdown to the same budget,\u201d Grayson said during an interview with The Post on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think the founders ever intended us to face one shutdown after another.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep.

(Jay Mallin/Bloomberg)\n\nBoth parties have tried in the past to use shutdowns and shutdown warnings as leverage to win concessions on hot-button issues ranging from spending to abortion. But Republicans have led the most recent efforts, which occurred during the Clinton and Obama administrations.\n\nThis year, conservative lawmakers threatened to allow Department of Homeland Security funding to lapse unless President Obama approved legislation to roll back his recent plans for shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. Neither side was initially willing to budge.\n\nThe standoff left Homeland Security employees, including personnel who patrol U.S. borders, inspect cargo and screen airplane passengers, spending weeks in doubt. Under a shutdown scenario, those whose jobs are vital to national security would have to work without pay, while all others would be sent home to wait for the funding lapse to end.\n\nAfter agreeing to a one-week extension of Homeland Security appropriations last Friday, Congress finally passed a bill this week to fully fund the department for the remainder of the fiscal year with no provision to block Obama\u2019s controversial immigration orders.\n\nFederal employees were less fortunate in 2013, when Congress allowed a partial shutdown to occur amid GOP attempts to defund the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Closures also happened in 1995 and 1996, when Republicans were fighting with President Bill Clinton over spending on Medicare, education, the environment and public health.\n\n\u201cThe evil dynamic of all this is that, over and over again, we\u2019re confronted with the same two choices: Pass a bill or see the government shut down,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cIt represents a risk to the country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Grayson can win over enough Republicans to push his bill through Congress at a time when the power of the purse is one of their biggest bargaining chips, but GOP lawmakers have supported and even sponsored similar legislation in the past.\n\nRep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) introduced a nearly identical anti-shutdown bill in 2013, and former congressman George Gekas (R-Pa.) pitched legislation in 1999 to ensure that a closure would not occur the following year.\n\nEighteen Republicans co-sponsored the former bill, while 30 backed the latter one. In his quest to rally support for the \u201cShut Down the Shutdowns Act,\u201d Grayson could start with that batch of GOP lawmakers, or at least those who are still serving in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proposal would automatically extend existing funding levels whenever Congress fails to pass appropriations.
