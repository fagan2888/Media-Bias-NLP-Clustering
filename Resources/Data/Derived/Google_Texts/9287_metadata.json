Speaking to human resources professionals, health care providers and policy makers is still an important part of many insurance companies\u2019 marketing plans.\n\nAetna, one of the largest of the companies, will introduce a new campaign on Tuesday aimed at those groups. It will highlight the company\u2019s goal of cutting billions of dollars of expenditures through so-called Big Data, electronic health records and other technologies as well as encouraging better coordination among health care providers. The campaign, called \u201cOur Healthy,\u201d will run online, in print and on mobile devices through the end of 2013.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the health care system is desperately in need of improvement,\u201d said Robert Mead, the senior vice president of marketing, product and communications at Aetna. Mr. Mead cited a report by the Institute of Medicine that tallied more than $760 billion in health care \u201cwaste\u201d created annually as a result of consumer fraud, unnecessary procedures and excessive administrative costs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe campaign was created by OgilvyOne in New York and is an extension of a consumer campaign called \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Healthy?\u201d that Aetna began earlier this year. Both \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Healthy?\u201d and \u201cOur Healthy\u201d are part of a $50 million advertising and marketing strategy for the company.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a consumer, you don\u2019t know what things cost,\u201d Mr. Mead said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what things are worth. You don\u2019t always know how to get the most value out of the health system. We have to bring everybody to the table.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Mead said the campaign also stressed the need for health care providers to shift to a model known as \u201caccountable care,\u201d which shifts their reimbursement models for health care professionals from being paid for the volume of services they perform to being paid based on the outcomes of patient care. Accountable care systems are usually linked to technologies that help health care providers measure performance and manage patient data. Aetna has 27 accountable health care agreements with hospitals and other health care providers around the country.\n\nA video for the \u201cOur Healthy\u201d campaign features Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, explaining the company\u2019s goals. \u201cUnless you fix that health care system, you cannot fix the economy,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said in the video. \u201cIf we fix just 20 percent of it, we could pay for the Affordable Care Act. We could insure everyone without increasing taxes.\u201d\n\nLike other insurance companies, Aetna has over the last few years been ramping up its technical products and services. It created Healthagen, a division of the company that sells health technology services to consumers and providers, like a mobile application that helps patients assess their symptoms and find doctors.\n\n\u201cThe fee-for-service model is broken,\u201d Mr. Mead said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act encourages the system to move to accountable care,\u201d he added. \u201cThe challenge with that is that doctors and hospitals need technology and support to make that work.\u201d\n\nBut more technology and more data may not solve the problem of waste in health care, said Robert S. Huckman, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School and the faculty co-chairman of the Harvard Business School Healthcare Initiative. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about having to manage waste in the system, most would agree that a lack of coordination rests at the heart of a lot of it,\u201d he said. \u201cData without an educated way of querying that data is not helpful. It is a start.\u201d\n\nWhile insurance companies like Aetna have access to vast amounts of patient data that could be used to manage costs, according to Mr. Huckman, the economic impact of even widely adopted technologies like electronic health records is still unclear. \u201cWithin providers and within a hospital, the electronic records have made greater inroads. But the question of moving toward greater coordination and greater interoperability is an issue we are still grappling with.\u201d\n\nThe cost of health care, however, is something everyone can agree is too high, Mr. Huckman said: \u201cI think the cost issue is most salient right now for most Americans. It hits you front and center when you look at some of the prices.\u201d He noted how costs could vary widely depending on where a person lived and who their insurer was. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t vary that much,\u201d Mr. Huckman said. \u201cThe cost of a product on Amazon is the same no matter where I buy it from. It does defy a little bit of explanation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130902201306, "twitter": {"description": "The insurance company\u2019s \u201cOur Healthy\u201d campaign will focus on cutting waste in health care spending through technological innovation.", "creator": "tanzinavega", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/business/media/with-change-coming-aetna-targets-employers.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002417834"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "With Change Coming, Aetna Targets Employers", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/03/business/ADCO/ADCO-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/business/media/with-change-coming-aetna-targets-employers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002417834", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/business/media/with-change-coming-aetna-targets-employers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/media", "hdl_p": "With Change Coming, Aetna Targets Employers", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/media/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 2, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/v/tanzina_vega/index.html", "section": "Media", "modified": "2014-08-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/media/index.jsonp", "tag": "Aetna Inc", "published": "2013-09-02", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Advertising and Marketing,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Aetna Inc", "description": "The insurance company\u2019s \u201cOur Healthy\u201d campaign will focus on cutting waste in health care spending through technological innovation.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Tanzina Vega", "SCG": "media", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "03adco", "byl": "By TANZINA VEGA", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The insurance company\u2019s \u201cOur Healthy\u201d campaign will focus on cutting waste in health care spending through technological innovation.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20140807070117, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/03/business/ADCO/ADCO-thumbStandard.jpg", "CN": "advertising", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 2, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Aetna Inc", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/business/media/with-change-coming-aetna-targets-employers.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/03/business/ADCO/ADCO-videoLarge.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The insurance company\u2019s \u201cOur Healthy\u201d campaign will focus on cutting waste in health care spending through technological innovation.", "title": "With Change Coming, Aetna Targets Employers"}, "pdate": 20130902, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "news", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/advertising", "tagline": "The companies, people and new technologies that are shaping the marketing and advertising business.", "uri": "/column/advertising", "display-name": "Advertising", "identifier": "advertising", "type": "column"}, "col": "Advertising", "articleid": 100000002417834, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "With Change Coming, Aetna Targets Employers", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/03/business/ADCO/ADCO-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8396\"", "article_summary": "AS the country marches toward a new health insurance system, insurance companies have spent millions on consumer advertising to position themselves as health care companies.\nAetna has 27 accountable health care agreements with hospitals and other health care providers around the country.\nBut because a majority of Americans are insured through their employers, the insurance companies have to reach several audiences.\nWe could insure everyone without increasing taxes.\u201dLike other insurance companies, Aetna has over the last few years been ramping up its technical products and services.\nSpeaking to human resources professionals, health care providers and policy makers is still an important part of many insurance companies\u2019 marketing plans."}
