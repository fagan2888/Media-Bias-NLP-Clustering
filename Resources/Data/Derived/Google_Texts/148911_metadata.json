The cost of a broken arm, or delivering a baby, or a sprained ankle is different if you live in Grand Junction or Colorado Springs, Denver or Walsenburg, Lamar or Pueblo. And those costs are key factors in health insurance premiums.\n\nThe Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI), part of the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA), is going to dig into why those costs are different.\n\nHouse Bill 1336 was recently passed, and was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper on May 18. This bill directs the DOI to \u201cdetermine the impacts and viability of establishing a single geographic area\u201d for setting health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cWe welcome this study because we want to know more,\u201d said Colorado Insurance Commissioner, Marguerite Salazar. \u201cThe Division was involved in this bill since it began, working with the legislature and the mountain communities. We know differences in the costs of healthcare drive the differences in health insurance premiums, but we want to know what\u2019s behind those healthcare costs.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the state is divided into nine geographic areas. Health insurance companies can differentiate their premiums between the geographic areas. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) required states to create geographic areas, recognizing that different areas had different providers, healthcare costs and patterns. Each area had to have similar healthcare costs within its region. For 2014, the DOI originally established 11 areas for the state. After a study in 2014 that looked at healthcare costs, these were reduced to nine areas.\n\nBut why does this bill ask the DOI to study a move to a single geographic area? Some people believe that having one geographic area will make health insurance more affordable for Coloradans. Others think that a single geographic area could lead to fewer insurance companies wanting to do business in the state, which would push up premiums.\n\nThe DOI will look at the potential impacts, both positive and negative, such a change would bring. And to study it, the Division will need to look at the heart of the matter, healthcare costs. In fact, the bill directs the DOI to study the healthcare costs that lead to differences in premiums throughout the state, specifically calling out five areas to put under the microscope.\n\n\n\nPrescription drugs\n\nProvider rates (what doctors and hospitals charge)\n\nDiagnostic tests (x-rays, scans, lab work, etc.)\n\nSurgical procedures\n\nOther hospital procedures and services\n\nThe study will analyze the healthcare cost information to determine how a single geographic rating area will impact insurance premiums, and the competition of insurance companies in this state.\n\nDOI\u2019s report is due to the legislature on August 1, 2016. However, if any changes to the state\u2019s geographic rating areas are recommended, those changes would not be put into place until 2018. It is too late to make changes for 2017, as the deadline for health insurance companies to submit their 2017 plans and premiums to the DOI was May 13, 2016.\n\nThe Division will review geographic rating support for the 2017 plans to ensure that the premiums are justified.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pagosadailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16LogoPDP_120.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Healthcare costs and health insurance premiums in Colorado are different depending on where you live.\nThis bill directs the DOI to \u201cdetermine the impacts and viability of establishing a single geographic area\u201d for setting health insurance premiums.\nAnd those costs are key factors in health insurance premiums.\nSome people believe that having one geographic area will make health insurance more affordable for Coloradans.\nThe Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI), part of the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA), is going to dig into why those costs are different."}
