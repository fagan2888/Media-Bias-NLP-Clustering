Six people, including a firefighter, were taken to a local hospital after fire broke out at a Denver home early Tuesday morning.

The fire broke out about 2:45 a.m. at a single-family home in the 700 block of Newton Street, said Mark Watson, a Denver Fire Department spokesman.

When firefighters arrived smoke was streaming out the front door and from the north side of the home.

Five residents – two women, two men and a juvenile male — were taken to a local hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation, Watson said. A firefighter also went to the hospital to be treated for dehydration.

The fire was put out and investigators are working to determine the cause of the blaze.
