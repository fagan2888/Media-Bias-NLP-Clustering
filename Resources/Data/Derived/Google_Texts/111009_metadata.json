And so my grandmother would send me out to go shopping at Safeway, and everybody there always treated me very well. So I very much appreciate the good work you guys do.\u201d\n\nBut more recently, the workers of Safeway rejected the Obamacare exchanges in their contract negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe contract allows current employees and some future employees to keep their current health benefits rather than being shifted onto health care exchanges \u2014 an outcome that union leaders said resulted from member activism during bargaining that was complicated by additional costs imposed by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the Baltimore Sun reported on Dec. 17, 2013.\n\nThe contract was agreed to by two grocery chains, Giant and Safeway, with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 27 and Local 400 covering about 28,000 employees in Maryland, Washington, D.C. and Virginia.\n\nThe Republican National Committee pounced on the irony, issuing a press release declaring: \u201cObamacare wasn\u2019t the safe choice for Safeway workers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Maryland against a background of trucks, Obama pledged to direct the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department to double fuel efficiency standards by 2025.\n\nHe noted that big commercial delivery trucks make up just 4 percent of vehicles on the road, but account for 20 percent of pollution from vehicles.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in research to get more fuel economy gains,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThanks to a partnership between industry and my administration, the truck behind me was able to achieve a 75 percent improvement in fuel economy over the last year \u2014 75 percent. That\u2019s why we call this super truck. It\u2019s impressive, this one right here, as well. I mean, these are \u2014 first of all, they\u2019re really big. But you can see how they\u2019ve redesigned the truck in order for us to save fuel economy.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama hit a Safeway distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Md., on Tuesday, where he reminisced about the grocery chain at an event to announce fuel efficiency standards.    \u201cI have a little soft spot for Safeway in my heart because, some of you know, I...", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/18/the-interesting-detail-obama-perhaps-didnt-notice-about-where-he-gave-his-latest-speech/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/600x39973.jpg", "title": "The Interesting Detail Obama Perhaps Didn\u2019t Notice About Where He Gave His Latest Speech", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "interesting, detail, obama, perhaps, didnt, notice, about, where, he, gave, his, latest, speech", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, business, epa, obamacare, politics, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 142, "gplus-count": 0, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/766894", "categories": "barack-obama,epa,obamacare,business,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 168, "description": "President Barack Obama hit a Safeway distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Md., on Tuesday, where he reminisced about the grocery chain at an event to announce fuel efficiency standards.    \u201cI have a little soft spot for Safeway in my heart because, some of you know, I...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "President Barack Obama hit a Safeway distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Md., on Tuesday, where he reminisced about the grocery chain at an event to announce fuel efficiency standards.    \u201cI have a little soft spot for Safeway in my heart because, some of you know, I...", "title": "The Interesting Detail Obama Perhaps Didn\u2019t Notice About Where He Gave His Latest Speech", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/18/the-interesting-detail-obama-perhaps-didnt-notice-about-where-he-gave-his-latest-speech/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/600x39973.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 399}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-18T13:55:56+00:00", "twitter-count": 98}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f37\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSo that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in research to get more fuel economy gains,\u201d Obama said.\n\u201cI have a little soft spot for Safeway in my heart because, some of you know, I went to high school in Hawaii and I was living with my grandparents, and our main grocery store was Safeway,\u201d Obama said.\nBut you can see how they\u2019ve redesigned the truck in order for us to save fuel economy.\u201d\u2014Follow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter\nAnd so my grandmother would send me out to go shopping at Safeway, and everybody there always treated me very well.\nPresident Barack Obama hit a Safeway distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Md., on Tuesday, where he reminisced about the grocery chain at an event to announce fuel efficiency standards."}
