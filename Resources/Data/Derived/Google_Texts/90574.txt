She is the First Lady of the United States and in the heart of President Barack Obama. Today we extend happy birthday greetings to FLOTUS Michelle Obama who is celebrating her 52nd birthday. As the Obama family begin their final year in the White House, Mrs. Obama has rarely had a misstep while she has tackled the task of raising two beautiful daughters, with the assistance of her mother under a very glaring and harsh limelight that comes with the perks of the East Wing.

Each time I watch my 5 year-old nephew CHOOSE fresh broccoli when we dine out, I know the Let’s Move campaign spearheaded by Mrs. Obama has made a difference in the lives of American children. The program was designed to help stem the tide of childhood obesity which left unchecked is condemning our kids to lifelong health issues. The other key issue she has tackled is the needs of military families.

Finally, as a Harvard educated lawyer who enjoyed a successful career before her move to Washington D.C., Mrs. Obama has been a symbol of inspiration to young girls to strive for the stars. She has represented the United States with style and grace.

Happy Birthday Mrs. Obama – and many more.
