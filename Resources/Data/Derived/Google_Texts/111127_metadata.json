Leo Hidalgo, CC BY 2.0\n\n(Reuters Health) - Vaccinating young girls against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in risky sexual activity, a new study shows.\n\nTeen girls in the study who were vaccinated against HPV were no more likely to become pregnant or contract another sexually transmitted infection (STI) than girls who were not vaccinated, the researchers found.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all boys and girls receive three HPV shots, which protects against multiple strains of the virus, which can cause cervical, anal, penile and throat cancer.\n\nThere has only been one other study of the potential association between the HPV vaccine and risky sexual behavior, which was much smaller and also found no relationship, the authors write (see Reuters story of October 15, 2012 here: http://reut.rs/1fDWl0Z).\n\n\u201cOur study was almost 200 times larger than the previous study and found no evidence of an increase in risk,\u201d said lead author Leah M. Smith of McGill University in Montreal in an email.\n\nThe results, she added, \u201cshould help put any remaining uncertainty on this issue to rest.\u201d\n\nBeginning in 2007, all 8th grade girls in Ontario, around age 13, were offered all three doses of the HPV vaccine. Only half of the eligible girls did receive all three doses.\n\nUsing health databases in Ontario, the researchers studied more than 128,000 girls, half of whom were eligible for the vaccine in school. The other half had gone through grade 8 before the vaccine was offered. In grades 10 through 12, more than 10,000 of the girls became pregnant, and 6,000 contracted an STI.\n\nBut the girls who had been vaccinated were no more or less likely to experience pregnancy or an STI than those who had not been vaccinated, the researchers reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n\n\u201cThe few other studies on HPV vaccination and sexual behavior have focused on perceptions of changes in sexual behavior following vaccination, rather than actual behavior, or have relied on self-reports of sexual behavior, which are notoriously problematic to study because they are vulnerable to the recall bias, response bias, and social desirability bias,\u201d Smith said.\n\nBut in terms of actual sexual behavior, sexual health interventions consistently do not lead to increases in risky sexual behaviors, she said. Concerns about that question have led some parents to choose not to have their children vaccinated, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is also one of the main reasons why some Catholic school boards in Canada initially refused to be part of the country\u2019s publicly funded, school-based HPV vaccination program, and it is a reason why some religious organizations have spoken out against the vaccine,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSimilar concerns in the U.S. may be less of a barrier \u201cAt least two recent reports in the U.S. indicate that concern about increased risky sexual behavior is not a main reason to not get vaccinated,\u201d said Jane J. Kim, citing two articles identifying financial concerns and parental need for more information as major barriers to vaccination.\n\nKim, an associate professor of Health Decision Science at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, was not part of the new study.\n\nThe most common side effect of the vaccination is pain at the injection site, fainting or dizziness, but no fatalities or disease have been causally linked to either of the two HPV vaccines, Gardasil or Cervarix, Kim said.\n\nFewer than 60 percent of young people in the U.S. get the first shot in the series, and fewer than 40 percent receive all three, she said.\n\n\u201cOther studies have consistently shown that sexual health interventions do not increase risky sexual behavior, and some may even promote safer sexual behaviors,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis includes interventions aimed at improving condom access in schools and providing sexual health education to teens.\u201d\n\nBy Kathryn Doyle\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1ATHfzi Canadian Medical Association Journal, online December 8, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hpv, virus, no, increase, risky, sexual, activity, hpv, vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vaccinating young girls against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in risky sexual activity.", "title": "HPV Vaccine Doesn't Increase Risky Sexual Activity In Teens", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hpv-virus-no-increase-risky-sexual-activity-hpv-vaccine-313448", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/hpv-vaccine-teens.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vaccinating young girls against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in risky sexual activity.", "title": "HPV Vaccine Doesn't Increase Risky Sexual Activity In Teens", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hpv-virus-no-increase-risky-sexual-activity-hpv-vaccine-313448", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/hpv-vaccine-teens.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/08/hpv-vaccine-teens.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-08T14:06:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T14:06:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vaccinating young girls against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in risky sexual activity."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a52\"", "article_summary": "But in terms of actual sexual behavior, sexual health interventions consistently do not lead to increases in risky sexual behaviors, she said.\n\u201cOther studies have consistently shown that sexual health interventions do not increase risky sexual behavior, and some may even promote safer sexual behaviors,\u201d Smith said.\nVaccinating young girls against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in risky sexual activity.\nLeo Hidalgo, CC BY 2.0(Reuters Health) - Vaccinating young girls against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in risky sexual activity, a new study shows.\n\u201cThis includes interventions aimed at improving condom access in schools and providing sexual health education to teens.\u201dBy Kathryn DoyleSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1ATHfzi Canadian Medical Association Journal, online December 8, 2014."}
