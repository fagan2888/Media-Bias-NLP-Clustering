Unlike Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites though, which seek donations only, start-ups will be looking for investors, a difference that has critics warning of \u201ca cascade of abuses by [start-ups] luring investors to what may be risky and untenable business ventures,\u201d as this story in today\u2019s New York Times reports.\n\nFor political history buffs, today marks the 61st anniversary of Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cCheckers\u201d speech, in which he tried to persuade the public that he should remain on the Republican ticket, denied allegations that he dipped into a political slush fund and said that no matter what happened to him, he would keep the gift of a black and white dog his daughters had named Checkers.\n\nAnd today marks the birthdays of John Coltrane (born in Hamlet, N.C.), Ray Charles and, last but most definitely not least, Bruce Springsteen, who turns 64 today.\n\nI grew up two blocks from the beach and a just few more from Asbury Park, N.J., and was only an eighth-grader when our music teacher introduced us to an up-and-coming local artist who had just released his first album. Too young to have heard him play at his favorite venue, The Stone Pony, we were thrilled simply by the album cover, \u201cGreetings from Asbury Park.\u201d Little did we know then where it would all lead.\n\nBruce Springsteen came to define what it meant to be from the Jersey Shore, not only because he came of age where we lived and wrote about places we knew but also because he never really left the shore community.\n\nIt was not uncommon over the years to pass him in the street, park next to him at the gym, see him browsing through albums at Jack\u2019s Music Shoppe in Red Bank.\n\nAnd he loved to show up unannounced at small shore music venues to play a set with other musicians \u2013 well-known or just starting out.\n\nThe Count Basie Theater in Red Bank was one of those venues, the one Bruce often turned to when offering up his music for a local cause.\n\nNeeded him for a holiday fundraiser for struggling families in the area? Bruce showed up. He may not have known the families personally, but he knew about where they lived and what that meant.\n\nHere he is, Christmas 2008 at Count Basie, doing what he\u2019d done so many holidays before, this time with another shore musician, Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nHe\u2019d do that again during the years that followed.\n\nAnd after 9/11, when shore communities lost so many residents. He did know some of them personally, as most of us did.\n\nAnd again, after Hurricane Sandy.\n\nSo Happy Birthday Bruce, and thank you (not Snooki) for defining the \u201cJersey Shore.\u201d Nothing like it in the whole wide world . . . .", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "And he loved to show up unannounced at small shore music venues to play a set with other musicians \u2013 well-known or just starting out.\nAnd today marks the birthdays of John Coltrane (born in Hamlet, N.C.), Ray Charles and, last but most definitely not least, Bruce Springsteen, who turns 64 today.\nSo Happy Birthday Bruce, and thank you (not Snooki) for defining the \u201cJersey Shore.\u201d Nothing like it in the whole wide world .\nStarting today, small start-ups in the Triangle area (and elsewhere) can start crowdfunding, a la Kickstarter and Indiegogo, without having to register shares for public trading, thanks to the \u201cJumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act,\u201d or JOBS Act, enacted in 2012.\nThe Count Basie Theater in Red Bank was one of those venues, the one Bruce often turned to when offering up his music for a local cause."}
