For the nearly 33,000 who have coverage from PreferredOne, most who want to keep those policies next year will have to pay over 60 percent more, according to officials with the Minnesota Association of Health Underwriters who\u2019ve seen the company\u2019s rate data.\n\nTom Beckfeld, a self-employed snowplower and window cleaner from Big Lake, acknowledged he\u2019s worried about getting a big rate increase notice from PreferredOne. But he said he has saved so much money thanks to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s ban on excluding patients with preexisting conditions that he\u2019ll still be better off.\n\nBeckfeld, 56, has diabetes and high blood pressure. The only insurance he could get before MNsure cost about $750 a month. PreferredOne charges him $421 a month and covers much more, including drugs. He put the savings at about $12,000 this year.\n\n\u201cEven if PreferredOne doubled its rates and came more in line with Blue Cross and everybody else, I\u2019m still looking at saving thousands of dollars a year,\u201d he said.\n\nMost people who bought PreferredOne policies via MNsure are expected to switch to other carriers because PreferredOne \u2014which grabbed the largest market share by offering the lowest rates \u2014 is pulling out of the exchange. Consumers who qualify for tax credits definitely will have to choose other carriers because subsidies are available only through MNsure.\n\nPremiums for three of the four carriers sticking with MNsure will also rise, the plans have confirmed. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, which was No. 2 with 22 percent of the signups this year, will raise its premiums an average of 17.2 percent. HealthPartners\u2019s rate increases average 8.1 percent, while Medica\u2019s will rise just 1.8 percent. However, UCare\u2019s average premiums will fall 9.1 percent.\n\nState officials say MNsure will still offer some of the lowest premiums in the country.\n\nBlue Cross and HealthPartners recently started sending out renewal notices. Medica and UCare officials said theirs won\u2019t go out until early November, just ahead of open enrollment, which begins Nov. 15. A PreferredOne spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on its rates and renewal plans.\n\nHeidi Michaels, an insurance broker with Dyste Williams in St. Louis Park, said she\u2019s already helping clients sort out their options. For example, she has an Eden Prairie family of four with a PreferredOne plan with a $710 premium and a $4,000 deductible. The closest 2015 PreferredOne plan they could choose would cost 42 percent more with a $7,700 deductible, and their clinic isn\u2019t in that network. They could also choose a Blue Cross plan that includes their clinic and cuts their deductible to $2,000, but the premium is 37 percent higher and office visits are limited to two.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re left with not-great choices, but regardless of their choice they\u2019re going to have an increase,\u201d said Michaels, president-elect of the underwriters group.\n\nHealthPartners has already sent \u201cpre-renewal\u201d letters to help its members prepare, said Executive Vice President Andrea Walsh.\n\nAnthony Schmitz, a custom kayak builder and writer from St. Paul, indicated that he\u2019d be glad to get a renewal notice, whatever it says about a premium increase \u2014 at least it would be evidence that he\u2019s insured.\n\nLike many Minnesotans, Schmitz had difficulty enrolling due to technical problems with the MNsure website. He said he\u2019s paid his premiums regularly, but got a cancellation notice from Blue Cross in July and has been struggling to straighten things out.\n\n\u201cI believe as of yesterday I have insurance again, but who knows?\u201d Schmitz said.\n\nSigning up was also a \u201clong ordeal\u201d for pastor David Berge. But the 32-year-old, his wife, and two sons ultimately got Medica and UCare plans through the public Medical Assistance program for lower-income people, which comes without any premium. And a note in his mail recently was welcome.\n\n\u201cWe got a letter saying we were automatically re-enrolled, so we don\u2019t have to do anything, which is definitely good news,\u201d Berge said.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
