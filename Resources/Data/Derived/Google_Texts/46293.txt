The zoo's executive director says the cheetahs didn't go toward the boy or his parents and that several eyewitnesses saw the woman holding the child over the railing.

Zoo officials say the boy hurt his leg in the fall. Cleveland Fire Department spokesman Larry Gray says the toddler was treated for bumps and bruises at a hospital.
