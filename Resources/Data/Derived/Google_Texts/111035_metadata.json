The cafe, which was once the general store, is owned by Blair Campbell, a white woman raised in the area who lives down the road with her husband, originally from Jamaica, and their two children; the cafe also employs a black chef raised in Greenbrier County, just to the south. Pocahontas County, which contains Hillsboro, is 96 percent white, 1 percent black and 3 percent Latino or mixed race.\n\nIn an article that ran on Martin Luther King Day, I reported here that Hillsboro showed strong support for Campbell\u2019s family in the aftermath of the crime and that Hillsboro might be looked to as an example of how small rural towns can grapple with racism and their histories of exclusion. A group of Campbell\u2019s friends came out in six degree weather and helped her scrub the words off with brake fluid. In the days following, Campbell and supporters started a unity campaign called \u201cWe Are One,\u201d which has to date just shy of 1,500 likes, and organized a \u201cLove Fest\u201d potluck held at the Presbyterian Church, which was attended by more than 200 people. Campbell is well known in town as the owner of this prominent business; when the Derecho wind storm of 2012 left the community without power or water for a week, her cafe became the center of relief efforts and cooked up nearly 3,500 meals.\n\nJustice initially seemed swift: \u201cThe cops did a great job,\u201d Campbell says. Halfway through the \u201clove fest\u201d potluck, an officer with the Pocahontas County Sheriff\u2019s Department arrived saying he was on his way to interview a suspect. Robbie Ratliff, 40, of Greenbrier County, who has a record for other misdemeanor crimes, was arrested and soon confessed. His tape-recorded confession, later played in court, says he was acting solely out of a personal grudge against Campbell \u2014 that he simply wanted to hurt her feelings because of what he felt was a monetary debt owed to his girlfriend, a former employee of Campbell\u2019s cafe, and that he is not a racist. Neither Ratliff nor his lawyer returned requests for comment.\n\nRatliff was charged with destruction of property \u2014 a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of $500 fine or up to one year in jail \u2014 and violating Campbell\u2019s civil rights, a felony. West Virginia state code Section 61-6-21 states, \u201cAll persons within the boundaries of the state of West Virginia have the right to be free from any violence, or intimidation by threat of violence, committed against their persons or property because of their race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation or sex \u2026 If any person does by force or threat of force, willfully injure, intimidate or interfere with, or attempt to injure, intimidate or interfere with, or oppress or threaten any other person in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him or her by the Constitution or laws of the state of West Virginia or by the Constitution or laws of the United States, because of such other person\u2019s race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, political affiliation or sex, he or she shall be guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\u201d\n\nBut enforcing this statute is another matter. Ratliff\u2019s trial on Aug. 28 was inadequate and disappointing to Campbell, her husband, Charlan, and their supporters. It took less than five hours and Pocahontas County Prosecutor Eugene Simmons only questioned Campbell about how she felt when she saw the racist graffiti: \u201cScared. Sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no voice,\u201d Campbell says. In addition to two witnesses who testified that they saw Ratliff\u2019s truck in the area of Campbell\u2019s business the night of the crime, the only other witness called by the prosecution was Pocahontas County Sheriff\u2019s Department Capt. McCoy who introduced the tape of Ratliff\u2019s confession. According to local attorney Clint Carte who was observing the proceedings, \u201cThey had him nailed dead to right on the destruction of property. But when he discussed his own internal motivations he was careful to say, hey, this wasn\u2019t a racial thing. I came away thinking, gosh, this confession may actually help him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man who defaced the Pretty Penny Cafe was arrested, but proving civil rights violations was more elusive", "title": "\u201cThe N-word is a horrible word, but how is it a threat?\u201d: The search for justice after a terrifying racial violation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The man who defaced the Pretty Penny Cafe was arrested, but proving civil rights violations was more elusive", "title": "\u201cThe N-word is a horrible word, but how is it a threat?\u201d: The search for justice after a terrifying racial violation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/08/the_n_word_is_a_horrible_word_but_how_is_it_a_threat_the_search_for_justice_after_a_terrifying_racial_violation/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/blair_campbell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The man who defaced the Pretty Penny Cafe was arrested, but proving civil rights violations was more elusive", "title": "\u201cThe N-word is a horrible word, but how is it a threat?\u201d: The search for justice after a terrifying racial violation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/blair_campbell.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Emma Eisenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Crime, Editor's Picks, pretty penny cafe, West Virginia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a29\"", "article_summary": "Pocahontas County, which contains Hillsboro, is 96 percent white, 1 percent black and 3 percent Latino or mixed race.\nHalfway through the \u201clove fest\u201d potluck, an officer with the Pocahontas County Sheriff\u2019s Department arrived saying he was on his way to interview a suspect.\nIt took less than five hours and Pocahontas County Prosecutor Eugene Simmons only questioned Campbell about how she felt when she saw the racist graffiti: \u201cScared.\nBut when he discussed his own internal motivations he was careful to say, hey, this wasn\u2019t a racial thing.\nA group of Campbell\u2019s friends came out in six degree weather and helped her scrub the words off with brake fluid."}
