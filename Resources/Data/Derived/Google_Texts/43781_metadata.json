Appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 1985, \u201cPaleolithic Nutrition: A Consideration of Its Nature and Current Implications\u201d argued that the human body is \u201cgenetically programmed\u201d to run, not on a modern diet, but on the foods consumed by our Stone Age ancestors.\n\n\u201cThe human genetic constitution has changed relatively little since the appearance of truly modern human beings, Homo sapiens sapiens, about 40,000 years ago,\u201d S. Boyd Eaton and Melvin Konner wrote.\n\nThe authors reasoned that human bodies have been shaped more by our prolonged time as huntergatherers than by the brief span since the advent of farming. Meat, probably lots of it, as well as fruits and vegetables were in. The staples of agriculture \u2014 breads, cereals, milks and cheeses \u2014 were not.\n\nThree decades later, that academic ripple is now a popular tidal wave. We have not just Paleo diets, but Paleo exercise, Paleo sleeping and Paleo toilets. They\u2019re all based on the premise that our bodies are more suited for Paleo-era habits.\n\nBut even as the \u201ccaveman\u201d diet rose to become the most Googled diet in 2013 and 2014, evolutionary biologists were with much less advertisement using advanced DNA techniques, sometimes on ancient bones, to suggest that the original Paleo premise may be off the mark: In fact, it seems, we have evolved.\n\nOver the last year alone, prominent scientific journals have published evidence of genetic shifts in humans over the last 10,000 years \u2014 apparently in response to the transition to agriculture.\n\nTwo relatively recent gene variants help humans survive with deficiencies characteristic of agricultural diets; another genetic shift appears to help fight\n\nthe dental cavities that arose with farm-based staples; another changes the way humans digest fats; dozens of others help fight the diseases that came with living at higher densities.\n\nThose new findings add to previous efforts showing that two other critical adaptations to new diets. After the domestication of milking animals, many humans evolved to digest milk. Separately, humans developed better ways to digest the starches characteristic of agricultural diets.\n\n\u201cIt drives me crazy when Paleo diet people say that we\u2019ve stopped evolving; we haven\u2019t,\u201d said Anne C. Stone, a professor of human evolution at Arizona State University who has shown that genes related to starch digestion appear to have changed in number apparently in response to farming. \u201cOur diets have changed radically in the last 10,000 years and, in response, we have changed, too.\u201d\n\nA closer look at evolution\n\nWhile all this new evidence challenges the Paleo diet argument, it doesn\u2019t necessarily disprove it, and Eaton and Konner maintain that their central hypothesis remains sound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s evidence that there\u2019s been a lot more selection and genetic change in the last five to 10,000 years than previously thought,\u201d Konner said. \u201cThis is a challenge to the Paleo diet claims \u2014 including mine and Boyd Eaton\u2019s over the years But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of one.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, he and Eaton say, the newly discovered genetic differences between Paleo hunter-gatherers and modern humans are not very numerous. While there may be some ways in which humans have adapted to agricultural diets, those are far outnumbered by the ways in which human bodies are suited for Paleo-era.\n\nMoreover, Konner said, even if one concedes that there has been significant genetic change over the last 10,000 years, those changes would only catch us up to human diets from 10,000 years ago. But our diets have changed radically over the last 300 years alone. We consume less fiber, more refined grains, etc., and evolutionary forces can\u2019t have altered our bodies so quickly over that time.\n\n\u201cThe biggest culprit with the current epidemic of diabetes, a looming problem world-wide, is refined carbohydrates,\u201d Konner said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way humans could have adapted to that because they haven\u2019t been around long enough.\u201d\n\nWhen Eaton and Konnner wrote in the \u201880s, it was far more difficult to detect evidence of recent human evolution. Since then, the pace of research accelerated rapidly, especially with the ability to sequence the entire human genome. It allowed researchers, for example, to compare the DNA of populations with different diets \u2014 new and old \u2014 and look for signs of adaptation.\n\n\u201cIn populations where starch was a major component of the diet, being able to extract as many calories as possible as quickly as possible, likely was a lifesaver for kids who suffered from bouts of intestinal illness,\u201d Stone said.\n\nMore recently, another advance gave scientists a direct way of comparing contemporary humans to our Paleolithic ancestors. They were able recover DNA from ancient bones.\n\nIn November 2013, for example, researchers announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a Siberian boy who lived 24,000 years ago. Then in October 2014, researchers announced that they had sequenced DNA from the bone of a human \u2014 a thigh discovered in Siberia \u2014 believed to be 45,000 years old. It is currently the oldest modern human genome .\n\n\u201cWe now have some idea how people who lived 45,000 years before present were related to present-day people,\u201d one of the researchers, Janet Kelso, said at the time.\n\nOne of the largest, most significant recent critical finds came from excavations done in advance of a railway project in Motala, Sweden. In a paper in the journal Nature, scientists looked at the DNA that has been recovered from the Motala remains and from those of more than 200 others ancient Eurasian humans. The ages ranged from 8,000 years old to about 2,000 years old \u2014 a span of time that covers ancient hunter-gatherers as well as early farmers.\n\nIn analyzing the DNA from those ancient remains, the scientists noted thousands of distinct places where there were DNA changes that didn\u2019t seem just random. That is, the changes didn\u2019t seem to be merely a case of genetic drift, but a sign that the human species was actually adapting to some aspect of its environment.\n\nOut of those thousands of places, the scientists then highlighted 12 places in the DNA where the signs of selection were clustered. One of those clusters related to the digestion of milk \u2014 a confirmation of previous findings. Another related to how humans digest fatty acids. Two others may have a link to celiac disease. Others were related to skin color, which got lighter as human moved northward from Africa, and disease resistance.\n\n\u201cEuropeans of 4,000 years ago were different in important respects from Europeans today, despite having overall similar ancestry,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nThose findings, like the others, challenge the Paleo assumption that humans have not changed. What remains unanswered is how much. As good as the research techniques have become, and as far as the technology has advanced, the validity of the central premise of the Paleo movement remains uncertain. As Eaton and Konner advised in 1985, any diet proposals, to be validated, must be tested with experiments.\n\n\u201cMy overall opinion of this is that we don\u2019t really know,\u201d said Iain Mathieson, a Harvard med school researcher and a co-author of the Nature paper. \u201cWe do know there are some specific changes in humans. But they are a relatively small in number. To me it\u2019s an open question. It\u2019s a hypothesis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/03/PALEO.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "We have not just Paleo diets, but Paleo exercise, Paleo sleeping and Paleo toilets.\n\u201cThis is a challenge to the Paleo diet claims \u2014 including mine and Boyd Eaton\u2019s over the years But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of one.\u201dFor one thing, he and Eaton say, the newly discovered genetic differences between Paleo hunter-gatherers and modern humans are not very numerous.\nAs Eaton and Konner advised in 1985, any diet proposals, to be validated, must be tested with experiments.\nThose findings, like the others, challenge the Paleo assumption that humans have not changed.\nBy Peter Whoriskey, The Washington PostThe article kicked off not just a diet, but a movement."}
