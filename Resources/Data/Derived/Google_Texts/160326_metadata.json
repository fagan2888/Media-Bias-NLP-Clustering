The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Jordan\u2019s authorities eventually will outlaw the original movement, which is deeply rooted in Jordanian society through its social outreach and welfare system. There have been some signs of a crackdown in recent months, including the arrests of about two dozen activists and the sentencing of the group\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 Zaki Bani Ersheid \u2014 to 18 month in prison for criticizing the Emirates.\n\nThe problems have put the Brotherhood in Jordan at its lowest point in years. It has no representation in parliament because of self-imposed election boycotts and is losing some of its young to extremist groups.\n\n\u201cThe Brotherhood, by relative standards, is fairly innocuous, it\u2019s not a significant threat to the kingdom,\u201d said David Schenker of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank. \u201cMany are asking what (is the) utility of kicking the Brotherhood when it is down.\u201d\n\nThe division was preceded by long-running ideological disagreements between \u201cdoves\u201d and \u201chawks,\u201d exacerbated by 2007 Gaza takeover of the Islamic militant Hamas, the Palestinian branch of the Brotherhood.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Split of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood blow to regional group", "title": "Split of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood blow to regional group", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Split of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood blow to regional group", "title": "Split of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood blow to regional group", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/16/split_of_jordans_muslim_brotherhood_blow_to_regional_group/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/jordan-divided-brothers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Split of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood blow to regional group", "title": "Split of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood blow to regional group", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/jordan-divided-brothers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karin Laub and Mohammed Daraghmeh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The larger Brotherhood faction, still loyal to the regional movement, alleged the government engineered the division to weaken the group.\nThe split deals a new blow to the region-wide Brotherhood movement, which has been outlawed as a terror group by close Jordan allies Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nA government official said that while Thnaibat\u2019s group registered with the authorities, the other faction \u201cdid not correct\u201d its status, suggesting it is legally vulnerable.\nThe new, officially licensed Brotherhood offshoot defines itself as a strictly Jordanian group, saying it cut ties with the regional movement to avoid being branded as militant.\nThe split was formalized earlier this month when the government licensed Thnaibat\u2019s breakaway faction, and the core movement promptly expelled the defectors."}
