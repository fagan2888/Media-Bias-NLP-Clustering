Three of Denver\u2019s most isolated, overlooked urban neighborhoods \u2014 Globeville, Elyria and Swansea \u2014 will continue to be the city\u2019s most isolated, overlooked urban neighborhoods unless officials in Denver hit the oatmeal circuit and advance a strong, unified position about the future of the city\u2019s most poorly served neighborhoods.\n\nConsider this:\n\n\u2022 The National Environmental Policy Act requires state transportation officials to conduct an environmental impact study (EIS) to evaluate \u201cthe quality of the human environment\u201d prior to building any federally funded transportation project.\n\n\u2022 The draft EIS for this 1.8-mile stretch of I-70 has taken longer \u2014 by nearly four times \u2014 than any in the 11-year history of the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).\n\n\u2022 In 2008, CDOT spent $32 million to repair the viaduct, adding 10 to 15 years to the life of Colorado\u2019s largest and most notable \u201cfailing\u201d bridge.\n\nLast month, concerned about the paucity of political support for the Swansea cut-and-cover (lowering the highway 40 feet and covering it with a grass esplanade) as well as shrinking federal resources and escalating demands on state bridge replacement dollars, CDOT commissioners directed staff to examine the commitment to replace the viaduct. If the mayor and City Council don\u2019t unite around political and financial support for the Swansea cut-and-cover and a second cover at Steele and Vasquez, their timidity will have consequences. The commission will advance three alternatives in the spring 2014 supplemental draft EIS:\n\n1. Reconstruct the viaduct to meet federal standards for lane and shoulder width, without adding lanes.\n\n2. Rebuild the viaduct, adding two new tolled express lanes in each direction, either shifting the structure north, requiring relocation of Swansea Elementary School, or south, requiring relocation of the Purina plant.\n\n3. Rebuild the portion south of Swansea Elementary below ground with two new tolled express lanes.\n\nCDOT\u2019s draft alternatives do not include urban design consultant Ron Straka\u2019s visionary plan to eliminate the Vasquez interchange, lower the viaduct between Vasquez and Steele streets and add a second cover strong enough to support a structure.\n\nNor have Denver elected officials made sufficient noise about the importance of linking Globeville, the neighborhood west of the National Western and the Platte River, to its neighbors, the river, transit and the city.\n\nIf city officials don\u2019t push hard for the Vasquez cover and coalesce around the third alternative in the draft EIS, CDOT can kick this can \u2014 forgive me \u2014 down the road.\n\nIn the decade-long vacuum of Denver\u2019s political leadership, dreamers and schemers have filled the void. Other interests \u2014 academics, architects and activists who don\u2019t live in the neighborhood \u2014 continue to fight to reroute I-70 from Colorado Boulevard to the Mousetrap or from Quebec to Wadsworth.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a decade from now the stupidity of running interstate highways through cities will be obvious. Or whether Congress will begin to invest in our country\u2019s failing and obsolete infrastructure. Maybe transit, ride-share, car-share and cycling will predominate urban transportation solutions. Perhaps pigs will fly.\n\nIf none of the above occurs, what will 10 more years of the status quo do to these neighborhoods?\n\nCivic activist Susan Barnes-Gelt can be reached at barnesgelt@gmail.com or @SBGtweets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee44\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for Denver officials to stop fiddling.\nMaybe transit, ride-share, car-share and cycling will predominate urban transportation solutions.\nConsider this:\u2022 The National Environmental Policy Act requires state transportation officials to conduct an environmental impact study (EIS) to evaluate \u201cthe quality of the human environment\u201d prior to building any federally funded transportation project.\n\u2022 The draft EIS for this 1.8-mile stretch of I-70 has taken longer \u2014 by nearly four times \u2014 than any in the 11-year history of the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).\nLast June, Denver Post editorial page editor Vincent Carroll wrote a thoroughly researched, pragmatic assessment of the future of north Denver\u2019s Interstate 70 viaduct between Colorado and Brighton boulevards."}
