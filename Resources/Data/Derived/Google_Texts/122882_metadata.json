Mike Rogers, Michigan Republican, slammed the Obama administration for ignoring repeated intelligence community assessments about the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and said the president\u2019s ambivalence toward the assessments resulted in \u201ca policy failure.\u201d\n\nThat Washington has been slow to respond to ISIL\u2019s rise as leading terrorist organization \u2014 seizing a vast swath of territory between Syria and Iraq over the past two weeks \u2014 \u201cis a result of an indecision, which is a policy failure,\u201d Mr. Rogers told reporters Wednesday morning at a briefing hosted in Washington by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\n\u201cThis is not an intelligence failure, it\u2019s a policy failure,\u201d said the congressman, who will retire from Congress at the end of this year to host a syndicated radio program.\n\n\u201cNot responding is a decision, not making a decision is a decision,\u201d Mr. Rogers said Wednesday, asserting that President Obama\u2019s own national security advisers received the same intelligence briefings about ISIL that he and other lawmakers were receiving on Capitol Hill more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t get the same stuff that we got,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cAnd some notion that if we don\u2019t do anything really hard, that everything will be just fine, is absolutely \u2014 I think it\u2019s a bit naive. It\u2019s a bit politically self-serving, that you\u2019re more concerned about what ratings you have at home than what threats happen overseas.\u201d\n\nMr. Rogers pushed back at recent statements by Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, and others suggesting ISIL\u2019s lightning advance in Iraq took U.S. leaders by surprise during recent weeks.\n\nMr. Rogers insisted that there ample assessments over the past two years from U.S. intelligence agencies about the evolving intentions and capabilities of the al Qaeda-inspired group \u2014 known by both English-language acronyms ISIL and ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe get all the raw intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very clear to me that years ago, ISIL/ISIS was pooling up in a dangerous way \u2014 building training camps, recruiting, drawing in jihadists from around the world. We saw all of that happening.\n\n\u201cSo some [notion] that we wouldn\u2019t have seen this coming, means that you weren\u2019t paying attention to the intelligence that was afforded us,\u201d the congressman said.\n\nHe said lawmakers became specifically concerned last year that ISIL was developing operational plans to attempt terrorist attacks in Western Europe and in the United States.\n\nAt the time, it became public that ISIL leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was engaged in an internal struggle with Ayman al-Zawahiri, who took over the leadership of al Qaeda\u2019s original core in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nWhile ISIL had emerged as a leading player in the civil war gripping Syria \u2014 which borders Iraq to the north and west \u2014 al-Zawahiri in 2013 called for the dissolution of ISIL in Syria, citing its extreme methods, and called on al-Baghdadi to refocus and confine the group\u2019s operations to Iraq and not pursue operations against the West.\n\nMr. Rogers said Wednesday that the Baghdadi-Zawahiri rift prompted extensive analysis among American intelligence community insiders at the time and that he personally saw the development as worrisome.\n\n\u201cZawahiri said focus on Iraq,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who added that \u201cthe very fact that they\u2019re having the discussion sends a chill down my spine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means somebody is in an operational status, trying to put together something that would look like something that could get the green light, including access to people who had Western passports.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most dangerous thing,\u201d he added. \u201cYou fly to Germany and you\u2019re a German citizen and you\u2019re flying to the United States, you don\u2019t need a visa. That\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s a big problem for us.\u201d\n\nMr. Rogers said the ISIL disaster illustrated the White House policy of avoiding politically difficult foreign policy decisions.\n\n\u201cThat is a really dangerous mindset and at some point, they just keep doubling down on that: \u2018Now it\u2019s hard, so let\u2019s stay out of it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rogers said.\n\n\u201cOK, I get that, the problem is [ISIL is] threatening the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Wednesday that he and other lawmakers were briefed more than a year ago on the dangers of the al Qaeda-inspired group now wreaking havoc in Iraq, accusing President Obama of a \"policy failure\" in failing to prevent their advances.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Wednesday that he and other lawmakers were briefed more than a year ago on the dangers of the al Qaeda-inspired group now wreaking havoc in Iraq, accusing President Obama of a \u201cpolicy failure\u201d in failing to prevent their advances.", "title": "House intel chief: Obama ignored Iraq warnings", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/25/house-intel-chief-obama-ignored-iraq-warnings/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/30/3_302014_ap130618117928201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/30/3_302014_ap130618117928201.jpg", "description": "The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Wednesday that he and other lawmakers were briefed more than a year ago on the dangers of the al Qaeda-inspired group now wreaking havo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "House intel chief: Obama ignored Iraq warnings"}, "Author": "Guy Taylor", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Mike Rogers, Iraq, al Qaeda, Syria"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ea0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t get the same stuff that we got,\u201d Mr. Rogers said.\n\u201cThat is a really dangerous mindset and at some point, they just keep doubling down on that: \u2018Now it\u2019s hard, so let\u2019s stay out of it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rogers said.\nThat\u2019s a big problem for us.\u201dMr. Rogers said the ISIL disaster illustrated the White House policy of avoiding politically difficult foreign policy decisions.\n\u201cOK, I get that, the problem is [ISIL is] threatening the United States of America,\u201d he said.\nMr. Rogers said Wednesday that the Baghdadi-Zawahiri rift prompted extensive analysis among American intelligence community insiders at the time and that he personally saw the development as worrisome."}
