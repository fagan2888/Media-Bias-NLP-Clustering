Kirsten Kelly posted her opinion on how customers should tip on Facebook.

A waitress is paying for saying what's on her mind. She was fired this week from her job at Texas Roadhouse in Findlay, Ohio.

Kirsten Kelly posted her opinion on how customers should tip on Facebook. She wrote," if you come into a restaurant and spend $50 or more, you should be able to tip appropriately."

A customer took a screen shot of the post and took it to the manager who let her go. Turns out, the customer was one of Kelly's Facebook friends.

"I mean, I knew that they could have yelled at me for that, but I didn't think they could fire me for posting that," Kelly said.

A job recruitment firm says even when you think your posts are private, they can come back to you, especially if your comments "bite the hand that feeds you," so to speak.
