Art Pope officially departs the McCrory administration today, stepping down from the post of state budget director.

Last month, in announcing Pope’s decision to leave, Governor Pat McCrory called the budget director and former state lawmaker “an important voice and important mentor.”

Others outside the administration have suggested that the conservative donor had too much influence over state spending and policies advanced in the legislature.

Here’s how Pope’s influence has been portrayed by North Carolina’s best known editorial cartoonists:

Succeeding Pope will be Lee Roberts, a Raleigh banking executive Governor McCrory appointed to the North Carolina Banking Commission last year.
