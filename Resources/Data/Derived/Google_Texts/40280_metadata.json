Fix-it veteran gets top IRS post\n\nIt\u2019s official. John Koskinen now has the worst job in Washington.\n\nThe Senate confirmed President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service on a 59-to-36 vote, giving the troubled agency its first permanent leader in more than a year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKoskinen was widely expected to clear the Senate after a friendly confirmation hearing last week. He now faces the seemingly insurmountable task of restoring public trust in the agency accused of targeting tea party groups seeking tax exempt status. A May inspector general report blasting agency workers for the practices led Obama to push out the acting chief amid a political firestorm.\n\nIt is not a job coveted by many - a fact Koskinen freely admits.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 slams on the IRS)\n\n\u201cI have a yellow legal pad. In one column are my friends and in the other are the people who think this is a good idea,\u201d he said jokingly after his Senate Finance hearing last week.\n\nObama\u2019s choice has a history of donating to Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, but won high praise from several Senate Finance Republicans who vetted Koskinen.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch - who has expressed frustration that Koskinen was put to a vote before the Senate Finance Committee completed its investigation into the targeting controversy - ultimately supported the nomination.\n\n\u201cI am encouraged by Mr. Koskinen\u2019s commitment to continue the cooperation the Finance Committee has enjoyed so far in its investigation, as well as his commitment to working with Congress to fix the IRS\u2019s many problems,\u201d Hatch, a Utah Republican, said in a statement to the congressional record.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full finance policy coverage)\n\nRepublican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Rob Portman of Ohio and Bob Corker of Tennessee joined Hatch is voting for Koskinen.\n\nKoskinen, 74, has earned a reputation as a fixer. He stepped in to lead Freddie Mac during the dark days of the financial crisis and worked in the Office of Management and Budget during multiple Clinton-era government shutdowns.\n\nThose skills will be put to the test as he\u2019ll officially join the agency about a month before tax season begins.\n\nBut the top priority for Koskinen will be to restore public trust in the agency.\n\n( PHOTOS: 8 key players in IRS scandal story)\n\nActing IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel published a report over the summer outlining management flaws faulted for the targeting program he intended to correct, including installing a chief risk officer. Koskinen will be charged with seeing many of those recommendations through.\n\n\u201cReally his first assignment is to restore the credibility of the agency. He will have to work closely with the Congress, with frequent visits to the Hill when they request to see him,\u201d said former IRS commissioner Mark W. Everson, now with alliantgroup, which advises business on tax issues.\n\nThat added scrutiny by IRS workers of tea party groups - and some liberal groups, Democrats contend - prompted the Obama administration to propose new regulations that could have a sweeping impact on how 501(c)4 groups participate in elections.\n\nIt will fall on Koskinen\u2019s shoulders to approve the final rules after the IRS collects feedback.\n\n( Sign up for POLITICO\u2019s Morning Tax tip sheet)\n\nThat could prove to be a potential pitfall early on for the new commissioner. Both conservatives and liberals groups argued that the regulations may stymie free speech - a threat Republicans in Congress promised to closely watch.\n\n\u201cThe regulation released today continues this Administration\u2019s unfortunate pattern of stifling constitutional free speech,\u201d House Oversight Committee Darrell Issa said when the proposed rules were announced in November.\n\nObamacare will also be a top issue.\n\nThe IRS has emerged from the botched rollout of Obamacare without harm \u2014 but that could change in 2014. The IRS has reported its systems are operating correctly, but an inspector general\u2019s report raised concerns that the premium tax credits included in the 2010 law could be susceptible to fraud.\n\nHow the agency responds to any Obamacare glitches will be pivotal if Koskinen wants to save the IRS from the harsh criticism now facing the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe IRS is also suffering - in part from the intense reaction to the targeting - from plummeting employee morale. Everson, a George W. Bush appointee, said Koskinen will need to strike a new \u201ctone\u201d to stop employee turnover.\n\n\u201cPeople are demoralized because of certain events and he needs to reassure the rank-and-file people in the agency that it\u2019s okay to your do you job,\u201d Everson said.\n\nThe shrinking IRS budget will also be a challenge for Koskinen. Congress has cut nearly $1 billion from the IRS budget since 2010, forcing employees to double-up on jobs and leave posts unfilled.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office on Wednesday released a report saying the IRS \u201cwas unable to keep up with demand for telephone and correspondence services\u201d during the 2013 filing season because of a budget crunch.\n\nObama\u2019s budget called for additional IRS resources but that proposal is a no-go among congressional Republicans whose distrust of the agency spiked during the tax exempt controversy.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Koskinen expressed concerns that the agency\u2019s tax collections could falter if Congress continued to reduce the budget.\n\nKoskinen enjoyed universal support from Democrats in the vote.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical time to have someone with Mr. Koskinen\u2019s expertise in charge of the IRS,\u201d Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said. \u201cWe need a confirmed commissioner to begin winning back the public\u2019s trust and manage the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Now that the Senate confirmed him, it's official: John Koskinen has the worst job in Washington.", "title": "Fix-it veteran gets top IRS post", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/john-koskinen-irs-senate-vote-101381.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/20/131220_john_koskinen_irs_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nominations (69),John Koskinen (2),Senate (2025),IRS", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Now that the Senate confirmed him, it's official: John Koskinen has the worst job in Washington.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb013\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a critical time to have someone with Mr. Koskinen\u2019s expertise in charge of the IRS,\u201d Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said.\nCongress has cut nearly $1 billion from the IRS budget since 2010, forcing employees to double-up on jobs and leave posts unfilled.\nFix-it veteran gets top IRS postIt\u2019s official.\nThe shrinking IRS budget will also be a challenge for Koskinen.\nIn one column are my friends and in the other are the people who think this is a good idea,\u201d he said jokingly after his Senate Finance hearing last week."}
