Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks.\n\nThe phase-out is not a reaction to that pushback, Olson said. \u201cNothing is changing. It\u2019s all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.\u201d\n\nHe echoed the company memo, saying of the Race Together initiative, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning into it hard.\u201d\n\nSchultz\u2019s note to employees acknowledged the skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach.\n\n\u201cWhile there has been criticism of the initiative \u2014 and I know this hasn\u2019t been easy for any of you \u2014 let me assure you that we didn\u2019t expect universal praise,\u201d it read.\n\nHe said the campaign at its core aims to make sure that \u201cthe promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few.\u201d\n\nBut the campaign didn\u2019t sit well with some Starbucks customers. Many voiced on social media and elsewhere that they didn\u2019t want a debate with their brew.\n\nAt a Starbucks in Pittsfield Township, Michigan, near Ann Arbor, two customers said on Sunday they didn\u2019t think a coffee shop was the right place for race relations dialogue.\n\nNinette Musili, a junior bio-molecular science major at the University of Michigan, said the campaign seemed to her like an insincere publicity stunt that wasn\u2019t executed properly.\n\nLike many who criticized Starbucks, she goes to the shops either before class or later in the day to study. At neither time does she want to discuss race relations.\n\n\u201cMost people come to Starbucks for coffee,\u201d said Musili, who is 19 and African-American. \u201cRace is an uncomfortable thing to bring up, especially in a Starbucks.\u201d\n\nShe said such discussions are important, and that Starbucks should have set aside time during the evenings for race discussions and invited people to attend.\n\nAnother customer, Shane Mulholland, 46, of Ann Arbor, also said Starbucks isn\u2019t the venue to talk about race.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here for coffee. They\u2019re not here to push their political agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI even contemplated not coming here because of it.\u201d\n\nHe said Starbucks should remain neutral on such topics because it\u2019s an established brand, rather than risk alienating customers. \u201cThere are other ways you can go about doing things to stimulate interest in what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Mulholland, who is white and runs an edible mushroom-growing business. \u201cThey must be doing so well they don\u2019t have to worry about losing customers over that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe campaign, he said, didn\u2019t start any discussions about race with him.\n\nDiscussions about race are necessary, but getting a message about it on a coffee cup is silly, Stephanie Nelson, 45, said at a Starbucks in Seattle, the chain\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cThat was pushing it a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe broader discussion is good.
