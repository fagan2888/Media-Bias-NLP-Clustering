One of my Twitter followers pointed out something interesting this morning: interest in preexisting conditions has plummeted on Google. Here's the chart:

There are a couple of spikes around 2010, when Obamacare was first passed, but other than that it's been a fairly steady decrease ever since. By 2015, so few people were worried about being denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition that they weren't even bothering to Google it. That's exactly how it should be. Thanks, Obamacare.
