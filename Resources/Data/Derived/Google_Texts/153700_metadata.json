Taking their words seriously \u2014 333,000 of them spoken in 20 primary debates \u2014 can tell us a lot about what the presidential hopefuls believe. In a new study, I bring the candidates\u2019 words under the microscope of big data analytics and examine their conservative or liberal policy positions, negative or positive political sentiments, and speech patterns.\n\nBig data analytics are powerful tools for finding patterns from unstructured information, such as texts, images, and virtually any raw information that\u2019s not already enumerated. For the debates, this approach is simple: It consists of pulling out the candidates\u2019 words, quantifying their characteristics, and turning the information into data we can analyze. Granted, certain elements of natural language \u2014 irony, sarcasm, etc. \u2014 are lost in this process. Yet, the method gives us a rare opportunity to weigh the candidates against each other on a quantitative basis.\n\nMost important to voters is where the candidates stand on issues. Debates can reveal this information because candidates with different policy positions have different word choices even on the same issue. For example, \u201cObamacare\u201d is a heavily used term \u2014 in criticism \u2014 by Ted Cruz, who\u2019s known as a very conservative senator. But Democratic candidates, especially the very liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders, often refer to the same thing agreeably as the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d For this reason, candidates lesser known to voters \u2014 or Trump \u2014 would appear more conservative in debates if they scored more \u201cconservative words\u201d and fewer \u201cliberal words.\u201d It is this scoring method that places the candidates\u2019 policy positions in Figure 1.\n\nJohn Kasich \u2014 widely characterized as a Republican liberals can like \u2014 is squarely situated in the moderate territory, not far from Hillary Clinton\u2019s position. But just as moderate as Kasich is the self-proclaimed, \u201ccommon-sense\u201d conservative, Trump. If this surprises those who think the business mogul is a real conservative and those who consider him a liberal \u2014 both camps exist, by the way \u2014 it\u2019s likely because Trump says, at the same time, things the two groups like to hear. At times, he takes the most right-wing position on illegal immigration. On other occasions, the businessman parades his (no-) trade policy as if he were Bernie Sanders. Apparently, going centrist on every issue, as the Ohio governor does, is not the only way to appear moderate. Trump\u2019s overall \u201cimage\u201d appears moderate too, despite his extreme left and right positions on different issues.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 sentiments \u2014 their overall \u201ctone,\u201d and not just their views \u2014 matter to voters too. In a textual analysis, the standard way to measure tone is to count what language experts identify as positive and negative words. As expected, if a candidate scores more negative words than positive ones in a speech, his or her tone is defined as negative. Figure 2 shows how the candidates fare.\n\nThe front-runners, Clinton and Trump, are both taking a rather positive tone. This is not surprising for the former secretary of state, the candidate most closely associated with the Obama administration. Trump\u2019s optimism, surprisingly, is almost comparable to that of Kasich, who has reiterated many times that he would run a positive campaign to highlight his accomplishments and his vision. Instead of leveraging the frustration of voters, Trump\u2019s strategy has been to paint a bright future with bizarre promises to his supporters: Just think how this country could be made great again by making great deals. This strategy is obviously working for the businessman campaigner who knows the art of the deal.\n\nRegardless of conservative or liberal positions and negative or positive sentiments, an electable candidate has to communicate well. Figure 3 tracks the effectiveness of the candidates\u2019 speeches by how often they use \u201cfunction words.\u201d These words \u2014 \u201cso,\u201d \u201con,\u201d \u201cthere,\u201d etc. \u2014 are used to deliver content in a speech. Wikipedia entries, for example, which are full of information, use more function words than ordinary Web pages.\n\nSenators Cruz and Sanders, who are used to complex legislative language instead of everyday words, have not communicated well with the voters. By comparison, Ben Carson and Trump \u2014 two popular \u201coutsiders\u201d \u2014 seem much better at knowing how to talk to ordinary people. In fact, the famed neurosurgeon and the real estate tycoon are so good at \u201cdialing down\u201d their language that they speak at very low grade levels \u2014 Carson at sixth grade and Trump at fourth.\n\nGlimpsing through the lens of big data reveals new information that goes beyond what the presidential contenders tell us. What will happen if Clinton and Trump become the nominees?
