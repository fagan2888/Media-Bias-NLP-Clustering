Szukala, the Medicaid inspector general for Erie County. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t making a lot of money.\u201d\n\nThose receiving benefits from the federal health care program earned an average of $997 a month at their jobs, which equates to an annual income of $11,961, according to the annual Medicaid report for Erie County.\n\nThe Medicaid report, released Thursday, also revealed:\n\n\u2022 Whites comprise the largest and fastest-growing group of Medicaid recipients, with 20 percent more whites receiving Medicaid benefits last year than in 2010, compared with 11 percent growth for blacks.\n\n\u2022 Treatment for mental illness cost Medicaid the most money \u2013 more than $209 million last year \u2013 among all defined conditions that were diagnosed countywide.\n\n\u2022 Childhood obesity remains a major issue. Among all Medicaid beneficiaries treated for obesity during the first half of this year, 43 percent were children, nearly double the percentage from four years ago.\n\n\u2022 Similar to private health insurance trends, an opioid painkiller remains the No. 1 prescribed drug for Medicaid recipients. Hydrocodone-acetaminophen, also known as the brands Vicodin and Lortab, is a frequently abused prescription narcotic.\n\n\u2022 If current trends continue, one out of every three Erie County residents could be on Medicaid within six years.\n\n\u201cWhile more than 28 percent of our county\u2019s residents now receive their health insurance from Medicaid, that number is projected to rise to over 33 percent by 2021 if trends continue,\u201d Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said.\n\nThe number of people receiving Medicaid benefits continues to rise by more than 4 percent a year, Szukala said. That\u2019s largely due to the federal Affordable Care Act, which allows more people to qualify for Medicaid benefits.\n\nNearly 259,000 residents \u2013 more than 28 percent of county residents \u2013 received health insurance through Medicaid last year, according to his report.\n\nMedicaid covers health care for low-income families and for the blind and disabled. Barring special circumstances, families must be within 133 percent of the federal poverty level to qualify for Medicaid benefits. For a family of four, that income limit comes to $32,253.\n\n\u201cPoverty is a very real problem in Erie County, and we remain committed to addressing it,\u201d said Poloncarz.\n\nChildren account for more than one-third of Medicaid recipients.\n\n\u201cThe face of Medicaid in Erie County is not a poor black child. It\u2019s a poor white chid,\u201d Szukala said.\n\nThis year\u2019s Medicaid report highlights the issue of the working poor. Szukala gained access to databases that allowed him to analyze data for 47 percent of all adult Medicaid clients serviced by the county last year.\n\nSzukala found that 40 percent of those people received W-2 forms, indicating that they earned income in 2014. The analysis does not indicate how long the Medicaid recipients worked, or in what areas, but he said his analysis dispels the notion that most Medicaid beneficiaries stay at home watching TV reruns.\n\nThose who did not work included residents receiving disability and retirement benefits, he added.\n\n\u201cWhat we have refutes a number of myths,\u201d he said.\n\nThose myths extend to perceptions of which races and ethnicities receive benefits, he said.\n\nAmong Medicaid recipients who identified a specific race, whites outnumbered African Americans, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans combined \u2013 not surprising given that whites comprise three-fourths of the county\u2019s population.\n\nBut whites between the ages of 21 to 64 became Medicaid recipients nearly five times faster than blacks or Hispanics. Whites also account for the highest average cost per Medicaid client, according to the report.\n\nAfrican Americans make up 13 percent of the county\u2019s population, followed by Asians and Latinos who together account for 7 percent.\n\nA disproportionate percentage of African Americans in the county receive Medicaid benefits. According to Szukala\u2019s review, 17 percent of whites were on Medicaid in Erie County, compared with 60 percent of blacks.\n\nErie County Medicaid services cost taxpayers an estimated $1.6 billion last year. The county continues to see a decline in its portion of Medicaid costs because the state now picks up a larger share of Medicaid costs. In previous years, Medicaid costs were a crushing expense for many communities statewide.\n\nThe county\u2019s Medicaid costs for this year is expected to be $8.1 million less than last year, capped at $211 million. The federal government assumes half of the total Medicaid costs.\n\nWhile the bulk of Medicaid recipients live in the city, particularly the East Side, West Side and Black Rock/Riverside, the county also showed a high percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries in Cheektowaga, Lackawanna, and the city and town of Tonawanda.\n\nThe Medicaid data for Erie County, covering the period from January 2011 through June 2015, examined more than 172,000 files of Medicaid recipients who are over the age of 18.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to see increases in the number of Medicaid recipients less than 21 years of age and in the number of white recipients, even while actual Medicaid costs to the county decrease as a result of the ACA\u2019s reimbursement formula,\u201d Poloncarz said.\n\nA couple with two children \u2013 with each caregiver working full-time and earning the minimum wage \u2013 wouldn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThis report shows again this year that many Medicaid recipients are employed outside of the home but are still not earning enough to rise above the qualification threshold,\u201d Poloncarz said. \u201cThese individuals are not the lazy, unemployed stereotypes that many people have of Medicaid recipients, but rather are doing all they can to provide a better life for themselves and their families.\u201d\n\nemail: stan@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Up to 40 percent of Erie County residents who receive Medicaid benefits have jobs.\u201cThey\u2019re not leeches on the system,\u201d said Michael R.
