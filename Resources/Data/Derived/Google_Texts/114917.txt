The Obama administration has not been shy about partnering with religious leaders on issues such as poverty, HIV/AIDS prevention, Obamacare, and even climate change. Now the White House is soliciting nominations for an upcoming Champions of Change ceremony to "honor faith leaders who are making a difference to combat climate change and advance conservation in their communities."

Katharine Gallogly, a special assistant in the White House office of public engagement, made the announcement on the White House blog on Wednesday. Gallogly said the White House intends to "celebrate the impact they are having here at home, and on the lives of people around the world." Nominations can include clergy, lay leaders, and leaders of faith-based organizations. The following questions are posted to help explain the qualifications of a Champion of Change:

Clergy: Do you know a clergyperson who has been a Champion for conservation in their community? A leader who has advocated for policies or ideas in communities that will help address climate change? Someone who has taken action to organize their community to help preserve the planet?

Lay Leader: Do you know a lay leader who has organized their faith community to take action on climate? A lay person who has worked through their community of faith to advocate for climate-friendly policies?

Faith-Based Organization Leader: Do you know a leader of a faith-based organization that has been thinking outside the box on taking action on climate? Someone who runs a faith-based organization that is combating climate change?

Nominations are due by midnight on Wednesday, June 17.
