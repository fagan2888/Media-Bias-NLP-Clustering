And yet, conflict we have\u2014perhaps the bitterest on this issue that we have yet seen in this country.\n\nThe pro-life camp has decided to focus its energy and efforts on abortion bans, whether explicit prohibitions that necessitate the overturning of Roe v. Wade, or implicit ones that skirt around its edges.[i] Some pro-life politicians, even Presidential candidates, increasingly dismiss exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest.[ii]\n\nIn the face of that legislative onslaught, the pro-choice camp has responded with its own rhetorical one: abortion on demand, without apology.[iii] Some pro-choice commentators have begun touting abortion as a positive social good without any potential downsides.[iv] The \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d mantra of the Clinton Presidency era has all but vanished from the scene.[v]\n\nIn other words, both camps seem to be doing everything in their power to horrify and disgust each other.\n\nMeanwhile, the abortions continue.\n\nAs each side marches away from common ground and towards far extremes, each step takes them farther away from the truth: that the moral case against abortion is far stronger than most abortion rights supporters might like to admit, and that the case for legal abortion is far stronger than most abortion opponents might like to admit.\n\nThe science does not give either side all of the news it wants to hear.\n\nThe absolutist moral case against abortion\u2014that a human life begins at fertilization\u2014has an elegant and powerful simplicity to it. We were all once fertilized embryos, and it was at fertilization that we became new, whole, unique organisms with the same basic genetic make-up that we possess today. And yet, the absolutist case is not without significant flaws. That same fertilized embryo could yet split into two to produce twins.[vi] Did a person just die and two more take up residence? A huge number\u2014as many as 80%\u2014of all embryos die when they are just days old, before they can even be implanted in the uterus. As one commentator has asked, \u201cIs Heaven Populated Chiefly by the Souls of Embryos?\u201d[vii] Maybe. Perhaps scientific advancements will make future generations look back at this early age of human existence and lament the loss of so many human persons to routine embryo death the same way that we now look back at most of human history and lament the loss of so many human persons to high rates of infant mortality. But combined with the splitting potential, there is at least room for serious doubt that, in the moment after fertilization, a member of the human family has been created.\n\nThat doubt fades quickly as the embryo grows. More than 90% of abortions in America occur in the first trimester.[viii] But a lot happens in those twelve weeks to make the title of human person seem more and more accurate. The embryo is still miniscule at five weeks, but the heart has begun to beat. By week twelve\u2014when the embryo has become a fetus\u2014arms, legs, and eyes have appeared, key vital organs have begun to function, and the fetus has begun to move and even hiccup.[ix]\n\nIs that enough? Maybe. Killing such an organism is at the very least deeply disconcerting.\n\nIn the weeks and months that follow, the doubt dissipates to a vanishing point. At week 19, the fetus can hear sounds outside the womb. At week 23, the fetus may be able to survive outside the womb. At week 28, he or she (the fetus\u2019s sex, set at fertilization, can be determined because the genitals are intact) almost certainly can.[x]\n\nFrom a moral and biological standpoint, nothing magical happens at birth. The day before birth, the baby is a baby.\n\nThere are two possible moral conclusions that are consistent with the scientific facts. The first, adopted by the utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer, is that even infants are not fully human and thus infanticide should be legal.[xi] I will let that speak for itself. The second is that the fetus became a human individual at some unknown, possibly distant, time earlier in the process and thus abortion at almost any stage constitutes something approaching a dangerous moral gamble.\n\nSo when pro-choice advocates focus all their emphasis on the many social and economic benefits that women\u2014and the society around them\u2014gain from the freedom to choose when to reproduce, they are both completely correct and completely ignoring the torturous moral question that is driving the debate: what if, when that choice comes via abortion rather than contraception, those benefits are built upon millions of dead human persons?\n\nThe main moral concern is that the organism might be a human being. If so, then the fact that killing him or her may give another person a better life is at a minimum a truly gut-wrenching decision. A moral belief system that tries to pretend that that decision is not fraught with moral peril seems almost predicated on the millennia-old notion of the stoics that fetuses were a form of plant life until the moment of birth.[xii] It cannot be rationally sustained. Peter Singer waits down that path.\n\nThe pro-life camp is right, then, that, morally, the best that abortion can be is a terrifying question mark. And yet, abortion is an evil without villains. Moral exhortations to choose life may be correct, but don\u2019t cut much when offered in isolation and when a woman is already working two jobs to feed three kids and can\u2019t picture a secure future for a fourth.\n\nAnd where the pro-life movement fastens blinders to itself is in thinking that this moral answer morally necessitates a blanket abortion ban.\n\nFrom a legal and policy standpoint, something magical does happen at birth: the community, if needed, can step in to protect the life of the baby without violating bodily autonomy and without precipitating the resurgence of dead and wounded women in our hospitals because of self-help and back-alley abortions.\n\nIt is disappointing that the banner pro-life event of the year, the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., takes place on the anniversary of Roe. Roe is not the anniversary of the beginning of abortions in America. Whatever one may think of its legal merits, Roe is the anniversary of the end of women dying in abortions in America.\n\nBefore Roe, abortions were still pervasive in the United States. For decades, hundreds of thousands of fetuses were aborted every year. Added to this toll over the years were the thousands of women who died in dangerous abortions.[xiii] Illegality makes things dangerous. It does not matter if the women are given a free pass and only doctors prosecuted, as some pro-life advocates have called for.[xiv] The prosecution of doctors means that most competent doctors flee the field. Without competent doctors to perform abortions, women turn to the only ones left: the incompetent and the unlicensed. Crack down harder and deter even those and women will turn to dangerous self-help. The bottom line: ban all abortion and women will die.\n\nAround the world today, tens of thousands of women die each year from unsafe abortions. Those deaths would drop drastically and rapidly if abortion were made legal, and they have done so in countries that have done so.[xv]\n\nA small price to pay for the lives of the saved unborn, the hardline pro-life camp might argue? To which I would respond, what saved unborn?\n\nEconomic security, not abortion prohibition, is the best predictor of low abortion rates. Cultural and moral norms, and access to and education about effective birth control, also play large roles. But it is not at all clear that laws do. In the Philippines, for example, abortion is comprehensively banned. Despite this, the country has a per capita abortion rate far higher than ours (c.27 vs. c.13).[xvi] What do they have that we don\u2019t, courtesy of their anti-abortion laws? Every year, tens of thousands of hospitalizations of women from botched abortions, and hundreds of deaths.[xvii] Same basic story in Central America. And South America. And much of Africa.[xviii]\n\nWestern Europe, which generally has abortion on demand in the first trimester? The lowest abortion rates in the world. Same basic story in Northern Europe and South Africa.[xix]\n\nThis is not to say that liberal abortion laws always come in tandem with low abortion rates\u2014Eastern Europe has some of the most liberal laws and highest rates.[xx] But it is to say that the strict laws that will guarantee the death and hospitalization of thousands of women are patently unnecessary to reduce abortion. Given that reality, to ban all abortion is, in practice, to choose death over life.\n\nThe pro-life policy path forward is to continue to expand the reach of affordable contraception to all through access and education. The biggest benefit that this approach has over prohibition: it works. Colorado tried an intensive four-year pilot program to give out free or reduced-cost long-term contraceptives. Abortions dropped 35%. Infuriatingly, Republican lawmakers cut the program\u2019s funding.[xxi] Still, the overall increased use of similar long-term contraceptive methods is bringing unplanned pregnancies down, and abortions along with them.[xxii] The Affordable Care Act has been a big part of this push, which makes the Republican Party\u2019s and Catholic Church\u2019s vocal opposition to the law\u2019s contraception provisions, from an anti-abortion standpoint, positively mind-boggling (says this Catholic).[xxiii]\n\nOpponents of legal abortion will likely retort that laws by their very nature carry moral weight and can seem to endorse whatever activity they allow. There is certainly some truth to this. Which makes it all the more important that, even as abortion necessarily stays legal, society both extends the social safety net and sends a moral message: this is legal, but we don\u2019t like this, and we wish you wouldn\u2019t do it. Please don\u2019t. There are alternatives.\n\nAnd go further. Don\u2019t hold the March for Life at the Supreme Court. Hold it at adoption centers and foster homes across the country. Demonstrate with action that every child will have a welcome place, even if the mother cannot care for him or her. Volunteer time. Pledge to be a foster parent. Pledge to adopt. Pledge to support those who do. Kindness and service. When the last abortion clinic closes in America, it will be because no one showed up.\n\nSo long as we remain locked in bitter ideological conflict over abortion prohibition, there will be no progress towards the worthy goals that each side seeks.\n\nOnly reproductive justice and moral resolve will end abortion in America.\n\n[i] See, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, The Return of the D.I.Y.

Some opposition stems from the fear that IUDs are actually a form of abortion, not contraception, because they might prevent the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Obstetricians and gynecologists view this as a remote possibility in some cases for some types of IUDs, but they do not know if it has ever actually occurred.
