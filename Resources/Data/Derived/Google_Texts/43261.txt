SEOUL, Sept. 3 (UPI) -- A van transporting South Korean pop stars Ladies' Code crashed Wednesday, injuring two members of the band and killing singer EunB.

According to a statement released by the band's management, at roughly 1:20 a.m. local time on September 3, a van driving Ladies' Code and members of their production team to Seoul lost a wheel during a rainstorm, causing the driver to lose control and crash the vehicle.

"After a schedule in Daegu on September 2, Ladies' Code was headed back to Seoul," explained the official statement provided to Yahoo! Philippines.

"Around 1:30 AM in Suwon, an issue occurred with the car′s back wheel coming off. With the rainy road and wheel coming off, the vehicle spun several times, hitting a guardrail. Due to this, EunB unfortunately passed away."

While none of the band's crew was injured, two other performing members of Ladies' Code were hospitalized, one critically.

"Rise is in critical condition while SoJung is injured and hospitalized, currently receiving treatment. The other members, manager, and stylists, who were in the car, did not receive serious injuries."

Despite sustaining no serious injuries, the entire production team is withdrawing from the public spotlight for the time being to cope with the loss of 22-year-old EunB and support those still in the hospital.

"Our staff is also unable to recover from the shock and are in great sorrow right now. We want to apologize to all the fans and everyone who have received much shock, and we ask for everyone to pray for the quick recovery of the [survivors]."
