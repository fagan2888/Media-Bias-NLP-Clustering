John Kasich looks as if he\u2019s preparing for another, this time on the national stage.\n\nThroughout his first term as governor, the Republican struggled to manage the complicated politics of his swing state, taking criticism from the left for scaling back the influence of public sector unions and from the right for accepting federal money from Obamacare to expand Medicaid. But his do-it-my-way message worked. Three years ago, Kasich was so unpopular his re-election was a longshot. On Tuesday, he won by 32 percentage points in one of the most politically polarized states in the nation, making inroads with women and minorities across the state, as he scooped up independent votes.\n\nThe performance instantly made Kasich a presidential contender\u2014donors are already reaching out with invitations and Republican groups are inviting him to speak. Kasich, 62, isn\u2019t shying away from the attention, but he\u2019s not in a hurry either. Speaking with TIME Monday afternoon, the Governor said he wasn\u2019t ready to decide whether to run for the White House. But he showed signs he is seriously considering it: in the coming months, for example, Kasich will launch a national campaign in support of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, just the sort of crypto-campaign that can test the presidential waters and build a national brand.\n\nKasich ran unsuccessfully for president once before, in 2000. At the time, he was a 16-year incumbent in the House of Representatives and Chairman of the House Budget Committee, and his campaign never gained traction: he bowed out even before the Iowa Straw Poll as George W. Bush dominated attention of the political and donor classes.\n\nIf he runs again, Kasich would likely find it easier to gain traction in a crowded, but divided field. That\u2019s due in part to the good fortune Ohio has seen over the last few years. Though his re-election was buoyed by the implosion of his Democratic opponent\u2019s scandal-plagued campaign in August, Kasich also took credit for the state\u2019s booming economy.\n\nIn an interview with TIME, Kasich talked about his victory, what he hopes to accomplish in his second term, and how he\u2019s working to maintain work-life balance as he contemplates his political future.\n\nYou won re-election by 32 points\u2026in Ohio. How did that happen?\n\nKasich: I think that we had a program that covered really\u2014I like to call it the 360 program. We build a stronger economy; help with tax cuts and some reform of regulations, and balancing budgets and all of that. The economy is so much stronger than when I came in four years ago. And in addition to that, once the economy\u2019s strong, which is the most important thing you can do, then you have an obligation to help the people I like to say live in the shadows. So, whether it\u2019s the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, we\u2019ve been able to get insurance for families that have an autistic child, the developmentally disabled have been helped. Minorities feel now\u2014I can\u2019t speak for all of them\u2014but a number of the leaders feel there is a place for them. So everyone was included, Ohio is doing better, and I think it\u2019s become a lot more united. And I think as a result of that, that\u2019s why you get results. We\u2019re basically an ideas administration. We don\u2019t rest on our laurels, we don\u2019t play a lot of politics. We look at problems, try to fix them, and come up with new and cool things that\u2019ll help the state.\n\nHow would you classify your politics? Are you preaching compassionate conservativism?\n\nKasich: Well no one\u2019s ever been able to put me in a box and I\u2019m not about to start putting myself in there.\n\nWhat does your re-election mean for Ohio and its politics?\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a sea change. People today, not just in Ohio, but in the country, they want solutions. They want to believe that things are going to get better. We have for the first time in a dozen years 60% of Ohioans feel that the state is headed in the right direction. I think it should not be interpreted as anything other than you ought to come to Ohio, you gotta tell people what you want to do and how their lives are going to be improved. And whoever does the best job of that is the person who\u2019s going to have the best results.\n\nWhat\u2019s your top priority for the second term?\n\nKasich: It\u2019s going to be a lot more of the same. It\u2019s job creation, making sure that our safety net programs are only a net and not a trap. That they have to provide an opportunity for people to get on their feet. Continuing to include all Ohioans in what we do. It\u2019s education, it\u2019s workforce, it\u2019s reforming higher ed. We can chew gum and walk at the same time out here. We\u2019ll have a very expansive agenda.\n\nYour victory is already starting talk about you running for president in 2016.\n\nKasich: Well, what I\u2019m excited about is that people are showing a lot of interest in the things that we\u2019ve done out here, and I think that\u2019s good. That makes me happy\u2014it\u2019s pleasing to me, I should say\u2014that people are going to take a very hard look at what we\u2019re doing here. And I think the process of being hopeful, being really opportunity oriented, not just in rhetoric but in action, showing that no one get\u2019s left behind, not just by talking about it but by doing it, I think is really a key. And not just sitting around with your finger in the air trying to figure out who\u2019s going to like what you do. Take into account where the public is, but lead, lead. Don\u2019t try to just figure out what the polls say, what the poll-driven programs are. I mean, I don\u2019t look at polls, I pay no attention to them. I\u2019m going to pay attention to the public, and the sense of where the public is on certain things, but you have to lead. And so I\u2019m pleased that as a result of this\u2014it was really an unbelievable win\u2014that people are going to start to say how did it happen. And they are saying it now. It gives me a chance to talk about what I think public life ought to be about, which is to lift everyone. It\u2019s not about what your party is, it\u2019s not about which group do you appeal to, it\u2019s about being in this and trying to build and trying to lift everyone, regardless of who they are, regardless of whether they vote for you. That\u2019s not the point of this business.\n\nDo you think too many politicians are too focused on the polls?\n\nKasich: Why don\u2019t you decide that.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker appeared to criticize you over the weekend for taking Medicaid expansion funding. How do you defend it?\n\nKasich: I don\u2019t defend it, I\u2019m for it. I\u2019m not defending anything.\n\nHave you seen those comments?\n\nKasich: No, I really don\u2019t have any reaction\u2014I haven\u2019t seen these comments, it wouldn\u2019t matter if I did see them. You know, we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing here in Ohio, and it\u2019s working for people. It\u2019s helping people, it\u2019s lifting people, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m so comfortable with and very pleased about.\n\nSo you\u2019d use a presidential campaign to spread your message?\n\nKasich: I\u2019m going to be spreading it one way or another. I\u2019m going to be out campaigning aggressively for a balanced budget amendment, I assume I\u2019m going to be making some speeches, where people are going to want to say \u2018tell us what you did.\u2019 And, I\u2019m not kind of anxious to\u2026 You know, we only did a handful of interviews. I think I was asked to go on virtually every show, and I just sort of said, look, we just had an election. It\u2019s an important time to get some rest, to recharge the batteries.\n\nThat must be hard, trying to decompress after the campaign?\n\nKasich: I was telling one of my colleagues the other day, I was a congressman for 18 years and in the legislature for four and at that point my job really overshadowed my life. But I\u2019ve got a good mix between doing my job, having that responsibility, and having a normal life. And I live in my own home, I don\u2019t live in the governors\u2019 mansion. I play golf, I work out, I lead a very normal life, which probably surprises a lot of people. It\u2019s not unusual to see me just right in the neighborhood. But in terms of the campaign, that\u2019s a little bit of a different situation. Let me just give you some statistics. In less than three years, I put 250,000 miles on the cars in which I travel. And in the last 100 days, since Labor Day, I think I did well over 100 events. So it\u2019s like running a marathon with a sprint at the end, which of course all great marathoners do, and at some point you\u2019ve got to stop running and rest up. So I\u2019m trying to get away from it. I\u2019m trying to recharge. It\u2019s important if you want to have good perspective, you\u2019ve got to make sure that you\u2019re rested. So I\u2019m working at it. I\u2019m exercising, I\u2019m playing golf, I\u2019m trying to get away, spend some time with my family. But I think I have a ways to go before I\u2019m fully recharged.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After resounding re-election, the Ohio governor looks to his next campaign.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "After resounding re-election, the Ohio governor looks to his next campaign.", "title": "Kasich Takes the Stage", "url": "http://time.com/3578286/kasich-ohio-white-house-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/john-kasich1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/john-kasich1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "After resounding re-election, the Ohio governor looks to his next campaign.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kasich Takes the Stage"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2014 election, 2016 election, john kasich, newsmaker interview, ohio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "john kasich, 2016 election, 2014 election, ohio, president, white house, campaign, medicaid"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m exercising, I\u2019m playing golf, I\u2019m trying to get away, spend some time with my family.\nKasich: I\u2019m going to be spreading it one way or another.\nI\u2019m going to pay attention to the public, and the sense of where the public is on certain things, but you have to lead.\nBut in terms of the campaign, that\u2019s a little bit of a different situation.\nI\u2019m trying to recharge."}
