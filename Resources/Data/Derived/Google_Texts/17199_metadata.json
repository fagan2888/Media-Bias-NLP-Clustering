We were not consulted, polled, or contacted by these Washington DC groups such as FreedomWorks has claimed,\u201d the letter continues.\n\nFreedomWorks\u2019s switch from former state Treasurer Shane Osborn to Sasse a few weeks ago is what spurred the urgent letter. The grassroots group cited reports that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell McConnell sets up vote to begin debate on defense policy bill Overnight Healthcare: Congressional report finds NFL 'acted improperly' in concussion study This week: Defense, energy bills top agenda MORE (R-Ky.), a toxic figure in the conservative movement, was implicitly supporting Osborn.\n\nWith their flip, Sasse now has the backing of nearly every major national conservative group that has weighed in on the race, including the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund, as well as support from conservative leaders like Sen. Mike Lee Mike LeeSenate set for showdown over women in the draft Overnight Finance: Path clears for Puerto Rico bill | GOP senator casts doubt on IRS impeachment | Senate approves .1B for Zika Overnight Tech: Trade groups press NC on bathroom law MORE (R-Utah) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R).\n\nThose endorsements have given him a boost in the competitive GOP primary to replace retiring Sen. Mike Johanns Mike JohannsTo buy a Swiss company, ChemChina must pass through Washington Republican senator vows to block nominees over ObamaCare co-ops Revisiting insurance regulatory reform in a post-crisis world MORE (R), and in recent polling he\u2019s caught up to Osborn, who was the original frontrunner in the race. Osborn does have the support of some national conservative figures, like social conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly.\n\nThe conservatives write in their letter that they are \u201cdisappointed with the way DC organizations are telling Nebraskans what the Tea Party in Nebraska thinks.\n\nIt concludes: \u201cWe find the endorsement of Ben Sasse and the claim of widespread support by Tea Party activists to be presupposed and false and we do not support him. Ben Sasse is absolutely NOT the conservative solution Nebraska needs to decrease Washington DC's power.\u201d\n\nThe letter is signed by 52 Nebraska conservative activists, ranging from founding members of local Tea Party groups to gun rights activists to Christian conservative activists, and was sent to nearly 20,000 people in Nebraska and nationwide.\n\nBonnett said though he\u2019s been an organizer for FreedomWorks through its online organizing tool for some time, he was given no advance notice of the endorsement switch and \u201cnobody I\u2019ve talked to has said they\u2019ve been polled or talked to by FreedomWorks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter is an attempt to protect the integrity of our conservative movement and to ensure that we don\u2019t allow any one group or any one big personality to risk the credibility of all of us,\u201d he said.\n\nFreedomWorks spokeswoman Jacqueline Bodnar said it was \u201cpretty clear\u201d the letter was orchestrated by the Osborn campaign, and that while the group \u201cappreciate[s] the feedback and the input from these 52 activists,\u201d it\u2019s not necessarily representative of conservatives in the state overall.\n\n\u201cFreedomWorks is a service center to grassroots activists. We work hard to empower local volunteers and groups at their request, not the other way around,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor every 50-person petition, there are thousands of conservatives, libertarians and tea party leaders who believe that Ben Sasse is the strongest choice in the Nebraska Senate primary. They have asked for our help, and we plan to continue empowering those volunteers on the ground with resources and materials as best we can,\u201d Bodnar added.\n\nA primary focus in the race has been a debate over who\u2019s the true outsider candidate. Sasse supporters have pointed to Osborn\u2019s McConnell support as evidence he\u2019s beholden to the establishment, and Osborn supporters say Sasse\u2019s work for the George W. Bush White House on healthcare policy and his ties to former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney both undermine his claim to that title.\n\nThe letter may indicate that those endorsements could be a double-edged sword if they frustrate grassroots organizers who feel they were left out of the process.\n\nAnother signer, Sheri Aden, Nebraska state director of the group Smart Girl Politics, told The Hill that the spate of conservative endorsements for Sasse \u201cjust reeks of elite GOP, putting someone in place without actually consulting the grassroots.\u201d\n\nAden said she hadn\u2019t seen or heard of Sasse at any Tea Party events before he jumped in the race, and since then, hadn\u2019t seen him at any events either. His campaign couldn\u2019t provide The Hill with a list or number of Tea Party events the candidate had attended recently, or before launching his bid, though it did tout his near-daily anti-ObamaCare town halls.\n\n\u201cWell, who is this guy?\u201d Aden said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been a Tea Party person for five years and all of a sudden he\u2019s getting these endorsements, where\u2019s the Sarah Palin endorsement coming from, really? There are obviously concerns about, is he going to owe [the conservative groups] favors.\u201d\n\nBoth Bonnett and Aden are Osborn supporters, and though they both said the letter includes signatures from supporters of the other two non-Sasse candidates in the race \u2014 banker Sid Dinsdale and attorney Bart McLeay\u2014 neither could provide specific examples.\n\nSasse\u2019s campaign provided its own letter, signed by 120 people who identified themselves only as \u201cindependent grassroots activists,\u201d declaring that Sasse \u201cis by far the strongest, most conservative\u201d candidate in the race and touting his healthcare alternative.\n\nScott Petersen, a conservative campaign operative who was chairman of the Douglas County Republican Party while Bonnett was executive director, said the letter appeared as though it was \u201ctrying to stir up a frustration\u201d with conservatives in Nebraska, rather than reflecting real discontent.\n\n\u201cIn reality, there\u2019s a lot of different conservative, Tea Party, freedom organizations,\u201d Petersen, who said he\u2019s neutral in the race, added. \u201cThis letter looks to be more of an attempt by a campaign to try to change the discussion on endorsements.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the deep divide in the state, Peterson did admit that \u201cto try to assume [Nebraska conservative groups] lean one way or another is naive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A state coalition is criticizing the involvement of national conservative groups in the race.", "description": "A state coalition is criticizing the involvement of national conservative groups in the race.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A state coalition is criticizing the involvement of national conservative groups in the race.", "title": "Neb. conservatives: Sasse isn't our pick", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/203367-ne-conservatives-sasse-isnt-our-pick", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/203367-ne-conservatives-sasse-isnt-our-pick", "dcterms.date": "2014-04-11T16:11-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jessica Taylor", "author": "Alexandra Jaffe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Nebraska Senate, FreedomWorks, Ben Sasse, Shane Osborn,Mitch McConnell, Mike Johanns, Mike Lee,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-11T16:11:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/203367-ne-conservatives-sasse-isnt-our-pick", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A state coalition is criticizing the involvement of national conservative groups in the race.", "card": "summary", "title": "Neb. conservatives: Sasse isn't our pick"}, "dcterms.title": "Neb. conservatives: Sasse isn't our pick"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca48d\"", "article_summary": "A group of Nebraska conservatives has penned a letter declaring Midland University President Ben Sasse isn\u2019t their preferred Senate candidate and criticizing the involvement of national conservatives in the race.\n\u201cIn reality, there\u2019s a lot of different conservative, Tea Party, freedom organizations,\u201d Petersen, who said he\u2019s neutral in the race, added.\n\u201cFor every 50-person petition, there are thousands of conservatives, libertarians and tea party leaders who believe that Ben Sasse is the strongest choice in the Nebraska Senate primary.\nThe conservatives write in their letter that they are \u201cdisappointed with the way DC organizations are telling Nebraskans what the Tea Party in Nebraska thinks.\nIt concludes: \u201cWe find the endorsement of Ben Sasse and the claim of widespread support by Tea Party activists to be presupposed and false and we do not support him."}
