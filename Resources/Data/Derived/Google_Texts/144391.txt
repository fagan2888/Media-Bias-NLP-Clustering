Don’t try to get around town on January 29 — that’s the day first lady Michelle Obama has re-scheduled her scrubbed DNC fundraiser at the Hancock Park home of Everybody Loves Raymond creator Phil Rosenthal and his wife, actress Monica Horan. This clambake previously had been scheduled for mid-October at same place but got nixed because the government shutdown made it seem icky — FLOTUS glad-handing Hollywood types who’d forked over $1,250 to $32,400 for the privilege, while many government workers aren’t collecting their paychecks just did not pass the cringe test. Back in October, she’d also pulled the plug on a planned San Francisco fundraiser.

President Obama also had to cancel a Hollywood fundraiser, back in September, at home of Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman because of the possibility of military action in Syria — Michelle’s fundraiser originally was skedded in lieu of that event. POTUS finally showed up in November to soak up some Tinseltown cash — first headlining a $2,500 to $15,000 shindig at Magic Johnson and wife Cookie’s house, then heading over to the Bev Hills home of Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl for a $16,200-a-person or $32,400-a-couple dinner. The next day, Obama finally made it over to Kauffman’s place.
