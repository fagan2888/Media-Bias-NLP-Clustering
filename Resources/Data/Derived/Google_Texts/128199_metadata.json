But most of us don\u2019t need to learn the lesson not to fake having cancer.\n\nI confess that I am the sort of the person for whom the phrase \u201cVicki Gunvalson\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u201d means nothing. But after the \u201cReal Housewives of Orange County\u201d supporting player raised eyebrows over the past season over a does-he-or-doesn\u2019t-he drama over his claims that he was being treated for a deadly form of the disease, I took an interest.\n\nJust last month, Ayers told Radar that he \u201cLife is funny sometimes. Sometimes it is not. My reality is that I have, once again, been diagnosed with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma specifically diffuse large B cell lymphoma\u201d \u2014 a \u201cfast-growing, aggressive\u201d form of the disease. He insisted, \u201cLet me assure you that I am going to remain positive and continue to battle this disease vigorously with much tenacity along with seeking the appropriate medical care.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with E! he said he was \u201cimproving,\u201d and that he \u201cwent from Stage 3 initial diagnosis now down to Stage 2, I have no more inflammation, lesions in my lymphatic system. Just had some bloodwork numbers that need to come down, normalize.\u201d He said, \u201cThe latter part of January was my last round of chemo.\u201d And he\u2019s also said, \u201cUnfortunately, I wish it wasn\u2019t true. It would be a lot easier if I didn\u2019t have cancer just to be honest with you. The daily grind, the routines of reminding yourself that I\u2019m sick and I need to do certain things and not do certain things.\u201d Ayers also offered documentation that appeared to prove that he had been receiving treatment at City of Hope National Medical Center, and said, \u201cThese are the three bills that reference the days I got my treatment.\u201d\n\nBut Ayers\u2019 story still didn\u2019t quite add up. While patients can be successfully treated, cancer staging itself generally is downgraded, as he claimed he\u2019d been. That\u2019s not how the terminology tends to work. And the paperwork Ayers claimed came from City of Hope didn\u2019t resemble the facility\u2019s official documentation. On Tuesday, a representative for City of Hope told E! that that they had not treated anyone named David Brooks Ayers.\n\nAnd then it all came out. On Wednesday, Ayers released a statement admitting he had faked the treatment documents: \u201cWords cannot express the deep regret that I have in fabricating documents to \u2018prove\u2019 to the world that I, in fact, have cancer. What I did was wrong and inexcusable. I acted alone, without Vicki\u2019s knowledge, to produce documents for a reality TV show in hopes of putting doubts about my cancer to rest. I never intended to disclose my actual medical records or details about my private and personal medical history, thus the rationalization of presenting documents that weren\u2019t true simply for a \u2018storyline\u2019 for the show.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ayers admits he faked proof of treatment\u2014if he made up the cancer altogether, he wouldn't be the first", "title": "Brooks Ayers\u2019 disgusting cancer lie: Even for a \u201cReal Housewives\u201d arc, this drama didn\u2019t add up", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ayers admits he faked proof of treatment\u2014if he made up the cancer altogether, he wouldn't be the first", "title": "Brooks Ayers\u2019 disgusting cancer lie: Even for a \u201cReal Housewives\u201d arc, this drama didn\u2019t add up", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/13/brook_ayers_disgusting_cancer_lie_even_for_a_real_housewives_arc_this_drama_didnt_add_up/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/Real_Housewives_Cancer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ayers admits he faked proof of treatment\u2014if he made up the cancer altogether, he wouldn't be the first", "title": "Brooks Ayers\u2019 disgusting cancer lie: Even for a \u201cReal Housewives\u201d arc, this drama didn\u2019t add up", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/Real_Housewives_Cancer.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bravo, Brook Ayers, Cancer, Real Housewives of Orange County, TV, Vicki Gunvalson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While patients can be successfully treated, cancer staging itself generally is downgraded, as he claimed he\u2019d been.\nAnd the paperwork Ayers claimed came from City of Hope didn\u2019t resemble the facility\u2019s official documentation.\nIt would be a lot easier if I didn\u2019t have cancer just to be honest with you.\nTopics: Bravo, Brook Ayers, Cancer, Real Housewives of Orange County, TV, Vicki Gunvalson, Entertainment NewsBrooks Ayers says, \u201cI made a mistake, yet I have learned a huge lesson as well.\u201d That\u2019s nice for him, and I truly hope he has.\nBut most of us don\u2019t need to learn the lesson not to fake having cancer."}
