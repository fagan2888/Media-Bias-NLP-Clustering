Winston Dimel punched in two touchdowns Saturday and helped lead Kansas State to a 34-0 win over South Dakota in the season opener for both teams.

Kansas State overwhelmed its FCS opponent from the first play of the game, when Morgan Burns returned the opening kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. But the Wildcats lost starting quarterback Jesse Ertz on their first offensive series of the game, when Ertz came up limping after only two snaps. He was replaced by Joe Hubener, who completed 9 of 18 attempts for 147 yards and a touchdown.

Dominique Heath led Kansas State receivers with three catches for 54 yards. The Wildcats relied heavily on their fullbacks in the red zone, giving the ball eight times to Dimel, who delivered touchdown runs from the 2 and the 1.

South Dakota's Ryan Saeger converted 18 of 30 passes for 205 yards.

Kansas State is catching some heat over their marching band's performance during halftime. The marching band released the following statement on Twitter:

"We apologize for anyone offended by our halftime performance depicting the starship enterprise and the Jayhawk mascot."

Many people took to social media, claiming the band's formation of the Jayhawk mascot and the "starship enterprise" closely resembled a sexual act.
