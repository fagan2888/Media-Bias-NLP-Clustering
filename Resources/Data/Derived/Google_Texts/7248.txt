Yankton, SD

Sunny skies and relaxed limits welcomed anglers at Lake Yankton in southeastern KELOLAND today, as fisherman take advantage of a rare opportunity.

Officials hope to clear Lake Yankton of all fish due to the large amount of "rough" fish such as Asian carp now present in the lake. As many as six different fishing lines are permitted in Lake Yankton until September 9, in addition to spears, archery and dip nets.

Luke Gapp and his family fish Lake Yankton today, and as of early afternoon, he says their luck could have been better.

"Well, we haven't caught anything yet, so...," Gapp said.

Wildlife officials likely wish the Gapp family's fortune was better; officials want to rid the lake of fish entirely.

Starting Friday until September 9, KELOLAND fishermen and women are allowed to remove up to three times both the daily and possession limits here at Lake Yankton. Additionally, no length limits will be enforced.

The culprits are what officials describe as "rough" fish like Asian carp. The Gapp family's visit to Lake Yankton was motivated by plans to camp. Luke's dad Steve eventually heard about the increased fishing limits.

"I didn't hear about it until, like, Thursday, at work, some people were saying that 'oh you're going fishing because of the limits,' and heard some stuff, about that they're going to have a kill-off over the winter and re-stock," he said.

The Gapp family wasn't the only anglers struggling Sunday.

"I've talked to a few other people this morning, and nobody's having any luck today," Gapp said.

Steve's daughter Serena wasn't about to give up, however.

"We're gonna probably swim a little and then come back and fish," she said.
