This variation is due to several drivers, including broad variation in conditions, comorbidities and medical severity; volume of patients discharged to PAC settings after short stays in acute hospital settings; and the amount and category of PAC services received during the care episode.\n\nMajor PAC providers have already made strides in improving or creating business models to make them better suited to a value-based care system. For example, RML Specialty Hospital, a Chicago long-term care hospital, focuses its ACOs' resources on highly-specialized care for patients admitted directly from a hospital and who needed three days in an intensive care unit. RML also has joined multiple PAC continuing care networks, and is currently tracking data on patients discharged from the hospital for 180 days, which it will then use to compare the outcomes to those of patients discharged from other types of post-acute providers.\n\nMeanwhile, Brooks Rehabilitation, an inpatient rehab facility in Jacksonville, Florida, redesigned its care model that emphasizes four patient needs:\n\nSelecting the right first setting by finding the least expensive PAC setting that meets a patient's needs\n\nby finding the least expensive PAC setting that meets a patient's needs Standardizing care across settings so patient outcome measures are comparable no matter where the patient receives care\n\nso patient outcome measures are comparable no matter where the patient receives care Planning for longitudinal care that results in a two-month care plan that accounts for patient needs in every care setting\n\nthat results in a two-month care plan that accounts for patient needs in every care setting Appointing nurse care navigators who aid patients in a coordinated transition from one setting to the next\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- download the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMost healthcare providers unprepared for longitudinal care\n\nFeds speed plans for value-based payments\n\nStudy: Hospital discharge processes still need work\n\nBeth Israel Deaconess lowers readmissions with post-discharge program\n\nFollow up with patients after discharge\n\nTo reduce readmissions, focus on patient, not condition\n\nHow healthcare providers can make value-based care turn a profit\n\nValue-based care requires trading competition for collaboration", "article_metadata": {"description": "As newer care delivery models evolve and emerge amid healthcare's transition from volume to value-based care, post-acute care providers have a vital role to play, according to a new TrendWatch report from the American Hospital Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As newer care delivery models evolve and emerge amid healthcare's transition from volume to value-based care, post-acute care providers have a vital role to play, according to a new TrendWatch report from the American Hospital Association.", "title": "What post-acute providers need to know about value-based care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/what-post-acute-providers-need-know-about-value-based-care/2015-12-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American Hospital Association (AHA),Care Delivery,coordinate care,longitudinal care,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,post-acute care,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The increased proliferation of alternative payment models that involve shared risk among hospitals, PAC providers and insurers means PAC providers must understand factors such as geographic PAC spending variation.\nAs newer care delivery models evolve and emerge amid healthcare's transition from volume to value-based care, post-acute care (PAC) providers have a vital role to play, according to a new TrendWatch report from the American Hospital Association.\nMajor PAC providers have already made strides in improving or creating business models to make them better suited to a value-based care system.\nFor example, RML Specialty Hospital, a Chicago long-term care hospital, focuses its ACOs' resources on highly-specialized care for patients admitted directly from a hospital and who needed three days in an intensive care unit.\nRML also has joined multiple PAC continuing care networks, and is currently tracking data on patients discharged from the hospital for 180 days, which it will then use to compare the outcomes to those of patients discharged from other types of post-acute providers."}
