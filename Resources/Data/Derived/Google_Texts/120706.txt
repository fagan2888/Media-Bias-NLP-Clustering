Tens of thousands of Nepalese who spent the night outdoors under a chilly sky were jolted awake today by strong aftershocks from a powerful, magnitude 7.8 earthquake that killed nearly 2,000 people across the Himalayan region.

One powerful, magnitude 6.7 aftershock sent people yelling and running for open ground.

Meanwhile, rescuers aided by international teams are clearing rubble in search of survivors while landslides are blocking roads, hindering aid efforts. Planeloads of aid material, doctors and relief workers from neighboring countries began arriving today.

Nepal bore the brunt of the quake's impact and officials say the death toll is expected to climb. Among the dead are 17 who were struck by a quake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest that buried part of the base camp.

Most areas remain without power and water. Workers are sending out tents and relief goods in trucks and helicopters.
