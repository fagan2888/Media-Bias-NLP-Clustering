Two Wheat Ridge police officers stopped at a red light when another vehicle slammed into their patrol car head-on Sunday morning.

The officers were not hurt, but a passenger in the Honda Accord that hit them at West 38th Avenue and Kipling Street sustained serious injuries, police Commander Mark Cooney said.

The accident happened at 7:55 a.m. The officers were in a marked police sport utility vehicle stopped in a northbound left turn lane on Kipling when it happened.

A black Honda Accord was headed south and veered “over the double yellow and hits the police car head-on,” Cooney said.

The officers had only minor injuries but went to a hospital as a precaution.

The driver and a second passenger in the Accord weren’t seriously injured, but were taken to the hospital.

Alcohol is suspected as a contributing factor.
