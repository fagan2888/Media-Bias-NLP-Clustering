According to reports, Mercer then shot him two more times.\n\n\u201cI really think that if he wasn\u2019t such a strong, young guy, he may have died,\u201d another aunt, Wanda Mintz, told QFox13.\n\nIn total, Mintz was shot in the back, abdomen, and hands. It is not clear how his legs were broken. Miraculously, none of his vital organs were hit throughout the onslaught of bullets.\n\n\u201cHe was on the wrestling team and he\u2019s done cage-fighting, so it does not surprise me that he would act heroically,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAfter police gained control of the situation, Mintz was taken to a hospital where he underwent surgery.\n\nHis family members have given updates on his status.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019m hearing, he\u2019s fine,\u201d Mintz\u2019s cousin Derek Bourgeouis told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to have to learn to walk again.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe page to help with medical expenses was set up by Derek Bourgeois after the attack. He says Mintz will \u201chave to go through a ton of physical therapy.\u201d\n\nThe page raised almost $15,000 in the first hour that it was up.\n\n\u201cI just hope that everyone else is OK,\u201d Mintz told ABC News in an interview Friday morning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just worried about everyone else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Army Veteran Chris Mintz stood up to an active shooter yesterday at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, taking seven bullets and surviving.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "U.S. Army Veteran Chris Mintz stood up to an active shooter yesterday at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, taking seven bullets and surviving.", "title": "Hero Chris Mintz Stands Up to Oregon Shooter, Survives", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Mintz.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T19:05:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WBZKUh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "U.S. Army Veteran Chris Mintz stood up to an active shooter yesterday at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, taking seven bullets and surviving.", "title": "Hero Chris Mintz Stands Up to Oregon Shooter, Survives", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Mintz.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2015-10-02T13:50:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T19:05:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Oregon, Chris Mintz, Umpqua Community College"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI just hope that everyone else is OK,\u201d Mintz told ABC News in an interview Friday morning.\nNorth Carolina native Chris Mintz has emerged as a hero after yesterday\u2019s tragic shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon.\n\u201cI really think that if he wasn\u2019t such a strong, young guy, he may have died,\u201d another aunt, Wanda Mintz, told QFox13.\nMintz, 30, then allegedly stood up to shooter Chris Harper Mercer as he made his way through a building on Umpqua\u2019s Roseburg, Ore., campus.\nMintz, who spent ten years with the U.S. Army including an overseas deployment, reportedly ran toward the gunfire to help other students get to safety."}
