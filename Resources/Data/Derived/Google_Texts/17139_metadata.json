He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2015\n\n.@FoxNews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @RichLowry to use such foul language on TV. Unheard of! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2015\n\nThe appearance of Lowry on a Fox show hosted by anchor Megyn Kelly was something of a perfect storm for Trump conspiracy-mongering. Last month, Trump accused Kelly and Fox News generally of treating him unfairly in the first presidential debate, sparking a feud between the candidate and the conservative news network that was briefly allayed when Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News, called Trump to make peace.\n\nThe Trump-Fox conflict, since reignited, can only be inflamed by Lowry\u2019s performance last night, but the number one cable news network in the country is not the only arm of the conservative media taking on The Donald.\n\nRelated: Two New Polls Show Exactly Why Donald Trump Is Winning\n\nConservative Washington Post columnist and Sunday talk show regular George Will has been attacking Trump\u2019s fitness for office for months, writing memorably in August that \u201cEvery sulfurous belch from the molten interior of the volcanic Trump phenomenon injures the chances of a Republican presidency.\u201d\n\nCharles Krauthammer, another conservative who like Will writes for the Post and appears regularly on the Sunday shows, has been a frequent Trump critic as well.\n\nBut if criticism from the Washington Post editorial pages and the National Review can be dismissed as the Republican establishment circling the wagons to protect its own, the same can\u2019t be said for many of the other elements of the conservative media universe that have turned on Trump.\n\nLast month, Erick Erickson, the founder of the conservative website RedState, a popular venue with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, banned Trump from speaking at an event his group was sponsoring. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in early September embarrassed Trump by exposing gaps in his foreign policy knowledge in a one-on-one interview.\n\nRelated: Trump, Obama and Bush Agree \u2013 Close the Carried Interest Loophole\n\nThe Federalist, a relatively young online conservative publication that has quickly gained influence, has mercilessly chronicled the billionaire candidate\u2019s political stumbles and policy failings.\n\nSo when Trump complains about his treatment by the media, remember, he may be paranoid, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wrong.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to conspiracy theories about he media campaign against him, Donald Trump may be paranoid.
