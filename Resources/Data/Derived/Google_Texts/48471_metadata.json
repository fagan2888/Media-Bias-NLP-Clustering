This is coming from the fast food restaurant that developed a meal that eventually became known as \u201cheart attack on a hook\u201d \u2014 the Big Catch platter, which contains 33 grams of trans fat in one sitting.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to improve the health profile of our entire menu and transition all of our fried products to trans-fat-free soybean oil,\u201d Mike Kern, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a news release. \u201cWhether choosing delicious baked or our classic batter-dipped fried fish, our guests can order with the confidence that their food has zero grams of trans fat.\u201d\n\nIn November of last year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided to ban partially hydrogenated oils in all manufactured foods. The FDA noted that trans fat could no longer be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d and thus many food manufacturers would have to remodel their food development process. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that reducing trans fat in foods could save up to 7,000 people from dying from heart disease \u2014 and up to 20,000 heart attacks per year. Indeed, plenty of research has linked trans fat to heart disease. \u201cThe scientific evidence is clear \u2014 eating food with trans fat increases production of \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease,\u201d the American Heart Association told CNN.\n\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a nutrition and health policy watchdog group, last year stated that Long John Silver\u2019s had the \u201cworst restaurant meal in America.\u201d Jeff Cronin, CSPI\u2019s director of communications, noted that the Big Catch platter meal actually surpassed any food out there when it came to trans fat servings; it exceeded two weeks\u2019 worth of maximum daily intakes recommended by the American Heart Association. However, after Long John Silver\u2019s adjusted its menu, CSPI\u2019s executive director Michael F. Jacobson gave the fast food restaurant some credit. \u201cWe were glad to work collaboratively with Long John Silver\u2019s leadership team and are pleased that the company achieved its ambitious goal in six months\u2019 time,\u201d Jacobson said in a news release.\n\nRemoving trans fat items from their menu is just one of several steps Long John Silver's is taking to \"revamp\" their menu and image. For example, the company plans to add the Crab Cake Sandwich to a \"Good For You\" menu, along with several other meals and soups. \u201cIt\u2019s great news and a big step on their journey to revitalize the brand overall,\u201d Gary Gerdemann, PR for the company, told NPR in an email.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "trans fat ban, long john silver's, partially hydrogenated oils, fda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The fried fish restaurant Long John Silver\u2019s has removed trans fat from its menu, in an attempt to improve its menu for health-aware customers.", "title": "Long John Silver\u2019s Removes Trans Fat; Fish Will Be Fried In \u2018Trans-Fat-Free-Soybean Oil\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/long-john-silvers-removes-trans-fat-menu-fish-will-be-fried-trans-fat-free-soybean-oil-267794", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/fried-fish.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The fried fish restaurant Long John Silver\u2019s has removed trans fat from its menu, in an attempt to improve its menu for health-aware customers.", "title": "Long John Silver\u2019s Removes Trans Fat; Fish Will Be Fried In \u2018Trans-Fat-Free-Soybean Oil\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/long-john-silvers-removes-trans-fat-menu-fish-will-be-fried-trans-fat-free-soybean-oil-267794", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/fried-fish.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/fried-fish.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-23T18:35:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-23T19:51:41-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The fried fish restaurant Long John Silver\u2019s has removed trans fat from its menu, in an attempt to improve its menu for health-aware customers."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc6b\"", "article_summary": "Removing trans fat items from their menu is just one of several steps Long John Silver's is taking to \"revamp\" their menu and image.\nHowever, after Long John Silver\u2019s adjusted its menu, CSPI\u2019s executive director Michael F.
