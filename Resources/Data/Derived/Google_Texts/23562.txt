â€” Authorities in Wake County were searching early Wednesday for a 15-year-old boy who went missing from a home in Apex.

The North Carolina Center for Missing Persons issued a Silver Alert for Noah Isiah Dunn at about 1:45 a.m. Wednesday, saying he is believed to be suffering from a cognitive impairment.

Dunn was last seen at 2629 Brad Court, a home just west of N.C. Highway 401.

Dunn is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs about 120 pounds. He has black hair in an afro style and black eyes. He has a tattoo of a cross on his chest and a tiger on his right arm.

When he disappeared, Dunn was wearing a white T-shirt, khaki pants and white Nike tennis shoes with a black stripe. It's unclear where Dunn might be headed.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts should call the Wake County Sheriff's Office at 919-856-6911.
