A new study from the journal Psychological Science finds that people who are good at planning their financial future are more likely to take steps to improve their physical health \u2014 and then actually become healthier.\n\nThe research, scholars say, offers a keen insight into the sorts of people who are likely to make short-term sacrifices in the name of a brighter future.\n\n\u201cIt suggests that there is something very abstract and fundamental about caring for the future,\u201d said Gretchen Chapman, an editor for the journal and a psychology professor at Rutgers University. \u201cThe sort of person who invests in retirement is the sort of person who takes care of their health.\u201d\n\nThe results echo previous research showing that some people are more predisposed than others to invest in the future. But much of that work, Chapman said, has been in the area of addiction \u2014 why heroin addicts, say, think differently about future consequences than nonaddicts. And this paper adds another interesting twist: The results come not from a laboratory experiment but from realworld data.\n\nThe researchers gleaned the findings from a trove of financial and health information that a midsize industrial laundry company in the Midwest collected from its employees, with their consent. The data was gathered anonymously by a third party and in turn provided to researchers at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nBroadly, the researchers looked at employees\u2019 contributions to their 401(k) plans and compared them against various measures of their health, including blood test results; cholesterol, kidney and iron levels; exercise frequency; and whether they smoked.\n\nFirst, the measures of about 200 employees were taken to establish a baseline. Then all the employees were told their health results and given instructions on how they might improve. A year later, they were tested again, in some cases more than once.\n\nEmployees who contributed regularly to their 401(k) plan were not only more likely to take steps to improve their health but also, in aggregate, had a 27 percent improvement in their blood scores.\n\n\u201cNoncontributors continued to suffer health declines,\u201d the paper said. The 401(k) contributors also showed relative improvements in safety behaviors, like seatbelt use.\n\nThe paper\u2019s co-author, Lamar Pierce, an associate professor of organization and strategy at Olin, said the findings should inform public policy debates about nutrition and personal finance. Some people, he said, respond well to information and education, but others \u2014 like the employees who neither saved nor took care of themselves \u2014 may need stronger solutions.\n\n\u201cHaving a single-pronged policy is not effective,\u201d said Pierce, whose co-author was a graduate student, Timothy Gubler.\n\nPierce said that people who didn\u2019t respond to education might need tougher remedies \u2014 such as taxes on sodas to discourage consumption or, in corporate settings, cafeterias that offer only healthy foods.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/hfaging09.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Then all the employees were told their health results and given instructions on how they might improve.\nThe 401(k) contributors also showed relative improvements in safety behaviors, like seatbelt use.\nEmployees who contributed regularly to their 401(k) plan were not only more likely to take steps to improve their health but also, in aggregate, had a 27 percent improvement in their blood scores.\nPierce said that people who didn\u2019t respond to education might need tougher remedies \u2014 such as taxes on sodas to discourage consumption or, in corporate settings, cafeterias that offer only healthy foods.\nBroadly, the researchers looked at employees\u2019 contributions to their 401(k) plans and compared them against various measures of their health, including blood test results; cholesterol, kidney and iron levels; exercise frequency; and whether they smoked."}
