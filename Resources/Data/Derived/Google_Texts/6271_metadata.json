Or Hal McRae upending Willie Randolph during the 1977 Royals-Yankees ALCS.\n\nAnd this one had all the qualities of a sports injury that won\u2019t soon be forgotten \u2014 like Rose running over Ray Fosse at home plate, or Lawrence Taylor snapping Joe Theismann\u2019s leg on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nThus, the debate raged on, with current and former players from all around the majors weighing in on social media and television.\n\n\u201cI hate the fact that people keep saying he plays the game hard. Everybody on the field plays the game hard,\u201d said ESPN analyst Alex Cora, a middle infielder during his playing days. \u201cThere\u2019s a way you should play the game, and this is not the way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can do that,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Chase Utley doesn\u2019t retire and he\u2019s playing next year, he\u2019s going to get drilled. He\u2019s going to get one in the ribs.\u201d\n\nBy now, most everyone with any interest has seen a replay of the violent collision that swung Game 2 of the NL Division Series in Los Angeles\u2019 favor.\n\nWith the Dodgers trailing by a run in the seventh inning, Utley slammed into Tejada at second base to make sure the Mets could not complete a double play that would have kept them ahead. Utley went in high and hard, crashing into Tejada\u2019s legs and flipping the shortstop head over heels.\n\nThe tying run scored, Tejada was wheeled off with a fractured fibula and the Dodgers rallied for three more runs in the inning, going on to a 5-2 victory that evened the best-of-five series at one apiece.\n\n\u201cI feel terrible that he was injured. I had no intent to hurt him whatsoever,\u201d said Utley, an All-Star second baseman who knows firsthand the perils of turning two. \u201cYou have to try and break up the double play. That\u2019s winning baseball.\u201d\n\nBut did it cross the line?\n\nTakeout slides are an accepted part of the game \u2014 always have been. The general guideline is they\u2019re within the rules as long as a runner doesn\u2019t go so far out of the basepath that he can\u2019t reach second base.\n\nBut there\u2019s also an etiquette to it because the later the slide, the more dangerous it can be.\n\n\u201cI just try to stay low,\u201d Chicago Cubs slugger Anthony Rizzo said. \u201cThere\u2019s ways to do it, there\u2019s ways not to do it.\u201d\n\nUtley went down late, twisting himself beyond the bag to clip Tejada rather than attempting to touch second base. Tejada was in a vulnerable position, with his back to the oncoming runner, after reaching behind his own body to glove an off-target toss from Murphy and trying to make a spinning pivot.\n\n\u201cI bet if he didn\u2019t get hurt nobody would be talking about it,\u201d Houston Astros rookie shortstop Carlos Correa said.\n\nA comment in the Official Baseball Rules to Rule 5.09 (a) (13) indicates umpires could have called an inning-ending double play if they determined Utley interfered with Tejada.\n\nThey did not.\n\n\u201cThe objective of this rule is to penalize the offensive team for deliberate, unwarranted, unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than trying to reach the base,\u201d the comment reads. \u201cObviously this is an umpire\u2019s judgment play.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a fine line between what\u2019s considered out of bounds and what is a clean, hard-nosed play.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows exactly what that line is,\u201d Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson said.\n\nMajor League Baseball executive Joe Torre said he\u2019ll review the play to see if it warrants any discipline.\n\nWith an eye toward safety, MLB recently adopted new rules to protect catchers from home-plate collisions. St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said he thinks contact at second base will probably be addressed this winter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep our players on the field and put a better product out there,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson and Correa were among those calling for change \u2014 or at least clarification.\n\n\u201cThey protect the catcher. I think they should protect us middle infielders as well,\u201d Correa said.\n\nCardinals third baseman Matt Carpenter, however, didn\u2019t like the sound of that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point now where it\u2019s like, are we going to wear shoulder pads when we play? I don\u2019t know. You never know how much is too much, changing the way the game is meant to be played,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd even Granderson had reservations.\n\n\u201cObviously when a player gets injured, everybody wants to change everything at some point in time,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re not necessarily a contact sport, there\u2019s times where contact is going to happen, and unfortunately for us, we end up losing a player because of it. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you need to go out there and start changing rules.\u201d\n\nUtley, meanwhile, was asked what constitutes a dirty slide.\n\n\u201cI think cleats high, hitting the guy before you hit the ground,\u201d he answered.\n\nAfter seeing the replay, did he think this one was dirty?\n\n\u201cDepends who you\u2019re talking to,\u201d Utley said.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum, AP Sports Writers Jay Cohen and Andrew Seligman in Chicago, Beth Harris in Los Angeles and Kristie Rieken in Houston, and freelancer Brian Sandalow contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clean slide or dirty play?
