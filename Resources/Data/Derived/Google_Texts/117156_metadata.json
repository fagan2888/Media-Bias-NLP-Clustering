They\u2019re all sitting governors who\u2019d like to be president, sure. But what else?\n\nHow about being embarrassingly bad at job creation? That\u2019s right. From January 2011 through January 2015, Louisiana under Jindal ranked 32nd in job creation with 5.4 percent growth over four years. Wisconsin under Walker ranked 35th, with 4.85 percent growth. New Jersey under Christie ranked 40th, with 4.15 percent growth. This compares with a national average of 8.21 percent.\n\nEven Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, who\u2019s worked more with Democrats\u2014most notably by agreeing to Medicaid expansion under Obamacare\u2014and thus tarnished his brand with conservative purists while puffing himself up with Beltway pundits \u2014 only ranked 23rd. He\u2019s still under the national average, with Ohio\u2019s 6.23 percent growth. Ohio has yet to get back to 2007 employment levels, \u201cThe nation and the majority of other states reached this benchmark in 2014,\u201d said researcher Hannah Halbert, in a statement from Policy Matters Ohio.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, once a 2016 hopeful cheered on by Grover Norquist and supported by supply-side icon Arthur Laffer in his crusade to slash (and eventually abolish) Kansas state income tax\u2014a sure-fired job-creation move, according to the promises of all concerned. Justly dubbed a \u201cfailed experiment\u201d for the massive deficits it has generated, the experiment also produced only lackluster job growth of 5.95 percent, ranking 28th in the nation\u2014better than Walker and Christie, sure, but lower than its neighbors in Nebraska (25th) and Oklahoma (14th).\n\nAfter years on end of House Speaker John Boehner whining, \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d this is a singularly unimpressive lot of contenders, wannabes and dropouts. But it\u2019s not an anomaly, as we\u2019ll soon see. Nor is it an anomaly that the national press, so far, routinely ignores this abysmal record. But can they continue to ignore it going forward\u2014particularly in the age of social media?\n\nHistorically, state governors have been the most credible candidates for president. Eight sitting governors have been elected to the White House, compared to just three sitting senators, and four vice presidents (compared to eight who took office after a president died). As chief executive of a state, governors can claim an experience most similar to that of president (though without the foreign policy part), and the potential diversity of that experience purportedly allows for an influx of proven practical state-level solutions to be ushered onto the national stage.\n\nAt least that\u2019s how the political folklore goes. Now, however, it\u2019s something of the opposite. With the off-year Tea Party wave of 2010 sweeping a large number of ideologically extreme politicians into office, decades of right-wing state-level institution-building reached fruition, and helped establish a high degree of uniformly mistaken economic practices\u2014cutting taxes, public investment and much-needed services, all in accordance with a playbook that\u2019s a proven loser. While individual presidential candidates can be expected to blow their own horns, the fact that their basic playbooks are all so similar opens them up to a broader attack: the entire framework of how they think about economic policy simply doesn\u2019t work.\n\nOf course, the GOP\u2019s problem is much bigger than just its current crop of governors, but the pattern of their failures open it up to a new line of attack\u2014provided those failures are seen for what they are. The GOP field can be thought of in terms of three main factions: The governors, all reelected, hence \u201cproven\u201d\u2014with former governors Jeb Bush, Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee thrown in; the first-term (hence \u201cgreen\u201d and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-thin) senators (Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio), and the assorted wild cards (Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, etc.) The senators enjoy the prominence of acting on a national stage, but doing so as part of a particularly dysfunctional Congress hardly sets them up to follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan, JFK or even Barack Obama. Moreover, their relentless attacks on Obama seem custom made to be turned back on them: Was he too young, in need of seasoning? Lacking in executive experience? A glib, superficial media star? Really, Tea Party children of Sarah Palin? Really?\n\nEvery cheap shot the freshman GOP senators have taken, endorsed or profited from directed at Obama is now a heat-seaking missile ready to turn back on them. The wild cards are there to make the senators look \u2026 well, senatorial, if not presidential. They are a sign of normal politics\u2019 failure. The governors are supposed to be the remedy to all this\u2014normal politics getting back on track, recalling the promise of George W. Bush, after the GOP\u2019s Clinton impeachment fiasco (never mind the details of how that turned out\u2026.). That\u2019s why this crop of governors\u2019 not-ready-for-prime-time economic records are particularly devastating: this is supposed to be their strong suit, both as governors and as Republicans. Instead, it is neither.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the embarrassing job-creation numbers, though that alone should be enough to disqualify the whole lot of them. New Jersey has just experienced its ninth bond downgrade under Christie, who may end up looking for a bridge to hide under. In Wisconsin, Walker, facing a two-year deficit that could go as high as $2 billion, has responded with $300 million in cuts for higher education, on top of billions in previous education cuts. Still, job creation was supposed to be Walker\u2019s big thing\u2014he promised to create 250,000 jobs in four years when he first ran in 2010, but came up short by more than 100,000 jobs. Making matters worse are the neighborhood comparisons. Wisconsin ranked between 29th and 41st in job growth over the last four years, the worst in the Midwest three of those years, and second worst the other. In fact, the state performed poorly on a whole host of indicators used by Bloomberg News, and suffers markedly in contrast with neighboring Minnesota, where progressive policies have that state\u2019s economy recovering nicely.\n\nPerhaps the pundits are still dazzled by these guys, but folks at home, not so much. Neither Christie nor Walker has any traction in beating Hillary Clinton in head-to-head home state matchups, probably the only kind of polls this early with any potential long-term 2016 value, since they involve figures well-known to the public being polled. Then again, Walker\u2019s job approval fell to 41 percent in the latest Marquette Law poll (56 percent disapprove), which has plenty of other bad news for him as well.\n\nIn contrast, Kasich does show signs of life, but the modest dose of political pragmatism he\u2019s shown is hardly what the GOP base is looking for, nor is he actually doing that well. Other ambitious GOP governors should really be thinking about reality TV. Bobby Jindal? (Budget cuts to higher education that \u201cwould set us back generations,\u201d according to GOP House Speaker Chuck Kleckley?) Mike Pence? Sam Brownback?\n\nTo really appreciate how bad this field is, we need a bit more context. First, let\u2019s be clear, the GOP\u2019s perceived advantage on the economy is entirely a matter of illusion. In his book, \u201cThey\u2019re Not Even Close: The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records, 1910-2010,\u201d investigative historian Erik Zuesse shows that \u201cDemocratic economic superiority extends not only to the performance of the stock markets, but also to employment, wages, economic equality, and all other major economic variables,\u201d as he explained in a 2012 column for Business Insider.\n\nThe GOP stock market record is particularly noteworthy, since it\u2019s the epitome of what they\u2019re supposed to do best at. However, Zuesse notes, \u201ceach one of the nine separate studies (all of the studies that have been done) of the performance of U.S. stock markets under Republican versus under Democratic presidents and congresses, has shown consistent and overwhelming superiority of economic performance with Democrats in the White House, and also with Democrats in Congress, as compared to Republicans.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a considerable gap between polarized economic policy debates in Washington and a relatively cohesive consensus among most econmists, as pointed out by economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, writing for Bloomberg in 2012 (\u201cThe U.S. Economic Policy Debate Is a Sham\u201d). They reference an ongoing survey of leading economists conducted by the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, including economists of both parties as well as independents. They note that \u201c92 percent agreed that the stimulus succeeded in reducing the jobless rate,\u201d a point that Republican politicians routinely ridicule. (When repeated in 2014, 97 percent agreed.) \u201cOn the harder question of whether the benefit exceeded the cost, more than half thought it did, one in three was uncertain, and fewer than one in six disagreed,\u201d they add. (By 2014, just 6 percent disagreed.) As for the \u201cLaffer Curve,\u201d and the GOP claim that tax cuts will pay for themselves by the growth they produce, Stevenson and Wolfers reported, \u201cThe Booth poll couldn\u2019t find a single economist who believed that cutting taxes today will lead to higher government revenue \u2014 even if we lower only the top tax rate.\u201d\n\nTwo other more recent results are worth mentioning. Democrats have long favored infrastructure spending as a way to stimulate the economy and raise average incomes. Before Obama took office, Republicans agreed, but no longer. In May 2013, 89 percent of economists agreed, just 5 percent disagreed. Later that same year, 91 percent agreed that a U.S. debt default would mean that \u201cU.S. families and businesses are likely to suffer severe economic harm,\u201d even as some Republicans said it would be a good thing to default. Just 3 percent disagreed.\n\nThe Booth expert polling results aren\u2019t monolithic, nor are they necessarily infallible\u2014orthodox economists were blindsided by the financial collapse in 2008, after all. But the degree to which key articles of GOP economic faith clash with overwhelming expert judgment is staggering\u2014and there\u2019s nary a hint of it in most of the media. It\u2019s a disconnect reminiscent of global warming, but much less widely recognized.\n\nIndeed, pundits as a class have internalized the notion of the GOP as the \u201cdaddy party,\u201d the one that does best at all manner of male-stereotyped roles: fighting wars, running the economy, understanding how things work. The Democrats are supposedly the \u201cmommy party,\u201d the one that takes care of you when you hurt.\n\nIt\u2019s utter balderdash, but voters tend to buy into it. In the same column mentioned earlier, Zuesse cited a Gallup poll headline \u201cObama Still Wins on Likability; Romney on the Economy.\u201d The figures were telling: \u201cBy 54 percent to 31 percent Obama is the more likable candidate, but by 52 percent to 43 percent Romney would \u2018better handle \u2026 the economy,\u2019 and by 54 percent to 39 percent Romney would \u2018better handle \u2026 the federal budget deficit.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe majority was wrong about Romney\u2019s economic acumen. He promised to reduce unemployment to 6 percent by the end of 2016, a target Obama hit by October 2014. But it wasn\u2019t just about top-line economic targets\u2014it was his entire economic approach.\n\nAll the way back in January, 2012, Jim Tankersley wrote a piece for the National Journal, \u201cThe Romney Conundrum,\u201d taking note of the disconnect between Romney\u2019s economic plan and the recommendations of his top advisors\u2014a disconnect paralleling the one noted by Stevenson and Wolfers: \u201cRomney issued a 59-point economic plan with fanfare last September. The platform contradicts landmark findings on monetary and housing policies published in 2011 by his top two economic advisers: Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia University\u2019s business school; and N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University professor and the author of the nation\u2019s most widely used college economics textbook.\u201d So Romney was to be trusted because he knew so much, had such smart advisers\u2014who he completely ignored. Yet, somehow, Romney managed to muddle through the whole campaign without this glaring contradiction ever becoming a significant story in the media.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walker, Christie and Jindal were supposed to show off GOP's deep bench.
