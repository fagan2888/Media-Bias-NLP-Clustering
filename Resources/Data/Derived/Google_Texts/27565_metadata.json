According to research from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, states have passed more than 200 restrictions on abortion since 2011, with 22 states enacting at least 70 new measures in 2013 alone. (Not all is progress for pro-lifers, who witnessed high-profile losses in Virginia and Albuquerque last year.)\n\n\n\nActivists campaigning against abortion promise that 2014 will be another year of gains for the movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been a groundswell of activity,\u201d says Charmaine Yoest, head of Americans United for Life. \u201cWe\u2019ve really seen the states become laboratories for democracy on these issues, and now we\u2019re seeing a patchwork of legislation starting to emerge.\u201d\n\nIn Tennessee, voters will decide this fall on whether to amend the state constitution to give lawmakers broader power to restrict abortion. If passed, the initiative would effectively overturn a 2000 state court ruling that found many abortion restrictions violated the strong privacy protections in the Tennessee Constitution, opening the floodgates for the GOP-controlled state government to push through a raft of new anti-abortion laws.\n\nIn Colorado, voters will consider a measure that would classify a fetus as a \u201cperson\u201d in cases of violent acts against women, a new iteration of the \u201cpersonhood\u201d initiatives that have been introduced \u2014 and mostly failed \u2014 in at least 10 states.\n\nAnd an initiative set to appear on the North Dakota\u2019s ballot this year takes the idea one step further, giving a fetus full legal rights under the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nFor the most part, anti-abortion efforts in 2014 will be dedicated to limiting access to the procedure, rather than advocate for outright bans. In the tussle over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the president\u2019s signature health care law, pro-life activists have found a new campaign in limiting health insurance coverage for abortion, wedding their efforts with wider conservative complaints. Last week , the House of Representatives voted to pass the No Taxpayer Funding For Abortions Act, which would permanently ban federal funding for abortion and deny tax credits to people who purchase health insurance that covers the procedure.\n\nIn Oregon, the only state with no major limits on abortion access, pro-life activists are working to get an initiative on the November ballot, which would prohibit the use of state taxpayer money for abortions.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, 34 states have already passed some type of restriction on insurance coverage for abortion.\n\nMichigan has become the center of this particular fight since the state legislature, controlled by Republicans, voted in December to ban abortion coverage from both public and private health insurance plans. Under the new rules, women who wish to have the procedure covered by insurance will have to purchase a separate rider before any pregnancy \u2014 a provision opponents derisively call \u201crape insurance.\u201d\n\nThe law \u2014 which was brought to the legislature via a rare citizens initiative, bypassing a likely veto by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder \u2014 makes Michigan the ninth state to bar private health insurers from covering abortion.\n\nWith several states already poised to add new limits to reproductive health care coverage, abortion rights advocates say it is likely that other Republican legislatures will attempt to follow Michigan\u2019s lead this year.\n\nLawmakers in several states have started tailoring regulations to target specific abortion clinics. In Missouri this month, more than 100 state representatives signed on to a\n\nnew bill that would require abortion providers to be inspected at least four times annually\u2014an exhaustive demand, critics say, for the state\u2019s sole abortion clinic.\n\nPro-life groups say the increased scrutiny is necessary to \u201cimprove accountability\u201d and ensure that women are safe at the clinic.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to drive every single clinic out of business so that women just have no recourse,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nWith midterm elections on the horizon, anti-abortion activists are urging the Republican Party to embrace its pro-life position, and more aggressively rebuff Democratic efforts to cast GOP candidates as extreme and anti-women.\n\nAt the Republican National Committee\u2019s recent annual winter meeting, delegates passed a resolution demanding that the party \u201cfight back against Democratic deceptive \u2018war on women\u2019 rhetoric.\u201d The resolution urged Republican candidates to seize \u201cadvantage of widely supported pro-life positions listed above to attract traditional and new values voters.\u201d\n\nSusan B. Anthony List, a national pro-life organization, said that it plans to use support for a ban on abortion after 20-weeks to target vulnerable Democrats in North Carolina, Louisiana and Alaska, three of the toughest states for Democrats who are seeking to maintain their hold on the Senate this fall.\n\n\u201cWe want our candidates to be out there, getting in front of these issues,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nBut Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones who are seizing reproductive issues as a key to victory in state-wide races in 2014.\n\nIn conservative Kansas, where Gov. Sam Brownback faces a surprisingly competitive race against pro-choice Democrat Paul Davis, the state\u2019s little-known senate minority leader, pro-choice advocates are trying to turn Brownback\u2019s anti-abortion positions into liability as he campaigns for reelection this fall. While Brownback remains the heavy favorite in deep-red Kansas, where lawmakers voted last year to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and have passed a law defining life as beginning at conception, the governor has seen his approval ratings sink well below 50 percent, and a recent poll from SurveyUSA shows Brownback trailing Davis in a 2014.\n\nCampaigning in a different deep red state, Democrats have bet on another candidate who has made who stand against restrictions to abortion central to her political identity. Wendy Davis, the state senator who is running for governor in Texas, became best known for her filibuster last to halt a restrictive state law. Even if Davis steers clear of reproductive issues on the campaign trail, her outspokenness on abortion has made the lawmaker particularly popular with the party\u2019s donors whose assistance she\u2019ll need to compete in her expensive race.\n\n\u201cWe understand that we are not going to undo all these trends in one cycle,\u201d said NARAL\u2019s Hogue. \u201cBut there is change coming\u2014there are signs that the American public is starting to stand up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With campaign season on the horizon, reproductive health laws are defining the politics of state capitals and campaigns", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "With campaign season on the horizon, reproductive health laws are defining the politics of state capitals and campaigns", "title": "Battles Over Abortion Flare in 2014", "url": "http://time.com/5284/battles-over-abortion-flare-in-2014/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/abortion-pro-life-pro-choice.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/abortion-pro-life-pro-choice.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "With campaign season on the horizon, reproductive health laws are defining the politics of state capitals and campaigns", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Battles Over Abortion Flare in 2014"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "abortion, politics, republicans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion, politics, republicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb43c\"", "article_summary": "Campaigning in a different deep red state, Democrats have bet on another candidate who has made who stand against restrictions to abortion central to her political identity.\nPro-life groups say the increased scrutiny is necessary to \u201cimprove accountability\u201d and ensure that women are safe at the clinic.\nActivists campaigning against abortion promise that 2014 will be another year of gains for the movement.\nIn Oregon, the only state with no major limits on abortion access, pro-life activists are working to get an initiative on the November ballot, which would prohibit the use of state taxpayer money for abortions.\nRick Snyder \u2014 makes Michigan the ninth state to bar private health insurers from covering abortion."}
