President Barack Obama stood in the White House Rose Garden and proclaimed the law a success: \u201cThe debate over repealing this law is over.\u201d\n\nBut as the second open enrollment period gets under way, a string of bad news is casting new doubts on the president\u2019s proclamation. The website works this time, yet systemic problems are growing: Companies are shedding jobs, rural hospitals are closing, premiums remain high, penalties have spiked, and the administration has admitted last year\u2019s enrollment figure was inflated. Actual first-year enrollment numbers landed at 6.7 million\u2014leading the administration in November to lower 2015 enrollment expectations from 13 million to less than 9.9 million.\n\nThe main thrust of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to increase access to healthcare, but on a surprisingly large scale it\u2019s having the opposite effect. Millions of Americans lost their health insurance because their plans didn\u2019t meet the requirements of the law, accounting for a large portion of the 6.7 million 2014 enrollees. Ed Haislmaier, a health policy expert at the Heritage Foundation, estimates a maximum of 2.4 million previously uninsured individuals obtained insurance through the state and federal exchanges. Others have lost healthcare access through hospital closures: Forty-five rural hospitals have shuttered since 2010, including at least a dozen this year, according to North Carolina Rural Health Research Program tracking data. The closures are primarily due to new regulations and cuts to Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement, but rather than helping reverse the alarming trend, the ACA has accelerated the process.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Roadcap told me her facility was already struggling financially, and knowing the ACA would bring more cuts in 2015 prompted the three-hospital system to close that location, affecting about 100 employees. Now the closest hospital is another rural location 15 miles away, the sole firewall saving Linden residents from a 35-mile drive\u2014which would put thousands at risk of missing the \u201cgolden hour\u201d for treatment after a major medical incident, such as a stroke or heart attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious to anyone working in healthcare that the healthcare delivery system needs to be changed,\u201d Roadcap said. \u201cHow it needs to be changed is a whole different question.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s system still relies heavily on employment, and that\u2019s another area where Obamacare is wreaking havoc. Companies are making choices to cut hours, cut the workforce, and in some cases close locations to cut costs or slide under the 50-employee threshold that requires a company to provide health insurance. Others are dumping employees into the health exchanges, risking the fines that will accompany enforcement in 2015 (see sidebar).\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what our survey predicted,\u201d said Duke University Professor Campbell Harvey, who helped poll more than 1,000 chief financial officers a year ago to ask how they would handle the ACA. Between 40 and 50 percent reported they would hire fewer workers, shift toward part-time employment, and/or lower health benefits. \u201cThe impact on the real economy is astonishing,\u201d Harvey said, and the country is \u201cdefinitely\u201d still in the early stages of feeling the effects.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s labor participation rate already languishes at historic lows, the Congressional Budget Office this year projected the ACA would directly lead to the loss of 2 million full-time-equivalent workers by 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024. Harvey said that \u201csignificantly understates the legislation\u2019s impact,\u201d because it is based on historical patterns and doesn\u2019t reflect companies planning to hire less and shift to part-time labor.\n\nHarvey believes if more people had understood the real effects of the law, the legislation would likely have never passed. He\u2019s not alone: Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and Obamacare architect, sparked a public relations nightmare in November when videos surfaced showing him crediting secrecy and the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d for getting the law through Congress. In Dec. 9 testimony before a House panel, Gruber issued a blanket apology for his \u201cinsulting and mean comments\u201d but defended the law and claimed it was passed in a transparent way. \u201cMy flaws as a private citizen should not reflect on any process by which the ACA was passed, or any success of that law.\u201d\n\nHeritage\u2019s Ed Haislmaier, who was part of a panel discussion with Gruber earlier this year, said the professor\u2019s attitude in the videos is typical: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of folks in health policy on the left who believe the same way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "HEALTHCARE | A string of bad news has beset Obamacare, and worse is likely on the way", "title": "WORLD | Code blue | J.C.
