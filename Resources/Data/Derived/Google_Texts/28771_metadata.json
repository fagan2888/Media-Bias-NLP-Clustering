Browne-Marshall at the website Politics in Color, is entitled \u201c2013: A Year of Racial Challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201c[S]outhern White radicals vowed to stop implementation of the Obama-care law leading one to wonder if Tea Party members would oppose affordable healthcare if it came from a nonBlack [sic] President,\u201d writes Browne-Marshall.\n\nIn the next two profoundly disconnected paragraphs, the taxpayer-funded professor rambles from Abraham Lincoln to Christopher Dorner, the black LAPD cop who killed a bunch of innocent people and then committed suicide at the end of a huge manhunt.\n\n\u201cSome called Dorner insane others said a modern-day Nat Turner, referring to the leader of a Virginia slave rebellion in 1831,\u201d Browne-Marshall writes in her characteristically thick, ungrammatical prose. \u201cHowever, the possibility racism was a core issue in this case was disregarded.\u201d\n\nShe then discusses a host of other issues, including a Supreme Court opinion on voting rights and the fates of Trayvon Martin and \u201cWhite Latino\u201d George Zimmerman.\n\nBrowne-Marshall teaches courses in constitutional law and evidence. She is also a member of the gender studies faculty.\n\nA webpage called \u201cRace, Law, and American Society\u201d is dedicated to a book Browne-Marshall wrote. It explains that Browne-Marshall \u201chas compiled an impressive array of historical and legal materials detailing the persistent legally sanctioned terrorism perpetrated by the majority culture against African Americans.\u201d\n\nThe webpage does not appear to indicate \u2014 as is customary among academics \u2014 the law school that trained Browne-Marshall in constitutional law or, in fact, any school she attended. Her department at John Jay does not list a curriculum vitae at all.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Browne-Marshall reasoned her way to the conclusion that \u201csouthern White radicals\u201d derailed Obamacare. As College Insurrection notes, a CNN poll conducted just before Christmas shows that 62 percent of Americans oppose the president\u2019s signature legislation.\n\nMore than 4.7 million Americans have had their health insurance cancelled as a result of the massive new healthcare regime. At the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Tuesday that, between federal and state exchanges, just 2 million Americans have signed up for Obamacare coverage.
