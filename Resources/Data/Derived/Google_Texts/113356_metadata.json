Researchers could begin by looking at suicide prevention methods and ways to keep guns stored safely and inaccessible to children, she said.A public safety approach means doing research and gathering data to answer the questions everyone has. It doesn't need to involve politics, she said.\u201cOn both sides of the aisle it makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cLet's get some data so we can help people.\u201dRep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) repeated the call for research funding he made in an October letter with other representatives to then-Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\u201cInstead of turning a blind eye to our country's disproportionately high incidence of gun violence, let's investigate evidence-based solutions that will help prevent violence while still protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,\u201d they wrote.Democrats tried to strike the riders that ban funding earlier this year but the notion was rejected along party lines. President Barack Obama directed the CDC to conduct research on guns after the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. He included $10 million for the research in his two most recent budget proposals but Republican legislators have not allowed the funding to go through.During a quick news briefing in the Oval Office on Thursday morning, Obama called for legislators to take basic steps toward making it harder for people to harm others with guns.\u201cRight now it's just too easy,\u201d he said. Dr. Georges Benjamin , executive director of the American Public Health Association, reiterated his call Thursday for strengthening background checks for those buying firearms and for funding gun violence research.\u201cWe strongly believe that common-sense measures can reduce the risk of death and injury caused by gun use, starting with our leaders in Congress taking action,\u201d he said.Also Thursday, Democratic senators, including Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California, turned what was originally a news conference opposing the Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act through budget reconciliation into a call for basic gun control measures.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "A group of physicians had asked lawmakers just hours before Wednesday's mass shooting in California to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to once again research gun violence.", "title": "Democrats, doctors say mass shootings need public health approach", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "A group of physicians had asked lawmakers just hours before Wednesday's mass shooting in California to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to once again research gun violence.", "title": "Democrats, doctors say mass shootings need public health approach", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151203/NEWS/151209953", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151203/NEWS/151209953/AR/0/President-Barack-Obama-San-Bernardino-shooting2.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "A group of physicians had asked lawmakers just hours before Wednesday's mass shooting in California to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to once again research gun violence.", "title": "Democrats, doctors say mass shootings need public health approach", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151203/NEWS/151209953/AR/0/President-Barack-Obama-San-Bernardino-shooting2.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151203/NEWS/151209953", "published_at": "2015-12-03", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20151203/NEWS/151209953/AR/0/President-Barack-Obama-San-Bernardino-shooting2.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17aa\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama directed the CDC to conduct research on guns after the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\nIt doesn't need to involve politics, she said.\u201cOn both sides of the aisle it makes sense,\u201d she said.\nAlice Chen, executive director of Doctors for America, said in an interview Thursday that when she heard about the shooting Wednesday she thought of it as more evidence that her call for funding gun research earlier that day should be heeded.She likened the idea of gun research to research on car safety that led to seatbelts, airbags and a reduction in deaths from automobile wrecks.\nResearchers could begin by looking at suicide prevention methods and ways to keep guns stored safely and inaccessible to children, she said.A public safety approach means doing research and gathering data to answer the questions everyone has.\n\u201cLet's get some data so we can help people.\u201dRep."}
