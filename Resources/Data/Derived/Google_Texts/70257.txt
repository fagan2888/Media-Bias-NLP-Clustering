Wichita Police are searching for a robber who is experiencing a bit of the holiday spirit.

A gunman held up Taco Bell, 5808 E. Central, Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. Police said the man pointed the gun at an employee and demanded money. An undisclosed amount of money was placed in a duffel bag.

Witnesses said as the man ran out of the store he shouted "Merry Christmas". They described as stocky, wearing all black with his face covered by a silver skull mask.

There were six employees and several customers in the store. They weren't hurt.
