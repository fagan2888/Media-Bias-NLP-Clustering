ConnectiCare is seeking a 9.8 percent increase to plans with 34,000 policyholders, while Golden Rule proposed an 18.5 percent rate hike for plans that cover 2,000 policies. Anthem and ConnectiCare initially proposed different average increases but adjusted them after Access Health raised the fee it charges insurance plans to fund its operations.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Katharine L. Wade ordered the hearing after consulting with state Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri about which plans should be subject to it.\n\n\u201cI believe it is very important that consumers better understand the regulatory review process and the factors that drive health care costs that ultimately have an effect on their household budgets,\u201d Wade said in a statement. \u201cThe Department\u2019s actuarial review is rigorous and seeks to ensure that rates are adequate for the benefits offered and protects consumers\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nVeltri said they chose Anthem and ConnectiCare because they have the most customers in the state\u2019s individual market and on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, including some who are new to coverage. \u201cWe felt it was necessary that people have a say in those,\u201d she said.\n\nGolden Rule, meanwhile, was picked because of the size of its proposed increase, Veltri said.\n\nAnthem spokeswoman Sarah Yeager said transparency is important to the company. \u201cAs always, we will cooperate fully throughout the rate filing process and welcome the opportunity in any forum to ensure that all stakeholders have the information they need to understand the factors that support our proposed rates,\u201d she said.\n\nConnectiCare said in a statement that the company \"welcomes the opportunity to review its rate filings with the Connecticut Insurance Department and the general public.\"\n\nThe hearings will be held Monday, July 27, at the Connecticut Insurance Department, 153 Market St., Hartford, on the 7th floor. The ConnectiCare hearing will run from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., Golden Rule\u2019s hearing will run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., and Anthem\u2019s hearing will be held from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nPeople can submit written comments electronically at www.ct.gov/cid.\n\nPast controversies over rate hearings\n\nIn the past, the role of rate hearings has been a subject of intense debate between consumer advocates \u2013 who have sought more frequent hearings on proposals to raise insurance rates \u2013 and insurance department officials, who have maintained that they make decisions about rates based on actuarial factors.\n\nIn 2011, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy vetoed a bill that would have made it easier for the healthcare advocate and attorney general to compel public \u201csymposiums\u201d on proposed rate hikes. Soon after, Veltri and then-Insurance Commissioner Thomas B. Leonardi reached an agreement that allowed her to request hearings on proposals to raise rates by 15 percent or more.\n\nLast year, the insurance department held a hearing on Anthem\u2019s request to raise rates on close to 66,200 policies \u2013 the first rate hearing in nearly four years. The regulator ultimately rejected the insurer\u2019s request to raise rates by an average of 12.5 percent and approved a smaller increase. But in the decision, Paul Lombardo, the actuary who oversaw the hearing and reviewed the proposal, included comments critical of the value of hearings in determining the price of insurance.\n\nIn the decision, Lombardo noted that state law allows rates to be rejected for three reasons: if they\u2019re inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. And he wrote that the department\u2019s usual process for reviewing rate proposals allowed for more flexibility and deliberation, at less cost than holding public hearings.\n\nBut Veltri has maintained that hearings are valuable in giving people confidence in the process used to evaluate rates.\n\n\u201cI think the public often will see a rate increase and say, \u2018Why are they doing this to me?\u2019 and there could be a valid reason in some cases,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hearing does give an opportunity for the plans to justify what they put in.\u201d\n\nVeltri said Tuesday that she and Wade have reached a new agreement on rate hearings. Wade agreed to hold hearings at the healthcare advocate\u2019s request up to four times per year on proposals to raise rates by 10 percent or more \u2014 a lower threshold than under the previous agreement.\n\nThe agreement also notes that the insurance commissioner plans to host a series of public forums throughout the state to help educate people about the factors driving health insurance rates and health care costs, and to allow people to give feedback about their experiences with health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/07/anthem-connecticare-golden-rule-rate-requests-to-get-public-hearings/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Connecticut Insurance Department, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/07/anthem-connecticare-golden-rule-rate-requests-to-get-public-hearings/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Their plans cover 70,553 policyholders who purchased insurance for themselves through the state\u2019s individual insurance market.", "title": "Anthem, ConnectiCare, Golden Rule rate requests to get public hearings", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/07/anthem-connecticare-golden-rule-rate-requests-to-get-public-hearings/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/01/Anthem-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/07/anthem-connecticare-golden-rule-rate-requests-to-get-public-hearings/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Connecticut Insurance Department will hold public hearings July 27 on proposals by three insurance companies to raise rates on health plans for 2016.\nAnd he wrote that the department\u2019s usual process for reviewing rate proposals allowed for more flexibility and deliberation, at less cost than holding public hearings.\nAnthem is seeking to raise rates by an average of 4.9 percent for its plans, which have 34,553 policyholders in the state.\nThe regulator ultimately rejected the insurer\u2019s request to raise rates by an average of 12.5 percent and approved a smaller increase.\nAnthem and ConnectiCare initially proposed different average increases but adjusted them after Access Health raised the fee it charges insurance plans to fund its operations."}
