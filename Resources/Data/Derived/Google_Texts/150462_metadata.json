Americans with incomes less than 400 percent of the poverty level who didn\u2019t have plans through their jobs were given tax breaks to help them buy insurance on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nAlso, about half the states also expanded Medicaid to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, with the federal government covering the costs.\n\nAs a result, federal health care spending grew by 11.7 percent in 2014, compared to 3.5 percent in 2013, meaning government spending outpaced the growth faced by all other sponsors of health care.\n\nThe uptick led to a 2-percentage point increase in the federal government\u2019s share of overall health spending, from 26 percent in 2013 to 28 percent in 2014.\n\nCMS\u2019s report, published in the journal Health Affairs, says Obamacare isn\u2019t the only culprit for increased spending. It also pointed to spending on retail prescription drugs \u2014 particularly to treat Hepatitis C \u2014 that reached nearly $300 billion in 2014.\n\nThe 12.4-percent increase comes after a relatively cool, 2.4-percent increase in 2013, making it the sharpest spike since 2002.\n\nRecent polls suggest Americans consider the high cost of prescription drugs to be the country\u2019s most pressing health concern, and lawmakers are taking notice.\n\nA bipartisan pair of senators released a report Tuesday that said a manufacturer of an effective treatment for Hepatitis C put profits before patients when it demanded $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 for a full course of treatment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health spending spiked by more than 5 percent last year as Obamacare took full effect, according to a new government analysis Wednesday that said the low-growth trend that had prevailed for most of President Obama's time in office changed as new prescription drugs came on the market and Americans started using more services.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Health spending spiked by more than 5 percent last year as Obamacare took full effect, according to a new government analysis Wednesday that said the low-growth trend that had prevailed for most of President Obama\u2019s time in office changed as new prescription drugs came on the market and Americans started using more services.", "title": "Obamacare prompts 5 percent increase in health spending", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/2/obamacare-prompts-5-percent-increase-health-spendi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/02/Obama2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/02/Obama2.jpg", "description": "Health spending spiked by more than 5 percent last year as Obamacare took full effect, according to a new government analysis Wednesday that said the low-growth trend that had prevailed for most of Pr", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare prompts 5 percent increase in health spending"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, Business Finance"}, "article_summary": "As a result, federal health care spending grew by 11.7 percent in 2014, compared to 3.5 percent in 2013, meaning government spending outpaced the growth faced by all other sponsors of health care.\n\u201cMillions of uninsured Americans gained health care coverage in 2014,\u201d CMS acting Administrator Andy Slavitt said.\nThe uptick led to a 2-percentage point increase in the federal government\u2019s share of overall health spending, from 26 percent in 2013 to 28 percent in 2014.\nCMS\u2019s report, published in the journal Health Affairs, says Obamacare isn\u2019t the only culprit for increased spending.\nThe 12.4-percent increase comes after a relatively cool, 2.4-percent increase in 2013, making it the sharpest spike since 2002."}
