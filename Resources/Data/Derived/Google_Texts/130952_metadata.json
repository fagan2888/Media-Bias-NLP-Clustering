Although the patient had no history of head trauma and denied substance abuse, there was one thing amiss about him: A month or so earlier, he\u2019d engaged in what the doctors would later describe in The Lancet as \u201ca contemporary dance form consisting of abrupt flexion\u2014extension movements of the head to the rhythm of rock music, most commonly seen in the heavy metal genre.\u201d\n\nThe metalhead was diagnosed with a subdural haematoma and released after surgeons removed the clot from the right side of his brain.\n\n\u201cEven though there are only a few documented cases of subdural haematomas [due to headbanging], the incidence may be higher because the symptoms of this type of brain injury are often clinically silent or cause only mild headache that resolves spontaneously,\u201d Ariyan Pirayesh Islamian told The Independent. \u201cThis case serves as evidence in support of Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s reputation as one of the most hardcore rock [and] roll acts on earth, if nothing else because of their music\u2019s contagious speed drive and the hazardous potential for headbanging fans to suffer brain injury.\u201d\n\nAlthough introduced in the early 1970s, documented injuries from headbanging remain rare and recent. Guitarist Terry Balsamo, of Evanescence, suffered a stroke from headbanging in 2005. Aside from brain injuries, musical performers engaging in headbanging have suffered spinal injuries, including Slayer bassist and vocalist Tom Araya, who in 2009 underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Likewise, Megadeth guitarist Dave Mustaine in 2011 blamed his neck and spine condition, stenosis, on years of rhythmic headbanging.\n\n\"Headbanging was introduced in the early 1970s,\u201d Islamian and his colleagues wrote in the study. \u201cThe number of avid aficionados is unknown. While such shows are enjoyable and stimulating for the audience, some fans might be endangered by indulging in excessive headbanging.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "headbanging, headbanging injuries, headbanging and brain damage, headbanging and concussion, headbanging and neck injury, headbanging and brain injury", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "It might seem anachronistic, but today's heavy metal fans are still \"headbanging\" decades after Led Zeppelin, Ozzy Osbourne, and Black Sabbath fans popularized the hair-tossing move.
