Before 2012, the Food and Drug Administration reluctantly embraced the basic framework advocated by Mark Baum (“A New Prescription for Lower Drug Prices,” op-ed, Jan. 26). The FDA allowed compounders to manufacture and ship some medicines on a wide scale, absent the agency’s usual oversight, simply because compounded drugs could be sold more cheaply. One of those firms was the New England Compounding Center (NECC). In 2012 one of NECC’s drugs became tainted, killing 64 Americans and sickening 800 others.

Drug compounding was supposed to be confined to pharmacies that made specialized drugs for individual patients. Companies like NECC used the guise of a pharmacy license to operate as large-scale drug manufacturers, but absent the traditional FDA oversight. The episode instigated the passage of the Drug Quality and Security Act in 2013, a law designed to close these loopholes. Mr. Baum advocates the re-extension of a dual market—one for approved generics and one for widely marketed compounded drugs to compete with them. Under his construct, the FDA would oversee the compounded drugs for their manufacturing, but not confirm their effectiveness and safety as it is required to do for the generic medicines.

To address high costs without creating new patient risks, the FDA can take steps to reduce the 50 months it takes for a generic drug to win approval or the 18 months it takes to prepare a generic application. Mr. Baum’s framework would undermine our generic drug model, without fixing the regulatory woes that are the real culprit in reducing generic drug competition.
