The Associated Press (AP) was quick to compare Obama\u2019s statements with the actual facts.\n\nPerhaps the president\u2019s most notable lie of the night was when he declared, \u201cAlthough this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it\u2019s been in nearly two years.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTo call the border crisis of 2014 a \u201cbrief spike\u201d is not only misleading, but completely inaccurate.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2014, more than 68,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended at the Texas-Mexico border. This figure is up significantly from previous years. The AP pointed out that in 2011 only 16,000 children were apprehended; in 2012, 24,000 were apprehended; and in 2013, 38,000 were apprehended.\n\n\u201cThe number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border has been on the rise since the 2011 budget year,\u201d the AP reported.\n\nObama also stated that the number of people illegally crossing the U.S. border is \u201cat its lowest level since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nAgain, that statement is not completely accurate.\n\n\u201d Indeed, in the 2014 budget year the Border Patrol made 486,651 arrests of border crossers, among the fewest since the early 1970s,\u201d the AP reported. \u201cBut border arrests have been on the rise since 2011.\u201d\n\nFinally, the AP slammed Obama for making broken promises to the Latino community. \u201cHe overlooked the fact that he promised as a candidate for president in 2008 to have an immigration bill during his first year in office and move forward on it quickly,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cHe never kept that promise to the Latino community.\u201d\n\nThe facts, however, did not stop Obama from stating during his speech, \u201cWhen I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders.\u201d\n\nFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Slams Obama for Lies in Amnesty Speech", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "AP Slams Obama for Lies in Amnesty Speech", "title": "AP Slams Obama for Lies in Amnesty Speech - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/21/obama-immigration-speechPNG.PNG", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/11/21/ap-slams-obama-for-lies-in-amnesty-speech/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Slams Obama for Lies in Amnesty Speech", "title": "AP Slams Obama for Lies in Amnesty Speech - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/21/obama-immigration-speechPNG.PNG", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Associated Press, Illegal Aliens,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Illegal Aliens", "published_time": "2014-11-21T10:30:40-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf352\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border has been on the rise since the 2011 budget year,\u201d the AP reported.\n\u201d Indeed, in the 2014 budget year the Border Patrol made 486,651 arrests of border crossers, among the fewest since the early 1970s,\u201d the AP reported.\n\u201cBut border arrests have been on the rise since 2011.\u201dFinally, the AP slammed Obama for making broken promises to the Latino community.\nThe AP pointed out that in 2011 only 16,000 children were apprehended; in 2012, 24,000 were apprehended; and in 2013, 38,000 were apprehended.\nThe Associated Press (AP) was quick to compare Obama\u2019s statements with the actual facts."}
