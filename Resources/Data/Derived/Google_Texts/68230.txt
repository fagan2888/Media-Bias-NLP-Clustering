Walgreens Multivitamin 50+ for Women, under recall.

Walgreens stores are recalling bottles of vitamins for older women. But in this case, the vitamins are not the problem.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission reports Multivitamin Women 50+ tablets have a packaging problem. The containers are not child-resistant and senior friendly, as required by the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.

The multivitamin supplement tablets inside the bottle also contain iron, which can cause serious injury or death to young children if multiple tablets are ingested at once.

The packages were sold at Walgreens stores nationwide from January through March for about $16.
