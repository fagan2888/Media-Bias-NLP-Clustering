The message sent on election night from the American people is loud and clear: Washington is broken, the big government experiment has failed, and the time has come for fresh leadership and a new direction for the country. We are humbled by the opportunity before us, but it’s just that – an opportunity, not a referendum.

Under the leadership of Majority Leader McConnell, we will work with the Republican-led House to focus on pro-growth legislation that strengthens our economy, relieves Americans from the burdens of Obamacare, grows America’s energy industry and secures a better future for the generations ahead.

It is my sincere hope that the President will heed the message that was sent election night and work with us to put the interests of the American people ahead of partisan politics and put an end to the gridlock that has plagued Washington.
