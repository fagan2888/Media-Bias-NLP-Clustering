If follow-up admissions labeled as observation stays were excluded from the data, all but about one quarter of the reduction would disappear, according to the article.\n\nIndeed, a February 2013 medical policy at the health system encouraged its doctors to use observation stays for heart failure patients \"to prevent reimbursement penalties for greater-than-expected readmission rates,\" according to the article. While more observation stays means a cheaper bill for the federal government, it can leave the patients themselves on the hook for exorbitant amounts.\n\nBut a spokesman for Banner told the WSJ that medical decisions about when to use observation stays are based on medical factors and billing rules. The drop in readmissions was the result of focused strategic initiatives, he said.\n\nThe trend to place patients in observation is not restricted to Banner Health; October research found that the top third of hospitals for readmission cuts between 2009 and 2014 also saw an increase in returning observation patients, particularly after the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services implemented readmission penalties in 2012, FierceHealthcare previously reported. However, the research also found an increase in observation status for hospitals that are not at risk for financial penalties for readmissions, such as veterans' hospitals. Further analysis by the WSJ found about 10 percent of the nation's short-term acute care hospitals accounted for about half of the increase in observation stays between 2010 and 2013. Three percent of those hospitals were Banner facilities.\n\nObservation stays are hindering hospitals in determining truly effective strategies for improving care quality, Eric Coleman, a geriatrician and University of Colorado professor, told the WSJ. \"The hospitals are responding to the incentive scheme that has been established for them,\" he said.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAs readmissions fall, observation status rises--even at hospitals outside readmissions program\n\nObservation status, ED visits create illusion of fewer readmissions, quality gains\n\nNew Virginia law requires hospitals to inform patients of observation status\n\nSenate hears providers' concerns about observation status crisis\n\nSenate committee hears stories on observation status, two-midnight rule\n\nNo one-size-fits-all strategy for readmission reduction\n\nNon-clinical care coordination process improves discharge process, reduces readmission\n\n'Patient navigators' reduced readmissions, overuse of ER in pilot program\n\nBest practices to reduce costly readmissions", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Arizona hospital system's encouraging progress on preventable readmissions for heart failure may be largely due to its increased use of observation status, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "An Arizona hospital system's encouraging progress on preventable readmissions for heart failure may be largely due to its increased use of observation status, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Evidence grows of link between increased observation stays, lower readmissions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/evidence-grows-link-between-increased-observation-stays-lower-readmissions/2015-12-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "acute-care hospitals,Banner Health,Care Delivery,observation status,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Readmission Penalties,readmission reduction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "If follow-up admissions labeled as observation stays were excluded from the data, all but about one quarter of the reduction would disappear, according to the article.\nWhile more observation stays means a cheaper bill for the federal government, it can leave the patients themselves on the hook for exorbitant amounts.\nReadmissions after inpatient stays fell from 18.5 in 2010 to 15.6 percent in 2013 at Banner hospitals, while rates of observation stays tripled in the same period for patients previously readmitted for the same conditions.\nHowever, the research also found an increase in observation status for hospitals that are not at risk for financial penalties for readmissions, such as veterans' hospitals.\nBut a spokesman for Banner told the WSJ that medical decisions about when to use observation stays are based on medical factors and billing rules."}
