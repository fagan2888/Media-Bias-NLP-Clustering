When Obamacare was signed into law three years ago, Vice President Joe Biden famously proclaimed it a “big f—ing deal.”

But in the state Biden represented in the Senate for more than three decades, just one person has signed up under the law’s health care exchanges since the system went live Oct. 1, the Associated Press reported.

The AP reported that the Delaware Department of Health and Social Service officials have “declared 59-year-old Janice Baker of Selbyville the first confirmed resident to enroll in the marketplace.”

It was reportedly a big deal to Baker, as the Selbyville, Del., resident said she began looking on Oct. 1 and made several frustrated attempts to sign up online and spent hours on the phone. She said she cleared the browsing history, cookies and other temporary data on her computer.

The healthcare.gov website has been riddled with massive technical problems, drawing criticism from nearly all Republicans and even some liberal commentators.

Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas has called for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius’ firing, and even former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs termed the rollout “excruciatingly embarrassing.”
