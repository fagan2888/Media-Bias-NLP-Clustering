ISIS is now threatening to assassinate her. She and her cohorts came close to becoming victims, yet some in the media on the right and the center-right have essentially blamed her for the gunmen\u2019s attack, just as far too many, last January, surreptitiously pardoned the Kouachi brothers and, with consummate perfidy to human decency, inculpated the satirical cartoonists they slaughtered, saying \u201cCharlie Hebdo asked for it.\u201d\n\nNo.\n\nBut first, allow me a brief yet illustrative digression.\n\nNo one can deny the nobility of the sentiment that prompted Ben Affleck, on Bill Maher\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d last autumn, to rush to the defense of what he sees as an unjustly maligned Muslim population with his outburst, as heartfelt as it was misguided, that it was \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d of Maher and Sam Harris to denounce Islam as \u201cthe mother lode of bad ideas.\u201d It seemed par for the course that Affleck followed the lead of so many progressives and conflated race and religion regarding Muslims. The semantically unsound rubbish concept of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d disorients well-meaning people and incites them to spout illogicalities with a preacher\u2019s righteousness.\n\nOne must, though, call out New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof for backing up Affleck on the same show, and, later, in an editorial. Kristof, after all, should know better. He trades in words and ideas, and his acceptance of the fraudulent term \u201cIslamophobia\u201d contributes to the generalized befuddlement on the left about the faith in question and whether negative talk about it constitutes some sort of racism, or proxy for it. It patently does not. Unlike skin color, faith is not inherited and is susceptible to change. As with any other ideology, it should be subject to unfettered discussion, which may include satire, ridicule and even derision. The First Amendment protects both our right to practice the religion of our choosing (or no religion at all) as well as our right to speak freely, even offensively, about it.\n\nOne must, however, recoil in stupefaction and disgust at the consortium of prominent writers who just signaled de facto capitulation to the Enforcers of Shariah. I\u2019m referring, of course, to the recent decision of 204 authors to sign a letter dissociating themselves from PEN\u2019s granting the Toni and James C. Goodale Freedom of Expression Courage Award to the brave, talented surviving artists of Charlie Hebdo. (Disclosure: I have friends among Charlie Hebdo\u2019s staff.) The authors objecting did so out of concern, according to their statement, for \u201cthe section of the French population\u201d \u2013 its Muslims \u2013 \u201cthat is already marginalized, embattled, and victimized, a population that is shaped by the legacy of France\u2019s various colonial enterprises.\u201d A \u201clarge percentage\u201d of these Muslims are \u201cdevout,\u201d contend the writers, and should thus be spared the \u201chumiliation and suffering\u201d Charlie Hebdo\u2019s cartoons allegedly caused them.\n\nEurope\u2019s colonial past and the United States\u2019 current (endless) military campaigns in the Islamic world, as well as prejudice against nonwhites in Europe, have predisposed many to see, with some justification, Muslims as victims. But apart from the blundering wrongheadedness of the PEN writers\u2019 dissent (Charlie Hebdo\u2019s undeniable courage won them the award, not their artwork) and putting aside the question of whether France\u2019s Muslims are necessarily \u201cdevout\u201d (French law prohibits religion-based polling, so who could know?), or uniformly \u201chumiliated\u201d by Charlie Hebdo, or necessarily \u201cembattled,\u201d one thing transpires with arresting clarity from the authors\u2019 declaration: Among the left, the confusion surrounding Islam and how we should relate to it imperils the free speech rights without which no secular republic can survive. We have to clear this up, and fast.\n\nThere is no legitimate controversy over why the Kouachi brothers targeted Charlie Hebdo. They murdered not to redress the social grievances or right the historical wrongs the PEN authors named. They explicitly told us why they murdered \u2014 for Islam, to avenge the Prophet Muhammad. Progressives who think otherwise need to face that reality. Put another way, the Kouachi brothers may have suffered racial discrimination and even \u201cmarginalization,\u201d yet had they not been Muslims, they would not have attacked Charlie Hebdo. They would have had no motive.\n\nWhat is it about Islam that simultaneously both motivates jihadis to kill and so many progressives to exculpate the religion, even when the killers leave no doubt about why they act? The second part of the question is easier to dispense with than the first. Progressives by nature seek common ground and believe people to be mostly rational actors \u2013 hence the desire to blame crime on social ills. Unfamiliarity with Islam\u2019s tenets also plays a role, plus, I believe, the frightening future we would seem to be facing as more and more Muslims immigrate to the West, and the world becomes increasingly integrated. Best just to talk of poverty and the like, or a few \u201cbad apples.\u201d But to respond to the question\u2019s first part, we need to put aside our p.c. reading glasses and examine Islam\u2019s basic elements from a rationalist\u2019s perspective. Islam as a faith would not concern progressives, except that some of its adherents choose to act as parts of its dogma ordain, which, to put it mildly, violates the social contract underpinning the lives of the rest of us.\n\nIslam is a hallowed monotheistic ideology, as are Judaism and Christianity, the other two Abrahamic \u201canti-human religions\u201d (to quote Gore Vidal), that preceded it. From a rationalist\u2019s perspective, any ideology that mandates belief without evidence is a priori dangerous and liable to abuse. This especially applies to monotheism. Objectively, polytheism was better. Look back in time. The many gods of Greek and Roman antiquity, by their very multiplicity, presupposed a spirit of pluralism in their societies and even a certain ludic variety. I worship Zeus, you Aphrodite; he follows Ceres, she Diana. The classical gods quarreled and copulated, stirred the heavens to storm and sent down rain on the crops, tossed earthward thunderbolts, and now and then accepted propitiations from us humans, but otherwise, didn\u2019t do much to bother us.\n\nEnter the God of the Israelites. Jealous and vengeful, capricious and megalomaniacal, He issued His Decalogue. What is Commandment Number One? \u201cYou shall have no other gods before Me\u201d \u2014 an absolutist order implicitly justifying violence against those who haven\u2019t gotten the memo. Even after \u201cgentle Jesus meek and mild\u201d entered the picture, Tyrannus Deus continued His brutal reign, with legions of His Medieval votaries waging crusades against rival monotheists in the Holy Land, hurling themselves into battle as they cried Deus vult! (God wills it!). And, of course, with Jesus came (the highly non-gentle, non-meek, non-mild) idea of eternal torment in hell as divine retribution for sin \u2013 surely no inducement to peace and tranquility, either.\n\nRecognizing no Holy Spirit or mediating, moderating heavenly offspring, the Prophet Muhammad transformed the Judeo-Christian Despot on High into an even more menacing, wrathful ogre, whose gory punishments meted out to hapless souls after death fill many a Koranic verse. Shirk, or associating another being with God, is, of course, a paramount sin in Islam. Iconoclasm, or smashing asunder God\u2019s rival deities as represented in idols, was and remains a favorite pastime of Islamist totalitarians, as was tragically demonstrated by the Taliban\u2019s 2001 demolition of the awe-inspiring Buddhas of Bamiyan, or ISIS\u2019s devastation of ancient statues in Iraq. Such crimes are not perversions of Islam, but actions based on its canon and a fanatical desire to emulate its luminaries. To wit, after conquering Mecca, none other than the Prophet Muhammad (whose life Muslims hold to be exemplary) devastated the 360 idols of the Kaaba; and the Quran (Surat al-Anbiya\u2019, 21:57-58) recounts how the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham to Jews and Christians) broke apart idols. Monotheistic Islam and destruction, thus, go hand in hand, along with the (intolerant, divisive) proclamation that the Quran is the Final Testament, God\u2019s last word to humanity, superseding the previous (equally preposterous) \u201crevelations\u201d of Judaism and Christianity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Confusion over Islam and how to relate to it imperils free speech, without which no secular republic can survive", "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Confusion over Islam and how to relate to it imperils free speech, without which no secular republic can survive", "title": "The left has Islam all wrong: Bill Maher, Pamela Geller and the reality progressives must face", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/the_left_has_islam_all_wrong_bill_maher_pamela_geller_and_the_reality_progressives_must_face/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/maher_geller_kristof.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Confusion over Islam and how to relate to it imperils free speech, without which no secular republic can survive", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/maher_geller_kristof.jpg", "title": "The left has Islam all wrong: Bill Maher, Pamela Geller and the reality progressives must face", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The left has Islam all wrong: Bill Maher, Pamela Geller and the reality progressives must face", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Affleck, Bill Maher, Charlie Hebdo, Editor's Picks, Islam, Muslims, New York Times, Nicholas Kristof, Pamela Geller, PEN, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "There is no legitimate controversy over why the Kouachi brothers targeted Charlie Hebdo.\nThey explicitly told us why they murdered \u2014 for Islam, to avenge the Prophet Muhammad.\nPut another way, the Kouachi brothers may have suffered racial discrimination and even \u201cmarginalization,\u201d yet had they not been Muslims, they would not have attacked Charlie Hebdo.\nSuch crimes are not perversions of Islam, but actions based on its canon and a fanatical desire to emulate its luminaries.\nThe semantically unsound rubbish concept of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d disorients well-meaning people and incites them to spout illogicalities with a preacher\u2019s righteousness."}
