Blue Cross and its related subsidiaries employed 7,921 workers last year.\n\nMore layoffs or reductions from attrition are expected over the next several months as division department heads complete employee needs assessments and expense reduction reviews, Blue Cross officials have confirmed.\n\n\"Continued automation of some IT functions and replacement of declining technologies were factors that ultimately affected these positions,\" Andy Hetzel, vice president of corporate communications, said in an email statement to Crain's. \"Additionally, our efforts to improve our IT processes are resulting in work that is lower value, redundant and unnecessary being eliminated or consolidated within our IT work teams.\"\n\nOff the 22 employees, 19 were located in Detroit, two in South Lyon and one in Southfield, Hetzel said. They are eligible to apply for open positions and were assigned to recruiters in human resources, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, Blue Cross said it lost $68 million in net income on its overall operations in 2015 \u2014 its first loss in at least five years.\n\nBut its health insurance business lines lost much more. For 2015, Blue Cross lost $344.3 million, a 216 percent increase from net income gain of $295 million in 2014, according to a report filed with the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.\n\nDocuments Crain's has obtained show Blue Cross\u2019 plan to reduce rising administrative costs \u2014 costs up to 30 percent higher than national insurers and other competing plans in Michigan, according to one Blue Cross report.\n\nSources tell Crain\u2019s there are multiple factors forcing the Blues to cut costs. They include right-sizing the workforce after a huge expansion to prepare for changes and new customers from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has embarked on a three-year, $300 million administrative cost reduction program that has so far resulted in at least 47 layoffs in the information technology and health care values divisions.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has embarked on a three-year, $300 million administrative cost reduction program that has so far resulted in at least 47 layoffs in the information technology and health care values divisions.", "title": "Blue Cross lays off 22 IT workers as it moves to further reduce costs", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160310/NEWS/160319984/blue-cross-lays-off-22-it-workers-as-it-moves-to-further-reduce-costs", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/Assets/rwd/C-Block_RWD.png?v=201503291736", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "theme-color": "#b51218", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Jobs/Career", "published_time": "2016-03-10T16:15:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-11T07:07:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cf0\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross lays off 22 IT workers as it moves to further reduce costsAnother 22 employees have been laid off \u2014 this time in the enterprise information technology department \u2014 by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Crain\u2019s has learned.\nDocuments Crain's has obtained show Blue Cross\u2019 plan to reduce rising administrative costs \u2014 costs up to 30 percent higher than national insurers and other competing plans in Michigan, according to one Blue Cross report.\nBlue Cross and its related subsidiaries employed 7,921 workers last year.\nMore layoffs or reductions from attrition are expected over the next several months as division department heads complete employee needs assessments and expense reduction reviews, Blue Cross officials have confirmed.\nEarlier this month, Blue Cross said it lost $68 million in net income on its overall operations in 2015 \u2014 its first loss in at least five years."}
