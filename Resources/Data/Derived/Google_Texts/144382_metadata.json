What\u2019s more, Moulton said he is uncomfortable calling attention to his own awards out of respect to \u201cmany others who did heroic things and received no awards at all.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nMoulton, who is facing off against Republican Richard Tisei in the Sixth Congressional District race, has been so close-mouthed about the medals that in his campaign, only his campaign manager \u2013 a former Marine \u2013 knew of the awards before the Globe asked for the citations on Wednesday. Even his parents did not know, and were told just this week, according to Scott Ferson, a campaign spokesman.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nCitations aside, Moulton\u2019s campaign was propelled from the start by his compelling personal story: the Harvard graduate who became a Marine officer after 9/11; who spent two years in Iraq commanding an infantry platoon even though he, and many of his men, opposed that war; and who later earned graduate degrees in business and government from Harvard.\n\n\n\nA Marine veteran of fierce combat in Iraq runs for Congress.
