In other words, \"four of 10 adolescent girls have not even begun HPV vaccination\" in the U.S.\n\nPossible reasons for the low coverage are the cost -- even if it is borne by private or public insurers -- and the difficulty of making three separate office visits.\n\n\"Vaccination of a much higher proportion of preteens is needed,\" she concluded. \"Otherwise, decades from now oncologists will still be talking about HPV-associated cancers with thousands of new patients every year.\"\n\nBecause the quadrivalent vaccine is highly effective at preventing infection and disease associated with strains 6, 11, 16, and 18, a placebo-controlled trial was deemed unethical, Joura and colleagues reported.\n\nBut the same high efficacy meant that a standard head-to-head trial of the two vaccines comparing outcomes related to those four strains would have needed to be unfeasibly large, they noted.\n\nSo in 14,215 women ages 16 to 26, they conducted an noninferiority trial for outcomes related to the first four HPV types, and an efficacy trial looking at disease associated with the other five. The women were randomly assigned on a one-to-one basis, to get either the nine-valent or the quadrivalent vaccine.\n\nThe theory was that the investigational vaccine would be better at preventing disease associated with its extra five HPV types than the current vaccine, while being no worse than that vaccine in preventing disease linked with types 6, 11, 16, and 18.\n\nParticipants were given three shots, on day one and at months two and six, the researchers reported, while tissue swabs and Pap tests were conducted on day one and at months seven, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 54.\n\nAs well as looking for all of the vaccine types, using polymerase chain reaction testing, the researchers also analyzed the samples for types 35, 39, 51, 59, and 59.\n\nThe primary efficacy hypothesis was that among women seronegative for the five new types through the vaccination period and given the nine-valent vaccine, and compared with the women given the quadrivalent vaccine, there would be a reduction in:\n\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia\n\nAdenocarcinoma in situ\n\nInvasive cervical carcinoma\n\nHigh-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia\n\nHigh-grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia\n\nVulvar cancer\n\nVaginal cancer associated with those types\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that, among women seronegative for the shared HPV types through the vaccination period, both vaccines would be associated with similar reductions in disease associated with those strains and would have similar immune responses and seroconversion rates.\n\nThe bottom line, Joura and colleagues reported, was that the rate of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to HPV-31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 was 0.1 per 1,000 person-years in the nine-valent vaccine group and 1.6 per 1,000 person-years in the quadrivalent vaccine group.\n\nAlso, for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, noninferiority of immune responses and seroconversion rates was established a month after the third shot. Rates of disease were similar between the groups.\n\nParticipants getting the nine-valent vaccine had more injection site reactions -- 90.7% versus 84.9% -- with pain, swelling, erythema, and pruritus the most common.\n\nSystemic reactions were similar, reported by 55.8% in the nine-valent group and 54.9% in the quadrivalent group. The most common events were headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue.\n\nThe researchers cautioned that the follow-up was limited in duration, although studies of the quadrivalent vaccine have not seen any sign of waning immunity over time.\n\nThe study had support from Merck.
