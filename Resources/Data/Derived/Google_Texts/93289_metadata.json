Too many people seem to forget that they have a brain of their own, and blindly accept everything they are told. The end result of this mindset is that \u201cThe blind follow the blind, and they all fall into the ditch.\u201d This is especially true concerning the media. There are very few media outlets that actually provide unbiased reporting. Yet almost all of them claim to do so. And while some of these \u201cfair and balanced\u201d news outlets promote conservatism, the vast majority are liberal propaganda factories. I don\u2019t support a double standard. If you claim to be neutral, you should be. But it\u2019s very clear who the most blatant offenders are. If you define the \u201cbig networks\u201d as ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC, 75% of major networks are left-leaning. If you include CBS and MSNBC, 84% are left-leaning. This bias is proved by the personal views of top journalists, what stories they cover, and how they cover those stories.\n\nReporters should keep their personal opinions from influencing the news stories they write and produce. But journalists are only human. A reporter\u2019s political outlook is bound to sway the judgments he or she makes each day, such as what events are newsworthy, and on whom to rely for trustworthy information. It is therefore essential that the media represent a diverse range of viewpoints, and are not dominated by just one political philosophy. However, surveys over the past 50 years have consistently found that journalists \u2014 especially those at the highest ranks of their profession \u2014 are predominantly liberal by a large margin. In 1981, S. Robert Lichter and Stanley Rothman surveyed 240 journalists at top media outlets across the country on their political views and voting patterns. The results of that survey are eye-opening. More than four-fifths of the journalists surveyed voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election between 1964 and 1976. Fifty-four percent considered themselves to be left of center, but only nineteen percent considered themselves to be on the right. When asked to classify their colleagues, 56 percent said the people they worked with were mostly on the left, and only 8 percent on the right. The majority of elite journalists also held strongly liberal political views. For instance, 90 percent agreed that a woman has the right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion. Fifty-four percent did not regard adultery as wrong, compared to only fifteen percent who did. However, Lichter and Rothman\u2019s survey is by no means the only one to show this liberal bias. There are dozens of other comprehensive studies which came to the exact same conclusion.\n\nThe liberal bias of the media can also be seen in what events they choose to cover and what events they choose to ignore. For example, when Jonathan Gruber admitted that Obamacare was passed on a foundation of lies and \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter,\u201d the majority of TV networks either glossed over the story or refused to cover it entirely. When ISIS captured hundreds of Christians in February, the major networks ignored that story as well. CBS\u2019s This Morning gave the story 18 seconds of coverage; NBC\u2019s Today didn\u2019t even mention it. ABC\u2019s Good Morning America devoted only 33 seconds to the story, while spending almost 21 minutes discussing the new season of Dancing with the Stars. These are just two recent examples. But a careful analysis of media coverage will prove this point further.\n\nJournalists also prove media bias by the way they cover stories. Simply put, the media loves to elevate liberals, ridicule conservatives, and mock Christians. Soon after the Newtown school shooting, CNN host Piers Morgan was interviewing Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America when he launched into a tirade. \u201cYou\u2019re an unbelievably stupid man, aren\u2019t you?\u2026You have absolutely no coherent argument whatsoever\u2026. You don\u2019t give a damn, do you, about the gun murder rate in America?\u2026I know why sales of these weapons have been soaring in the last few days. It\u2019s down to idiots like you. Mr. Pratt, You are a dangerous man espousing dangerous nonsense. And you shame your country.\u201d\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. On July 31, 2013, MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews called three GOP Senators \u201cpolitical terrorists.\u201d He continued, \u201cLike all terrorists, including those who use bombs, their number one goal \u2014 their only goal \u2014 is to blow things up. [Senators Ted] Cruz, [Rand] Paul and Mike Lee are on a mission to destroy, shut down the American government, destroy ObamaCare, drive the country into default, destroy the U.S. credit rating. Terrorists with one purpose: To bring down, not just this administration but, let\u2019s face it, the American government.\u201d In contrast, the same Chris Matthews had nothing but good things to say about President Obama. \u201cThis guy\u2019s done everything right. He\u2019s raised his family right. He\u2019s fought his way all the way to the top of the Harvard Law Review, in a blind test becomes head of the Review, the top editor there. Everything he\u2019s done is clean as a whistle. He\u2019s never not only broken any law, he\u2019s never done anything wrong. He\u2019s the perfect father, the perfect husband, the perfect American.\u201d\n\nThe media also routinely targets Christians. In a PBS interview, author Ayaan Hirsi Ali said, \u201cSomehow, the idea got into [Radical Muslims\u2019] minds that to kill other people is a great thing to do and that they would be rewarded in the hereafter.\u201d PBS host Tavis Smiley responded: \u201c\u201cBut Christians do that every single day in this country.\u201d Ali asked him, \u201cDo they blow people up every day?\u201d Smiley\u2019s answer: \u201cYes\u2026\u201d One could literally write a book documenting the hundreds of cases of outrageous liberal bias in the media.\n\nIt is abundantly clear that the media is biased. That is the simple truth. What to do about it, however, is much more complicated. Should we regulate the media to ensure equal numbers of liberals and conservatives are hired? Should we appoint government directors to ensure that coverage is neutral? The answer is a resounding NO! The government has no right to control or regulate the media to ensure fairness. The solution to the media bias problem is the free market. Consumers should speak with their choices. If the general public only relied on unbiased news outlets, the biased ones would go out of business. If you prefer news outlets that promote a point of view that you agree with, that is not a problem. But be honest and admit that those sources are not neutral.\n\nConsumers also need to be more careful to find the truth for themselves, and not just rely on the media. Intellectual laziness leads to intellectual slavery. If you believe everything the media tells you, you can be controlled by the media. Finally, the management of media outlets should be responsible to ensure neutrality. If particular journalists consistently insert their bias into news coverage, they should be fired or reassigned to an opinion desk. To be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t believe that third point will ever happen. Each media outlet is usually owned or run by someone who has opinions, and they want the public to be influenced by those opinions. To be clear, I\u2019m not opposed to people trying to influence the public with their opinions. That\u2019s a First Amendment right. Just don\u2019t call it news.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml", "ca_image": "http://cowgernation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_102143884-150x150.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Cowger Nation", "description": "There are some things in life which must be questioned.
