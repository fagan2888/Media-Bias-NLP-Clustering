Photo: Brendan Esposito\n\nSunday is all about the celebration of Alex McKinnon, and his amazing fight and attitude, but think for a moment of another young footballer whose career was taken away.\n\n\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t want to take anything away from Alex ... I really feel for him,\u2019\u2019 Simon Dwyer said.\n\nYou may not instantly remember the name. So many have forgotten about him, most notably the players\u2019 association. He is one of the reasons why changes need to be made so professional athletes are covered by workers compensation laws.\n\nDwyer was the young Wests Tigers back-rower who flattened Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in one of the great tackles of the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played City-Country and then his career came to a shuddering halt when he went in for a tackle on Bulldogs prop Michael Hodgson.\n\n\u2018\u2018I just remember voices in my head saying, \u2018I can\u2019t move my f---ing legs\u2019, and I couldn\u2019t move them at all at first ... but then I got helped up and started to get movement, but I never got it in my arm,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAs we sat in a cafe, Dwyer looked a long way from the powerful forward with the world at his feet. His right arm sat there in a sling \u2013 it hasn\u2019t moved after that tackle.\n\n\u2018\u2018It can be tough sometimes ... you know, just day-to-day things,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I had lunch with some of the boys yesterday and I ordered a steak ... I had to get Todd Payten to cut it up for me ... that\u2019s not really what a 25-year-old bloke wants to deal with ... but I don\u2019t want to whinge ... it was just a freak thing. I tore the nerves off my spinal cord.\n\n\u2018\u2018They said it was the type of injury you might find with one of those high-speed skiers in the Olympics.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs we talked, the man on his right championing his cause was Brad Fittler. The former Roosters great has taken Dwyer on almost like a younger brother. Fittler was listening to Dwyer talk about his arm and he stopped the conversation in its tracks. \u2018\u2018Mate, have you ever thought about chopping it off?\u2019\u2019 Fittler said.\n\nDwyer didn\u2019t blink: \u2018\u2018No, I\u2019m not going to chop my arm off, mainly because I live in the hope that one day down the track they may come up with some kind of science that can help me out. I live in hope when it comes to that.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also has seen a reason not to. \u2018\u2018My dad Paul had gangrene in his leg and he faced that kind of decision and decided to fight on and now he is making real progress ... so you never know. I just need to stay positive to the best of my ability.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe is doing that. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not speaking so people feel sorry for me. I\u2019m over feeling sorry for myself. I\u2019m not speaking out because of the attention that Alex is getting. I think that it\u2019s great and Alex is in a far more challenging situation than I am in.\n\n\u2018\u2018What I want is for all players who have had injuries that affect them for the rest of their lives to be looked after. When the Alex thing happened ... I thought that I\u2019d like to speak to him.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs well as the game has responded to the McKinnon situation, it dropped the ball when it came to Dwyer. His plight was brought to the attention of the players\u2019 association through the media, and the driving force was Fittler.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was pretty awful that he was ignored for three years,\u2019\u2019 Fittler said.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was pretty bad that the last collective bargaining agreement was negotiated without anyone taking into account the insurance for players. It doesn\u2019t make sense that the bloke selling the hot dogs outside of the ground has better insurance than the players who are playing the game. It\u2019s mind-boggling.\n\n\u2018\u2018What is even harder to cop is that Simon continues to be ignored by the players\u2019 association ... they know about his situation and they hardly make an effort to help him out. He\u2019s been given lip service at best.\n\n\u2018\u2018I find it hard to believe the level of neglect. It simply is not good enough. If it wasn\u2019t for blokes like Alex McKinnon and Simon Dwyer ... I\u2019d lose faith, but to see their attitude in adversity is what makes this game.\u2019\u2019\n\nFittler \u2013 who has been working hard on a fundraising night for Dwyer at Wests Leagues Club on August 1 \u2013 doesn\u2019t want credit. Instead, he said that should go to leading player agent Wayne Beavis.\n\n\u2018\u2018When I look at what is good about the game, it\u2019s the actions of Wayne,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He is not Simon\u2019s manager, but he has been working hard for no financial gain to make sure that the night happens and that we raise money for Simon.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe aim is to raise $100,000. When you consider that the injury has cost him a career which could have netted him some $4 million, it is a huge financial hit for a kid who grew up in modest surrounds in Macquarie Fields. Dwyer may need the money.\n\nHe has been earning a modest salary, believed to be $60,000, working at the Tigers. It was a job that was negotiated when his new three-year deal was made redundant because of his injury. Instead of being left with 25 per cent of his contract, which was the standard settlement, the Tigers gave him a gig for the length of the contract.\n\n\u2018\u2018That deal is up in a few months and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do just yet,\u2019\u2019 Dwyer said. \u2018\u2018The club said it may depend on who is coaching the team. I suppose I have to start to look around. I\u2019m not sure who would employ me, so I may need to try and start my own business. It\u2019s a bit uncertain.\u2019\u2019\n\nMcLean lies low\n\nOne area has been off limits in interviews with Alex McKinnon and those associated with him \u2013 Jordan McLean. The media around McKinnon has been brilliant \u2013 but controlled \u2013 and there is a reason for it.\n\nMelbourne are staying in close touch with McLean this weekend through their three-member counselling team. He also has his teammates to lean on as he copes with the groundswell of support for McKinnon.\n\nIt has been relayed to this column that McLean is a huge supporter of the fundraising activities. The NRL has pulled so many right reins in this but this column is hoping enough is being done for McLean.\n\nThere is still an undercurrent of anger about this tackle, mainly from those close to McKinnon and his teammates. And there is disdain for the tackling technique the Storm have employed for years.\n\nThe NRL made a big error by putting Cameron Smith up to promote the week on the day before Origin.\n\nHis media conference was awkward as he was asked whether he had been in touch with Alex, given he is Australian captain. He had to say no.\n\nSmith was criticised by this column for being over the top in arguing with the referee when McKinnon was lying injured on the ground.\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond then and didn\u2019t want to deal with the matter when reporters were asking about the incident on the field, saying he\u2019d dealt with it.\n\nWarner\u2019s advice\n\nDave Warner says fatherhood will give him an even greater reason to succeed for the rest of his career and he is more determined then ever to be a role model once his fiancee, Candice Falzon, gives birth in September.\n\n\u2018\u2018What I really want for my child is to know that there is more to life than sport,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I put all my eggs in the sports basket and it worked out for me, but I wish that I had gone down the education route more. And that\u2019s what I want for our kid.\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve managed to get by. I want to help kids get to places that they want to get to. I hope I can do that by pushing the importance of being rounded and educated.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think it\u2019s important to get outside of the bubble of sport. I\u2019m not the sharpest tool ... I grew up housing commission ... everyone talks about it being rough.\n\n\u2018\u2018I sort of escaped in sport. That\u2019s what I found interesting, but I would not encourage that. I want to see my kids hit the books and I want them to excel in that way. I\u2019ve got around not being well educated, but I am learning on the run.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs far as being a dad, \u2018\u2018My commitment will become a lot more ... I\u2019ll be even more determined and it will give me even greater reason to succeed.\u2019\u2019\n\nBeing a dad won\u2019t make him change his approach to cricket. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve got this far playing the way I do and I won\u2019t change that,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t be someone else out on the field and I won\u2019t be.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe couple have done a magazine deal to tell the story about their baby. Plans have begun for a wedding. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve set a date ... and it\u2019s after the World Cup final,\u2019\u2019 Warner said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d be shot if I did it before that time.\u2019\u2019\n\nWolfman worry\n\nDavid Williams\u2019s welfare has been of concern to his teammates since he was banned for betting on Manly games.\n\n\u2018\u2018If you know Wolfie, his highs are high and the downside of that is that his lows are really low,\u2019\u2019 Anthony Watmough said.\n\n\u2018\u2018As a group we were concerned because he was the face of it all ... which is not really fair.\n\n\u2018\u2018Why is he splashed all over the place and forced to wear it all when the officials who were betting were not named? I find that difficult to comprehend and to me, it\u2019s what is good for the players should be good for the officials of the game. The good thing is Wolfie is back at training and he seems a lot better.\u2019\u2019\n\nTesty Tigers\n\nWests Tigers players are fed up being painted as the instigators in the demise of coaches at the club. There is a growing feeling they are being used as scapegoats for management decisions.\n\nThere is no doubt some players had misgivings about the appointment of Mick Potter, however the feeling among the group is they are being used to divert attention from management.\n\nAs for Potter being responsible for retaining several star players, this column has been told Potter is minimally involved in negotiating to keep stars at the club.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sport", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Sunday is all about the celebration of Alex McKinnon, and his amazing fight and attitude, but think for a moment of another young footballer whose career was taken away.", "title": "Wests Tigers back-rower Simon Dwyer is the NRL's forgotten man", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/wests-tigers-backrower-simon-dwyer-is-the-nrls-forgotten-man-20140719-zuwtt.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/c/8/h/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zuwtt.png/1405822578820.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/c/8/h/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zuwtt.png/1405822578820.jpg"}, "title": "Wests Tigers back-rower Simon Dwyer is the NRL's forgotten man", "description": "Sunday is all about the celebration of Alex McKinnon, and his amazing fight and attitude, but think for a moment of another young footballer whose career was taken away.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Sunday is all about the celebration of Alex McKinnon, and his amazing fight and attitude, but think for a moment of another young footballer whose career was ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d3f\"", "article_summary": "Dwyer was the young Wests Tigers back-rower who flattened Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in one of the great tackles of the past decade.\nIgnored: Former Wests Tigers back-rower Simon Dwyer.\nIt\u2019s a bit uncertain.\u2019\u2019McLean lies lowOne area has been off limits in interviews with Alex McKinnon and those associated with him \u2013 Jordan McLean.\nPhoto: Brendan EspositoSunday is all about the celebration of Alex McKinnon, and his amazing fight and attitude, but think for a moment of another young footballer whose career was taken away.\n\u2018\u2018That deal is up in a few months and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do just yet,\u2019\u2019 Dwyer said."}
