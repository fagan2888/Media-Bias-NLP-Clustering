(AP) - Sag is swag if you ask some young people.\n\nFor Trevor Smith, saggin\u2019 pants are merely a fashion statement.\n\nOthers, however, worry that it perpetuates racial stereotypes, may have roots as a gay male signal and could lead to health complications based on the way it can force wearers to walk.\n\nBut Smith, 18, a student at Gateway Community College, said, \u201cIt\u2019s just fashion for us. Everyone has a different look at it and some people don\u2019t know how to go with the changing times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know the meaning of the pants saggin\u2019 years ago; it\u2019s changing now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on what it meant back in the day or the negative, we wear it as part of our swag or expression.\u201d\n\nOpinions vary on the origin of the sagging pants movement.\n\nSome contend that it sprang up because belts were not allowed in prison - to prevent self-harm, while some believe blacks who were enslaved were denied belts for fear they would aid in escape.\n\n\u201cThe saggin\u2019 started in the prison where inmates couldn\u2019t wear belts, but in jail culture things started to transcend,\u201d said community activist Leonard Jahad, the state\u2019s top New Haven probation supervisor,\n\n\u201cThe left pant leg rolled up meant you\u2019re in a certain gang and both pant legs rolled up meant something else,\u201d Jahad said. \u201cWhen pants are down like the kids wear on the streets, in prison, it means you are available to the next man for sexual activity.\u201d\n\nSmith, who\u2019s also entertainment director of the youth development organization Ice the Beef, said he and his peers don\u2019t view the sagging pants as a sexual signal, or anything more than a style choice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saggin\u2019 our pants to be disrespectful. Nobody says anything when people wear short jean skirts; no one cares,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different when our mothers and grandmothers wear the big hats to church. It\u2019s fashion for them and the sag is our fashion.\u201d\n\nSmith acknowledged that some of his peers who wear sagging pants go to the extreme.\n\n\u201cSome of us do take it to the max, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s to the ankles,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of black culture now, but whites and Puerto Ricans wear the sag, too,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral white male youth who wear their pants sagging were interviewed for the story. All declined be identified.\n\nHowever, they agreed it\u2019s purely a fashion expression and a way to be connected to their black peers.\n\nJason Jacobs, 15, who has been wearing the sagging style since he was 9, said he wore it for the wrong reasons.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started doing it, I did it so I could stuff things into my pants, now it\u2019s a trend everyone does,\u201d Jason said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it all the time like I use to; it was a big with me at one point,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stop the sag, because I want to be different now.\u201d\n\nJason said black youth started the trend and believes \u201cwhite boys have picked up on it to be like us.\u201d\n\nCity resident Ronald Huggins, 22, who does not agree with the sagging fashion, said he believes the black community is the hub for style and fashion for other ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the brainchild for a lot of things and if we only realized the influence and the amount of power we have to produce positive things, we\u2019d be setting records all over the world,\u201d said Huggins, a Southern Connecticut State University graduate who aspires to be mayor of New Haven.\n\n\u201cIf we can just get ourselves together, we can affect the nation and generations to come,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fashion has created a way of life for some who identify with the hip-hop community.\n\nNew Haven hip-hop and graffiti artist Dooley-O Jackson said hip-hop introduced the style to mainstream society because youth had no other options to express themselves.\n\n\u201c(Some) adults wear suits and kids wore tight shorts, so hip-hop broke the standard rules of dressing,\u201d said Jackson, 44, who started rapping in the late 1980s.\n\nDifferentiating rap music from hip-hop culture, Jackson said, \u201cRap never had its own fashion, its always been hip-hop.\n\n\u201cPants hanging off your bottom is something that came from jail,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen hip hop at its worst had no new swag, except jailhouse rock clothing, the youth adopted it.\u201d\n\nAccording to hiphop-network.com, in the early 1970s the musical genre was born in the crime-ridden neighborhoods of the South Bronx.\n\nFashion statement or not, some towns across the country have decided sag is not swag. In New Jersey, two towns have passed ordinances banning sagging pants, and other towns have considered or adopted similar measures.\n\nPenns Grove and Wildwood are issuing fines of $25 on first offense.\n\nOn further offenses, fines could climb to $1,000, as well as potential community service hours.\n\nBut state Sen. Gary Holder-Winfield, D-New Haven, said creating a law on the issue is a waste of time.\n\n\u201cNo one in the House or Senate has raised the issue. Different cities in the state talked about it last year, but nothing came from it,\u201d said Holder-Winfield.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s a sloppy fashion and adds to the negative perception of black youth; it needs to be done away with.\u201d he said.\n\nJahad said from a law enforcement perspective, he sees it as similar to the broken window theory - which posits that addressing issues such as vandalism in neighborhoods helps address larger issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a quality-of-life crime, it\u2019s seen as if your pants are down, you\u2019re not motivated, you don\u2019t have a job and don\u2019t care about yourself,\u201d Jahad said.\n\n\u201cThis is a community accountability issue, but when we can\u2019t police ourselves, law enforcement steps in,\u201d he said.\n\nJahad believes race does play a factor when it comes to law enforcement stereotypes.\n\n\u201cSkateboarders and hipsters wear their pants saggy, but they\u2019re not seen as anti-establishment,\u201d he said. \u201cFor our kids, law enforcement is looking at it like it\u2019s criminal.\u201d\n\nZebra Hip Hop Sportswear owner Yaser Elhilo said the trend is changing.\n\n\u201cYoung people from the age of 15-29 are now looking for fit and slim jeans,\u201d said Elhilo, whose store is located at 344 Whalley Ave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the over-30 group that are looking for the loose saggy jeans for a more comfortable feel,\u201d said Elhilo, whose customers are mainly Latino and black.\n\nIn terms of fit, some in the health field say structural and biomechanical modifications that bring the sag can cause nerve damage and alter the wearer\u2019s gait.\n\n\u201cIts altering balance and altering the way you load your weight; it\u2019s never straight-legged,\u201d said Eileen M. Denny, of Denny Chiropractic and Acupuncture in Hamden.\n\n\u201cWhen pants sag, you\u2019re rotating the legs inward at the knees and turning feet outward to keep balance, which create poor posture,\u201d said Denny, whose office is located at 2842 Old Dixwell Ave.\n\nDenny said long-term effects can include knee alignment and foot issues.\n\n\u201cAnytime you improperly load your spine or lower back, you run a greater risk of arthritis,\u201d said Denny. \u201cWhen weight is put on the front of the thigh, pain will go down the thigh causing pressure on the nerves.\u201d\n\nAmong other factors that surround the culture of sagging pants is what the word saggin\u2019 spells in reverse.\n\nSmith said he is aware of the word in reverse, but it is no longer a negative in his vocabulary. If used in acronym form, the word now means \u201cNow I\u2019m Getting Goals Accomplished\u2026,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cPeople fought for the word to be removed and it\u2019s not going anywhere, so why not take it from a negative into a positive,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the word has pejorative connotation, Smith said in 2014 it\u2019s not often used as an insult.\n\n\u201cNobody uses it to insult people anymore, and the people that do are ignorant,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther, Quinnipiac Associate Professor of Journalism Richard Hanley said political operatives use certain other words instead of directly pejorative words.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if (saggin\u2019 in reverse is) an accident of vocabulary or something that holds meaning, but I don\u2019t think young black men understand the word in reverse,\u201d Hanley said.\n\nHanley said when politicians use words in a pejorative sense, they know what they\u2019re alluding to.\n\nSome racial code words include welfare, food stamps, inner-city and crime.\n\n\u201cThey signal something, maybe not a direct racist attitude, but they summon racist feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe polls show that; that\u2019s why it\u2019s used as a political instrument, especially when it was unacceptable to use the n-word.\u201d\n\nSmith said adults may not like the fashion but \u201cI\u2019m sure they had their style and fashion when they were young, too.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: New Haven Register, http://www.nhregister.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sag is swag if you ask some young people.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sag is swag if you ask some young people.", "title": "For some, sagging pants carry greater meaning", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/13/for-some-sagging-pants-carry-greater-meaning/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/13/fedf359ee8b17f1a590f6a70670050e0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/13/fedf359ee8b17f1a590f6a70670050e0.jpg", "description": "Sag is swag if you ask some young people.", "card": "summary", "title": "For some, sagging pants carry greater meaning"}, "Author": "SHAHID ABDUL-KARIM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "In New Jersey, two towns have passed ordinances banning sagging pants, and other towns have considered or adopted similar measures.\nIt\u2019s fashion for them and the sag is our fashion.\u201dSmith acknowledged that some of his peers who wear sagging pants go to the extreme.\nSeveral white male youth who wear their pants sagging were interviewed for the story.\nFor Trevor Smith, saggin\u2019 pants are merely a fashion statement.\nEveryone has a different look at it and some people don\u2019t know how to go with the changing times.\u201d\u201cWe know the meaning of the pants saggin\u2019 years ago; it\u2019s changing now,\u201d he said."}
