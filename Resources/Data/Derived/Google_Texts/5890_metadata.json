Anyone who has selected an 800 number for his or her business knows that it\u2019s important to choose one that\u2019s easy to remember.\n\nHowever, that should be done without insulting your customers. The number seemed innocent enough, though not necessarily easy to remember. It\u2019s 1-800-318-2596, and Lachlan Markay of the Washington Free Beacon decided to see if he could come up with an easier way to remember it.\n\nWhat Markay got was a surprise: the Obamacare line actually spells out 1-800-F1U-CKYO. Markay tweeted this because he found it amusing, but of course it soon went viral. You have to understand that no letters are connected to the number \u201c1\u201d on American telephones.\n\nFor many, this was a funny coincidence, but for critics of Obamacare, it seemed more like a hidden (and deliberate) message. The furor still hasn\u2019t died down.\n\nHashtag this\n\nAlmost immediately, the hashtag #ObamacarePhoneNumbers went wild on Twitter. People were quick to offer up their own, less offensive alternative for the number.\n\nSuggestions included 1-800-404-FAIL, 1-800-SOY-LENT, and 1-800-HOT-MESS, to name just a few. It was actually the US Department of Health and Human Services which had set up the number, and thus far, it hasn\u2019t commented on what happened.\n\nThe Washington Times covered the story with the headline \u201cDialing for depravity?\u201d Of course, the photo of President Obama scratching his head using his middle finger seemed the perfect illustration for these shenanigans.\n\nIt\u2019s been compared to a Freudian slip, but more likely the department just accepted whatever 1-800 number it was randomly assigned. Here\u2019s a lesson in patience and care: You never know what will happen if you let one thing slip through the cracks.\n\nNit picky\n\nObamacare supporters point out that the all important \u201cU\u201d is missing at the end of the phone number, and add that this isn\u2019t an effective way to remember the number. However, the damage has already been done.\n\nEven if you want to dig into the nitty-gritty of the situation, however, it\u2019s clear that the number can spell out something very close to a curse. Overall, the kerfuffle over the toll-free number has garnered nearly as much attention as the actual rollout of Obamacare. It\u2019s also an important reminder about just how crucial all aspects of business can be, even for the government.\n\nThese toll-free numbers have been around as long as most people can remember, and they\u2019re not going anywhere. People want to be able to pick up a phone, talk to a human, and ask questions, especially when it concerns something as important as their health.\n\nWith Obamacare, there was a great opportunity to help with branding and get people started on the right note when they were reaching out to health care and insurance experts. Instead, one thoughtless decision to take a random 800 number led to Twitter bedlam and lots of jokes.\n\nLesson learned\n\nThe next time the government or any other organization gets a new phone number, it\u2019s worth the time to tap into your creativity and send the right message. This is particularly true of such a prominent agency, but any business can benefit.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t going to remember a string of numbers, but they\u2019ll remember a catchy message \u2014 for better or for worse. As the FU blunder is starting to die down, Americans are still left with a big decision: At the end of the year, what are they going to do about their health insurance coverage?\n\nIt\u2019s time to start comparison shopping and figuring out their next move. At least Americans will be able to remember who to call to get their questions answered, even if they do have to face a slight insult to get there.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether you love Obamacare or would rather leave it, an unfortunate circumstance accompanied the launch of the online registration.
