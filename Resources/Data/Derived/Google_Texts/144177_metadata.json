Diclegis is the first and only treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy approved by the FDA in more than 30 years, and the only treatment granted a Pregnancy Category A rating by the FDA, the highest level of pregnancy product safety.\n\nNot only are some insurers (such as Aetna) restricting access to this FDA-approved treatment, they're requiring health care providers to first prescribe off-label medications, or a combination of over-the-counter treatments neither developed nor approved for use during pregnancy. It's only after a pregnant woman has failed to control her morning sickness through trial and error with these untested-in-pregnancy propositions before being allowed access to the only medication tested and FDA-approved as safe and effective for pregnant women who suffer from this condition.\n\nImportantly, for women who have morning sickness, it's critical to get treatment early to reduce complications \u2014 and that means getting the best treatment as soon as possible, not \u201cfailing\u201d up the therapeutic ladder.\n\nAetna\u2019s decision to deny cutting-edge care for America\u2019s moms also illustrates the danger to the development of important new treatments for a host of other diseases. According to Tufts University it costs about $1 billion to bring a new medicine to market. That's $1 billion per drug \u2014 and those are the ones that make it through the clinical and regulatory processes. The innovation ecosystem is a fragile wetland and investment dollars are harder to come by than ever before. Why would a pharmaceutical company invest in high risk research and development if there is likely to be no insurance company willing to pay for the therapeutic benefits it can deliver?\n\nPregnancy is a difficult journey \u2013 but its travails are worth the result. That\u2019s also true for health care innovation. Today, it takes about 10,000 new molecules to produce one FDA-approved medicine. And only three in 10 new medicines earn back their research and development costs. And here's the kicker: Unlike other R&D-intensive industries, biopharmaceutical investments generally must be sustained for more than two decades before the few that make it can generate a profit. But ask any patient whose life has been saved or prolonged through the miracles of modern medicine whether or not the investment has been worthwhile.\n\nProtecting \u201csustainable innovation\u201d is crucial for both the public health and to maintain America\u2019s lead as the global hub for biotechnology.\n\nHarvard University health economist (and Obama health care adviser) David Cutler has noted that: \"Virtually every study of medical innovation suggests that changes in the nature of medical care over time are clearly worth the cost.\" To borrow an overused adjective from the world of global climate change -- we must protect \"sustainable\" innovation.\n\nAmerica's mothers-to-be are on the front lines. A \u201cpregnant pause\u201d in appropriate access is not acceptable.\n\nPeter J. Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner, is president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest\u00e2\u20ac\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u00a9Thinking of submitting an op-ed to the Washington Examiner?
