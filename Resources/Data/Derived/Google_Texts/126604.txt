Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on Monday continued to draw attention to Donald Trump’s past liberal stances on a variety of issues.

“I think it’s a valid question to ask whether or not we can believe the sincerity of Mr. Trump,” Paul said during a conference call with reporters on Monday evening about Trump’s stances.

Paul said there’s “concern over whether or not Donald Trump is a fake conservative, or whether he’s conservative at all.”

The New York businessman, Paul said, has been “for the bank bailouts, been for Democrats running government, think [Democrats] run the economy better, been for gun control before he was against gun control, been for a single payer system before he was against a single payer system, for Obamacare before he was against Obamacare.”

Paul compared Trump to the big government Republicans the tea party movement targeted in 2010.

“I started out…as being part of the tea party movement and one of our concerns really was about fake conservatives,” he said. “Our concern was that many Republicans said that they were for smaller government, yet government was getting bigger under Republicans.”

Paul and Trump have been feuding since last week’s debate. Facing falling polling numbers and trying to inject some fresh enthusiasm into his campaign, Paul went on the offense against Trump.

“I’d say that he’s already hedging his bets because he’s used to buying politicians,” Paul said at the beginning of the debate, injecting himself into the conversation when Trump wouldn’t commit to supporting the Republican nominee in the general election.

Trump, in the debate, defended his past contributions to Democrats as a smart business move.

“Before two months ago, I was a businessman,” Trump said. “I give to everybody. When they call, I give.”
