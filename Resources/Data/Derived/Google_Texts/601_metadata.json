Keep the focus on your own campaign,\" the memo advised.But GOP strategists contend Trump's stances on national security, entitlement reform and healthcare, as well as trade and immigration, are not a comfortable fit for the GOP candidates who may wind up sharing the ticket with the brash billionaire this November.\"This is a year when Republican congressional candidates are not going to want Trump to be their spokesperson,\" Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, tells The Hill. \"He is too polarizing and his negatives are too high.\"Adds White Ayres, a GOP pollster who advised Florida Sen. Marco Rubio:\"Donald Trump's policy positions are not just inconsistent with a lot of Republican platforms in the past but diametrically opposed to a lot of Republican platforms in the past. It remains an open question whether other Republicans who have run on some version of those policy proposals are willing to throw them over because their nominee does.\"Another strategist, Vin Weber, an adviser on the campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, says it remains to be seen \"to what extent are we going to follow tradition and simply turn the entire convention and the party over to the nominee\" if Trump becomes the standard-bearer.\"That's something that we've always done in the past,\" he said. \"I think that's a much more open question this time\u2026\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, GOP, Capitol Hill, 2016", "pubdate": "2016-05-04T11:53:33", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The unorthodox campaign of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is reportedly putting pressure on the top two Republican lawmakers - and vulnerable congressional candidates - to protect their Capitol Hill majority.", "title": "Ryan, McConnell at Odds on How to Guide Party Through Turbulent 2016", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Mitch-McConnell-Paul-Ryan-GOP-Capitol-Hill/2016/05/04/id/727181/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=9ee74c5b-1d3f-45f9-8fb3-70882a904616&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Mitch-McConnell-Paul-Ryan-GOP-Capitol-Hill/2016/05/04/id/727181/", "description": "The unorthodox campaign of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is reportedly putting pressure on the top two Republican lawmakers - and vulnerable congressional candidates - to protect their Capitol Hill majority.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Ryan, McConnell at Odds on How to Guide Party Through Turbulent 2016"}, "epoch": 1462362813, "keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, GOP, Capitol Hill, 2016", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-05-04T11:53:33"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Mitch-McConnell-Paul-Ryan-GOP-Capitol-Hill/2016/05/04/id/727181/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The unorthodox campaign of presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is reportedly putting pressure on the top two Republican lawmakers - and vulnerable congressional candidates - to protect their Capitol Hill majority."}, "article_summary": "\"\"Don't get drawn into every Trump statement and every Trump dust-up.\n\"This is a year when Republican congressional candidates are not going to want Trump to be their spokesperson,\" Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, tells The Hill.\nIt remains an open question whether other Republicans who have run on some version of those policy proposals are willing to throw them over because their nominee does.\n\"That's something that we've always done in the past,\" he said.\n\"I think that's a much more open question this time\u2026\""}
