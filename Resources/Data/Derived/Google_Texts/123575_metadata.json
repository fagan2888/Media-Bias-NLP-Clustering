KCRA 3'S MIKE LUERY JOINS US TONIGHT WITH A LOOK AT TWO CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER, BOTH ARE WELL KNOWN TO SACRAMENTO AREA VOTERS. BOTH CANDIDATES ARE VETERANS. THE DEMOCRAT WAS ELECTED TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S POST FOUR YEARS AGO. REPUBLICAN TED GAINES IS A CURRENT SENATOR. HE ALSO RUNS HIS OWN INSURANCE BUSINESS. CONSUMER PROTECTION IS JOB ONE. DAVE JONES IS RUNNING FOR REELECTION. THE SACRAMENTO DEMOCRAT AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE STATE SENATE SAYS HE WILL CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR STAY CONSUMERS. $1.6 BILLION IN RATES THAT WERE OTHERWISE PAID BY USING A REGULATION AUTHORITY. HIS REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, TED GAINES, SAYS HE HAS MUCH MORE EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD OF INSURANCE. I CONSIDER MYSELF THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER ADVOCATE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE AS MUCH CHOICES POSSIBLE. THE TWO CANDIDATES REALLY COLLIDE OVER THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. TED GAINES IS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT. I THINK WE ARE SOFT. THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SEEN THEIR RATES GO UP DRAMATICALLY. INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD THE CARE THAT THEY WANTED, THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR DEDUCTIBLES CO-PAYS DOUBLE. WE OUGHT TO BE FIGURING OUT HOW WE REFORM HEALTH CARE. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE THIS INTRUSION OF GOVERNMENT. IT IS A BILLION DOLLAR BUREAUCRACY THAT IS LOSING MONEY. JONES ADMITS THAT OBAMACARE HAS BEEN FAR FROM FLAWLESS. WE HAVE HAD RATES GO UP 185% ON AVERAGE. THE RATES CONTINUE TO CLIMB, EVEN WITH THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT. GREAT PRESIDENT OBAMA PLEDGE THAT PATIENT COULD EITHER DOCTORS. NOW WE KNOW THERE ARE CASES WHERE PEOPLE CANNOT KEEP THEIR DOCTOR. I'D YOU RECONCILE THAT? THAT NETWORKS HAVE FEWER DOCTORS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I RECOGNIZE AS AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER, I WILL HOLD THE HEALTH STRESSES ACCOUNTABLE, NURSES, DOCTORS, SPECIALISTS, TO SERVE PEOPLE. HE CONTENDS THAT CONSUMERS CAN HAVE LOWER PROSTRATE VOTING FOR PROP 45 ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. HE WOULD GET THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THAT POWER TO REGULATE HEALTH CARE RATES. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HE CANNOT UNITE NOW. THE AUTHORITY TO REJECT EXCESSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE RATES. IT REQUIRES HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HMOS TO PUBLISH THE RATES. HE IS OPPOSED TO PROPERTY FIVE. I'M AGAINST IT. TOO MUCH POWER IN ONE POLITICIAN , THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. 35 OTHER STATES ARE NOT DONE THIS. -- HAVE DONE THIS. JONES VOICE TO HIS TRACK RECORD IS -- AS COMMISSIONER. WE HAVE ARRESTED OVER A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED INSURANCE FRAUD. $300 MILLION TO CONSUMERS IN DISPUTE WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE HAVE 170,000 CALLS A YEAR FROM CONSUMERS THAT HAVE DISPUTE. HE WANTS MORE COMPANIES OFFER HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HAVE MADE IT TOUGH FOR MANY PEOPLE FINDING COVERAGE. ALLSTATE IS A -- AS HAD A MORATORIUM. STATE FARM HAS HAD 270 DICK GROAT'S -- THE GOATS. -- ZIP CODES. I WOULD INVITE MORE COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE. HE WANTS MORE CONSUMER CHOICE. JONES WAS MORE CONSUMER PROTECTION. JONES HAS A HUGE FUNDRAISING EVENT. RECORDS SHOW THAT JONES HAS A WAR CHEST OF $2.3 MILLION. THE GAINS HAS $14,000 CASH ON HAND. THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST RECORDS. AS WE HAVE BEEN INUNDATED. WHY HAVE WE NOT SEEN A LOT OF ADS. ALL THE BIG MONEY IS A PROPERTY FIVE. THAT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE OR LOWER HEALTH CARE RATES. THAT IS WITH OF THE MONEY HAS COME IN. SO FAR THEY HAVE RAISED 2.2 MILLION.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 18:57:23 PDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Mike Luery", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "The two candidates for California insurance commissioner disagree on how to handle health care and the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Insurance commissioner candidates collide over health care", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/politics/commitment-2014-insurance-commissioner/29178430", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/29178432/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/eohjt6z/-/img-Commitment-2014-Insurance-Commissioner.jpg", "type": "video"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/politics/commitment-2014-insurance-commissioner/29178430", "player": {"width": 640, "height": 390}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/video/29178430", "iphone": "kcra://content/video/29178430", "googleplay": "kcra://content/video/29178430"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/video/29178430", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/video/29178430", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "KCRA,California,election,Commitment 2014,Insurance Commissioner,Dave Jones,Ted Gaines,Mike Luery,November, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com, kcra videos, kcra politics", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "KCRA,California,election,Commitment 2014,Insurance Commissioner,Dave Jones,Ted Gaines,Mike Luery,November, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com, kcra videos, kcra politics", "description": "The two candidates for California insurance commissioner disagree on how to handle health care and the Affordable Care Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9272\"", "article_summary": "HE WOULD GET THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THAT POWER TO REGULATE HEALTH CARE RATES.\nTHE TWO CANDIDATES REALLY COLLIDE OVER THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE.\nKCRA 3'S MIKE LUERY JOINS US TONIGHT WITH A LOOK AT TWO CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER, BOTH ARE WELL KNOWN TO SACRAMENTO AREA VOTERS.\nTHAT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE OR LOWER HEALTH CARE RATES.\nTHE AUTHORITY TO REJECT EXCESSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE RATES."}
