An exact location for the slide set-up was never announced and the company reiterated the tentative nature of the scheduling on its social media accounts. Fargo Police Lt. Joel Vettel said in January that city officials usually prefer several months of lead time for large events and that Slide the City would need to obtain permits before setting up.\n\nIn Racine, Wis., the company was aiming to deploy a slide, but has since been at a \u201cstandstill\u201d in negotiations with the city and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, according to a report in the Racine County Eye.\n\nThe company was also denied operation in Madison earlier this year. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that emergency vehicles wouldn\u2019t be given enough room on both sides of the street after the slide was set up. The city requires 20-foot-wide access lanes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Slide the City,fargo,Summer,events", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rick Abbott", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Those hoping for a slick July cool-off will have to settle for their front yard Slip\u2019N Slide.\r\n\r\nScott Ward, event director for the Slide the City company, said in an email message Monday that folks won't be slipping around the streets of Fargo, this summer anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately we a...", "title": "Slide denied: Without an adequate hill, company cancels Fargo...", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3771688-slide-denied-without-adequate-hill-company-cancels-fargo-summer-event", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/color-me-rad-details-2.jpg?itok=zZA8RcbU", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FARGO \u2013 Those hoping for a slick July cool-off will have to settle for their front yard Slip\u2019N Slide.\r\n\r\nScott Ward, event director for the Slide the City company, said in an email message Monday that folks won't be slipping around the streets of Fargo, this summer anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately we a...", "creator": "rickabbo", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3771688-slide-denied-without-adequate-hill-company-cancels-fargo-summer-event", "image": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/color-me-rad-details-2.jpg?itok=XPfg0dZa", "title": "Slide denied: Without an adequate hill, company cancels Fargo...", "site": "inforum", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1451861908361756}, "keywords": "News,Slide the City,fargo,Summer,events", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inforumFM", "tag": "News,Slide the City,fargo,Summer,events", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T16:37:26-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Photo from Slide the City"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Those hoping for a slick July cool-off will have to settle for their front yard Slip\u2019N Slide.\r\n\r\nScott Ward, event director for the Slide the City..."}, "article_summary": "\"Unfortunately we are unable to come to Fargo this year because we can't find an adequate hill for our slide,\" Ward said.\nScott Ward, event director for the Slide the City company, said in an email message Monday that folks won't be slipping around the streets of Fargo, this summer anyway.\nFARGO \u2013 Those hoping for a slick July cool-off will have to settle for their front yard Slip\u2019N Slide.\nThe event, featuring a 1,000-foot-long slide, was set for Saturday, July 18.\nAn exact location for the slide set-up was never announced and the company reiterated the tentative nature of the scheduling on its social media accounts."}
