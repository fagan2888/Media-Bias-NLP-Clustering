The unicorn of Washington, D.C. So many Ponce de Leons seek this Fountain of Youth. Like de Leon, most finally give up \u2014 and just retire in Florida.\n\nCongressional gerrymandering has rendered so many districts so very partisan. And then we wonder why a 72 percent Republican-district- representative and a 78 percent Democrat-district- representative can\u2019t find common ground.\n\nAbout the only time there is bipartisanship is when an idea is so terrible, it criss-crosses the aisle. Enter the Obama administration.\n\nWe have said since the administration\u2019s inception that if you\u2019re looking for bipartisanship \u2014 look on the other side of whatever position the president is pushing. This president is the king of strident partisan-only support.\n\nThere was bipartisan opposition to Obamacare. And there has been bipartisan opposition to this president just about all the way through \u2014 up to and including members of both parties being highly skeptical of the just announced Iran capitulation deal.\n\nWhich brings us to the president\u2019s push to strip mine patents and their legal protections.\n\nThis president doesn\u2019t particularly like private property of any sort \u2014 physical or intellectual. And he\u2019s spun that contempt into crony socialism gold.\n\nHuge business Google is a world-class, international intellectual property (IP) thief. And with huge amounts of campaign cash, tech support and high-level personnel-lending, this administration is the de facto Google administration.\n\nNowhere is the sell-out more clear than on patents. Who is the head of the Obama administration\u2019s Patent and Trade Office? Michelle Lee \u2013 who\u2019s last gig was\u2026Google\u2019s head of patents and patent strategy. Shocker.\n\nSo when this president repeatedly expresses his support for patent \u201creform\u201d \u2014 grab your Government-to-English dictionary. Because his definition of \u201creform\u201dalmost certainly isn\u2019t yours. (See also: Obamacare \u201creform.\u201d)\n\nEnter the House\u2019s woefully misnamed Innovation Act (again, get your dictionary). Which makes it exponentially more difficult for patent holders to defend their property from thieves like\u2026Google.\n\nIf this were the Wild West, the Innovation Act would mandate ranchers use pea-shooters to fend off bazooka-armed rustlers. In short, the Innovation Act undermines innovation.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea so terrible, it triggers the Obama Bipartisan Opposition Rule. Later today\u2026:\n\nBicameral, Bipartisan Press Conference to Highlight Broad Opposition to Sweeping Anti-Patent Legislation Moving Through Congress Senator David Vitter (R-LA), Senator Chris Coons (D-DE), Representative John Conyers (D-MI) and Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY), will hold a joint press conference to highlight the broad opposition to sweeping anti-patent legislation moving through Congress. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on H.R. 9, so-called the Innovation Act, before the House concludes legislative business in July \u2026 . H.R. 9 is strongly opposed by inventors, small businesses, venture capitalists, startup communities, and manufacturing, technology, and life sciences companies.\n\nThe opposition isn\u2019t just bipartisan \u2014 it\u2019s omni-partisan. Just about anyone who has a thought worth having \u2014 and thus patenting \u2014 is opposed to the bill.\n\nDo we all come just to oppose? Of course not \u2014 we offer bipartisan alternatives. That are actual, small-bore solutions. Not omni-directional, vastly-overreaching, government-defined \u201creforms\u201d:\n\nSenator Coons is the author of targeted patent legislation, the STRONG Patents Act, which Senator Vitter has co-sponsored.\n\nRather than destroy the patent village in order to \u201csave\u201d it \u2014 let\u2019s actually only address the only problem anyone ever cites.\n\nIt\u2019s the bipartisan thing to do.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Seton Motley", "description": "Rather than destroy the patent village in order to \u201csave\u201d it -- let\u2019s actually only address the only problem anyone ever cites.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Ahh, bipartisanship.
