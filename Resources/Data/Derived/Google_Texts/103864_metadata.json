Lindsey Graham (R-SC) claiming he intends to change his references to \u201cObamacare\u201d as \u201cHillarycare\u201d if the national healthcare program collapses because he wants presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton \u201cto own it,\u201d the former president marveled at the GOP\u2019s obsession with wanting the program to fail.\n\n\u201cThis bill [Obamacare] has already produced a lot of good results,\u201d Clinton explained. \u201cLook, they are desperate for this bill to fail.

I would be shocked if it fails. I just think when all these dire predictions don\u2019t come out, if they don\u2019t, I believe that pretty soon, within the next several years, it will be like Medicare and Medicaid. It will be a normal part of our lives and people will be glad it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the 2008 campaign that saw Hillary Clinton lose the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama, Clinton said campaigns must be about having \u201ca plan for the future,\u201d but cautioned that candidates need to define themselves to the voters but the opposition does it first.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a strategy for presenting your true self to the voters in an environment where there are unprecedented opportunities for those who don\u2019t want you to win to paint a different picture of your true self,\u201d he explained.\n\nWatch the video below, uploaded to YouTube by yazchattiest:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/clinton-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Bill Clinton pounds Republicans for \u2018sitting around just begging for America to fail\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "Can you remember a time in your lifetime when a major political party was sitting around just begging for America to fail?\n\u201cThis bill [Obamacare] has already produced a lot of good results,\u201d Clinton explained.\n\u201cLook, they are desperate for this bill to fail.\nBecause, if it\u2019s not a failure, everything they\u2019ve been telling us since 1980, \u2018big government\u2019s bad,\u2019 is wrong.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThey so badly want it to fail.\n\u201cYou have to have a strategy for presenting your true self to the voters in an environment where there are unprecedented opportunities for those who don\u2019t want you to win to paint a different picture of your true self,\u201d he explained."}
