The world premiere of \u201cThe 12\u201d \u2014 Robert Schenkkan and Neil Berg\u2019s musical about Jesus\u2019 disciples \u2014 is slated for March 27 through April 26 at the Stage Theatre.\n\nThe production joins a robust roster of diverse works, including the revamp of \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown,\u201d which opens the season Sept. 12.\n\n\u201d Denver Center Goes All the Way\u201d could have been the winking headline for this late addition. After all Schenkkan\u2019s play \u201cAll the Way\u201d won the Tony Award for best drama in June. Actor Bryan Cranston took best actor honors for his turn as President Lyndon Baines Johnson during the period he was muscling and cajoling Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nFor the Denver Center\u2019s resident theater company to end the season the way it launches it \u2014 with a fresh musical \u2014 also underscores the all-in commitment the company and artistic director Kent Thompson have made not merely to new plays, but also new musicals.\n\n\u201cMusicals are a tough thing obviously because of the resources required,\u201d Schenkkan said on the phone from New York. \u201cAnd it\u2019s wonderful that a theater the size of Denver is willing to take that gamble with their audiences.\u201d\n\nWith the help of the Steinberg Commission in Playwriting, the much-in-demand Schenkkan is already at work on a commissioned piece for the Denver Center.\n\n\u201cHis epic \u2018The Kentucky Cycle\u2019 is one my favorite plays,\u201d Thompson said via e-mail. \u201cWhen I saw \u2018All the Way\u2019 in its premiere at Oregon Shakespeare Festival I knew we\u2019d made a great choice.\u201d Schenkkan won the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cThe Kentucky Cycle\u201d in 1992.\n\nStill. Thompson agrees two musicals in one season is quite the undertaking.\n\n\u2018The Unsinkable Molly Brown\u2019 fulfills many things on my list of artistic priorities \u2014 a terrific book and new songs from the Meredith Willson library, a top creative team, and \u2014 in many ways most important\u2014a new look at an iconic Colorado woman whose story is relevant today.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe 12,\u201d Schenkkan and composer-lyricist Berg imagine the lives of the 12 disciples in the aftermath of their leader\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThis is the part of the story I\u2019ve never seen dramatized in any form,\u201d said Schenkkan. \u201cWhat an interesting dramatic question. These 12 very ordinary men \u2014 blue-collar, young for the most part \u2014 who give up everything to follow this very compelling \u2014 at the same time difficult-to-understand \u2014 individual into what seems like an extraordinary triumph. Which within 36 hours becomes a complete horror show. He\u2019s dead. They\u2019re hunted. Every thing they\u2019ve given up everything for is gone.\u201d\n\nThompson says he did not go searching for a musical to take the final slot of the season. Instead, he wrote, \u201cThe 12\u201d fulfills a larger goal \u201cto create unforgettable experiences for audiences and artists.\u201d\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Center will close season with premiere of the musical \u201cThe 12\u201d", "title": "Denver Center will close season with premiere of the musical \u201cThe 12\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/13/denver-center-will-close-season-with-premiere-of-the-musical-the-12/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140814__AE15THANNOUNCEp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140814__AE15THANNOUNCEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T17:12:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:03:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcf5\"", "article_summary": "After all Schenkkan\u2019s play \u201cAll the Way\u201d won the Tony Award for best drama in June.\nThe production joins a robust roster of diverse works, including the revamp of \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown,\u201d which opens the season Sept. 12.\nThe Denver Center Theatre Company has unveiled the final show of its 2014-2015 season.\nThe world premiere of \u201cThe 12\u201d \u2014 Robert Schenkkan and Neil Berg\u2019s musical about Jesus\u2019 disciples \u2014 is slated for March 27 through April 26 at the Stage Theatre.\n\u201d Denver Center Goes All the Way\u201d could have been the winking headline for this late addition."}
