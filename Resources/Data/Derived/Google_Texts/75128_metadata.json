ObamaCare isn\u2019t Obama\u2019s Katrina or his Iraq, or even his Watergate (notice these are all Republican scandals that Republicans are dying to falsely equivocate onto a Democrat oh PLEASE). Nope.\n\nAccording to Woodward, Obama is incompetent (of course), but he had good intentions.\n\n\u201cWhat this is, it\u2019s a mess clearly, but what it isn\u2019t, and I think you have to look at the question of motive. And the President\u2019s motive here, even though there were deep problems with the implementation, he wants to do something good for 30 million people and get them health insurance. So this isn\u2019t Watergate, this isn\u2019t Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.\u201d\n\nIs he incompetent? Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace begged. Of course, Woodward soothed.\n\nWoodward said, \u201cThere\u2019s no question about that. But you see all of these stories and this frenzy out there, the game over, the presidency is over some people are saying, and I think that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nIt will get much worse, Woodward fed Wallace. Oh yes, much worse than an almost Katrina/Iraq/Watergate. Hisssss.\n\nIt\u2019s the President\u2019s fault that a website was deliberately overloaded and unfunded and then DDOS-ed, because Obama is responsible for everything, especially Republican obstructionism (see Benghazi). It\u2019s like David Gregory said, it\u2019s Iraq but without the deaths. And that is so not tacky or out of context or clown showy at all. Trying to help save the lives of millions of people is just like starting a war on a lie but without the deaths because you see in this episode of Rewriting History, Iraq was about incompetence, not lies.\n\nLive or die, what\u2019s the diff? Please be quiet when Very Important Pundits speak.\n\nAnd so we have come around some crazy corner where this ride must be almost over because Bob Woodward has just told Fox News that this is not Obama\u2019s Watergate.\n\nNever mind that 47 million people without insurance are going to have it. Almost WATERGATE I tell you. Or at least Katrina. Iraq? PLEASE!?!?\n\nWhen this hysteria has passed and people are signed up for affordable healthcare, we will resume our regularly scheduled Obama taxpayer funded GOP enabled Witch Hunts: Benghazi and the IRS. We will never discuss the People or how this helps the People, because life and death? Meh.
