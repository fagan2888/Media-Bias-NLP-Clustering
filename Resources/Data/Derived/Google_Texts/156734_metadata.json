Rand Paul told a partisan crowd last week that the rule was never part of the Affordable Care Act, but was tacked on later by the White House\n\nThe so-called 'grandfather' clause virtually guarantees the cancellation of private health insurance policies that change in any way from year to year\n\n\n\nKentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul told an audience in Charleston, S.C. last week that the wave of health insurance cancellations following the Affordable Care Act's implementation came from 'a regulation written by President Obama' months after he signed the law.\n\nAnd every Senate Democrat, he said during his Nov. 11 remarks, voted against the GOP's attempt to block the regulation.\n\nSpeaking at The Charleston Meeting, an influential monthly gathering of conservative movers and shakers, Paul said Senate Republicans tried in 2010 to block an Obamacare rule that only permitted Americans to keep their health insurance policies if nothing about them was changed from year to year.\n\nThat 'grandfather' clause in the Obama administration's regulations has been widely faulted for causing nearly 5 million policy cancellations, and analysts estimate that number could climb to 12 million.\n\nPresident Obama pledged on Thursday to give insurers a one-year grace period, and House Republicans passed a stronger measure on Friday that would empower the companies to keep selling their 2013 policies indefinitely.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nRand Paul told a partisan crowd on Nov. 11 that the Obama White House crafted the regulation responsible for millions of health insurance cancellations, and that every Senate Democrat blocked an effort to kill it His fault? President Obama's administration crafted the regulation that has forced nearly 5 million Americans in the ranks of the uninsured\n\n'I'm still learning about it,' Paul said of the Affordable Care Act. 'It\u2019s 20,000 pages of regulations. The Bill was 2,000 pages. And I didn\u2019t realize this until this week \u2013 the whole idea of you losing or getting your insurance cancelled wasn\u2019t in the original Obamacare [law]. It was a regulation written by President Obama, three months later.'\n\nIn a little-noted Nov. 5 report, the influential Senate Republican Policy claimed that '[t]he Obama Administration decided \u2013 all on its own \u2013 that any routine change made to a grandfathered plan would invalidate the promise that you can keep what you had.'\n\nCiting that report, Paul described the GOP's attempt to do away with that regulation in 2010, months before he became a U.S. senator.\n\n'The Republicans had a vote to try to cancel that regulation so you couldn\u2019t be cancelled \u2013 to grandfather everybody in,' he said.\n\n\n\n'You know what the vote was? Straight party line. Every Democrat voted to keep the rule that cancels your insurance.'\n\nWatch the full speech on YouTube\n\n\n\nLooking ahead? Sen. Rand Paul is seen as a likely 2016 presidential candidate, but first he aims to force as many Senate Democrats into retirement as possible\n\nThe GOP proposal came from Wyoming Republican Senator Mike Enzi, who sought to overturn what he warned would 'threaten small businesses with higher health care costs, more regulation, and even loss of the health insurance many of their employees rely on.'\n\n'Throughout the health care debate, the President continually promised, \"If you like what you have you can keep it,'\" Enzi said at the time. 'The grandfathered health plan rule breaks the President\u2019s promise.'\n\nHis proposal, a joint resolution expressing 'congressional disapproval' of the grandfather clause, failed on a 59-40 vote strictly along party lines.\n\n\n\nDuring a brief debate, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley complained that 'only in the District of Columbia could you get away with telling the people \"if you like what you have you can keep it,\" and then pass regulations six months later that do just the opposite, and figure that people are going to ignore it.'\n\nIn his Charleston speech, Paul claimed politically vulnerable Democrats including Mark Pryor or Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana will find it difficult to explain their 2010 votes when they run for re-election next year.\n\nSen. Mike Enzi proposed a measure in 2010 that could have gutted the Obamacare 'grandfather' regulation, but every Democrat \u2013 including Mark Pryor of Arkansas \u2013 voted to block the attempt\n\n\n\nVulnerable? Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu voted for the Affordable Care Act, and also voted against a Republican move to get rid of the law's 'grandfather' regulation\n\n\"This week, have you noticed?' he asked. 'Democrats are, like, going to the White House and saying, \"Mr. President \u2013 what did you do?'\"\n\n'We're not responsible for this,' he described them telling their constituents. ' The president cancelled your insurance, but not us. Because we're running in the South now, and we've got a Republican running against us.'\n\nBut Landrieu and Pryor 'voted specifically, not just for Obamacare. They voted for the rule that says if your insurance ever changes, you'll be cancelled.'\n\nSpokespersons for Landrieu and Pryor did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nA Rasmussen poll released Monday showed that 58 per cent of Americans \u2013 a new high water mark \u2013have an unfavorable view of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nMallory Factor, the South Carolina author and businessman who organizes The Charleston Meeting, told MailOnline that his events 'really do get a lot of real, candid comments from big-name politicians.'\n\n'I'm not surprised Sen. Paul raised some eyebrows. These meetings give people an opportunity to see our national leaders outside of three-minute sound bites.'\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Senate,GOP,tried,block,Obamacare,rule,caused,insurance,cancellations", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509520/Senate-GOP-tried-block-Obamacare-rule-caused-insurance-cancellations.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Millions of insurance cancellations came from the rule 'written by President Obama,' Paul said, and 'every Democrat voted to keep the rule'", "title": "Paul: Senate GOP tried to block 'grandfather' clause but Dems saved it", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509520/Senate-GOP-tried-block-Obamacare-rule-caused-insurance-cancellations.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/18/article-2509520-1961683900000578-581_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2509520, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Senate,GOP,tried,block,Obamacare,rule,caused,insurance,cancellations", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-11-18T20:31:41.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+U.S.+Political+Editor", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T21:31:32.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Senate GOP tried block Obamacare rule caused insurance cancellations"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Millions of insurance cancellations came from the rule 'written by President Obama,' Paul said, and 'every Democrat voted to keep the rule'", "title": "Paul: Senate GOP tried to block 'grandfather' clause but Dems saved it", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509520/Senate-GOP-tried-block-Obamacare-rule-caused-insurance-cancellations.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/18/article-2509520-1961683900000578-581_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2013/11/1418450360_2849164604001_Rand-Obamacare.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Millions of insurance cancellations came from the rule 'written by President Obama,' Paul said, and 'every Democrat voted to keep the rule'"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe269c\"", "article_summary": "And every Senate Democrat, he said during his Nov. 11 remarks, voted against the GOP's attempt to block the regulation.\n'Throughout the health care debate, the President continually promised, \"If you like what you have you can keep it,'\" Enzi said at the time.\nThey voted for the rule that says if your insurance ever changes, you'll be cancelled.'\nSpeaking at The Charleston Meeting, an influential monthly gathering of conservative movers and shakers, Paul said Senate Republicans tried in 2010 to block an Obamacare rule that only permitted Americans to keep their health insurance policies if nothing about them was changed from year to year.\nEvery Democrat voted to keep the rule that cancels your insurance.'"}
