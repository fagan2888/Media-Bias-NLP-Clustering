It might well be called a moment of affirmation after a bruising campaign.\n\nThe Democratic race for Barbara Mikulski\u2019s Senate seat had long been defined as a choice between the symbolic draw of replacing her with an African-American woman who has a compelling personal story--or choosing a white male with a far more impressive record. Thanks to what appeared to be a very strong turnout in Van Hollen\u2019s congressional district, his record overcame the lure of picking Donna Edwards to bolster the slim ranks of Senate women.\n\nHe promised supporters at an election night rally he would follow Mikulski\u2019s example of fighting for Marylanders.\n\n\u201cShe understood that the job of a Maryland senator was, yes, to engage in the big battles at the national level,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cBut she also understood you never forget the people back home in our neighborhoods and communities and deliver results on the ground.\u201d\n\nDiane Bongiorni, a former constituent of Van Hollen\u2019s in Montgomery county, offered a story last night that was typical of many such tributes he received during this campaign.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago when the Maryland Obamacare rollout was so horrible, I was actually very ill and needed an operation and I could not get my health insurance,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd I called Chris Van Hollen\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nShe said a Van Hollen aide bullied the Maryland people into giving her health insurance just in time for her to have open heart surgery.\n\nBut then she moved into Edwards\u2019 Prince George\u2019s County district. And now when she calls Edwards' office for service \u201cnobody even returns my call.\u201d\n\nAs Mikulski proved, sometimes it\u2019s the small gestures that are the most appreciated.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Chris Van Hollen\u2019s victory party last night took on a festive glow long before positive results were more than just exit polls and wishful thinking.
