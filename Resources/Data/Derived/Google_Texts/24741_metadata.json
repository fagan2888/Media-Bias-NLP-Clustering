The funeral follows a somber wake the day before as mourners lined up for blocks on a cold, rainy day to pay their respects.\n\nLiu, 32, had served as a policeman for seven years and was married just two months when he was killed with his partner, Officer Rafael Ramos, on Dec. 20. Ramos\u2019 funeral was held a week ago.\n\n\u201cThis is a really tragic story,\u201d Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters following the wake, held just two days after the death of his own father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\n\u201cThis is really pointless. It had nothing to do with them,\u201d he said of Liu and Ramos. \u201cThey did nothing wrong. \u2026 It was pure and random hatred.\u201d\n\nThe shooter, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, killed himself shortly after the brazen daytime ambush on a Brooklyn street.\n\nInvestigators say Brinsley was an emotionally disturbed loner who had made references online to the killings this summer of unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers, vowing to put \u201cwings on pigs.\u201d\n\nThe deaths strained an already tense relationship between city police unions and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who union leaders have said contributed to an environment that allowed the killings by supporting protests following the deaths of Eric Garner on Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.", "article_metadata": {"description": "2nd NYPD funeral follows cold, wet day of mourning", "title": "2nd NYPD funeral follows cold, wet day of mourning", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "2nd NYPD funeral follows cold, wet day of mourning", "title": "2nd NYPD funeral follows cold, wet day of mourning", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/04/2nd_nypd_funeral_follows_cold_wet_day_of_mourning/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/nypd-officers-shot.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "2nd NYPD funeral follows cold, wet day of mourning", "title": "2nd NYPD funeral follows cold, wet day of mourning", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/nypd-officers-shot.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Balsamo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb012\"", "article_summary": "The funeral follows a somber wake the day before as mourners lined up for blocks on a cold, rainy day to pay their respects.\nRamos\u2019 funeral was held a week ago.\nBuddhist monks will lead a Chinese ceremony for Officer Wenjian Liu, followed by a traditional police ceremony with eulogies led by a chaplain.\nLiu, 32, had served as a policeman for seven years and was married just two months when he was killed with his partner, Officer Rafael Ramos, on Dec. 20.\n\u2026 It was pure and random hatred.\u201dThe shooter, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, killed himself shortly after the brazen daytime ambush on a Brooklyn street."}
