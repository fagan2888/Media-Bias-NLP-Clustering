Cuyahoga County and the Cuyahoga Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Coalition will be hosting free tax preparation services as part of the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program. Last year in Cuyahoga County, the VITA Program served 13,000 people and brought back more than $18 million to the community. County VITA sites are at the County’s Westshore Neighborhood Family Service Center (NFSC) and at the Southgate NFSC. Westshore NFSC is located at 9830 Lorain Ave, Cleveland Ohio 44102; the tax site will be open Tuesday evenings and Saturdays. Southgate NFSC is located at 5398 ½ Northfield Rd, Maple Heights Ohio 44137; the tax site will be open Tuesday evenings and Saturdays. To schedule an appointment go online to www.211oh.org or call 211/United Way.

Returns will be prepared and filed by IRS certified tax-preparers and completed while the tax-payer waits. All returns will be screened for eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. To qualify, tax-payers must have a 2015 earned income less than $53,505, and must be filing a simple return.

Tax-payers should remember to bring: Current photo I.D., Social Security cards for each adult and child on the return, W2 and 1099 income statements, child care expense statement and provider’s Tax I.D. Number, Form 1099-INT for any checking or savings accounts as well as bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit. If the taxpayer purchased health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, bring 1099 tax credit from health insurance company.
