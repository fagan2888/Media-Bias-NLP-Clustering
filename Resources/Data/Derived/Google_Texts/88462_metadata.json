I need to get out of the debunking racket. https://t.co/LpMYtNpxVb \u2014 F. Perry Wilson (@methodsmanmd) August 3, 2015\n\nThe CMS database shows that Oz was paid more than $1.2 million in 2014. Most of that comes from Covidien Sales LLC, which, according to MedPageToday, paid him for \"his ownership stake in HET Systems, a company which sells a hemorrhoid energy therapy system.\"\n\nAs Vox reports, Oz did promote the treatment in one of his syndicated columns, and did include a disclosure that he \"helped develop\" the therapy \u2014 though Vox also points to an essay in the journal BMJ that argues that disclosure doesn't necessarily eliminate conflict of interest.\n\nProPublica's database, which also includes transactions that occurred in the last five months of 2013, shows more than $1.5 million in total paid to Oz. That database also says that Oz received more than any of the other 247 doctors with his specialty \u2014 Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians/Thoracic Surgery (Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery) \u2014 in the state of New York.\n\nOz has been called before a US Senate panel before for endorsing products on his TV show that weren't supported by science, at which point he did admit that some of these products \"don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.\" (He was not speaking specifically about HET Systems.)\n\nEarlier this year, a group of top physicians asked that he be removed from his faculty position at Columbia University for his \"egregious lack of integrity\" and for his support of what they called \"quack treatments.\"\n\nWe've reached out to Dr. Oz's press contacts and will update this post if we hear back.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#1e2021", "sailthru.author": "Lauren F Friedman", "application-name": "Tech Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Transparency laws are finally shedding light on how much money drug companies pay doctors.", "creator": "kevloria", "url": "http://www.techinsider.io/how-much-money-drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-2015-8", "image": "http://static4.techinsider.io/image/55c517ee2acae7c23f8bbd21-506-253/drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-more-than-15-million-since-2013.jpg", "title": "Drug companies have paid Dr. Oz more than $1.5 million since 2013", "site": "techinsider", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "science", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Dr. Oz, Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, Kevin Loria, Lauren F Friedman", "description": "Transparency laws are finally shedding light on how much money drug companies pay doctors.", "author": "Kevin Loria and Lauren F Friedman", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-07", "sailthru.title": "Drug companies have paid Dr. Oz more than $1.5 million since 2013", "theme-color": "#1e2021", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.techinsider.io/image/55c517d12acae74c2f8bbf5c-50-50/drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-more-than-15-million-since-2013.jpg", "news_keywords": "Dr. Oz, Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, Kevin Loria, Lauren F Friedman", "tbi-image": "http://static4.techinsider.io/image/55c517d12acae74c2f8bbf5c/drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-more-than-15-million-since-2013.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 1111678992180150}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.techinsider.io/assets/images/ti/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=TI-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-08-07", "article": {"publisher": "techinsider", "author": "http://www.techinsider.io/author/lauren-f-friedman"}, "sailthru.description": "Transparency laws are finally shedding light on how much money drug companies pay doctors.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Tech Insider", "description": "Transparency laws are finally shedding light on how much money drug companies pay doctors.", "title": "Drug companies have paid Dr. Oz more than $1.5 million since 2013", "url": "http://www.techinsider.io/how-much-money-drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-2015-8", "image": "http://static3.techinsider.io/image/55c517ee2acae7c23f8bbd21-1190-625/drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-more-than-15-million-since-2013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Tech Insider", "p": {"domain_verify": "d6302fabb0c3cb7485489a9c237bf78f"}, "title": "Drug companies have paid Dr. Oz more than $1.5 million since 2013", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.techinsider.io/image/55c517d12acae74c2f8bbf5c/drug-companies-have-paid-dr-oz-more-than-15-million-since-2013.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "science"}, "article_summary": "Pharmaceutical companies paid Dr. Mehmet Oz more than $1.5 million between the last five months of 2013 and 2014, according to a review of ProPublica's Dollars for Docs site.\nDr. Oz makes more than 1.2 million dollars per year from pharma.\nThe site leans on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, which ProPublica released in an effort to make the relationships between doctors and pharmaceutical companies more transparent.\nhttps://t.co/LpMYtNpxVb \u2014 F.
