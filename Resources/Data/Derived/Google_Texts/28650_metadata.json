I would veto SB 1062, but would then bring together all the interested parties before this legislative session adjourns to forge consensus on acceptable language protecting religious liberty.\"\n\nA couple days later, after Governor Jan Brewer vetoed the bill, Ducey published this statement on his campaign website: \"Now that Gov. Brewer has deliberated and made her decision on SB 1062, it's time to refocus on the issues that I'm hearing most about from voters around the state -- how to get back to a full-strength economy and create jobs.\"\n\nBut now, Ducey sees a different opportunity.\n\nDJ Quinlan, executive director of the Arizona Democratic Party, says in a statement this morning that Ducey is \"dog whistling\" the issue.\n\n\"After saying he would veto SB 1062, he promised to work to bring it back again,\" Quinlan says. \"Maybe all those ice cream socials with his party's extremists gave Doug brain freeze or it's just another example of what we see coming from today's extreme wing of Arizona Republicans - and what Barry Goldwater warned about - their relentless attempts to restrict individual rights based upon their own religious beliefs.\"\n\nSo, if the former Cold Stone Creamy executive would veto SB 1062 and it shares the \"exact\" same principles as the Hobby Lobby case, why is he praising the SCOTUS' decision?\n\nPresident Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) mandates that employers make available various types of contraceptions within their employee health plan. So, the owners of Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts outfit, sued, saying that forcing them to do so violated their religious rights.\n\nIt's worth noting Hobby Lobby's own dripping hypocrisy, as reported by various media outlets, including Mother Jones.\n\nThe corporation writhes in sanctimonious disgust at providing employees access to certain contraceptions and yet the company had \"more than $73 million in mutual funds with investments in companies that produce emergency contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices, and drugs commonly used in abortions. Hobby Lobby makes large matching contributions to this company-sponsored 401(k),\" Mother Jones reported in April.\n\nGot a tip?
