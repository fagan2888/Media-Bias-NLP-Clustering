Facebook is showing few signs of slowing down.

The social-networking giant’s quarterly profit more than doubled from a year ago as mobile-advertising growth continued to surge. Revenue jumped 61% from a year ago, as advertisers are drawn to the company’s growing user base.

Shares jumped 2.6% to $73.10 in after-hours trading. If the gains hold through Thursday’s opening bell, the stock will open at a new all-time high. Shares are up 173% over the past 12 months through Wednesday’s close, the top performer in the S&P 500.

In conjunction with its quarterly results, Facebook also released a slew of charts highlighting its growth and its success in mobile advertising.

First, here’s a look at daily active users, who spend the most time on the social network’s platform and are therefore more valuable to Facebook from an advertising perspective. These users increased to 829 million, up 19% from a year ago.

Monthly active users hit 1.32 billion, up 14% from a year ago.

Mobile, once again, was the segment where Facebook saw big growth. Mobile daily active users rose to 654 million, up 39% from a year ago. Facebook’s advertising has benefited from this growth. Mobile-advertising accounted for 62% of advertising revenue in the quarter, up from 59% in the first quarter and 41% a year ago.

Mobile monthly active users increased to 1.07 billion, up 31% from a year ago.

Bottom line: Facebook’s revenue continues to grow to new heights. Revenue clocked in at $2.91 billion in the second quarter, up 61% from a year ago and ahead of analysts’ expectations.

Update: Facebook had 1.07 billion mobile monthly active users in the second quarter. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said 1.07 million.
