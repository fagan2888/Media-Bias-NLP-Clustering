Mangold estimates that he can do \"80 percent of what a doctor would do.\"\n\nAs a first step, he had to take some undergraduate prerequisites \u2013 including organic chemistry and microbiology \u2013 that his 2004 bachelor\u2019s in athletic training from North Dakota State University did not require. He then entered the University of Iowa\u2019s Master of Physician Assistant Studies program, which runs 28 months, often sharing classes with medical students. By his second year, he was seeing patients at the university\u2019s hospital and at other facilities in the state.\n\n\n\n[Learn about schools with top-ranked physician assistant programs.]\n\nAfter graduating in 2013, Mangold passed the national certification exam and was hired by the Vinton Family Medical Clinic in Vinton, Iowa, one of Virginia Gay Hospital\u2019s outposts.\n\n\"I have autonomy, unless I have a question or concern for my supervising physician,\" says Mangold, 34, who sees about 20 patients daily. He reviews patients' medical histories, does physical exams, orders and interprets x-rays and other diagnostic tests, treats a whole range of ailments from bronchitis to diabetes, writes prescriptions and removes moles or cysts and performs other office-based procedures.\n\nWhile one-third of PAs choose a career in primary care, others work in medical specialties, including emergency medicine, orthopedics and psychiatry. Their tasks depend largely on the specialty and what their supervising physician needs them to do.\n\nA PA working in surgery, for example, may close incisions and provide care before and after the operation. As America\u2019s population ages, PAs will increasingly be needed to treat the kinds of chronic ailments that come with an older population, like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\n\n[Consider becoming a physician's assistant instead of a medical doctor.]\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also has added to the ranks of insured individuals, who now are more able to seek primary care. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects job growth of 38 percent between 2012 and 2022. The money is good, too. The median annual wage for PAs was $90,930 in 2012, with the top 10 percent making more than $124,770.\n\nPhysician assistants aren't the only health jobs that are taking off. Here are a few other booming career options.\n\nPhysical therapist: As the U.S. population expands and baby boomers get creakier, PTs will find plenty of opportunities to help the injured and ill improve their movement and manage their pain. In fact, the government estimates 36 percent growth by 2022 \u2013 or nearly 124,000 openings.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a doctor of physical therapy degree, which typically takes three years. The median annual wage for PTs was $79,860 in 2012, but leading earners pulled in more than $112,000.\n\n\n\n[Find out about how medical schools are teaching the doctors of tomorrow.]\n\nDentist: The demand for dentists is expected to be particularly strong in rural areas in coming years, translating to more than 59,000 positions by 2022. Dental school requires four years, and specialists like orthodontists and endodontists generally need another two to four years.\n\nThe hard work pays off, though. The typical general dentist made $149,310 in 2012 with the top 10 percent boasting $187,000.\n\nOptometrist: It\u2019s the fading eyesight of America\u2019s aging population that is boosting the job market among optometrists, although some specialize in treating infants and children. Optometrists, who must have a doctor of optometry degree, examine, diagnose, treat and manage various eye diseases and injuries.\n\nThe BLS projects 24 percent growth by 2022. Median salaries ran about $97,820 in 2012, although earnings for some topped $184,500.\n\nThis story is excerpted from the U.S. News \"Best Graduate Schools 2016\" guidebook, which features in-depth articles, rankings and data.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160504_postsecondary\",\"text\":\"There are more than 2,900 four-year, degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "PAs enjoy many of the same responsibilities of medical doctors and are able to choose a specialty.", "zone": "top medical schools", "author": "Christopher J.
