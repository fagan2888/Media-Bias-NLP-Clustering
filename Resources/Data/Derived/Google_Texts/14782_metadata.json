It\u2019s Wallace\u2019s job to make sure everyone on the roster has what he needs at his locker when he needs it, or that Wallace can get something for them \u2014 equipment, services \u2014 when they need it.\n\nHe was resurrecting a body that had been in a baseball coma for 33 years.\n\n\u201cWe just worked with what we had,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIt was kind of close, comfy. The coach\u2019s locker room you could put both hands on either side of the wall in the room. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot of space. We were in the visitor\u2019s locker room there because D.C. United had the home locker room.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is we were going in there blind. Everyone was saying, \u2018Is everything going to work? Is everything going to be ready?\u2019 For the most part, it was. One thing was the batting cage was dug in at the bottom of the stairs, dug into the dirt, and every time it rained, it flooded. God rest his soul, watching Mitchell Page [the batting coach in 2006] walk around with his coffee mug and his sandals because there was about an inch of water down there. We had to make sure the drainage pumps didn\u2019t get clogged up from the peanut shells from the stands.\u201d\n\nWallace took a tour of RFK Stadium in the winter to get a handle on what he would be facing. On that tour, he found a room that had the jerseys from the Cracker Jack Old Timers games that were played in the stadium in the 1980s \u2014 all part of the effort to drum up support for the return of baseball to the District. \u201cThey may still be there,\u201d Wallace said, laughing as he remembered the museum-like tour of failed baseball recruitment efforts in Washington.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the team came up from spring training in Viera that Wallace could set up shop for veteran ballplayers like Vinny Castilla and Jose Guillen, newcomers to the team who were used to major-league facilities.\n\nThe ones who came from Montreal? They were used to second-hand furniture and spare parts. Major League Baseball had purchased the Expos in 2002 from Jeffrey Loria in a historic three-franchise deal that allowed Loria to buy the then-Florida Marlins from John Henry, who in turn joined a group buying the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe Expos players and team personnel who lived through the MLB-ownership years in Montreal arrived in Washington prepared to expect the worst. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the greatest facility in Montreal, either,\u201d Wallace said, remembering the decaying home that was Olympic Stadium.\n\nBut they also brought with them that chip on their shoulders from being baseball\u2019s orphan.\n\n\u201cAll of us who came from Montreal were like a little family because when we were up in Montreal, we were the little engine that could,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIt was like that when we came to D.C. because we were still being run from Major League Baseball.\u201d\n\nWhat was different, though, was what happened on the field and in the stands. That Nationals team stunned everyone with a 50-31 record and first place in the National League East after the first half of the season, though the bottom would fall out in the second half with a 31-50 record to finish the season at 81-81. The finish, though, doesn\u2019t diminish the memories of that inaugural season.\n\n\u201cI am from Arlington, Texas, and grew up a Cowboys fan,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI remember watching when the Cowboys would play the Redskins at RFK Stadium, you would see those stands bouncing up and down. So, it was fun to see that for baseball. When the visiting teams would come in and see that, it kind of unnerved them a bit.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun, and it was also awe-inspiring to be in the nation\u2019s capital, one of the most powerful cities in the world, and to have us be part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat first group of players will always have a special place for me,\u201d said Wallace, who helped right the wrong his former boss had done to Washington baseball fans.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wallace, perhaps more than any member of the orphaned franchise that became the Washington Nationals in 2005, appreciated the moment when he arrived at RFK Stadium to set up shop for the return of baseball to D.C.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wallace, perhaps more than any member of the orphaned franchise that became the Washington Nationals in 2005, appreciated the moment when he arrived at RFK Stadium to set up shop for the return of baseball to D.C.", "title": "LOVERRO: Nationals clubhouse manager Mike Wallace has seen it all over 10 years", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/loverro-mike-wallace-nationals-clubhouse-manager-h/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/13/nationals-spring-baseballjpeg-0f56f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/13/nationals-spring-baseballjpeg-0f56f.jpg", "description": "Wallace, perhaps more than any member of the orphaned franchise that became the Washington Nationals in 2005, appreciated the moment when he arrived at RFK Stadium to set up shop for the return of bas", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "LOVERRO: Nationals clubhouse manager Mike Wallace has seen it all over"}, "Author": "Thom Loverro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd898a\"", "article_summary": "We were in the visitor\u2019s locker room there because D.C.
