Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Camas, is facing a challenger on both the right, Michael Delavar, and the left, Bob Dingethal, in the race to represent the 3rd Congressional District.\n\nHerrera Beutler, first elected in 2010, has said she\u2019s running for a third term in part because she doesn\u2019t believe anyone will work harder to represent Southwest Washington.\n\nDelavar, a Republican who was once a supporter of Herrera Beutler, blasted her as a liberal and said she should have backed her party rather than calling for the end of the government shutdown in 2013. The Democratic candidate, Dingethal, said it\u2019s time to work to bolster the middle class, properly fund the nation\u2019s public schools and move past partisan gridlock that has paralyzed Congress.\n\nBoth Delavar, a Washougal pilot, and Dingethal, who is on leave from his position as executive director of the Gifford Pinchot Task Force, take issue with what they characterized as the incumbent\u2019s reluctance to hold more traditional town halls.\n\nLast week, the U.S. House voted on a measure intended to help banks deal with legal marijuana shops without fear of being prosecuted for breaking federal law. Herrera Beutler voted against the measure. She did not vote in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\nHerrera Beutler has \u201cwitnessed in our communities the negative impacts that can stem from marijuana use,\u201d her spokesman Casey Bowman wrote in an email, adding it\u2019s \u201cnot an easy issue for her.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of pot, both Delavar and Dingethal disagree with the incumbent, although for different reasons.\n\nDingethal, who is in favor of decriminalizing marijuana, said the state needs the revenue and it\u2019s not a good idea to push using the drug back into the shadows.\n\n\u201cI think it would be disingenuous to support states\u2019 rights to vote this in and then not find a way to make it workable,\u201d Dingethal said.\n\nDelavar \u2014 whose main platform is strict adherence to the Constitution \u2014 said prohibition is not within the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction and it should be left up to the state\u2019s to decide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let them reflect the will of the voters without trying to impose my will upon them,\u201d Delavar said.\n\nDelavar\u2019s stance on guns has proven controversial. Although he said it\u2019s not a central platform to his campaign, he believes people with criminal histories should not be prohibited from owning firearms. The Constitution, he said, is clear: \u201cthe right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nHerrera Beutler said it\u2019s important to keep guns out of the hands of people who have mental health issues but that she is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and people shouldn\u2019t be limited unduly.\n\nDingethal said it\u2019s time to stop letting powerful lobbyists, such as the National Rifle Association, dictate our nation\u2019s gun laws. He\u2019s a proponent of stricter gun laws.\n\nBoth Herrera Beutler and Delavar believe the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, Dingethal said it establishes a great framework.\n\nDelavar is in favor of Vancouver\u2019s proposed oil-by-rail terminal, while Dingethal is opposed. Herrera Beutler declined to take a hard stand, saying instead she believes her role is to push for higher safety standards.\n\n\u201cWith regard to the oil terminal, the siting decision is up to the state, and the affected city is having a healthy debate on whether it makes sense for the area,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what should be happening, and since there isn\u2019t a federal role in the siting decision the community doesn\u2019t need its federal representative grandstanding, making promises she can\u2019t keep, and confusing the issue. The federal role here is ensuring safety in the transportation system, and that\u2019s where Jaime has appropriately placed her focus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "U.S. Rep.
