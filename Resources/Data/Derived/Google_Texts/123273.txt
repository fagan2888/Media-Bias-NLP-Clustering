Then it is a nail-biting few weeks before the result is announced at a conference on September 12.

All say the Health and Social Care act is the Tory legislation they would set out to repeal.

But they have very different answers to what makes them laugh, cry and is most important in their life.

Mr Corbyn is a football fan, while Ms Cooper wanted to be Doctor Who’s assistant as a child.

And Ms Kendall’s rivals should worry, as her favourite telly programme is The Sopranos.

What is your priority if you become leader?

To rebuild a strong Labour Party standing up for equality, social justice and good jobs – so we can win the next election and build a fairer country.

Our plan must be to create two million more high-tech jobs, to bring in universal childcare, to build affordable housing and end child poverty.

What Tory act would you repeal first?

Where to start? The NHS and Social Care Act followed by the Bedroom Tax, and the new Trade Union Bill.

That the Labour Party is still strong, energetic and determined despite our defeat. There are also so many people who were devastated the Tories got back in and who were depending on a Labour government to abolish the bedroom tax, save their Sure Start or tackle the zero hours contracts that we have to fight and win the next general election.

Why did you join the Labour Party?

As the granddaughter of a miner and daughter of a trade unionist I’ve always believed in strong Labour values. I could see I had more chances than my mum or grandma because Labour governments stood up for women’s equality. So I joined to campaign for better opportunities for everyone.

Ray Tang/REX Priority: Jeremy wants social justice

What is your priority if you become leader?

To offer the electorate a coherent economic alternative grounded in Labour values of social justice, peace and equality. I believe in a country in which people are happier, more fulfilled, secure in their work, home and with the opportunity to further themselves.

A government that supports people in achieving their collective aspirations through providing strong public services, access to lifelong learning and a prosperous, more balanced economy propped up by world-leading infrastructure.

The pernicious Health and Social Care Act. The Labour Party would restore the principle of publicly funded, publicly delivered, fully accountable social services available to all, free at the point of use and based on need.
