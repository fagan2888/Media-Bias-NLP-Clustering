And today is definitely one of those days. That's why we're highlighting three animal stories that are sure to make you chuckle.\n\nFirst up, take a look at this giant lobster. It weighs a whopping 23 pounds.\n\nIt's also the new star of Long Beach, New York, where Jordan Lobster Farms is located.\n\nThankfully, this lobster's sheer size has saved it from being eaten. Instead, the wholesaler is donating the crustacean to the Long Island Aquarium.\n\nSo, there's this seagull.\n\nNo, not that seagull. Instead, we're taking about one that's taken up residence at the top of a Seattle, Washington, parking garage.\n\n\"She dive-bombs anyone who dares to park here, like Cameron Carlson. First, mama lands in front of his car. When he gets out, she practically skims the top of his head,\" a KOMO reporter said.\n\nAnd finally, the Arlington Police Department in Texas was called in when the local animal shelter got ransacked.\n\nBut one look at the surveillance video showed them this: The culprit was actually a four-legged pup named Sadi. She'd managed to escape from her cage and make a big ol' mess.\n\nThe department ended up writing on their Facebook page, \"In lieu of an 'arrest' we found Sadi a Furrever Home so she can continue to have lots of fun.\"\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week's top 3 animal stories feature a lobster, a seagull and a dog.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "This week's top 3 animal stories feature a lobster, a seagull and a dog.", "title": "Top 3 Funny Animal Stories Of The Week", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/top-3-funny-animal-stories-of-the-week/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1437245479.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This week's top 3 animal stories feature a lobster, a seagull and a dog.", "title": "Top 3 Funny Animal Stories Of The Week", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/top-3-funny-animal-stories-of-the-week/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1437245479.png", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=RranJhdjpdy8HsdJjggL_9TBowvw32QK&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://49246", "iphone": "newsy://49246", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://49246", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "top 3,top 3 animal,top 3 animal stories,top 3 funny,lobster,23 pound lobster,seagull,seagull seattle parking garage,said the dog,dog arlington police department,aol,newsy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1437245479.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce466\"", "article_summary": "This week's top 3 animal stories feature a lobster, a seagull and a dog.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.\nBut one look at the surveillance video showed them this: The culprit was actually a four-legged pup named Sadi.\nThat's why we're highlighting three animal stories that are sure to make you chuckle.\nAnd finally, the Arlington Police Department in Texas was called in when the local animal shelter got ransacked."}
