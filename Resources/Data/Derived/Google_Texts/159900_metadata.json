While not every Framer shared the Virginia delegation\u2019s theological hypervigilance, there was widespread sympathy for an Amendment-level firewall against religious tyranny within Congress.\n\nBut despite serving as the nation\u2019s primary church-state legal baseline for more than 200 years, the Establishment Clause has been rendered all but silent by the Roberts Court. Just two months prior to its Burwell v. Hobby Lobby ruling, the Court, by an identical 5-4 majority, reversed a lower court decision and found Constitutional the use of explicitly Christian prayers to begin public meetings.\n\nIt\u2019s the System, Stupid\n\nPonder this: The real problem here isn\u2019t Hobby Lobby, the pro-prayer crowd, nor even the five oddly activist Supremes who are doing their level best to breach the Clause.\n\nThe problem is the system. The problem is we long ago became Constitutional autotrons, treating the document as our (mostly) secular bible, beyond reproach and in no way in need of major rethinking.\n\nTo put it theologically, the Constitution is our societal false idol; justifying per Burwell and scores of other portentous cases, a system of government in which nine individuals \u2013 elected by no one, serving at will, and accountable only to their own consciences \u2013 are routinely ceded power over such fundamental matters as political election outcomes, societal morays and personal freedoms.\n\nSeen in the meta, the public prayer and Hobby Lobby rulings are but the latest indicators of systemic governing stagnation, and why it\u2019s time for a grand-scale, long-term review of our foundational document; starting with how we think about it.\n\nBeen There, Done That\n\nIn a CNN World op-ed from June 20, 2011, reporter and author, Fareed Zakaria, points out that the Constitution is a unique and precious guardian of the good; but like any historical text, is subject to complexities unimaginable by those who created and signed it.\n\nZakaria reminds us that calling for a Constitutional review is hardly a new idea. Consider that Jefferson, et al, were themselves working off an existing, broadly revered document: \u201cSuch a plan is not unheard of in American history.\n\nAfter all, the delegates in Philadelphia in 1787 initially meant not to create the Constitution as we now know it, but instead to revise the existing document, the Articles of Confederation. But the delegates saw a disconnect between the document that currently governed them and the needs of the nation, so their solution was to start anew.\u201d\n\nThe First Step\n\nWe should not minimize the enormous damage done as the Establishment Clause is set aside in favor of exclusionary public prayer, and religion-based health care. With these two rulings alone, the Court\u2019s five conservatives have exponentially added to the nation\u2019s long-standing mistreatment of non-Christians and women.\n\nBut as the ideologically-driven decisions continue to amass, so, too, should appeals for an exploratory, three-branch commission tasked with asking tough questions about the Constitution\u2019s presumed infallibility.\n\nIt\u2019s a first step we can\u2019t afford not to take.\n\nRelated articles", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Article 3", "description": "The failure of the nation to update the Constitution and the structure of government it originally bequeathed to us is at the root of our current political dysfunction. - Larry Sabato, \"A More Perfect Constitution: 23 Proposals to Revitalize Our Constitution and Make America a Fairer Country.\" It's a shame the deep-pocketed theocrats that run Hobby Lobby, Inc. don't go in for a little gambling, because right now they're damn near running the table.
