Darin LaHood of Illinois says constituents have \u201cturned the page\u201d since he was elected to replace former Rep. Aaron Schock, who resigned amid questions over his spending.\n\nLaHood, a 47-year-old Republican, took Schock\u2019s House seat after a special election in September. Since taking office, LaHood hasn\u2019t missed any of the 208 roll call votes the House has taken, including his vote against a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, the Chicago Tribune (http://trib.in/1UiLZrk) reported.\n\n\u201cCongress needs to get serious about reining in our spending,\u201d LaHood said.\n\nSchock, who resigned in March, faced criticism of his global travels and decorating of his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d A federal investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe office is now LaHood\u2019s and has been repainted beige, and adornments include college pennants and a football helmet.\n\nThe scandal was \u201cdisappointing\u201d for constituents, LaHood said. It reinforced the need, he said, to be surrounded by good mentors and smart people who \u201caren\u2019t afraid to tell you no.\u201d\n\nSchock and LaHood know each from Peoria Republican circles, and LaHood campaigned for Schock when he was running for school board in 2001. LaHood said Schock is bright and articulate and worked hard for the district, and that his resignation was the best decision \u201cfor his future and the people of the district.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways, I have sympathy for what happened to Congressman Schock,\u201d LaHood said.\n\nLaHood\u2019s father, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, represented the central and western Illinois district for 14 years. He frequently hears chitchat about his father, and also gets counsel from him.\n\nRay LaHood told his son to stay close to home and true to those who put him in office.\n\n\u201cYou just never go wrong if you do that,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Rep.
