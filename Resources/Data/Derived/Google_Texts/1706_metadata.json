Leto\u2019s game.\n\nFor fourth-year coach Matt Kitchie, Friday night\u2019s 18-15 win against Middleton, which snapped a 46-game on-the-field losing streak (not counting forfeit wins in 2010 and 2011) and earned him his first victory as the Falcons\u2019 leader, the game will always be special.\n\nBut seeing the emotion on the faces of his seniors, who got the first win of their high school careers, that was a moment of pure joy.\n\n\u201cEven though it was one game, that\u2019s the reality, it was just one game,\u201d Kitchie said. \u201cBut for these kids, it was our one game, and I hate that it has taken this long, but it was that one game for our kids and that\u2019s the greatest thing for me.\u201d\n\nWith four seniors who have played all four years, and another four or five whom Kitchie said have worked through eligibility issues but were always there for practices, the win is something they will never forget.\n\nKitchie said he has faced a unique set of obstacles at Leto, and he and his coaches have made it about winning in small ways rather than on the scoreboard, but Friday\u2019s victory proved all the previous hardships were worth the effort.\n\n\u201cWe have seniors who have been with us for all four years and not on JV, not on varsity sniffed victory and they never quit,\u201d Kitchie said. \u201cIt was a moment of joy, and it was unbelievable to be a part of just for those kids.\u201d\n\nKitchie said the game also meant something to the community around Leto, and as the team bus returned from Middleton, the players were met by a host of athletes from the school\u2019s other programs.\n\n\u201cTo me, it is about our community and not just the football team,\u201d Kitchie said. \u201cWhen we got back to the school, the parking lot was filled with baseball players, soccer players, and really it was a community win and not just a football win. The kids were excited for each other, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s growth key for Bulls\n\nFirst-year Bloomingdale coach Brian Surcy, who served as a Bulls assistant before being promoted, said he has seen a big leap in the abilities of junior quarterback Isaiah McIntyre.\n\nSurcy said it has been McIntyre\u2019s growth off the field and his dedication to working on his skills in practice that have shone through.\n\nThe quarterback has led the Bulls to a four-game winning streak and has Bloomingdale (6-1) in the playoff hunt with two district games left.\n\n\u201cOver the last two weeks we\u2019ve had some talks and I\u2019ve let him know that we are going to go as far as his will wants us to go,\u201d Surcy said. \u201cHe\u2019s really taken that to heart. He has matured leaps and bounds on the field, but what he\u2019s really making progress at now is just becoming a much more young man off the field.\u201d\n\nSurcy said Bulls quarterbacks coach David Grant has helped hone McIntyre\u2019s abilities and that the coaches are seeing the consistency needed for future success.\n\n\u201cI think that all this work with our quarterback coach has really helped him improve,\u201d Surcy said. \u201cFirst of all, Isaiah is a special player, competitive as (heck) and has a desire to lead this team.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre has thrown 11 touchdown passes the past two games and added three rushing scores and a receiving TD during the Bulls\u2019 four straight wins. With three regular-season games to play, the Bulls already have matched the school record for wins in a season (6-4 last season).\n\nNext up for the Bulls is a big district game at Newsome. Both teams (along with Wharton, which Bloomingdale faces in two weeks) are 2-1 in district play, with Plant leading at 3-0.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking anywhere further than Newsome,\u201d Surcy said. \u201cThat is our one and only focus on a very tough Newsome team.\u201d\n\nDefense adjusts, rolls in big win\n\nArmwood\u2019s defense had a game plan against Lennard \u2014 protect underneath and allow its secondary to match up against the Longhorns\u2019 deep passing attack.\n\nOn a few occasions, the plan allowed Lennard freshman quarterback Devin Black to find room to run, as he posted gains of 19, 9 and 6 yards.\n\nHowever, that was short-lived as Armwood\u2019s defense tightened and relentlessly pressured Black, forcing a number of hurries, recording a pair of interceptions and posting seven sacks in a 56-0 win.\n\n\u201cWe had to wait, back up and get back on the ball,\u201d Armwood\u2019s Aaron Covington said. \u201cWe just had to fix our mistakes early, and we did that.\u201d\n\nCovington had the difficult job of covering one of the area\u2019s most dynamic receivers in Diontae Johnson, who entered the game averaging more than 100 yards receiving per game. Johnson, Black\u2019s favorite target, was held to four catches for 76 yards. Covington had a fumble recovery and a fourth-quarter interception.\n\n\u201cWe had to shut him down and not let (Johnson) get loose with a lot of open space around him,\u201d Covington said. \u201cWe were really not focusing on the deep balls, we were focused on shutting down those screens where he has all that open field.\u201d\n\nSeffner Chr. rescinds forfeit\n\nSeffner Christian rescinded its forfeit win against Lakeland Santa Fe Catholic, a school grieving after the death of Gil Kromer.\n\nThe Crusaders were scheduled to play Santa Fe Catholic on Oct. 10, but the game was moved to Oct. 11 after about 25 students and employees at Santa Fe came down with a stomach virus. The game was then postponed before Santa Fe forfeited.\n\nKromer, 17, a starting tackle, died the next day at Tampa General Hospital of what was suspected to be bacterial meningitis.\n\n\u201cOut of respect to their team and school, we thought it was the least we could do,\u201d Seffner Christian athletics director Andy Holmes said.\n\nTop performers\n\nDelvin Austin, King \u2013 The junior had a pair of defensive touchdowns in the Lions\u2019 28-10 win over Jefferson, taking an interception 50 yards in the second quarter and scooping up a fumble and returning it 76 yards in the third.\n\nDerrick Baity, Plant \u2013 The senior scored on two long pass plays in the first three minutes of a 48-9 win over Newsome and finished with 200 all-purpose yards. He also had a fourth-quarter interception return for a score.\n\nLogan Crouse, Bloomingdale \u2013 The 6-foot-6 wideout caught four touchdown passes from Isaiah McIntyre in a 38-14 win over Riverview, including one in the final minute of the second quarter and another just nine seconds into the second half.\n\nAnthony Hollingshed, East Bay \u2013 The sophomore had a breakout performance, rushing for 235 yards and two touchdowns in a 21-7 win against Strawberry Crest.\n\nQuentin Poteralski, Steinbrenner \u2013 The senior passed for 218 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 133 rushing yards and two 50-plus-yard scoring runs in a 55-40 win over Wiregrass Ranch.\n\nTribune reporter Nick Williams contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 18 Oct 2014 20:20:13 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 One game.
