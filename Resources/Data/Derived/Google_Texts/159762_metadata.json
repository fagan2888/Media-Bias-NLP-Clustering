That recognition prompted a group of female scientists in the United States to form the Alliance of Women Alzheimer\u2019s Researchers (AWARE) to foster collaborative studies, professional networking and more gender-specific research.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, women are moving into this sense of, \u2018If not us, who?\u2019 \u201d said Roberta Diaz Brinton, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Pharmacy who helped organize AWARE, a professional interest group within the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nThe group, which has about 150 members (including a few men) originated at an international conference held by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in 2012. The women met a year later.\n\nBut the idea had been brewing for some time, as female researchers \u2014 aware of the special impact Alzheimer\u2019s has on women and the need to conduct gender-specific research \u2014 attended symposiums featuring mostly male scientists.\n\nRecommended: Is Costa Rica an affordable option for expats and medical tourists with Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\n\u201cThere was no one event that led to the formation of AWARE,\u201d Brinton said. \u201cIt was instead a steady drip of inequality over many years that reached a tipping point. It was more like many of us \u2014 who had been working 24/7 for decades \u2014 suddenly and collectively looked up from the bench, from the clinic, and saw a world that was surprising and perplexing to us. The hypothesis that merit and excellence would earn appropriate leadership positions was not supported by the data.\u201d\n\nAmid a growing recognition that diseases and treatments can follow different courses in people of different races or sexes, the women wanted to shift the focus of research, too.\n\n\u201cWe did also very much want to advance the science of gender-based differences in Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d said Suzanne Craft, a professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University\u2019s School of Medicine who helped organize the group.\n\nCraft said she still recalls feeling unintentionally left out by the head of a laboratory who organized pickup basketball games with the male graduate students in his lab. Sexism, benign or not, has influenced the direction of Alzheimer\u2019s research, she said. But the agenda has begun to change.\n\n\u201cFinding ways to collaborate, finding mentors to tell you what your options are, finding ways to actually think about doing gender research that maybe has not been the focus for so long \u2014 those are all the opportunities we\u2019re trying to create,\u201d said Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and a founder of the group.\n\n\u00a9 2014, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women arguably have been hit hardest by Alzheimer's disease: Two-thirds of those with the dementia-causing disease are women, and women serve more often than men as their caregivers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tico Times", "description": "Women arguably have been hit hardest by Alzheimer's disease: Two-thirds of those with the dementia-causing disease are women, and women serve more often than men as their caregivers.", "title": "Female Alzheimer's researchers band together", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LaCasaSol-1000x656.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-03T22:20:22-06:00", "url": "http://www.ticotimes.net/2014/09/04/female-alzheimers-researchers-band-together", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ticotimes.net", "description": "Women arguably have been hit hardest by Alzheimer's disease: Two-thirds of those with the dementia-causing disease are women, and women serve more often than men as their caregivers.", "creator": "@dboddiger", "url": "http://www.ticotimes.net/2014/09/04/female-alzheimers-researchers-band-together", "image": {"src": "http://www.ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LaCasaSol-1000x656.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LaCasaSol.jpg"}, "title": "Female Alzheimer's researchers band together", "site": "@theticotimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": "pupstar"}, "article": {"section": "Expat Living", "tag": "retirees", "published_time": "2014-09-04T00:05:39-06:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T22:20:22-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Yet despite inroads by female researchers, Alzheimer\u2019s study has been dominated by men.\nThat recognition prompted a group of female scientists in the United States to form the Alliance of Women Alzheimer\u2019s Researchers (AWARE) to foster collaborative studies, professional networking and more gender-specific research.\nRecommended: Is Costa Rica an affordable option for expats and medical tourists with Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\nSexism, benign or not, has influenced the direction of Alzheimer\u2019s research, she said.\nWomen arguably have been hit hardest by Alzheimer\u2019s disease: Two-thirds of those with the dementia-causing disease are women, and women serve more often than men as their caregivers."}
