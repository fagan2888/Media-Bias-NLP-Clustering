Starting in 2018, Obamacare will impose a 40% excise tax on employer-paid health insurance premiums above a governmentally imposed limit that does not keep up with medical inflation. Consequently, insurance companies will be forced to impose increasingly severe restraints on policy-holders\u2019 access to diagnostic tests and treatment\u2014limits that will make it harder to get often-expensive treatments essential to combatting life-threatening illnesses.\n\n\u201cKeeping employers from spending relatively little more to buy better insurance impacts us all, not just their employees,\u201d stated Mary Kay Culp, executive director of Kansans for Life. \u201cWhen those who can afford to spend more on health insurance are prevented from doing so, it severely dampens the costly research and development that gives those at all income levels access to innovative drugs and treatments that improve the ability to save lives and improve health.\u201d\n\nExcluding Insurers from Exchanges. Under Obamacare, consumers using the exchanges may only choose plans offered by insurers who do not allow their customers to spend what government bureaucrats deem an \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d amount for their health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing most exchange plans deny access to top specialists and medical centers,\u201d Culp noted, \u201cbut few reports explain this is because insurers who provide greater access to care are excluded from the exchanges.\u201d\n\nMedicare Limits. Most senior citizens know that Obamacare will cut half a trillion dollars for Medicare over a decade, but they may not be aware of the law\u2019s provision allowing Washington bureaucrats to prevent them from making up the Medicare shortfall with their own funds by limiting their right to spend their own money to obtain insurance through Medicare Advantage less likely to limit treatments that could save their lives.\n\nIndependent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB is directed to recommend measures to limit spending on health care to a growth rate below medical inflation \u2013 not just for Medicare, but also for all private, nongovernmental health care spending. The federal Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is then authorized to implement these measures by placing limits on the treatments providers may give their patients by imposing so-called \u201cquality and efficiency standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare authorizes Washington bureaucrats to create one uniform, national standard of care that is designed to limit what private citizens are allowed to spend to save their own lives,\u201d stated Culp. \u201cWe are convinced most Americans do not believe that the government should limit the right of Americans to use their own money for health insurance that is adequate to save their lives. We commend Senator Roberts for his bill and his consistent leadership to end Obamacare\u2019s rationing. \u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Obamacare, Washington bureaucrats can dictate one uniform standard of health care that is designed to limit what private citizens are allowed to spend, with our own money, to save our own lives,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThis is not right.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Senator Roberts introduced the Restoring Access to Medication Act, which repeals the provision of Obamacare limiting a patients\u2019 right to purchase over-the-counter products with their own money. He also introduced the Four Rationers Repeal Act, which repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board; it repeals the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center; it repeals the changes made to the Preventive Services Task Force; and it makes sure any comparative effectiveness research is used by the doctor and the patient, not coverage providers or CMS, to determine the best care for patients.\n\nSenator Roberts is an outspoken opponent of Obamacare. Senator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Finance and is the ranking member of its Subcommittee on Health Care. He is a member of the Senate Committee on Health,", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Congressional Bill Would Repeal Obamacare's Death Panels, Health Care Rationing", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "New legislation introduced today in the U.S. Senate would repeal some of the health care rationing components of Obamacare, including the controversial death pa", "title": "New Congressional Bill Would Repeal Obamacare\u2019s Death Panels, Health Care Rationing", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/04/01/new-congressional-bill-would-repeal-obamacares-death-panels-health-care-rationing/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/elderlypatient.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "new congressional bill would repeal obamacare\\'s death panels,health care rationing", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde256\"", "article_summary": "New legislation introduced today in the U.S. Senate would repeal some of the health care rationing components of Obamacare, including the controversial death panels.\nIPAB is directed to recommend measures to limit spending on health care to a growth rate below medical inflation \u2013 not just for Medicare, but also for all private, nongovernmental health care spending.\nSenator Roberts is a senior member of the Senate Committee on Finance and is the ranking member of its Subcommittee on Health Care.\n\u201cObamacare has made many Americans fearful that cost-cutting and rationing of care will limit their options for health care at a time when they are vulnerable\u2013when they are sick or battling a life threatening condition,\u201d Roberts said.\nWe commend Senator Roberts for his bill and his consistent leadership to end Obamacare\u2019s rationing."}
