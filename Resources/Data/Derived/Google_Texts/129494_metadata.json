Groups will meet at the Brentwood Library (on the corner of Concord Road and Knox Valley Drive) to register for the 9 a.m. cleanup.\n\nGear such as trash bags, safety vests and trash-removal supplies will be provided by Keep Williamson Beautiful. Volunteers will be removing debris and collecting trash along the river banks throughout the day.\n\nRotarians will be on hand to provide assistance and help dispose trash at the end of the cleanup.\n\n\"Members of our Rotary Club have been concerned about the health of the Little Harpeth River, so we decided to orchestrate this effort in 2006 and have been doing it each year since,\" Brentwood Noon Rotary said in a statement. \"This service project has a direct benefit to all Brentwood citizens as well as our neighbors downstream.\u201d\n\nInterested volunteers should contact Skip Heibert at heibski@gmail.com.\n\nReach Collin Czarnecki at 615-852-1130 or on Twitter at @CollinReports.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1XT8Iet", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Brentwood Noon Rotary Club is seeking out volunteers for the 11th annual Little Harpeth River Cleanup on Jan. 30.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The Brentwood Noon Rotary Club is seeking out volunteers for the 11th annual Little Harpeth River Cleanup on Jan. 30.", "title": "Volunteer for Little Harpeth River Cleanup", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/brentwood/2015/12/06/volunteer-little-harpeth-river-cleanup/76796558/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Brentwood Noon Rotary Club is seeking out volunteers for the 11th annual Little Harpeth River Cleanup on Jan. 30.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb2d418db86e778b52448bd4e90624101b84e1ed/c=24-0-1597-1573&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg", "title": "Volunteer for Little Harpeth River Cleanup", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Neighborhoods", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Neighborhoods", "title": "Volunteer for Little Harpeth River Cleanup", "author": "Collin Czarnecki", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/williamson/brentwood", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e698ce48d9d1704e432ebf44b5dca24598924d1/c=1219-0-2399-1573/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6bb737090638c944cca41fe52d7769c0141b5b2f/c=24-0-1597-1573/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b17993e404f9090d806cfd97f4f7c8c790e1fed/c=154-0-2246-1573/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e16af90e5cc4738f71d3ae942076dff00888979/c=0-218-2399-1573&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-06T09:05:22.073000-06:00", "shorthed": "Volunteer for Little Harpeth Cleanup", "articleid": 76796558, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10db6294f8c33cf1050354481a89721781def5b5/c=0-218-2399-1573/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f981b56eedabd930c9d4627acc501dc5bada864a/c=0-0-881-1573/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Nashville/Nashville/635848540182921898-nasdc5-5dixniz2us2zhw9h4ws-original.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/collinmichaelmedia"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Little Harpeth River cleanup,Brentwood Rotary,Brentwood Noon Rotary Club,Harpeth River"}, "article_summary": "Locals looking to get their hands dirty for a good cause can team up on the Little Harpeth River next month.\nThe Brentwood Noon Rotary Club is seeking out volunteers when it holds the 11th annual Little Harpeth River Cleanup on Saturday, Jan. 30.\n(Photo: File / Jae S.
