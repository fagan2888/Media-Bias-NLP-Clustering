The video will air across digital platforms and television stations in Wisconsin ahead of its primary on April 5. It\u2019s part of a $500,000 buy and will replace a previously released ad targeting Kasich.\n\nThe video starts with President Obama praising Kasich for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt ends with an image of Kasich with text that reads \"John Kasich and Barack Obama Expanding Obamacare. Wrong for Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nKasich has strongly defended expanding Medicaid in Ohio, saying it has saved lives and money and brought tax dollars back to his state.\n\n\u201cPeople say, was that a hard decision, to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said on Monday during a town hall-style meeting he held in La Crosse, Wisconsin. \"No, it was a piece of cake. If I got a chance to help the mentally ill, the drug-addicted, the working poor to get up on their feet, why would I say no?\u201d\n\n\"President Obama himself praised John Kasich\u2019s expansion of Obamacare, which this new ad highlights. It is a disaster and John Kasich, despite significant opposition in his state, decided to expand it. In the meantime, Ted Cruz fought in the Senate to dismantle Obamacare and promises to repeal every word if elected to the White House,\u201d said Chip Roy, executive director of Trusted Leadership PAC.\n\nThe ad is the latest shot in the growing battle between Kasich and Cruz as the two presidential candidates seek to be the ultimate beneficiary of the anti-Trump vote. On Friday, Kasich condemned an ad released by a super PAC supporting him, New Day For America, that depicts Cruz as a liar with a growing Pinocchio nose that grows so long it wraps around his neck like a noose. Kasich in particular took issue with the ad referring to Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d the nickname Trump has given Cruz and used repeatedly on the trail. Super PACS and candidates cannot communicate directly.\n\n\"I don\u2019t run that organization but I\u2019m expressing my displeasure and they are going to - we can\u2019t communicate with them directly but I don\u2019t like that word and I told them that, and I said it last night on TV and I would hope that they don\u2019t use that word and take it down,\u201d Kasich said in Hershey, Penn.\n\nThe same super PAC responsible for the Pinocchio ad also filed a complaint against Trusted Leadership PAC earlier this week, saying that a previously released ad targeting Kasich \"falsely claims that John Kasich has accepted 'hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros.\u201d Trusted Leadership PAC has denied the pro-Kasich PAC's claims and said that the \"Pinocchio\" ad targeting Cruz is untruthful.\n\nABC News\u2019 Ben Gittleson and Ines de la Cuetara contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Cruz Super PAC Takes Aim at Kasich With New Ad", "description": "Cruz Super PAC Takes Aim at Kasich With New Ad", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-super-pac-takes-aim-kasich-ad/story?id=38097111", "type": "article", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Trusted Leadership PAC, a pro Ted Cruz super PAC, is strengthening its attack of John Kasich with the release of a new ad in Wisconsin as both Kasich and Cruz work to siphon away as many delegates as possible from Donald Trump.\nThe 30-second video, called \u201cKasich BFF\u201d depicts the Ohio governor as...", "title": "Cruz Super PAC Takes Aim at Kasich With New Ad"}, "Date": "2016-04-03", "twitter": {"description": "Trusted Leadership PAC, a pro Ted Cruz super PAC, is strengthening its attack of John Kasich with the release of a new ad in Wisconsin as both Kasich and Cruz work to siphon away as many delegates as possible from Donald Trump.\nThe 30-second video, called \u201cKasich BFF\u201d depicts the Ohio governor as...", "title": "Cruz Super PAC Takes Aim at Kasich With New Ad", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-super-pac-takes-aim-kasich-ad/story?id=38097111", "image": {"width": 150, "height": 116}, "creator": "@jesshop23", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,38097111", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,38097111", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-super-pac-takes-aim-kasich-ad/story?id=38097111"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-03", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,38097111", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-super-pac-takes-aim-kasich-ad/story?id=38097111"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-super-pac-takes-aim-kasich-ad/story?id=38097111", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,38097111", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2016-04-03 12:11:57", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Donald Trump, GOP Presidential race, Republican presidential candidate, super PAC, Trusted Leadership, New Day for America, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Donald Trump, GOP Presidential race, Republican presidential candidate, super PAC, Trusted Leadership, New Day for America"}, "article_summary": "Trusted Leadership PAC, a pro Ted Cruz super PAC, is strengthening its attack of John Kasich with the release of a new ad in Wisconsin as both Kasich and Cruz work to siphon away as many delegates as possible from Donald Trump.\nIt ends with an image of Kasich with text that reads \"John Kasich and Barack Obama Expanding Obamacare.\nThe same super PAC responsible for the Pinocchio ad also filed a complaint against Trusted Leadership PAC earlier this week, saying that a previously released ad targeting Kasich \"falsely claims that John Kasich has accepted 'hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros.\u201d Trusted Leadership PAC has denied the pro-Kasich PAC's claims and said that the \"Pinocchio\" ad targeting Cruz is untruthful.\nIt is a disaster and John Kasich, despite significant opposition in his state, decided to expand it.\nKasich in particular took issue with the ad referring to Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d the nickname Trump has given Cruz and used repeatedly on the trail."}
