Here\u2019s a look back at some that occurred in the Riverhead area.\n\n\u2022 Hospital merger announced\n\nAt the end of March, Peconic Bay Medical Center announced that its board of directors had unanimously agreed to enter into an alliance with the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, the 14th largest health care system in the country.\n\nThe decision came after two years of negotiations between PBMC and both North Shore-LIJ and Stony Brook Medicine, the other health provider PBMC had considered merging with.\n\nThe East End\u2019s other two hospitals, Southampton Hospital and Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, both decided to merge with Stony Brook, thus ending the East End Health Alliance, which the three East End hospitals had formed in 2008.\n\nPBMC president and chief executive officer Andrew Mitchell said the merger with North Shore-LIJ, which was subsequently approved by state regulators, will give PBMC resources and funding needed to improve medical care in its service area.\n\n\u201cMy mantra since 2001 has been, \u2018How do we convert this into a regional medical center that has all of the major services that the population that lives here needs?\u201d Mr. Mitchell said in March.\n\nThe agreement is expected to be finalized in mid-January.\n\n\u2022 PBMC expands west on Route 58\n\nIn an effort to relieve emergency room congestion at its main campus on Roanoke Avenue, Peconic Bay Medical Center is building a new hospital annex building at the Gateway Plaza on Route 58, which also is home to Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture and Walmart.\n\nDubbed an Urgent Care and Diagnostic Imaging center, the 3,500-square-foot building was approved by the Riverhead Town Planning Board in September.\n\nA 1,945-square-foot expansion of the building is also permitted.\n\nThe hospital is trying to shift minor injuries and ailments away from the ER at its main campus and into the new building, according to Mr. Mitchell, who said the hospital will need to educate people to go to the annex with minor ailments, since state law prohibits them from not treating patients who go to the emergency room, even if it\u2019s for something minor.\n\n\u201cClearly, some of the patients in emergency room settings can be treated in non-emergency settings,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.\n\nMr. Mitchell said PBMC also is in the process of applying to the state health department to become an area trauma center for the East End, a designation that would mean that many patients who are currently transported to Stony Brook University Hospital from the East End following trauma incidents such as car accidents could eventually come to PBMC for that treatment.\n\nHe said space in the emergency department at PBMC\u2019s main campus is being eyed as space for the trauma center. The process of gaining that designation from the state takes about two years, he said.\n\n\u2022 Medical marijuana comes to Riverhead\n\nAt first, it looked like the Town of Riverhead might get its first medical marijuana growing facility, with one proposed for Baiting Hollow and another for the Enterprise Park at Calverton.\n\nBut instead, New York State approved a medical marijuana dispensary for the town.\n\nNeither plan went over well at first.\n\nIn late May, Jack and Kurt Van Wetering of Ivy Acres in Baiting Hollow went public with their proposal to grow medical marijuana in a greenhouse off Edwards Avenue. But that plan ran into heavy criticism from neighbors, who said they didn\u2019t oppose medical marijuana, which New York State legalized in 2014, but they did oppose the location, which they said was too near homes.\n\nRiverhead Town officials also wouldn\u2019t support the proposal. The state passed on Ivy Acres\u2019 application anyway, instead approving a plan from Columbia Care that proposed growing marijuana upstate and using the vacant Blockbuster Video site on Route 58 as a dispensary.\n\nThat plan was first met with opposition from town officials, who said it was too close to the high school and suggested a one-year moratorium to determine where medical marijuana dispensaries would be best located in town.\n\nBut an overwhelming majority of speakers at a public hearing urged the Town Board to ditch the moratorium, with many saying medical marijuana cured painful conditions they or someone they knew had.\n\nColumbia Care agreed to move its dispensary to an East Main Street building that houses Eastern Long Island Hematology/Oncology \u2014 which brought more pushback from residents near that location.\n\nBut as of now, the facility is scheduled to open in early 2016. It will be the only one in Suffolk County.\n\n\u2022 The demise of Health Republic\n\nHealth Republic New York was one of 23 Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans \u2014 better known as CO-OPs \u2014 created through the Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d), which was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance.\n\nHealth Republic began selling insurance plans in October 2013 and, for a time, was biggest of the nation\u2019s CO-OPs, with more than 200,000 people insured in New York.\n\nBut by 2015, things weren\u2019t looking so good for Health Republic. In fact, things couldn\u2019t have gotten much worse than they did.\n\nIn late September, the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services announced that Health Republic was not financially stable enough to offer insurance in 2016.\n\nThen less than a month later, the DFS pulled the plug on the insurer even faster than previously expected, shutting the insurance provider down by Nov. 30, rather than the end of the year.\n\nThis sent hundreds of individuals and small-business owners scrambling to find a new insurance company for themselves or for their employees.\n\nThe DFS said a review of Health Republic\u2019s finances \u201cfound that the company\u2019s financial condition is substantially worse than the company previously reported in its filings.\u201d\n\nPaul Connor, CEO of Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, said the Affordable Care Act allowed more people to have insurance, but the downside has been that most of the more affordable plans have high deductibles that some people have found hard to afford.\n\n\u201cWhat that means us is that individuals have a much higher deductible to be able to meet before the real insurance kicks in,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWhat hospitals have been seeing nationwide is that those people with high deductibles, a fairly high percentage of them end up being not being able to pay, and it turns into a bad debt. So that has the hospital industry very concerned.\u201d\n\nMr. Connor said ELIH has about $380,000 in unpaid bills from Health Republic \u201cthat we don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to get.\u201d\n\nStatewide, he said, hospitals collectively are owed about $170 million by Health Republic, and individual physicians are owed between $10 million and $30 million.\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhoto: PBMC\u2019s urgent care and diagnostic imaging center in the Walmart Shopping Center was approved in September.
