Bowe Bergdahl, Video, Media News, News, Politics News\n\nWhile speaking with former Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked if executing Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl should be \u201cat least on the table\u201d once the former POW returns home.\n\nBefore pondering whether or not the just-released prisoner should be killed, however, Wallace asked Mukasey to weigh in on whether or not Bergdahl is guilty of desertion, as many conservatives and some of Bergdahl\u2019s former platoon-mates have said.\n\n\u201cFrom what you know so far, is Bergdahl guilty of leaving his base without permission, being absent from his post?\u201d Wallace asked Mukasey. \u201cIs he guilty of being a deserter, is he guilty of being a defector? And after five years of captivity \u2014 some people initially said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s enough\u2019 \u2014 should he face the appropriate punishment if he is found guilty?\u201d\n\nMukasey refrained from rendering a definitive judgment and reiterated that Bowe\u2019s guilt should be proven before discussions of punishment were justified. Still, he said, \u201cDesertion is a very serious offense. It carries a penalty \u2014 if it\u2019s done in wartime \u2014 that includes possibly the death penalty. At the end of World War II, we executed a U.S. soldier, in January of 1945 for desertion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace wants to know if killing the rescued POW should be \"on the table\" VIDEO", "title": "Fox News wonders: Should the military execute Bowe Bergdahl?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace wants to know if killing the rescued POW should be \"on the table\" VIDEO", "title": "Fox News wonders: Should the military execute Bowe Bergdahl?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/fox_news_wonders_should_the_military_execute_bowe_bergdahl/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/captured-soldier-bergdahls-journey.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace wants to know if killing the rescued POW should be \"on the table\" VIDEO", "title": "Fox News wonders: Should the military execute Bowe Bergdahl?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/captured-soldier-bergdahls-journey.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Afghanistan War, Bowe Bergdahl, Chris Wallace, Fox News, Fox News Sunday, Michael Mukasey, Sgt.
