The first baby born in Colorado in 2016 arrived while New Year’s Day revelers were still blowing party horns and shooting off fireworks.

The official time that Cora Menges was born at UCHealth’s Memorial Hospital North in Colorado Springs was 12:00 a.m.

Proud father Micah Menges, 32, said Friday that Cora’s mother, Hannah, and the baby are doing well.

Cora has one older brother, Ezra, 22 months.

Cora was 7 pounds, 10 ounces and was 21 inches long. She is healthy.

Menges said they don’t have any expectations for their daughter, except one: “She better be a Packers fan,” said the Minnesota native.

The thought that Cora would be the first child born in Colorado in 2016 never entered their minds until moments after the birth and they looked at the clock.

“It’s pretty crazy,” he said.

Hannah Menges had a doctor’s appointment at 8:30 a.m. on New Year’s Eve. She started going into labor at 4 p.m., and Micah drove his wife to the hospital at 8:30 p.m.

The doctor announced the baby was about to come around 11:55 p.m., Menges said.

The couple were still considering 20 possible names as recently as Christmas, the day they decided upon the name, Cora.

The time she was born proves it’s not easy competing for the honor of being the first baby born in 2016.

There’s a lot of pride that goes along with being the hospital where the first baby of the year is born, said Jessica Berry, spokeswoman for University of Colorado Hospital.

The first child of the year at University was a 6-pound, 9-ounce girl, who has three brothers and one sister.

Adanelly Lopez was born at 4:01 a.m., Berry said.
