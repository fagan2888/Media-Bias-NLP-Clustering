Scott Walker, who just returned from Israel, presumably to beef up his foreign policy chops ahead of a presidential announcement, called Clinton\u2019s policies at State a complete \u201cmess.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust about everywhere that Hillary Clinton has played a role with this president, that part of the world is largely a failure, a mess, because of what we\u2019ve seen from Obama and Clinton,\u201d Walker told Bob Schieffer.\n\nWalker, who has hinted that he will be announcing his candidacy for president in June, blasted the Obama administration for its handling of the drawdown of the Iraq war.\n\n\u201cWe have a place that\u2019s destabilized now because of their quick move in the last few years to get out of Iraq,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker also criticized the administration for being too soft on Iran in constructing a deal to slow its nuclear weapons capability.\n\n\u201cI think if we\u2019re going to have negotiations, we should have them on our terms, not on theirs,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, we need to dismantle the illicit nuclear infrastructure they have.\u201d\n\nRelated: Clinton Wants to Kill Super PACs, Including Hers\n\nDuring an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, announced candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said Clinton would continue the \u201cfailed policies\u201d of the Obama Administration. \u201cThis is not a time for the status quo,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Florida lawmaker, who has been a vocal critic of the administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran, sounded off on the looming framework for a deal.\n\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s new revelations about the deal, it gets worse and worse and worse,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHe also defended President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, saying it was the right move for what we knew at the time.\n\n\u201cHe was dealing with Saddam Hussein. The world is a better place because Saddam Hussein is not there,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt was not a mistake.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Jeb Bush Bumbles, Rubio Seizes a Moment\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush, also a likely presidential contender, set off a firestorm last week for telling Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly that he would have authorized the Iraq war \u201cknowing what we know now.\u201d Bush has backed off that position, saying he misheard the question and would not have favored invading Iraq if the information available now was available then.\n\nRubio\u2019s comments come just days after he gave a high-profile foreign policy speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York in which he argued that the U.S. must aggressively confront Russia, China and other countries that could threaten the U.S.\u2019s position in the world.\n\n\u201cWe simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 a leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nAt the Lincoln Dinner, 11 Republicans who either have announced their White House bids or are expected to announce them soon, took turns pummeling the Obama administration chiefly on foreign policy matters ranging from Iraq, to Iran and the fight to destroy ISIS\n\n\u201cI blame Barack Obama above all else for squandering the gains that were so hard to come by in Iraq,\u201d \u201cSen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said, according to The Hill.\n\nAnd The Washington Post quoted former Sen. Rick Santorum as lambasting Obama foreign policy, saying his views could be boiled down into four words: \u201cIran, enemy. Israel, friend.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Republicans are focusing so heavily on attacking the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy and tying Clinton to it. Recent public opinion polls have consistently shown that Americans are unsatisfied with U.S. foreign policy.\n\nA February CNN/ORC poll revealed that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of Obama\u2019s handling of foreign affairs and 54 percent disapprove of how the administration is dealing with terrorism.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If the Sunday morning talk shows and the GOP\u2019s Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines on Saturda", "title": "GOP Hopefuls Reveal Major Line of Attack against Clinton", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/17/GOP-Hopefuls-Reveal-Major-Line-Attack-against-Clinton", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04242012_Marco_Rubio_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/17/GOP-Hopefuls-Reveal-Major-Line-Attack-against-Clinton", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04242012_Marco_Rubio_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If the Sunday morning talk shows and the GOP\u2019s Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines on Saturda", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c78\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvery time there\u2019s new revelations about the deal, it gets worse and worse and worse,\u201d Rubio said.\nRecent public opinion polls have consistently shown that Americans are unsatisfied with U.S. foreign policy.\nIsrael, friend.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising that Republicans are focusing so heavily on attacking the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy and tying Clinton to it.\nAnd The Washington Post quoted former Sen.
