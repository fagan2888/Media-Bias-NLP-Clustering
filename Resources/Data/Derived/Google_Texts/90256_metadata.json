Prosecutors and defense attorneys called witnesses for only a handful of the filings. Denver District Judge John W. Madden must rule on about 200 motions before summonses are sent out in January.\n\nLewis, 24, faces 16 counts \u2014 including first-degree murder, arson and robbery \u2014 in the attack at Fero\u2019s Bar and Grill that left five people dead in October 2012. The case marks the first time since 2001 that Denver prosecutors have pursued the death penalty.\n\nThe last time a Denver jury sentenced a defendant to death was in 1986.\n\nDuring a hearing Tuesday, attorneys discussed the timeline for jury selection and the trial.\n\nAttorneys will begin questioning potential jurors in January.\n\nOpening statements are scheduled to begin March 16, according to an order made public in July. Madden said he expects the trial, including the potential penalty phase, to take four weeks.\n\nTo be safe, he set aside six weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, defense attorneys argued the cellphone Lewis allegedly used the night of the attack was obtained improperly by investigators. As a result, they say any information obtained from the phone should be excluded from trial.\n\nDenver police Detective Mike Martinez said Lewis\u2019 girlfriend \u2014 who was paying for the phone \u2014 gave the phone to police after Lewis was arrested Oct. 17, 2012.\n\nAuthorities say Lewis used the phone the night of the attack. He allegedly sent his co-defendants, brothers Joseph and Lynell Hill, a coded text message, \u201cG-4,\u201d which meant the plan to rob the bar was good to go.\n\nThe Hill brothers have accepted plea agreements in exchange for testifying against Lewis. Joseph Hill was sentenced to life in prison without parole, and Lynell was sentenced to 70 years.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Judge wants 600 potential jurors for Denver death penalty case", "title": "Judge wants 600 potential jurors for Denver death penalty case", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/12/judge-wants-600-potential-jurors-for-denver-death-penalty-case/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20121017__feros_bar_grill_denver_arson_murder_investigationp1.jpg", "height": 375}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20121017__feros_bar_grill_denver_arson_murder_investigationp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-12T17:13:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:17:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0852\"", "article_summary": "The last time a Denver jury sentenced a defendant to death was in 1986.\nA jury pool of at least 600 people will be assembled for the death penalty case against the man accused of stabbing five people to death in a Denver bar.\nThe case marks the first time since 2001 that Denver prosecutors have pursued the death penalty.\nDenver District Judge John W.
