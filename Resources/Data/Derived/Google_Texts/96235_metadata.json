Today, public sector outsourcing deals account for two-thirds of the annual contract value in the market overall.\n\nMuch of the activity is happening in the U.S., which consists almost entirely of information technology work and driven in large part by Department of Defense spending, according to ISG. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, contending with the changes mandated by the Affordable Care Act, are also significant users of third-party IT services.\n\nThese federal agencies are also poised to add on more business process services in the future as well \u201cas technology improves and the workforce ages,\u201d says John Keppel, president EMEA and Asia with ISG. Public sector agencies in the U.K. and Australia have already adopted business process outsourcing on a much wider basis, according to ISG. Both countries have increased their BPO activity over the past year in areas such as taxation, pensions, asset registration, e-governance and benefits administration.\n\n[ Related: Obama\u2019s big data project targets community improvement ]\n\nIn recent years, public sector outsourcing contracts have gotten longer in duration as well at a time when private sector deals have gotten shorter. Both have converged to average of about 3.2 years. \u201cThe federal government is pursuing outsourcing in a number of areas where agencies had traditionally created in-house technology functions in the past,\u201d says Keppel. \u201cPrivate sector terms have been growing shorter, driven by specialization and the flexibility that those deals provide to clients.\u201d\n\nShared services environments drive longer outsourcing deals\n\nA new push from the U.S. government for shared services environments (particularly in back-office functions like IT, accounting and finance) is another contributing factor to the longer deals. \u201cShared services offers the possibility of substantial budget savings. This dynamic drew private sector companies toward outsourcing and government managers, faced with growing pressure to increase efficiency, are being encouraged \u2014 even forced \u2014 to look at shared services as a smart way to approach this,\u201d Keppel says.\n\n[ Related: Obama taps former security advisor, IBM CEO to lead cyber panel ]\n\nBut the shared services mandate has ruffled feathers and introduced significant technological challenges. \u201cThe move to shared services hasn\u2019t been easy, as it runs counter to a long history of each agency establishing its own IT functions,\u201d says Keppel. \u201cImplementing shared services requires significant system integration and data migrations. In addition, many agencies have had to maintain legacy systems they thought they would be able to retire. Agencies have been successful in identifying the lowest hanging fruit, such as consolidating systems within their own agency.\u201d\n\n[ Related: 5 years into the \u2018cloud-first policy\u2019 CIOs still struggling ]\n\nAt the same time, federal CIOs are working aggressively to adopt cloud applications, roll out mobile technologies and support big data projects, for which they\u2019ll need the experience, efficiency, and capabilities of private sector providers. \u201cMany agencies\u2019 budgets remain flat, they are understaffed, and face a skills gap to pursue cloud, mobile and big data technologies,\u201d says Keppel. \u201cOutsourcing providers possess the expertise, unique skill sets, and service delivery capabilities to help agencies launch these projects quickly and cost effectively.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cio.com/article/3068221/outsourcing/public-sector-embraces-bigger-longer-outsourcing-deals.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/10/outsourcing-thinkstock-100528175-primary.idge.jpg", "site": "@CIOonline", "card": "summary", "description": "Public sector outsourcing deals are growing as the U.S. government seeks shared services efficiencies."}, "parsely-author": "Stephanie Overby", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "sailthru.tags": "outsourcing,managed-service-providers,it-industry,stephanie-overby,newsanalysis,medium", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-10T12:31:00Z", "parsely-link": "http://www.cio.com/article/3068221/outsourcing/public-sector-embraces-bigger-longer-outsourcing-deals.html", "author": "Stephanie Overby", "parsely-title": "Public sector embraces bigger, longer outsourcing deals", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core1.staticworld.net/images/article/2014/10/outsourcing-thinkstock-100528175-small.idge.jpg", "description": "Public sector outsourcing deals are growing as the U.S. government seeks shared services efficiencies.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-10T05:31-05:00", "fb": {"app_id": 129182073794488}, "date": "2016-05-10", "parsely-section": "Outsourcing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "CIO", "description": "Public sector outsourcing deals are growing as the U.S. government seeks shared services efficiencies.", "title": "Public sector embraces bigger, longer outsourcing deals", "url": "http://www.cio.com/article/3068221/outsourcing/public-sector-embraces-bigger-longer-outsourcing-deals.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/10/outsourcing-thinkstock-100528175-primary.idge.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "type: newsanalysis,source: cio,original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://core4.staticworld.net/images/article/2014/10/outsourcing-thinkstock-100528175-primary.idge.jpg", "google-site-verification": "kgXSqlEuYT_m_uwWCByBpKmiaVLisiAi9bPjzyelGTw", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/10/outsourcing-thinkstock-100528175-orig.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Today, public sector outsourcing deals account for two-thirds of the annual contract value in the market overall.\n[ Related: Obama\u2019s big data project targets community improvement ]In recent years, public sector outsourcing contracts have gotten longer in duration as well at a time when private sector deals have gotten shorter.\nOver the past five years, as outsourcing in the commercial sector has grown steadily but modestly, the annual contract value of outsourcing deals in the public sector has more than doubled, according to analysis by outsourcing consultancy ISG.\nPublic sector agencies in the U.K. and Australia have already adopted business process outsourcing on a much wider basis, according to ISG.\n[ Related: Obama taps former security advisor, IBM CEO to lead cyber panel ]But the shared services mandate has ruffled feathers and introduced significant technological challenges."}
