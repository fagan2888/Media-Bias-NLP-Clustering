Police say a stabbing suspect didn't get far before he was caught by officers.

The officers were working bar closing detail in downtown Colorado Springs shortly after 2 a.m. when they were flagged down by a witness over a disturbance at the corner of East Kiowa Street and North Tejon Street. Police discovered one person had been stabbed, and transported the victim to the hospital.

Police aired out a description of the suspect to fellow officers. The suspect was found a short time later in an alley just one block from Kiowa and Tejon. He's been identified as 30-year-old Fredrick Lamberty, and was arrested on charges of first-degree assault.

The victim's injuries are not life-threatening.
