She hinted she was for the (Keystone) XL pipeline, now she\u2019s opposed to it.\u201d\n\nBush is correct that the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone pipeline have played a major role in the Democratic primary campaign. And Clinton has faced pressure from her liberal critics to oppose Keystone and TPP. So did Clinton really flip on both issues?\n\nAs secretary of state, Clinton said she was \u201cinclined to support\u201d the Keystone XL pipeline. She also said TPP \u201csets the gold standard\u201d for future trade deals. She did hedge her bets on both issues, and was careful with her comments, but she made it clear during her tenure that she was leaning in favor of both Keystone and TPP.\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, she faced countless attacks from Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders and she eventually moved to the left on both issues. Clinton announced her opposition to the Keystone pipeline in September, saying it would harm the environment. One month later, she came out against TPP.\n\nVerdict: True\n\nDonald Trump & Carly Fiorina\n\nReality Check: Who met Putin?\n\nBy Tom LoBianco, CNN\n\nWhen it comes to U.S.-Russian relations, a little chest-puffing is hardly new. But two Republicans vying for the White House did some exaggerating of their own with their claims of meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cI got to know him very well because we were both on \u201960 Minutes,\u2019 we were stable mates. We did well that night,\u201d Trump said Tuesday night.\n\nTrump also implied last month that the two had spent some time in together before the show in comments last month on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing we have is that we were on \u201960 Minutes\u2019 together and we had fantastic ratings. One of your best-rated shows in a long time,\u201d he joked. \u201cSo that was good, right? So we were stable mates.\u201d\n\nFiorina took a swipe at Trump when she responded later and, in the process, overstated Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nTrump never directly said that the two met, but he did imply it. But that\u2019s not the case. The Putin interview was conducted in Putin\u2019s home in Russia.\n\nOn the other hand, Fiorina has met Putin. Though something that Fiorina leaves out of her recollection of meeting with Putin: she praised the Russian leader following their meeting in 2001, before the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, when she praised his leadership and the promise for a new Russia.\n\n\u201cI keep wondering how it is that I got positioned to speak in the slot before the President of the Russian Federation \u2014 on the subject of change, no less, \u201d Fiorinia said, according to a copy of the speech posted on Hewlett Packard\u2019s website. \u201cHewlett-Packard has been at the center of a lot of change in our 62-year history. But President Putin was elected president in the first democratic transition in Russia in 1,000 years. Talk about giving new meaning to the word \u2018invent.'\u201d\n\nVerdict for Trump: False\n\nVerdict for Fiorina: True\n\nCarly Fiorina & Ted Cruz\n\nReality Check: Fiorina and Cruz on the size of the tax code\n\nBy Marshall Cohen and Julie In, CNN\n\nThe length of the U.S. federal tax code came up at least twice in the debate.\n\nAsked about tax policy, Carly Fiorina said that \u201cinnovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73,000-page tax code.\u201d\n\nSo that begs the question: Is the tax code really that long?\n\nFiorina is likely referring to an oft-cited report from CCH, a leading tax research company. The report is used by tax professionals and it is more than 72,000 pages long. However, it includes much more than the actual tax code. It contains thousands of pages of regulations, legal analysis and explanations.\n\nWhen you look at the actual tax-related statues passed by Congress, as published by the Government Printing Office, it comes out to 2,652 pages, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nVerdict: False\n\nAlong the same theme, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said, \u201cThere are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible.\u201d\n\nThe IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Advocate Service recognizes the complexity of the tax code, noting in its 2014 Annual Report to Congress that the code has \u201creached nearly 4 million words.\u201d The calculation was made by utilizing Microsoft Word\u2019s \u201cword count\u201d feature and leaving in components such as amendment descriptions and cross-references.\n\nMost sources agree that the King James Bible contains almost 800,000 words.\n\nCruz is correct in stating that the IRS code contains more words than the Bible (in this case, the King James Version).\n\nVerdict: True\n\nRand Paul\n\nReality Check: Paul on Democrats presiding over income inequality\n\nBy Kevin Liptak, CNN\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul alleged during the debate that income inequality \u201cseems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, states run by Democrats and counties currently run by Democrats.\u201d\n\nA look of Census data provides a clear picture of where the gap between rich and poor is greatest in the United States, and it\u2019s not as cut-and-dry as Paul suggests when it come comes to political responsibility.\n\nFor starters, the elected leaders in states and cities have switched from Democrat to Republican, or vice versa, over time. Policies enacted by politicians from both parties have contributed to each place\u2019s current economic picture.\n\nThe most commonly used indicator for income inequality is the Gini index, which uses wage data to assign a number to each location. According to Census data, the five metropolitan areas with the greatest income gaps are Bridgeport, Connecticut; New York City; Miami; McAllen, Texas; and New Orleans.\n\nThree of those cities are currently run by Democrats; the other two are led by Republicans.\n\nIn the states, the picture is similarly mixed. The state with the highest score on income inequality is New York, where a Democrat has governed since 2007. Before that, a Republican held office for a decade.\n\nNext on the list in Connecticut, where a Democrat has occupied the statehouse since 2011, preceded by 15 years of Republicans.\n\nLouisiana is third, currently helmed by a Republican governor but previously governed by Democrats. California and Florida \u2014 two more states that have had governors from both parties over the past two decades \u2014 round out the top five.\n\nAmong the 10 states with the highest income disparity, six currently have Republican governors.\n\nOn the other end, Republican governors led seven of the 10 states with the lower levels of income inequality.\n\nWhile Democrats do run cities and states where income inequality is high, Republicans do too. It\u2019s not accurate to say Democrats are predominantly in charge of places where it\u2019s the highest.\n\nVerdict: False\n\nDonald Trump\n\nReality Check: Trump on \u2018Operation Wetback\u2019\n\nBy Sonam Vashi, CNN\n\nBillionaire Donald Trump claimed Dwight Eisenhower successfully deported 1.5 million immigrants after sending them deep across the border.\n\nTrump said, \u201cDwight Eisenhower \u2026 moved a million and a half illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again, beyond the border. They came back. Didn\u2019t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.\u201d\n\nEisenhower\u2019s policy, named \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d was implemented in 1954 and deported undocumented immigrants deep into Mexico. Many of the undocumented had come through wartime Bracero programs, when American labor needs led to a policy that allowed Mexicans to come to the U.S. for temporary agricultural work. When the temporary contracts were not renewed, many workers became illegal.\n\nThe exact number that the operation deported is unclear. Eisenhower\u2019s attorney general, Herbert Brownell, Jr., said in 1955 that the operation had deported 1 million people, but other researchers put that number closer to 250,000. Between 1953 and 1955, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recorded more than 800,000 apprehensions, according to Mae M. Ngai\u2019s \u201cImpossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America.\u201d Some research shows that more Mexicans may have left the U.S. voluntarily due to fears of apprehension.\n\nHowever, Trump never mentioned the inhumane practices that occurred when the INS deported the workers back into Mexico in the 1950s. The transfer process was widely criticized as inhumane. Some deportees were transported in over packed trucks or were dropped off without resources in the desert and died from heat stroke; others drowned after transport on overloaded ships, according to Ngai\u2019s book.\n\nVerdict: True, but misleading\n\nBen Carson\n\nReality Check: Carson on minimum wage and unemployment\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNN Money\n\nAsked whether he supports a $15 hourly minimum wage, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said, \u201cEvery time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.\u201d\n\nWhether raising the minimum wage prompts businesses to shed jobs remains a matter of debate. Many studies exist on either side of the argument. But there\u2019s at least one case where the jobless rate went down: In 1997, the minimum wage increased to $5.15 an hour, from $4.75 an hour. At the start of that year, there were 7.2 million Americans without jobs. The number of unemployed subsequently fell each month until October 2001. There have been other times when the number of jobless was lower a year after Congress raised the federal minimum wage: 1950, 1961, 1967, 1978 and 1996.\n\nVerdict: False\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nReality Check: Huckabee on corporate taxes paid on goods made in China\n\nBy Sonam Vashi and Eve Bower, CNN\n\nFormer Gov. Mike Huckabee said, \u201cChina is beating the daylights out of us. They can build stuff we can\u2019t because they are not taxing it. When they don\u2019t tax capital and labor, and we do. They bring something over here and it\u2019s automatically cheaper even without the regulatory environment because they are not embedding the taxes. We are.\u201d\n\nHuckabee claims that China does not tax capital. The definition of \u201ccapital tax\u201d varies widely, and can refer specifically to corporate income tax or other types of capital, or both. If \u201ccapital\u201d is understood as being all of a corporation\u2019s capital, exclusive of spending, it is correct that China does not have a \u201ccapital tax,\u201d according to a 2015 report on taxation in China by the international consulting firm Deloitte. Contrary to Huckabee\u2019s claim, however, the United States does not have a federal \u201ccapital tax\u201d either, according to a 2014 Tax Foundation report. China does have a corporate income tax rate of 25%, whereas the U.S. rate is 35%.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s claim about taxes on labor is also incorrect. According to the World Bank, in 2014, Chinese businesses paid an effective labor tax rate of 49.3%. Businesses in the United States paid a far lower effective tax rate at 9.7%.\n\nVerdict: False\n\nReality Check: Huckabee on firing the chair of the Federal Reserve\n\nBy Tami Luhby, CNN Money\n\nAsked whether he would change leadership at the Federal Reserve, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\nSo, could Huckabee get rid of current chair Janet Yellen when he takes office? Yes, but he\u2019ll have to wait until February 2018, a year into his presidency. That\u2019s when Yellen\u2019s term ends.\n\nAs much as they may disagree with the Federal Reserve chair, neither the president nor Congress can fire any member of the Fed Board of Governors in the middle of their terms.\n\nFed governors serve 14-year terms. The president appoints the chair every four years.\n\nVerdict: True\n\nChris Christie\n\nReality Check: Christie stopped Obamacare in New Jersey\n\nBy Kevin Liptak, CNN\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, defending his record in resisting President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, said \u201cwe stopped Obamacare in New Jersey because we refused to participate in the federal exchange.\u201d\n\nThat quote itself is false \u2014 no governor is able to refuse participation in the federal health insurance exchange created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nChristie likely meant that as governor, he refused to establish a statewide health insurance exchange. In December 2012, he vetoed a measure that would have created such an exchange in the Garden State. Like many Republican governors, Christie resisted establishing such a marketplace because of his deep opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean New Jersey residents aren\u2019t able to participate in Obamacare. Without a state exchange, consumers rely in the federal marketplace accessed on HealthCare.gov.\n\nIndeed, thousands of New Jersey residents have obtained health plans that way. The latest estimate from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicates 194,194 people in New Jersey had signed up for plans through the federal marketplace.\n\nChristie\u2019s assertion also omits another aspect of the Affordable Care Act, in which the federal government expanded Medicaid for low-income American adults. States had to opt-in to the expansion, and many Republican governors resisted since they claimed their states would end up paying more down the road.\n\nChristie announced in 2013 he would accept the federal Medicaid expansion for his state.\n\nSince then, Medicaid enrollment in New Jersey has increased 36%. More than 1.7 million New Jersey residents are in Medicaid and CHIP, the children\u2019s health insurance plan, up more than 463,000.\n\nChristie himself has touted the decision to accept the expansion dollars on the campaign trail, saying it was \u201cthe right decision for New Jersey.\u201d\n\nVerdict: False", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (Nov. 11, 2015) -- The Republican candidates for president gathered in Milwaukee for their fourth debate Tuesday, and CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "CBS 4 - Indianapolis News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | WTTV", "description": "WASHINGTON (Nov. 11, 2015) \u2014 The Republican candidates for president gathered in Milwaukee for their fourth debate Tuesday, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check team spent the night putting their st\u2026", "title": "Republican debate: Fact checking the candidates\u2019 claims", "url": "http://cbs4indy.com/2015/11/11/republican-debate-fact-checking-the-candidates-claims/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/s056127550-300.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/s056127550-300.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@cbs4indy", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs4indy"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Get your Indianpolis news, weather, sports, contests, broadcast schedule, community events, and station profile from Indy's CBS affiliate CBS4Indy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "fb": {"pages": 315510655359}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://cbs4indy.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/7952da63e73906af73d23febaa4f6da0?s=16", "application-name": "CBS 4 - Indianapolis News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | WTTV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy", "published_time": "2015-11-11T05:02:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T05:02:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy"}, "keywords": "national & world, news, politics,", "google-site-verification": "97DFOe8LA-RusExwUtjGnPNTbFPxcebeoCtXwJNFDNg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 Republican debate: Fact checking the candidates\u2019 claimsWASHINGTON (Nov. 11, 2015) \u2014 The Republican candidates for president gathered in Milwaukee for their fourth debate Tuesday, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.\nThe definition of \u201ccapital tax\u201d varies widely, and can refer specifically to corporate income tax or other types of capital, or both.\nChina does have a corporate income tax rate of 25%, whereas the U.S. rate is 35%.\nWe are.\u201dHuckabee claims that China does not tax capital.\nContrary to Huckabee\u2019s claim, however, the United States does not have a federal \u201ccapital tax\u201d either, according to a 2014 Tax Foundation report."}
