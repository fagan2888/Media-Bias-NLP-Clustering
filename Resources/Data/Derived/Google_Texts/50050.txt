Choirs from near and far gathered in a local church for the annual Unity Fest.

The festival held at the Prince of Peace Christian Fellowship Church is in its 9th year. Shedrick Waters, the festival promoter says the purpose of the event is to unite Christian believers of all races, religions, and beliefs. The event continues to grow this year and by the start of the fest Sunday night, not a seat in the house was left vacant.

"It's very important because what it does is it actually affirms the unity of Christian believers actually coming to a physical site," Waters said. "It's something that you can see, believers that you've never seen before coming together for the same good, which is to lift up the name of Jesus in unity."

Gospel choirs from as far as Waynesboro and as near as Newton were some of the entertainers of the year.
