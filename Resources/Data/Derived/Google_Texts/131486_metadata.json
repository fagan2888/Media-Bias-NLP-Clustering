The piece, written by Daniel Horowitz, goes on to argue that the shutdown, far from being politically damaging to Republicans, is in fact playing out better than any conservative could hope.\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a sense of conviction and the presence of a Republican backbone brings to a debate in Washington,\u201d beams Horowitz, before launching into a fact-free estimation of the shutdown\u2019s political repercussions:\n\nDemocrats are beginning to slowly grovel back to the negotiation table, barely able to contain their show of bravado [sic]. We are now having a national discussion about Obamacare, something that would have never happened had we not chosen to fight on the budget bill. [\u2026] Something funny occurs when we actually stand and fight. Democrats are put on defense, and they begin to make mistakes. We begin shifting the polls, public perception, and even the media cycle.\n\nCo-blogger and right-wing radio host Dana Loesch is similarly positive about the politics of the shutdown for the right. She argues that the shutdown, which, like Horowitz, she attributes to Democrats, is an example of President Obama\u2019s \u201crefusal to face the American people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right-wing media is loving the government shutdown", "title": "Right-wing media on shutdown: \u201cLet the crisis continue\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The right-wing media is loving the government shutdown", "title": "Right-wing media on shutdown: \u201cLet the crisis continue\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/03/rightwing_media_on_shutdown_let_the_crisis_continue/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/dana_loesch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The right-wing media is loving the government shutdown", "title": "Right-wing media on shutdown: \u201cLet the crisis continue\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/dana_loesch.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dana Loesch, Daniel Horowitz, Government shutdown, Michael Reagan, Obamacare, right wing media", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Co-blogger and right-wing radio host Dana Loesch is similarly positive about the politics of the shutdown for the right.\n\u201cWelcome to the Harry and Barry Shutdown Show,\u201d chimes the headline of a front page post at the right-wing blog RedState.\nShe argues that the shutdown, which, like Horowitz, she attributes to Democrats, is an example of President Obama\u2019s \u201crefusal to face the American people.\u201d\nTopics: Dana Loesch, Daniel Horowitz, Government shutdown, Michael Reagan, Obamacare, right wing media, Politics NewsThe government shutdown may be unpopular among the public at-large \u2014 and polling may show the GOP is bearing the majority of the blame \u2014 but as far as the right-wing media is concerned, the good times have only just begun.\nWe begin shifting the polls, public perception, and even the media cycle."}
