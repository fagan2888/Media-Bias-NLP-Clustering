There are many things you'd never expect Glenn Beck to say: "Barack Obama is a great president," "the Affordable Care Act was a huge success," "amnesty for all undocumented immigrants!"

But "liberals, you were right" tops them all. And yet:

"From the beginning, most people on the left were against going into Iraq. I wasn’t.... Liberals, you were right. We shouldn’t have."



Beck made this surprising declaration on his radio show on Tuesday while discussing the widening rift between Republicans and Democrats. He urged both parties to come together to oppose another war in Iraq.

"Not one more life. Not one more life. Not one more dollar, not one more airplane, not one more bullet, not one more Marine, not one more arm or leg or eye. Not one more," he said. "This must end now. Now can't we come together on that?"

Meanwhile, the U.S. on Monday announced it would send more than 200 soldiers to Iraq to help deal with escalating attacks by the militant group ISIS. Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that the administration would consider conducting drone strikes.

Beck isn't alone in denouncing an intervention, but the situation has put a new spotlight on noted Iraq War hawks such as Former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Iraq War architect Paul Bremer.
