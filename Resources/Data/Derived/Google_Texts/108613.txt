“Undue Burden” – It is an awkward phrase, isn’t it?

On Monday the Supreme Court kicked the “undue burden” back to the courts. The balance in this case is the “under burden” on one’s religious convictions about the morality of contraception and the mandate of the Affordable Care Act that contraception needs to be provided to women. Religious nonprofit groups argue that the ACA mandate forcing employer-funded health insurance plans cover birth control infringes on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The justices lined up 4 to 4 because there is a vacancy on the court, and rather than having a tied vote which would have meant the lower court rulings would stand, they sent it back to the lower court with the admonition to “work it out.”

Jessica Mason Pieklo, Vice President, Law and the Courts at Rewire, will explain the ramifications of the decision or lack thereof. Don’t think this only applies to women and their contraceptive privileges, there are over a hundred other areas such as services to certain groups of people as an undue burden on the religious convictions of those refusing to provide services. Does religious conviction trump law?

Meeting between Donald Trump and Paul Ryan

Did you follow the meeting between Trump and Ryan last week? In this meeting did you wonder if among the various issues (top secret) they discussed could have included Social Security, Medicare, budget deficits….. Who did you think would be the most moderate and undulating voice? Somehow it seems that since Paul Ryan has become the Majority Leader of the House, he is being portrayed as a more moderate voice. Let’s examine that.

We will discuss Paul Ryan’s views on Social Security, Medicare and other “entitlements” with Linda Benesch, Communications and Digital Strategist at Campaign to Strengthen Social Security & Social Security Works on tomorrow’s show at 10 am. We might not have a good idea where Trump stands, but we do have a track record with Paul Ryan.
