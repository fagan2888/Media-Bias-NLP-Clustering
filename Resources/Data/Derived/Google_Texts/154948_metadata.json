By winning Good Morning America's \"ROAR With Katy Perry\" contest.\n\nSchools submit a two minute video of students performing their rendition of Perry\u2019s new song \"Roar.\" Perry will perform a concert at the winning school on her birthday, October 25. The concert will also be broadcast on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nNick Efstathiou, Director of the Million Dollar Band and latest winner of the NewsChannel 7\u2019s Golden Apple award, and his staff came up with the concept. They\u2019re also responsible for the filming and editing.\n\nEfstathiou\u2019s wife, Kelly, who is the Auxiliary Director of the band, sent us this brief synopsis of the video:\n\n\u201cChampions come in all shapes, sizes and personality types, from the \u201cknow-it-alls,\u201d and \u201cbetter thans,\u201d to the \u201cteam players,\u201d and \u201cgo getters.\u201d The trick is coming together as a team and blending those differences to create something greater than the individual. When all is said and done; the greatest champion finds that they are only as powerful as their weakest link. Excellence is achieved when the strongest reach down to pull up the weak, when the negative is transformed into something positive, and teamwork rules the day. Only then can those individual voices unite to become a ROAR!\u201d\n\nKelly Efstathiou says their video reflects what the Million Dollar Band is all about.\n\n\u201cNo matter how different, difficult, inexperienced or rough around the edges one might be, there is a place for everyone in our program,\u201d said Kelly Efstathiou.\n\nIt appears Bay High has some stiff competition based on Katy Perry's reaction to an entry from Lakewood High School in Lakewood, Colorado.\n\nOh my GAWD.
