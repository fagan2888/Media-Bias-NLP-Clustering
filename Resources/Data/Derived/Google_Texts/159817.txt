The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Minority Health recently hosted the first webinar in a series on the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care, also known as the National CLAS Standards.

What are the CLAS Standards?

The National CLAS Standards provide a blueprint for healthcare providers and organizations to better serve diverse communities through culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS), which are defined as, being respectful of, and responsive to, individual cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health-literacy levels, and communication needs.

Failure to provide CLAS can have a major impact on health outcomes for vulnerable populations, as well as on the cost and quality of care. For example, individuals with limited English proficiency may be at greater risk for medical errors, longer hospital stays, and avoidable readmission when healthcare facilities do not use trained interpreters.

For more information on how you can implement the National CLAS Standards at your organization, watch the recorded webinar and visit www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov.
