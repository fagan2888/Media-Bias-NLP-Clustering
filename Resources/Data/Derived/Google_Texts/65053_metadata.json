The U.S., he lamented, is \u201cthe only advanced country on Earth\u201d that doesn\u2019t guarantee \u201cpaid maternity leave to our workers.\u201d\n\nApparently this is supposed to be some kind of devastating argument, because you see it a lot. When Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced a paid maternity leave policy for city workers, he also noted that \u201cthe United States is the only developed nation in the world without a statutory right to paid parental leave.\u201d PBS NewsHour has made the same point: \u201cAlmost every country in the world offers more generous maternity leave than the U.S.\u201d (To prove just how backward we are, PBS lumps America in with Papua New Guinea. Boy, someone in the PBS newsroom needs some remedial training in cultural sensitivity!)\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just maternity leave, either. The U.S. gets rebuked for being an outlier for lots of things. \u201cHere\u2019s a Map of the Countries That Provide Universal Health Care,\u201d scolds The Atlantic. \u201c(America\u2019s Still Not on It).\u201d It\u2019s a popular point to make in arguments over capital punishment, too. As a Los Angeles Times news article reprovingly noted after a jury condemned Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, \u201ctoday 105 of the 192 countries represented at the United Nations have abolished the death penalty by law, and at least 43 more have abolished it in practice. ... Those that still employ the death penalty\u2014among them Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Somalia, China, Japan and the U.S.\u2014are outliers and strange bedfellows.\u201d\n\nOh, and \u201cThe United States has such an unequal distribution of wealth,\u201d says a piece on the Huffington Post, \u201cthat it\u2019s in the league of corrupt underdeveloped countries, no longer in the league of the developed nations.\u201d\n\nYou get the point. If the rest of the civilized world is doing something and we\u2019re not, then clearly we need to mend our ways.\n\nBut this line of reasoning recently came to an abrupt halt when it slammed into a brick wall labeled \u201cabortion.\u201d The Family Foundation of Virginia had claimed the U.S. \u201cis one of only seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization.\u201d The others: China, North Korea, Singapore, Canada, the Netherlands, and Vietnam. PolitiFact Virginia rated the statement true. Similar statements have been made before, by Rick Perry\u2019s wife Anita (PolitiFact checked that in 2013) and Carly Fiorina (who was checked by Politifact on the point in 2011). Their statements received ratings of half-true.\n\nThe ratings, however, matter less than the reaction. When asked about the figures, a spokesman for the Center for Reproductive Rights said data showing the U.S. fails to conform to international norms are \u201can imperfect way to think about abortion laws.\u201d Oh.\n\nJust a guess, but most supporters of abortion rights probably don\u2019t give a fig what the rest of the world does. They believe abortion should be widely available even in later pregnancy\u2014and if America\u2019s laws are more liberal in that regard, then it\u2019s the rest of the world that needs to catch up, not the other way around.\n\nThe U.S. is exceptional in other ways as well. As The New York Times reported in a 2008 article, we are the only country that blocks prosecutors from introducing certain evidence in criminal trials if the police obtained it improperly: \u201cThe rule applies whether the misconduct is slight or serious, and without regard to the gravity of the crime or the power of the evidence. \u2018Foreign countries have flatly rejected our approach,\u2019 said Craig M. Bradley, an expert in comparative criminal law at Indiana University. \u2018In every other country, it\u2019s up to the trial judge to decide whether police misconduct has risen to the level of requiring the exclusion of evidence.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe U.S. also deviates from international norms by providing for punitive damages. After an Alabama couple won $1 million from a company for a defective motorcycle helmet that contributed to their son\u2019s death, an Italian court refused to help them collect because, the Times said, punitive damages were \u201cso offensive to Italian notions of justice that it would not enforce the Alabama judgment.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re running in one direction and everyone around you is running the opposite way, it\u2019s prudent to wonder whether you haven\u2019t made a mistake. But it doesn\u2019t prove a thing by itself. The Xin dynasty Emperor Wang Mang abolished slavery, however briefly, in China in the first century. It must have seemed mad at the time, but that didn\u2019t make it wrong.\n\nPolicies are good or bad policy independent of how many other countries have them, and in some cases\u2014such as the exclusionary rule\u2014the trait that makes the U.S. unique in the world is a significant virtue. \u201cCollective wisdom\u201d often isn\u2019t. Remember the Demotivator poster about business meetings: \u201cNone of us is as dumb as all of us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "What happened to being more like the rest of the world?", "title": "More Liberal Hypocrisy on Abortion", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/06/03/more-liberal-hypocrisy-on-abortion", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14333408367025.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14333408367025.jpg", "description": "What happened to being more like the rest of the world?", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "More Liberal Hypocrisy on Abortion"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-03T14:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/a-barton-hinkle"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb9c\"", "article_summary": "And it\u2019s not just maternity leave, either.\nJust a guess, but most supporters of abortion rights probably don\u2019t give a fig what the rest of the world does.\nThey believe abortion should be widely available even in later pregnancy\u2014and if America\u2019s laws are more liberal in that regard, then it\u2019s the rest of the world that needs to catch up, not the other way around.\n\u2018Foreign countries have flatly rejected our approach,\u2019 said Craig M.
