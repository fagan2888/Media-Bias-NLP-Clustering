Last night, Stephen Colbert embraced Bolling\u2019s suggestion as part of his \u201cSmile File\u201d segment, in which he looks at the most uplifting stories of the day.\n\nColbert said he didn\u2019t think there was anything about the Castro story that could make him smile, until he tuned in to The Five whose Eric Bolling \u201calways sees the glass as half full.\u201d In the Fox segment, Bolling pulled out his white board to show just how much money taxpayers will save from Castro\u2019s suicide. \u201cJustice is expensive,\u201d Colbert said, eagerly agreeing with Bolling. \u201cImagine how much we could have saved if we never caught him.\u201d\n\nBolling later broadened his calculus out to Guantanamo Bay, where he said the country could save $150 million if the prisoners there would all just kill themselves. \u201cThank you!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. \u201cWould it kill those Gitmo detainees to kill themselves? I mean, for Pete\u2019s sake, what are they waiting for, charges?\u201d\n\nWhen Colbert discovered that the white board also featured the Twitter handle @ericbolling, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t do it, Eric! You\u2019ve got so much to live for! Nothing\u2019s coming to me now, but one imagines.\u201d\n\nColbert of course decided to take Bolling\u2019s idea one step further, taking on the \u201csuicidal elephant in the room: Social Security.\u201d He concluded by saying, \u201cIf any of you freeloaders out there need some inspiration, just turn on The Five. Because every time I watch Eric Bolling, I want to kill myself.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via Comedy Central:\n\nThe Colbert Report\n\nGet More: Colbert Report Full Episodes,Video Archive\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro hung himself in his cell this week, Fox News' Eric Bolling was one of the few TV commentators to call for more prison", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-06-at-7.57.27-AM.png", "title": "Stephen Colbert: \u2018Every Time I Watch Eric Bolling, I Want to Kill Myself\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "After Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro hung himself in his cell this week, Fox News' Eric Bolling was one of the few TV commentators to call for more prison suicides.
