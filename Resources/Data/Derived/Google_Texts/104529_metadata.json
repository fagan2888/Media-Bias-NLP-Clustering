Public-sector workers can be forced to pay union fees in D.C. and 23 states, although thousands of Wisconsin and Michigan workers have exercised their ability to opt out as a result of recent reforms.\n\nMillions siphoned from taxpayers make their way to AFL-CIO each year, as the union coalition\u2019s largest affiliates are American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and American Federation of Teachers. This explains AFL-CIO support for bigger government, but AFL-CIO headquarters pay stands in contrast to the organization\u2019s politics.\n\nAFL-CIO backed the fringe-left Occupy Wall Street movement launched in late 2011, and it continues to embrace the group\u2019s \u201c99 percent\u201d rhetoric. Solidarity with low-income workers is a major theme of AFL-CIO efforts to increase union membership, grow government and hike corporate taxes.\n\nPeople\u2019s World, a publication of Communist Party USA, reported on an April 15 press conference unveiling the 2014 edition of AFL-CIO\u2019s Executive Paywatch report. At the presser, Trumka said the pay of top CEOs keeps increasing \u201cbecause the system is rigged.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cannibalizing their customer base,\u201d Trumka added. Using money paid to AFL-CIO by its dues-funded union affiliates, Trumka was paid a total of $322,131 during AFL-CIO\u2019s 2014 fiscal year ending June 30.\n\nThe gap between average AFL-CIO headquarters pay and the national average for all occupations grew from $36,367 in 2004 to $40,639 in 2013. AFL-CIO did not respond to a Watchdog.org inquiry about the pay gap between AFL-CIO headquarters and the rest of the country.\n\nAverage AFL-CIO pay, the national mean wage for all occupations and the 90th percentile wage for all occupations are shown in the following chart. Averages for all occupations for are not yet available from the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2014.\n\nA recent AFL-CIO video calling for a federal minimum wage hike lamented, \u201call the income gains of the last 15 years went to the richest 10 percent of Americans,\u201d but AFL-CIO headquarters officers and employees were among the top 10 percent of wage earners nationwide every year from 2004-11.\n\nIn 2013, average AFL-CIO headquarters pay was $1,251 lower than the 90th percentile as calculated by BLS. In 2012, AFL-CIO headquarters pay was just $62 shy of the top 10 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, D.C. paid the union group's officers and employees an average of $89,328 during the 2014 fiscal year.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, D.C. paid the union group's officers and employees an average of $89,328 during the 2014 fiscal year.", "title": "Workers stuck paying plush AFL-CIO union salaries - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/Trumka-featured.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-23T14:38:50+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/178147/aflcio-union-pay/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, D.C. paid the union group's officers and employees an average of $89,328 during the 2014 fiscal year.", "title": "Workers stuck paying plush AFL-CIO union salaries - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/Trumka-featured.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2014-10-24T04:00:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-23T14:38:50+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "AFL-CIO, AFL-CIO pay, union pay, Big Labor, forced unionism, forced union dues, mandatory union dues, AFL-CIO headquarters"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1eab\"", "article_summary": "This explains AFL-CIO support for bigger government, but AFL-CIO headquarters pay stands in contrast to the organization\u2019s politics.\nIn 2013, average AFL-CIO headquarters pay was $1,251 lower than the 90th percentile as calculated by BLS.\nIn 2012, AFL-CIO headquarters pay was just $62 shy of the top 10 percent.\nIn 26 states and the District of Columbia, private-sector workers can be forced to pay AFL-CIO affiliates as a condition of employment.\nAFL-CIO did not respond to a Watchdog.org inquiry about the pay gap between AFL-CIO headquarters and the rest of the country."}
