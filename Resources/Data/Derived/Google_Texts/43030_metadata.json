In others, it seems to be a detriment. And like any skill, being able to read people can be used for good or evil.\n\nSome of the greatest moments in human history were fueled by emotional intelligence. When Martin Luther King, Jr. presented his dream, he chose language that would stir the hearts of his audience. \u201cInstead of honoring this sacred obligation\u201d to liberty, King thundered, \u201cAmerica has given the Negro people a bad check.\u201d He promised that a land \u201csweltering with the heat of oppression\u201d could be \u201ctransformed into an oasis of freedom and justice,\u201d and envisioned a future in which \u201con the red hills of Georgia sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\u201d Delivering this electrifying message required emotional intelligence\u2014the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions. Dr. King demonstrated remarkable skill in managing his own emotions and in sparking emotions that moved his audience to action. As his speechwriter Clarence Jones reflected, King delivered \u201ca perfectly balanced outcry of reason and emotion, of anger and hope. His tone of pained indignation matched that note for note.\u201d Emotional intelligence is important, but the unbridled enthusiasm has obscured a dark side. Recognizing the power of emotions, another one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century spent years studying the emotional effects of his body language. Practicing his hand gestures and analyzing images of his movements allowed him to become \u201can absolutely spellbinding public speaker,\u201d says the historian Roger Moorhouse\u2014\u201cit was something he worked very hard on.\u201d His name was Adolf Hitler. Since the 1995 publication of Daniel Goleman\u2019s bestseller, emotional intelligence has been touted by leaders, policymakers, and educators as the solution to a wide range of social problems. If we can teach our children to manage emotions, the argument goes, we\u2019ll have less bullying and more cooperation. If we can cultivate emotional intelligence among leaders and doctors, we\u2019ll have more caring workplaces and more compassionate healthcare. As a result, emotional intelligence is now taught widely in secondary schools, business schools, and medical schools.\n\nEmotional intelligence is important, but the unbridled enthusiasm has obscured a dark side. New evidence shows that when people hone their emotional skills, they become better at manipulating others. When you\u2019re good at controlling your own emotions, you can disguise your true feelings. When you know what others are feeling, you can tug at their heartstrings and motivate them to act against their own best interests. Social scientists have begun to document this dark side of emotional intelligence. In emerging research led by University of Cambridge professor Jochen Menges, when a leader gave an inspiring speech filled with emotion, the audience was less likely to scrutinize the message and remembered less of the content. Ironically, audience members were so moved by the speech that they claimed to recall more of it. The authors call this the awestruck effect, but it might just as easily be described as the dumbstruck effect. One observer reflected that Hitler\u2019s persuasive impact came from his ability to strategically express emotions\u2014he would \u201ctear open his heart\u201d\u2014and these emotions affected his followers to the point that they would \u201cstop thinking critically and just emote.\u201d \"Whenever we wanted to persuade our staff to support a particular project we always tried to break their hearts.\" Leaders who master emotions can rob us of our capacities to reason. If their values are out of step with our own, the results can be devastating. New evidence suggests that when people have self-serving motives, emotional intelligence becomes a weapon for manipulating others. In a study led by the University of Toronto psychologist St\u00e9phane C\u00f4t\u00e9, university employees filled out a survey about their Machiavellian tendencies, and took a test measuring their knowledge about effective strategies for managing emotions. Then, Cote\u2019s team assessed how often the employees deliberately undermined their colleagues. The employees who engaged in the most harmful behaviors were Machiavellians with high emotional intelligence. They used their emotional skills to demean and embarrass their peers for personal gain. In one computer company studied by Tel-Aviv University professor Gideon Kunda, a manager admitted to telling a colleague \u201chow excited we all are with what he is doing,\u201d but at the same time, \u201cdistancing my organization from the project,\u201d so \u201cwhen it blows up,\u201d the company\u2019s founder would blame the colleague.\n\nShining a light on this dark side of emotional intelligence is one mission of a research team led by University College London professor Martin Kilduff. According to these experts, emotional intelligence helps people disguise one set of emotions while expressing another for personal gain. Emotionally intelligent people \u201cintentionally shape their emotions to fabricate favorable impressions of themselves,\u201d Professor Kilduff\u2019s team writes. \u201cThe strategic disguise of one\u2019s own emotions and the manipulation of others\u2019 emotions for strategic ends are behaviors evident not only on Shakespeare\u2019s stage but also in the offices and corridors where power and influence are traded.\u201d Of course, people aren\u2019t always using emotional intelligence for nefarious ends. More often than not, emotional skills are simply instrumental tools for goal accomplishment. In a study of emotions at the Body Shop, a research team led by Stanford professor Joanne Martin discovered that founder Anita Roddick leveraged emotions to inspire her employees to fundraise for charity. As Roddick explained, \u201cWhenever we wanted to persuade our staff to support a particular project we always tried to break their hearts.\u201d However, Roddick also encouraged employees to be strategic in the timing of their emotion expressions. In one case, after noticing that an employee often \u201cbreaks down in tears with frustration,\u201d Roddick said it was acceptable to cry, but \u201cI told her it has to be used. I said, \u2018Here, cry at this point in the ... meeting.\u201d When viewing Roddick as an exemplar of an emotionally intelligent leader, it becomes clear that there\u2019s a fine line between motivation and manipulation. Walking that tightrope is no easy task. In jobs that required extensive attention to emotions, higher emotional intelligence translated into better performance. In jobs that involved fewer emotional demands, the results reversed. In settings where emotions aren\u2019t running high, emotional intelligence may have hidden costs. Recently, psychologists Dana Joseph of the University of Central Florida and Daniel Newman of the University of Illinois comprehensively analyzed every study that has ever examined the link between emotional intelligence and job performance. Across hundreds of studies of thousands of employees in 191 different jobs, emotional intelligence wasn\u2019t consistently linked with better performance. In jobs that required extensive attention to emotions, higher emotional intelligence translated into better performance. Salespeople, real-estate agents, call-center representatives, and counselors all excelled at their jobs when they knew how to read and regulate emotions\u2014they were able to deal more effectively with stressful situations and provide service with a smile. However, in jobs that involved fewer emotional demands, the results reversed. The more emotionally intelligent employees were, the lower their job performance. For mechanics, scientists, and accountants, emotional intelligence was a liability rather than an asset. Although more research is needed to unpack these results, one promising explanation is that these employees were paying attention to emotions when they should have been focusing on their tasks. If your job is to analyze data or repair cars, it can be quite distracting to read the facial expressions, vocal tones, and body languages of the people around you. In suggesting that emotional intelligence is critical in the workplace, perhaps we\u2019ve put the cart before the horse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In some jobs, being in touch with emotions is essential.
