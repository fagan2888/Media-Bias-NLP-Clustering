But fringe conservatives are not the only ones expressing fears about a military takeover \u2014 Republicans like Texas Representative Louie Gohmert, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott have also said they are concerned about Operation Jade Helm 15. As Brian Tashman of Right Wing Watch explains in this piece, it\u2019s hardly the first time conservatives have feared President Barack Obama was involved in bizarre undercover plots against the United States.\n\nIt seems that radical right-wing conspiracy theorists have the ear of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who recently ordered the Texas National Guard to monitor a U.S. military exercise called Jade Helm 15. According to many of these far-right activists, Jade Helm 15 is part of a secret effort to take over conservative states like Texas, impose martial law, confiscate people\u2019s firearms, round up \u201cpatriotic men,\u201d force people into cattle cars and lock them up in Wal-Marts that have been converted into FEMA camps.\n\nAbbott has since tried to distance himself from the conspiracy theory, but Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tex., has demanded \u2014 and apparently received \u2014 a meeting with military leaders over the matter.\n\nJade Helm 15 is just the latest in a litany of far-right conspiracy theories about President Obama planning a military takeover of the country. While none of the theories has ever actually panned out, far-right pundits and activists keep inventing new ones, insisting that whoever doesn\u2019t agree with them either doesn\u2019t see the truth or is enabling Obama\u2019s dictatorial agenda.\n\nRemember: Obama\u2019s plot against America goes all the way back to his birth\u2026\n\n1) Barack the Baby Communist\n\nFaith 2 Action founder Janet Porter, who recently worked with Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul and several GOP candidates on a film about how the gay rights movement will \u201ccriminalize Christianity,\u201d revealed to WorldNetDaily readers just two weeks into Obama\u2019s first term that she had learned through a chain email that the president had been planted as a baby by Russian communists who would use him to take over America.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t prove whether it\u2019s true or not, but in light of all that is happening, it just doesn\u2019t seem that far-fetched anymore,\u201d Porter wrote, claiming that the letter was \u201cnot some e-mail scam\u201d and that she personally reached out to its source to confirm the details.\n\nAccording to the email\u2019s author, during the early 1990s he met two Russian scientists, spouses \u201cV.M\u201d and \u201cT.M,\u201d who told him that \u201cyou will have a black president very soon and he will be a Communist\u201d \u2026 named \u201cBarack.\u201d The Russians continued:\n\nThis is not some idle talk. He is already born, and he is educated and being groomed to be president right now. You will be impressed to know that he has gone to the best schools of presidents. He is what you call \u2018Ivy League.\u2019 You don\u2019t believe me, but he is real and I even know his name. His name is Barack. His mother is white and American and his father is black from Africa. That\u2019s right, a chocolate baby! And he\u2019s going to be your president. \u2026 It\u2019s all been thought out. His father is not an American black, so he won\u2019t have that social slave stigma. He is intelligent and he is half white and has been raised from the cradle to be an atheist and a Communist. He\u2019s gone to the finest schools. He is being guided every step of the way and he will be irresistible to America The female scientist seemed to know a lot about this young man: \u201cShe rattled off a complete litany. He was from Hawaii. He went to school in California. He lived in Chicago. He was soon to be elected to the Legislature. \u2018Have no doubt: he is one of us, a Soviet \u2026. [H]e will be a blessing for world Communism. We will regain our strength and become the number one power in the world.\u2019 She continued with something to the effect that America was at the same time the great hope and the great obstacle for Communism. America would have to be converted to Communism, and Barack was going to pave the way.\u201d\n\nA few right-wing activists tried to find proof of this arrangement, alleging that Communist Party mentored and indoctrinated Obama \u2014 possibly with the help of marijuana and his \u201creal father\u201d Frank Marshall Davis \u2014 into \u201cMarxism and an anti-White world view.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, every single word in this chain email was true! Maybe. And now, Obama is on the brink of taking over America with his secret squads of Obamacare militias, immigrants, African Americans and/or foreign troops.\n\n2) Obamacare Squads\n\nBefore joining the Family Research Council, retired Army Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin released a video with the far-right group the Oak Initiative suggesting that Obama is leading a \u201cMarxist insurgency\u201d in the U.S. He claimed that Obama inserted into the Affordable Care Act a measure that would create a personal army reminiscent of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Brownshirts, warning that the president was \u201claying the groundwork for a constabulary force that will control the population in America.\u201d\n\nBoykin cited a provision in the health care act which prepares medical professionals to respond to emergencies such as a hurricane, along with a 2008 speech that then-candidate Obama delivered about the need to increase funding for groups such as the Peace Corps and AmericaCorps as part of a \u201ccivilian national security force,\u201d a move backed by the Bush administration.\n\nSeveral years later, the Obamacare brownshirts still haven\u2019t materialized, but the 2008 speech remains a source of fodder for conservatives who believe, as then-Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., put it shortly after Obama\u2019s election, that Obama was doing \u201cexactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany and it\u2019s exactly what the Soviet Union did.\u201d\n\nLiberty Counsel head Mat Staver agreed with Boykin\u2019s assessment, warning that the health care law created a Brownshirt-style military force loyal to the president.\n\nPorter joined in in 2012, claiming that FEMA Corps, which trains young people to work in disaster response, might actually be \u201ca standing army to stifle dissent\u201d and \u201cpart of a new civilian security force that President Obama has called for in speeches.\u201d WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah, who once alleged that Obama sent a secret signal to Muslims to \u201cfinish\u201d the Holocaust against the Jews, similarly warned that Obama would soon \u201cmove to shut down and destroy all independent media\u201d and would make sure that \u201chis biggest critics will be rounded up in the name of national security.\u201d\n\n3) About That Executive Order\u2026\n\nIn 2012, when Obama issued an emergency preparedness executive order similar to ones issued by presidents since Dwight Eisenhower, some right-wing commentators went ballistic since this time, the president was Obama!\n\nBuster Wilson, then a radio host with the American Family Association\u2019s radio network, claimed that the executive order created \u201cthe president\u2019s version of the Brownshirts\u201d that was equivalent to \u201cHitler\u2019s own private civilian army.\u201d Wilson also wondered if the government was setting up FEMA camps stocked with plastic coffins for mass graves.\n\n\u201cHe is openly implementing martial law in this country,\u201d InfoWars host Alex Jones said about the executive order. The executive order, Jones claimed, declared that administration officials would have the power to \u201csecretly arrest Americans and disappear us any time they want\u201d and build \u201cthe domestic security force that\u2019s just as big and just as strong as the military Obama\u2019s always talked about as the \u2018FEMA Corps.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne congressman, then-Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, suggested that the president would use the executive order to seize total power. In fact, Stockman speculated that Obama may have deliberately brought Ebola to America in order to create a crisis to justify the implementation of his order granting himself \u201cemergency powers to take over control of the economy and everything.\u201d\n\n4) Ebola! Remember That?\n\nLast year, four people were diagnosed with Ebola while in the U.S., two after travelling from West Africa and two after caring for an Ebola patient at a hospital in Texas. In the eyes of conservatives, this was a widespread pandemic that was all Obama\u2019s fault.\n\nAccording to Stockman, Obama may have had an \u201cintentional\u201d plan to bring Ebola into the U.S. \u201cin order to create a greater crisis to use it as a blunt force to say, well in order to solve this crisis we\u2019re going to have to take control of the economy and individuals and so forth\u2026. [T]here may be an overreaction where the government starts taking away the rights of those that aren\u2019t that necessarily involved or need that to happen. I hope that\u2019s not that case but, as you know, this current government uses crisis to advance their philosophy and their agenda.\u201d\n\nConservative talk show host Michael Savage claimed Obama \u201cmight use Ebola as a pretext\u201d to \u201cgain even more power.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants an insurrection,\u201d Savage declared. \u201cHe wants a pretext. He wants his Kristallnacht. He wants to take the guns, he wants to arrest people, he wants to detain people for their own safety.\u201d\n\nRadio host Rick Wiles predicted that Ebola was part of \u201ca carefully crafted plan to dismantle the United States of America,\u201d as it would be used \u201cas the cover to round up patriots who resist the takedown of the republic\u201d and set up \u201cEbola Barry\u2019s Ebola Recovery and Re-Education Camps.\u201d\n\nAnother far-right radio host, Laurie Roth, predicted that Obama would deliberately fuel an Ebola outbreak in order to \u201ccreate a guise to declare martial law due to created outbreaks,\u201d giving him the power to \u201ccontrol speech, food, travel and health care\u201d and even \u201cdemand adults and children take some sort of mandated/mystery vaccination that kills off even more people\u201d:\n\nMy prediction is that a forced vaccination plan from Obama and his administration is on its way. This will not only allow someone put in control (so Obama can\u2019t be blamed) to release something potentially fatal into our system, but also act as a tracker \u2013 the complete end of our privacy and freedom.\n\nColumnists for WorldNetDialy alleged that Ebola was part of Obama\u2019s \u201corchestrated\u201d plan to cancel the 2016 election, \u201c\u2018legitimize\u2019 a declaration of martial law in America\u201d and make use of \u201cthe $1 billion worth of disposable FEMA coffins supposedly stored in Georgia.\u201d\n\nPrior to the Ebola scare, Porter took to WorldNetDaily to predict that Obama would use swine flu to \u201cround up American citizens\u201d and force them into FEMA concentration camps. She also told WorldNetDaily readers that the president, emulating Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, would create \u201ca food shortage\u201d to see that people are \u201cstarved to death.\u201d\n\n5) Obama\u2019s Race War Ruse\n\nSince predictions about Obama\u2019s dastardly plan to infect all other Americans with the Ebola virus in order to seize power didn\u2019t exactly come true, conservative activists have turned to recent demonstrations over issues such as racial profiling as another Obama-orchestrated plot to take control of the country.\n\nGlenn Beck, once again citing Obama\u2019s frequently distorted 2008 speech, said that the riots that broke out during demonstrations in Baltimore in April were part of a \u201cset-up\u201d by the government to engineer civil strife in order to justify a federal takeover of local police units. And, once that happens, \u201cit\u2019s lights out, republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest show ever,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThose riots in Baltimore; that wasn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nBeck went on to say that this manufactured crisis will soon lead to a full-blown genocide in which millions of people, including Beck himself, will perish.\n\nOthers in the right-wing media took similar views. Wiles claimed that protests in Ferguson, Missouri, were all part of a plot to enable \u201cEmperor Obama\u201d to \u201cstart a civil war,\u201d which would give him a reason to implement stringent gun control so people could no longer \u201cprotect themselves from tyrants.\u201d His fellow conservative talk show host Jesse Lee Peterson said that Obama brought \u201cchaos\u201d to Baltimore just so \u201che can federalize the police departments around the country.\u201d WorldNetDaily columnist Morgan Brittany claimed that the Baltimore riots were \u201cplanned\u201d by the government, which she said is bent on \u201cstirring up unrest\u201d in order to give Obama the justification \u201cto institute martial law to preserve order, form a national police force and postpone the 2016 elections.\u201d\n\nSavage, the conservative radio host, even went so far as to allege that Obama started the riots as a way to send arms to gang members under the pretext of preserving order: \u201cIt\u2019s a race war. These are their shock troops, they don\u2019t have the brown shirts yet, they don\u2019t have the armbands, but soon Obama could deputize them. Isn\u2019t that a natural army for him? Take the Crips and the Bloods, give them a green uniform and give them a weapon and they\u2019ll keep order in the streets.\u201d\n\nWell before the Ferguson and Baltimore demonstrations, Gun Owners of America head Larry Pratt and far-right pundit Stan Solomon predicted that the president would create a \u201cblack force\u201d that would massacre any white people who resisted his plans.\n\nIn another interview, Pratt accused Obama of hoping to \u201cbring violence\u201d and \u201csome kind of social implosion to America\u201d as a way to keep power, with Solomon warning of \u201can explosion of attacks on haves by have-nots\u201d and \u201cmore specifically on white haves by black have-nots; more specifically on Christian, heterosexual white haves by black, Muslim and/or atheist \u2014 not that there\u2019s much difference \u2014 black have-nots.\u201d\n\n6) Bundy Ranch Standoff\n\nThe short-lived standoff between federal law enforcement and Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher and Fox News darling who refused to pay grazing fees for his cattle or to recognize the legal authority of the U.S. government, gave another opportunity for right-wing commentators to warn of an imminent federal takeover spurred on by Obama-instigated violence.\n\nWorldNetDaily columnist Erik Rush pointed to the Bundy standoff as proof that \u201cthe federal government intends to control everything,\u201d including \u201cour food supply.\u201d Denouncing President Obama as a someone who \u201cembodies the diabolical Manchurian President, clandestinely working to destroy America,\u201d Rush warned that the Bundy standoff might have been a test case for imminent FEMA camp internment.\n\n\u201cDo we wait until a family is slaughtered because they opened fire on government agents executing an illegal raid on their home?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo we wait until Department of Homeland Security operatives come around to arrest \u2018domestic terrorists\u2019 as designated by Harry Reid and ship them off to FEMA camps?\u201d\n\nTelevangelist Gordon Klingenschmitt, who has since been elected to the Colorado legislature, said that the federal government dug \u201cmass graves\u201d near the ranch to hold the bodies of the \u201ccowboys\u201d they planned to murder. Wiles had a similar theory:\n\nCivil unrest is brewing, the Obamanistas have tried a number of tactics to insult and infuriate the American people to respond with violence\u2026. I expect dirty Harry Reid and his Washington sidekick Barry Soetoro will send federal agents back to Nevada this summer and my fear is that federal snipers will take out a bunch of cowboys and militia men.\n\nStewart Rhodes, the founder of Oath Keepers, a radical group which fears that concentration camps are coming to the U.S., stopped by a press conference at the National Press Club to deliver a \u201cmessage for the feds out there\u201d and the \u201cidiot\u201d Obama that the Bundy standoff could have \u201ckicked off a civil war in this country.\u201d Mike Vanderboegh of the Three Percenters militia said that officials such as Harry Reid were \u201cpromising us all civil war on a vast scale\u201d through \u201cstate-sponsored violence\u201d intended to crush freedom.\n\n7) Obama\u2019s Immigrant Army\n\nNot only will Obama have loyal armies of doctors, AmeriCorps members, black protesters and gang members, but he will also, according to several conspiracy theorists, create a force of undocumented immigrants \u2014 specifically young Central American refugees escaping the drug war \u2014 to do his bidding.\n\nPratt, the gun lobbyist, claimed last year that Obama was forming a private \u201cPraetorian Guard\u201d composed of undocumented immigrants, each \u201cloyal to the guy that brought him\u201d into the country.\n\nAnti-immigrant activist William Gheen offered his own version of this prediction, alleging that the federal government was \u201cgoing to give the illegal immigrants badges, they\u2019re going to give them guns, and they\u2019re going to put them in positions of authority over Americans in every way imaginable. So when you step out your door and there\u2019s a knock at the door, you\u2019re going to be looking at the new face of the state, which is the prior illegal immigrants that now have a badge and a gun and dominion over you.\u201d\n\nGheen added that the Obama administration was \u201csupporting the organized and well-funded illegal alien invasion of our homeland\u201d and therefore has \u201cthe blood of many thousands of Americans on their hands that have been killed, injured raped and robbed by illegal immigrants,\u201d warning that \u201ccenter-right, Christian, heterosexual\u201d men were particularly at risk.\n\nGheen even told Jones, the \u201cInfoWars\u201d host, that the young immigrants were the pawns and child soldiers of U.S. \u201celites\u201d who want to subjugate patriotic Christians: \u201cThey\u2019re willing to literally say and do anything that their new masters call on them to do to protect their position. Once Obama rams these \u2018kids\u2019 in, gives them their Obamaphone, enrolls them in Obamacare, puts them in a public school, pays for their housing, pays for their food\u2026these people will do anything that their leaders call on them to do and I do mean anything.\u201d\n\nAlan Keyes wondered if Obama, whom he thinks wants to become America\u2019s \u201cF\u00fchrer,\u201d was \u201cimporting\u201d immigrants \u201cin order to facilitate what I think is an overthrow of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nWorldNetDaily\u2019s resident health \u201cexpert\u201d Elizabeth Lee Vliet claimed that the government would use a \u201cflood of illegals\u201d who carry exotic diseases to \u201coverwhelm and collapse the economic and social systems, in order to replace them with a \u2018new socialist order\u2019 under federal control.\u201d\n\n8) Obama\u2019s Atheist/Islamic/Canadian/Alien Army\n\nBuilding off the birther conspiracy theory that Obama is not a U.S.-born citizen and the general right-wing belief that he is not a real American, several conservative activists believe that the president will use foreign forces, outside of just immigrants and health care workers, to oppress Americans.\n\nAccording to Bill Federer, a Religious Right \u201chistorian,\u201d the Arab Spring was designed by nefarious forces who wanted to create a surge in Muslim refugees who would then settle in the U.S. in order to establish Islamic \u201csleeper cells.\u201d Soon, these sleeper cells would \u201cget a signal to have Ferguson riots in malls across America,\u201d which would give Obama the justification to \u201crestore order\u201d by setting up a \u201cmilitarized dictatorship.\u201d Obama, Federer warned, could follow in the footsteps of Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Pol Pot in killing millions of Christians.\n\nFederer cited a man named Avi Lipkin, who apparently heard from his wife, who heard from an unspecified Arabic-language broadcast, about a plot to bring millions of Muslim refugees into the country in order to bring about Sharia law. Lipkin alleged that Obama was \u201cgoing to bring in 50 to 100 million Muslims\u201d and settle them in national parks and \u201clands confiscated by Agenda 21\u201d \u2014 a sustainable development initiative that is at the center of its very own right-wing conspiracy theory \u2014 ultimately forcing America to \u201csurrender its Christianity\u201d in the face of a new \u201cMuslim majority.\u201d Then, Obama would establish a \u201cdictatorship\u201d \u2026 with the help of \u201cthe Masons, the Illuminati [and] the Trilateral Commission.\u201d\n\nLipkin and Federer, however, don\u2019t hold a candle to Jim Garrow, a right-wing activist who believes that Obama tried to kill 300 million Americans with an EMP attack for the sake of enriching George Soros and giving him the chance to live in a luxurious bunker underneath the White House. Garrow also believes that Obama will try to improve his poll numbers by claiming that he is able to communicate with aliens, but if they plummet any further and Americans start to revolt, then Obama will \u201cask [Canadian Prime Minister Stephen] Harper to send troops into America to help quell the rioting and vice versa.\u201d\n\nGarrow shared his very plausible anti-Obama conspiracy theories with far-right radio hosts including Wiles, Rush and Jones. Garrow told Jones in detail about Obama\u2019s EMP plot, which he said was only stopped as a result of divine intervention, along with the president\u2019s failed plan to detonate a nuclear device near Charleston, South Carolina. Fortunately, the nuke, Garrow said, was detonated safely off the coast by heroic military officials. He cited the deaths of dolphins (who were likely killed by the BP oil spill) as proof.\n\nJones talked to another \u201creal source\u201d about the need to \u201cbrace for a nuclear attack in South Carolina,\u201d who alleged that Charleston was the target because of the presence of U.S. submarines: \u201cThis is a false flag operation, a major false flag, that is about to occur because if they take out our naval base in Charleston, they will cripple about one-third of our fleet ballistic missile submarine force.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything they are doing is like trying to set America up,\u201d Jones replied, wondering if \u201cObama is like a triple agent of the globalists, we know that, and they are maneuvering America towards a set-up to destroy us and then Homeland Security will then detonate nukes in all of our bases as an inside sneak attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ultimately reeks of yet another false flag being orchestrated by the United States government in order to send us into war,\u201d Jones said in another commentary about the matter. \u201cI just wish to God that this wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the same Alex Jones who launched Jade Helm 15 into the GOP mainstream and led to such a fear that the governor of Texas ordered the National Guard to monitor the U.S. military during the drill.\n\nOf course, when one conspiracy theory fails to materialize, radio hosts like Alex Jones just move on to the next one, and then eventually, Republican politicians just move along with them.\n\nAs Rick Santorum found out, among the party\u2019s base \u2014 as many of one-third of whom think Obama will invade Texas \u2014 at least some people think that it is an established fact that \u201cObama tried to blow up a nuke in Charleston.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Louie-Gohmert-Fox-Business-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Takeover!
