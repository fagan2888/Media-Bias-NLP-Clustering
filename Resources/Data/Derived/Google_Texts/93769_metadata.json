Let\u2019s just talk about the ways pop culture can chip away at the soul, the ways a jokey demonstration of a game or an imaginary Twitter fight or yet another celebrity explaining that she believes in equality but don\u2019t call her a feminist or the sound of that song that just wouldn\u2019t go away can make a person realize how far we still have to go. There were truly far too many contenders to choose from this year, but these were the sexist lowlights that raised our blood pressure most.\n\nElan Gale\n\nIt turned out \u201cDiane,\u201d the huffy airline passenger in the medical mask, never even existed. What Buzzfeed dubbed an \u201cepic\u201d encounter that \u201cwon\u201d Thanksgiving was instead merely the \u201cBachelor\u201d producer\u2019s stunt to \u201centertain some people\u201d with \u201ca cautionary tale.\u201d Gale\u2019s \u201centertaining,\u201d \u201ccautionary\u201d message? You can pretend to send a strange woman a note saying, \u201cEat my dick\u201d and be lauded as a champion of civility. Got it.\n\nBustle\n\nIn an inadvertently revealing feature on Bleacher Report co-founder Bryan Goldberg\u2019s attempt to \u201credefine what \u2018women\u2019s interest\u2019 looks like,\u201d the New Yorker showed the world a man who\u2019s disappointed. Disappointed, because \u201cHonestly, nothing would have been more helpful here than for some highly regarded feminist writers to say, \u2018Bryan\u2019s a good person.'\u201d A man who explains, \u201cI am a dude. I don\u2019t have a lot of overlapping interests with most women my age. I\u2019m really into history. I\u2019m really into markets and finance. I don\u2019t know a damn thing about beauty, but I don\u2019t need to.\u201d Because those unhelpful feminists wouldn\u2019t be into history or finance. And the photo accompanying the whole thing? It was of a thoughtful Goldberg sprawled on the floor and surrounded by a gaggle of female employees, tapping away on a laptop perched on a high-heeled, short-skirted woman\u2019s lap. Who says it\u2019s tough for women to find desk jobs?\n\nSexism pretending to be journalism\n\nGoodness, where to begin? James Taranto boo-hooing over a \u201cwar on men\u201d and \u201can effort to criminalize male sexuality\u201d in a story on military sexual assault? Richard Cohen\u2019s bizarre Miley Cyrus-centric complaining about \u201cthe so-called Steubenville Rape\u201d (an odd term for a crime that has so far led to two rape convictions)? How about CNN\u2019s pity party for the rapists? Maybe a Fox News guest\u2019s assertion that women should \u201cthank men\u201d for freeing us up \u201cto embrace that side of yourself that isn\u2019t about work\u201d? We could list all the ways the media gave a platform to Dark Ages ignorance, but we\u2019d be here till 2015.\n\nLululemon\n\nWhat do you if you\u2019re a \u201cpremium\u201d clothing brand faced with accusations of deteriorating quality in your merchandise? If you\u2019re Chip Wilson, you oh so subtly suggest maybe the problem is your fat, scratchy thighs, lady \u2013 perhaps because his company\u2019s pants only go up to size 12 anyway. In a Bloomberg interview in November, the company founder said, \u201cSome women\u2019s bodies just actually don\u2019t work for it \u2026 They don\u2019t work for some women\u2019s bodies. It\u2019s about the rubbing through the thighs, [and] how much pressure is there.\u201d Women and their thighs protested otherwise. Wilson abruptly stepped down as company chairman a month later.\n\nMaria Kang\n\nSpeaking of body wars. First, she laid down the gauntlet \u2013 and got herself a whole lot of free publicity \u2013 by posing in an abs-flaunting ensemble surrounded by her three children and provocatively asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d Then Kang ramped it up by ranting against Curvy Girl Lingerie\u2019s campaign of plus-sized women posting photos of themselves in their underwear and complaining, \u201cWe\u2019re normalizing obesity in our society.\u201d To cap it all off, she confidently told ABC in early December, \u201cI said you can just tell by looking at someone if they are fit or not\u2026. Anyone can tell this with a bare naked eye looking at a bare naked stomach.\u201d For her obsessive fat-shaming, Kang is proof that a woman can be just as backward and toxic as any man.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Big\" thighs, Blurred Lines and post-baby bodies galore -- behold the moments the year forgot feminism", "title": "2013: The year in sexism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Big\" thighs, Blurred Lines and post-baby bodies galore -- behold the moments the year forgot feminism", "title": "2013: The year in sexism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/26/2013_the_year_in_sexism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/year_in_sexism-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Big\" thighs, Blurred Lines and post-baby bodies galore -- behold the moments the year forgot feminism", "title": "2013: The year in sexism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/year_in_sexism-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Best of 2013, Bustle, Catherine, duchess of cambridge, Editor's Picks, elan gale, James Taranto, Kate Middleton, lululemon, maria kang, miss america, Richard Cohen, robin thicke, Sexism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d64\"", "article_summary": "In a Bloomberg interview in November, the company founder said, \u201cSome women\u2019s bodies just actually don\u2019t work for it \u2026 They don\u2019t work for some women\u2019s bodies.\nSexism pretending to be journalismGoodness, where to begin?\nIt\u2019s about the rubbing through the thighs, [and] how much pressure is there.\u201d Women and their thighs protested otherwise.\nYou can pretend to send a strange woman a note saying, \u201cEat my dick\u201d and be lauded as a champion of civility.\nWe could list all the ways the media gave a platform to Dark Ages ignorance, but we\u2019d be here till 2015."}
