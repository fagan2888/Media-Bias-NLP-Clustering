He knew immediately the outcome would be grim for a man so well respected in the aviation community.\n\nPino was an army master aviator test pilot, test pilot and former president for Bell Helicopter and had recently retired as president from Sikorsky Helicopter Company.\n\nInvestigators say Pino's friend and fellow pilot Nick Tramontano was a passenger on the aircraft. He was also killed. The two were flying above Pinal County in Pino's World War II aircraft known as \"Big Beautiful Doll.\"\n\n\n\nUrschel says as much as Pino loved to fly, he says he loved his family even more. \"He always spent time with his family. He was always going to Tucson for the football games to spend time with his parents and his sisters and constantly spoke of his family, and he was so polite to everybody that he met.\"\n\nThe FAA is handling the investigation.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
