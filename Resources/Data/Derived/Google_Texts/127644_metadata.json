Hyundai is a source of pride, and my old friend Mayor Bobby Bright still deserves a lot of the credit for it. But what if Coach Saban celebrated his first title at Alabama instead of building on it? It\u2019s time for us to start envisioning what the jobs of Montgomery\u2019s future are going to look like.\u201d\n\nThough the mayoral race is officially nonpartisan, Davis is perhaps most well known for his time as a Democratic Congressman, followed by a high-profile party switch. He was one of only 34 house Democrats, and the only member of the House Black Caucus, who voted against ObamaCare in 2010. Later that year he unsuccessfully pursued the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. He became a Republican in 2012, citing the Obama Administration\u2019s policies that he believed did little more than \u201cpunish businesses and job creators with more taxes.\u201d That same year he spoke in support of GOP Presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe mayoral election will be held on August 25th. Current Mayor Todd Strange is seeking re-election. Former Alabama State House member and Democratic Attorney General nominee in 2014 Joe Hubbard is also rumored to be running.\n\nThe video announcing Davis\u2019s candidacy can be viewed below.\n\nLike this article?
