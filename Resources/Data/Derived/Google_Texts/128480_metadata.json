John Kasich played to media enthusiasm for big-government Republicans earlier this week during a Republican Governors Association panel.\n\nSharing a stage in Boca Raton, Fla., with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Kasich chided President Obama\u2019s critics Wednesday while defending Obamacare, Common Core and citizenship for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe RGA panel was moderated by MSNBC host Chuck Todd, who earlier this month told Republican radio host Hugh Hewitt he thinks Kasich has \u201cthe perfect gubernatorial resum\u00e9\u201d to run for president.\n\nPerry, Walker, Pence and Jindal also are considered likely 2016 presidential candidates, but Kasich has long been one of the media\u2019s favorite Republicans. Throughout Wednesday\u2019s discussion, Todd asked Kasich each question first and then let Kasich cut in at the end of other governors\u2019 comments.\n\nOn immigration, Kasich suggested Republicans in Congress should plead with President Barack Obama not to grant amnesty to illegal aliens by executive order.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake for him to move forward like this unilaterally,\u201d Kasich said, although Kasich unilaterally expanded Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program last year to get Obamacare money.\n\nVideo of Kasich\u2019s response to Todd\u2019s immigration question is available courtesy of C-SPAN.\n\nAfter Pence, Jindal, Perry and Walker remarked on the political nature of Obama\u2019s immigration maneuvering, Kasich reiterated the need for compromise.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s just too divided,\u201d Kasich said, imploring Republicans to work with Democrats like he did while serving in Congress in the 1990s.\n\nWatch video of Kasich\u2019s additional comments on bipartisan unity\n\n\u201cPeople want problems solved, and you gotta be careful with the rhetoric, ya know, because you get too far out on that and people don\u2019t wanna deal,\u201d continued Kasich, who routinely accuses Obamacare critics of ignoring God\u2019s call to help the poor.\n\nAsked about granting citizenship to illegal immigrants, Kasich said, \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: We gotta think about what\u2019s gonna bring about healing. Now, my sense is, I don\u2019t like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line \u2014 we may have to do it. It may be a laborious and tough process; I would never say you would never do it. I\u2019m open to it.\u201d\n\nWatch video of Kasich\u2019s comments on amnesty\n\nRegarding the Common Core State Standards Initiative, Kasich said, \u201cif the federal government starts meddling in this, if it starts doin\u2019 all this education policy out of Washington, I\u2019m not for that. But as long as local school boards are involved in writing the curriculum to reach a higher standard \u2014 particularly in math and in science, which we have in Ohio, we\u2019re not gonna do history with some Common Core \u2014 I think it makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cTesting does drive what gets taught,\u201d Jindal said, also noting U.S. Department of Education funding and No Child Left Behind waivers have been tied to participation in Common Core.\n\nSee the governors\u2019 Nov. 19 discussion of Common Core\n\nInterjecting defensively after Jindal, Walker, Pence and Perry expressed their concerns with Common Core, Kasich said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any complaints from anybody in my state that they\u2019re not able to set their own curriculum to set a higher standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t get the message from the governors, the 45 governors that came out with this, but they didn\u2019t have Arne Duncan, they didn\u2019t have these people writin\u2019 this, this was governors doin\u2019 it, and that\u2019s what I thought we wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Todd asked Kasich to explain his decision to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, Kasich replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people that have been made promises to that have been ignored \u2014 the drug-addicted, the working poor and the mentally ill.\u201d\n\nWatch Kasich defend his embrace of Obamacare\n\n\u201cNow, I can get my money back from Washington, and I want it back in Ohio cause I know what they do with it in Washington,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nContrary to this favorite Kasich talking point, Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is paid for with new federal spending, not Ohio tax dollars.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve been doing for the people who\u2019ve been living in the shadows, living under a bridge or whatever \u2014 and the people have responded to it, and conservatives in my state have responded to it, by and large,\u201d the Ohio governor said.\n\nThat \u201cconservatives\u201d support Kasich\u2019s decision to take billions in Obamacare money to put hundreds of thousands of able-bodied childless adults on Medicaid would come as news to every center-right group in Ohio not controlled by the Ohio Republican Party.\n\nCutting in again after Perry, Jindal and Walker detailed their reasons for rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, Kasich cried, \u201cRonald Reagan expanded Medicaid!\u201d\n\nWatch Kasich\u2019s additional Medicaid expansion remarks\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion allows us to do something, but the reason why the Affordable Care Act is bad is first of all, it\u2019s top-down, it has nothing to do with costs, and it\u2019s frozen jobs,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nHis Obamacare Medicaid expansion has cost federal taxpayers roughly $2 billion since Jan. 1, and will likely shrink the state\u2019s already-shrinking labor force.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
