(EPA/Shawn Thew) European Pressphoto Agency\n\nThe White House, which took flak early in the year for a lack of diversity in its top appointees, is crowing about an increase in women, racial minorities and gay appointees as the Senate continues clearing a backlog of President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominations.\n\nMost notable may be the rise in gay appointees to the courts. Before Mr. Obama, just one openly gay judge had been confirmed to the federal bench. Mr. Obama has nominated 10 openly gay federal judges, and seven have been confirmed.\n\nThe Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which advocates for more of these appointments, says that more than 250 openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people have been appointed since the start of the administration.\n\nOn the judicial front, the White House points to several other markers. Among them: 43% of Mr. Obama\u2019s confirmed judges have been women, a higher rate than his predecessors. The list includes Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard, confirmed last week to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit after Senate Democrats pushed through a rule change to require just a simple majority for confirmation.\n\n\u201cThe president wants the federal courts to look like America,\u201d said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. He said diversity includes demographics as well as life experiences.\n\nEarly in his second term, Mr. Obama came under fire as most of his top appointments went to men, including secretaries of defense, state and treasury. Pressure has eased since then, in part due to his selection of Janet Yellen as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who was picked over former adviser Larry Summers, who many women\u2019s groups opposed.\n\nThe Senate plans votes on as many as nine presidential nominations this week.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The White House is crowing about an increase in diversity among top appointees.", "title": "White House Now Touts Diversity of Appointees", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/17/white-house-now-touts-diversity-of-appointees/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AU584_JudgeN_G_20131216161941.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "White House Now Touts Diversity of Appointees", "description": "The White House is crowing about an increase in diversity among top appointees.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Laura Meckler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The White House is crowing about an increase in diversity among top appointees.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-17T12:05:18-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/17/white-house-now-touts-diversity-of-appointees/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-42419", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The White House is crowing about an increase in diversity among top appointees.", "title": "White House Now Touts Diversity of Appointees", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/12/17/white-house-now-touts-diversity-of-appointees/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AU584_JudgeN_G_20131216161941.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-42419", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-17T16:32:51-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9591\"", "article_summary": "On the judicial front, the White House points to several other markers.\n\u201cThe president wants the federal courts to look like America,\u201d said White House spokesman Eric Schultz.\nMr. Obama has nominated 10 openly gay federal judges, and seven have been confirmed.\nBefore Mr. Obama, just one openly gay judge had been confirmed to the federal bench.\n(EPA/Shawn Thew) European Pressphoto AgencyThe White House, which took flak early in the year for a lack of diversity in its top appointees, is crowing about an increase in women, racial minorities and gay appointees as the Senate continues clearing a backlog of President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominations."}
