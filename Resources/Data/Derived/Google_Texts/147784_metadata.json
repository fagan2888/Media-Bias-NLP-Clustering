No one would expect on the natural reading of the word \u2018sex\u2019 that that would include subjective concepts like gender identity, when it\u2019s not specifically mentioned.\u201d\n\nThe reinterpretation could strike down laws in states that ban Medicaid funds from being used in sex-reassignment procedures.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s another striking example of federal overreach and intrusion, not only into the operations of the states, but into the operations of individual hospitals, physicians, and insurers, who should have the ability to make their own decisions when it comes to controversial treatments,\u201d Mr. Severino said.\n\nUnderlying the debate on who should pay for the surgeries is whether such procedures even work to treat transgender people.\n\nDr. Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said gender dysphoria is a psychosocial ailment \u2014 similar to anorexia and other body-dysmorphic maladies \u2014 and therefore should be treated through psychotherapy and counseling.\n\nHe said there is scant evidence to suggest that sex change surgeries work and argues that proponents of the procedures are taking a \u201cgreat shot in the dark for an ideological reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody would give this kind of treatment, with this kind of evidence, for anything other than ideological reasons,\u201d said Dr. McHugh, who ended such procedures at Johns Hopkins in his capacity as chairman of the Department of Psychiatry in 1979.\n\nBut Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, said Dr. McHugh\u2019s understanding flies in the face of standard medical practice, citing the American Psychiatric Association and American Medical Association, which recommend a physical rather than mental remedy.\n\n\u201cMental health services are important for a wide variety of people for a wide variety of needs,\u201d Ms. Warbelow said. \u201cAnd certainly transgender people do seek relationships with mental health care providers, but the appropriate treatment as deemed by the American Medical Association and every major physical and mental health-care organization out there is to affirm people in their gender identity.\u201d\n\nThe price of the procedures has also caused critics to question whether such funds would not be better spent elsewhere.\n\nDr. McHugh said the treatment plan can vary drastically from patient to patient \u2014 some of whom opt only for hormone or testosterone injections while others seek an assortment of procedures from electrolysis for facial and body hair to penectomy, vaginoplasty and facial reconstruction.\n\nIn total, he said, the surgeries can run in the tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cAnd then, of course, people have to have medical care afterward for all kinds of hormone treatments. It\u2019s an expensive business.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Chovanes said the costs of sex-reassignment surgeries would be a drop in the pond of the multibillion-dollar Medicaid budget.\n\n\u201cThere are 2.2 million Pennsylvania people on Medicaid, and since the entire program is something like $26 billion, this specific care should be pretty minor when considered within the greater context of the program,\u201d Ms. Chovanes said.\n\n\u201cI would say the exact cost estimate really isn\u2019t important,\u201d Ms. Warbelow said. \u201cThat we provide health care and health benefits to ensure people are healthy and are able to engage in a full life, you certainly don\u2019t question what it costs to provide treatments for any number of health care needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A woman from Pennsylvania who now identifies as a transgender man wants to have his uterus surgically removed, and he says Obamacare requires the state to pay for it.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A woman from Pennsylvania who now identifies as a transgender man wants to have his uterus surgically removed, and he says Obamacare requires the state to pay for it.", "title": "Transgender man says Obamacare requires Pennsylvania to pay for uterus surgery", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/8/transgender-man-says-obamacare-requires-pennsylvan/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/08/Obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/08/Obamacare.jpg", "description": "A woman from Pennsylvania who now identifies as a transgender man wants to have his uterus surgically removed, and he says Obamacare requires the state to pay for it.", "card": "summary", "title": "Transgender man says Obamacare requires Pennsylvania to pay for uterus"}, "Author": "Bradford Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, Julie Chovanes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat we provide health care and health benefits to ensure people are healthy and are able to engage in a full life, you certainly don\u2019t question what it costs to provide treatments for any number of health care needs.\u201d\nA woman from Pennsylvania who now identifies as a transgender man wants to have his uterus surgically removed, and he says Obamacare requires the state to pay for it.\n\u201cAnd then, of course, people have to have medical care afterward for all kinds of hormone treatments.\nUnderlying the debate on who should pay for the surgeries is whether such procedures even work to treat transgender people.\n\u201cUnder Obamacare, it\u2019s got to be provided,\u201d said Julie Chovanes, a transgender woman who represents the plaintiff and is executive director of the Trans Resource Foundation."}
