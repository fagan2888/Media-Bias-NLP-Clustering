Keeping adversaries like China and Russia at the negotiating table was likely expensive \u2013 even though both have much to gain from the relaxation of international sanctions on Iran. Both look forward to ramped-up arms sales and increased trade with Iran, but even so, neither China nor Russia hands out diplomatic wins to the United States without some payback. The proposed acquisition of high-tech chipmaker Micron by a state-owned Chinese company may signal the sort of quid pro quo we will see in months to come.\n\nThe very day that President Obama announced that the P5+1 nations had reached an accord with Iran aimed at reining in that country\u2019s nuclear ambitions, China\u2019s Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. announced its intention to bid $23 billion for Micron Technology, the last remaining U.S. supplier of memory chips. This would be the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company to date; the prior top acquisition was the $7 billion takeover of Smithfield Foods by Shuanghui International in 2013.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Important Things to Know About the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nSome analysts are skeptical that the deal will go through. First, the apparent premium of 19 percent for a stock that is off 50 percent in the past year is stingy. Investors have sold the shares because of slowing demand for PCs, the biggest market for the type of memory chips that Micron produces. Second, the transaction should raise red flags for security reasons.\n\nChina has long made it clear its intent to build a high-quality domestic semiconductor capability, an essential building block for today\u2019s technology industries and one it has yet to develop. Tsinghua's potential purchase of Micron would be a giant step forward in reaching that objective. Memory chips are vital to many consumer goods like smart phones and cameras, but are also an essential ingredient in high tech defense products.\n\nWill the United States object to the deal? The Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, representing multiple federal agencies, is tasked with blocking any acquisitions that could undermine U.S. security. In 2005, such considerations led CFIUS to nix the purchase of Unocal by CNOC, China\u2019s state-owned oil company.\n\nThat suggests a likely challenge to Unigroup\u2019s takeover of Micron. A lengthy 2012 piece on China\u2019s semiconductor quest in a Wharton periodical noted, \u201cChina\u2019s semiconductor designers and manufacturers still face some restrictions on access to technology due to longstanding worries over use of such know-how in military applications.\u201d Will those ongoing concerns drive CFIUS to object to the purchase of Micron? Or did China extract a wink and a nod from John Kerry that if they backed the Iran agreement, the U.S. might become a little more lenient on exporting our technology. Stay tuned.\n\nRelated: Tom Cotton Sharpens His Knives for Obama\u2019s Iran Nuke Deal\n\nIt is not only China that may have required sweeteners to stand by the U.S. Russia, too, may have needed some wooing. That likely accounted for the otherwise unfathomable public relations coup Secretary of State John Kerry handed Vladimir Putin when he met the Russian leader in Sochi this past May. Even The New York Times recognized the photo op for what it was \u2013 a \u201cdiplomatic victory\u201d for the former KGB head whom the Obama administration had been ignoring and attempting to isolate for months.\n\nAs The Times noted, the meeting \u201cwas widely interpreted [in Moscow] as a signal of surrender by the Americans \u2014 an olive branch from President Obama, and an acknowledgment that Russia and its leader are simply too important to ignore.\u201d Russia, said The Times, had proved \u201cstubbornly important\u201d on the world stage, especially \u201cin the negotiations that secured a tentative deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d\n\nKeeping Russia in place may also explain our refusal to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons \u2013 despite encouragement from Congress for providing such assistance. In recent comments made to legislators, both Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and incoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Marine General Joe Dunford said they were in favor of providing lethal arms to Ukraine.\n\nPresident Obama and John Kerry were desperate to clinch a \u201clegacy-making\u201d agreement, and willing to make enormous concessions to that end. The frantic push to conclude a deal with Iran led the Obama team to backtrack on numerous early demands, such as dismantling Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, promised \u201canytime, anywhere\u201d inspections \u2013 including military sites -- and the insistence that Iran provide information about past weapons-related research on detonators and delivery mechanisms. What we don\u2019t know is what other concessions were made to our negotiating partners.\n\nRelated: The Long, Confusing History of Iran\u2019s Frozen Assets\n\nSkepticism about the deal springs not only from the sense that the U.S. was willing to give up more than the Iranians (even though it\u2019s their economy that needs help), but also from the lack of any gestures of good will from Iran. They still hold at least three Americans hostage; they still march through the streets shouting Death to America; they still support terrorist groups in the Middle East. Just six days ago Iran extended a $1 billion line of credit to Syria \u2013 a good clue as to where the $100 billion they will receive from sanctions relief might go.\n\nSkepticism also arises from the self-congratulations offered up by Iran\u2019s President Rouhani, who said that the deal satisfied all of Tehran\u2019s objectives: termination of all sanctions (including arms and proliferation sanctions) as soon as the agreement goes into effect, continued nuclear research and development on advanced systems, and ongoing operation of its main enrichment plants. Mr. Rouhani must have a sense of humor; he stressed that \u201cIran will keep a watchful eye on powers\u2019 compliance\u201d since \u201ccertain powers have left a dark record in complying with their undertakings.\u201d He added, for good measure that \u201cIran is only after peace and security in the region.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "What did the Iran deal cost the U.S.?", "title": "The Hidden Costs of the Iran Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/15/Hidden-Costs-Iran-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-obama_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/15/Hidden-Costs-Iran-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-obama_2.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "What did the Iran deal cost the U.S.?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca657\"", "article_summary": "Related: The 8 Most Important Things to Know About the Iran Nuclear DealSome analysts are skeptical that the deal will go through.\nWhat did the Iran deal cost the U.S.?\nKeeping adversaries like China and Russia at the negotiating table was likely expensive \u2013 even though both have much to gain from the relaxation of international sanctions on Iran.\nThe frantic push to conclude a deal with Iran led the Obama team to backtrack on numerous early demands, such as dismantling Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, promised \u201canytime, anywhere\u201d inspections \u2013 including military sites -- and the insistence that Iran provide information about past weapons-related research on detonators and delivery mechanisms.\nBoth look forward to ramped-up arms sales and increased trade with Iran, but even so, neither China nor Russia hands out diplomatic wins to the United States without some payback."}
