So, apparently, was VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, who evidently took at face value the corrupt VA statistics \u2014 and who, after a distinguished military career, resigned.\n\nProbably not taken by surprise was Yale Law Professor Peter Schuck, who identified the problems at the VA before the scandal broke in his recently published book, \u201cWhy Government Fails So Often and How It Can Do Better.\u201d\n\nSchuck is no libertarian who wants to do away with government altogether. He says he has voted for every Democratic presidential candidate but one since 1964.\n\nThe federal government, he notes, does more things than ever and gets less respect than ever from the people it purports to serve. There is, he argues, a connection between these two trends.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is a case in point. Writing well before the current scandal, Schuck notes that the VA\u2019s budget has more than doubled in real terms over a dozen years, from $45 billion in 2000 to $154 billion in 2012, and that it hired many more claims processors.\n\n\u201cYet as Congress keeps authorizing new benefits and makes eligibility easier, the backlog (now 900,000 claims) grows steadily worse due to the agency\u2019s continued reliance on paper records, its perversely designed production quotas that encourage employees to reach for the thin folders first, the numerous refilled and appealed claims after denials, and its lax definition of disability to include common age-related conditions.\u201d\n\nReaching for the thin folders first, it turns out, was not the worst of it. The waiting list scandal uncovered at the Phoenix VA hospital was not just the product of a few miscreants.\n\nAs the VA inspector general\u2019s report makes clear, there was a widespread conspiracy to keep veterans off the official waiting lists. Dozens if not hundreds of VA employees must have cooperated and colluded.\n\nEach of them knew what was going on. Each knew that they were cheating and violating the rules. And many understood that bonuses and promotions hinged on the success of their conspiracy.\n\nSo the Phoenix VA hospital reported that the average waiting time for medical appointments was 24 days \u2014 short of the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 goal of 14 days but within ballpark range.\n\nBut the actual waiting time, according to the IG\u2019s report, was 115 days. That is orders of magnitude greater than the 14-day goal.\n\nWhen ObamaCare was under consideration in Congress, liberal bloggers like Ezra Klein called the VA health system \u201cone of the most remarkable success stories in American public policy.\u201d It was an example of \u201cwhen socialism works in America.\u201d\n\nTrue, in some respects the VA system performs admirably. Its work on prosthetics has helped many severely wounded veterans live productive and satisfying lives. And it\u2019s also true that some VA units perform better than others. Death rates and IV-line bloodstream infections are far better at the top-rated Boston VA than in Phoenix, for example.\n\nBut, as the Ethics and Public Policy Center\u2019s Yuval Levin points out, \u201cCentrally run, highly bureaucratic public health-care systems that do not permit meaningful pricing and do not allow for competition among providers of care can really only respond to supply and demand pressures through waiting lines.\u201d Long queues are the price of free care.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to call for ending waste, fraud and abuse, and sometimes an administrative change can improve performance. Levin, who worked in the George W.
