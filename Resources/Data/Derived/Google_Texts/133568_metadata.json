Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta.\n\nIn a letter, Randy Evans, the attorney for Jackson Healthcare of Alpharetta warned Barlow that he was dallying with a slander suit for alleging that Jackson Healthcare and its CEO, Richard Jackson, were the sole entity behind Senate Bill 86, a measure sponsored by Beach and other Republicans that would have greatly curtailed malpractice lawsuits.\n\nThe bill was introduced in February 2015, and never moved.\n\nThe comments in question were made last week at the Cherokee County Republican Women\u2019s debate. You can find the exchange on this YouTube video around the 50-minute mark. Beach pointed to SB 86 as part of his fight to curtail the influence of trial lawyers and repair the alleged damage done by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe second signer on the bill is state Sen. John Albers, R- Roswell, considered one of the most conservative members of the state Senate.\n\nWhen his turn came to speak, Barlow said this:\n\n\u201cThis particular legislation is a form of crony politics. The only serious supporter of this particular bill is an organization called Jackson Healthcare. It\u2019s funded $100,000 in political contributions to my opponent and several other politicians\u2026. \u201cThis bill benefits nobody except them\u2026.\u201d\n\nJackson Healthcare\u2019s attorney took exception:\n\n\u201cThese statements are false and deceptive with actual knowledge. In addition, since neither Jackson nor Jackson Healthcare are public figures, the standard for imposition of liability is much lower than for public figures.\u201d\n\nEvans, as you know, is a member of the Republican National Committee and one of the most politically connected attorneys in Atlanta: Read the entire letter here:\n\nJackson Healthcare is a well-known financial figure in Georgia politics. CEO Richard Jackson put $500,000 into the pro-Jeb Bush Right to Rise PAC in 2015.\n\nNor is it unprecedented for the company to insert itself in local elections. In 2014, organizations with links to Jackson Healthcare attacked state Sen. Josh McKoon, R-Columbus, for his opposition to an earlier version of SB 86. The details can be found in this PeachPundit.com piece.\n\nThe Barlow camp pointed to the Beach campaign for the legal warning. \u201cThere is nothing to this besides bully tactics by the Beach campaign to try and shut Aaron up regarding his extensive campaign contributions from big business, particularly Jackson Healthcare,\u201d said Barlow spokesman Andrew O\u2019Shea.\n\nAbsent examining the cease-and-desist letter, the Beach campaign declined comment.\n\n***\n\nIf there were any doubts that Indiana is all-important to the Stop Donald Trump forces, there shouldn\u2019t be any more.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich said late Sunday he would suspend his campaign in Indiana in hopes that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz can score the winner-take-all primary.\n\nIn exchange, Cruz is stepping aside in New Mexico and Oregon, where Kasich\u2019s more moderate blend of conservatism is expected to do better.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the Party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee,\u201d Kasich strategist John Weaver said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that will be John Kasich, who is the only candidate who can defeat Secretary Clinton and preserve our GOP majority in the Congress.\u201d A tidbit on the topic from the Washington Post: The deal was discussed in a private meeting last week between Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe and Kasich chief strategist John Weaver in Hollywood, Fla., on the sidelines of the Republican National Committee meeting, said a source with knowledge of the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The deal was finalized Sunday in phone calls between the two advisers. *** The Guardian, a British newspaper, has a look at how protestors planned their unexpected appearance at Stone Mountain Park on Saturday: One dusty black car that pulled up to a toll at Stone Mountain park on Saturday looked like any other about to sputter into the Georgia park, but its driver had a plan: she handed the attendant a penny, then a second, and a third, on her way to $15. At three tolls nearby, drivers did the same, locking cars in traffic as far as the eye could see. As planned, that\u2019s when the protest against \u201cpro-white\u201d and pro-Confederate demonstrators began. Nearly 50 activists affiliated with Black Lives Matter and progressive groups jumped out of cars, unfurled banners against white supremacy, and passed out flyers to exasperated drivers, who honked horns and shouted obscenities. *** This Wall Street Journal piece has an unusual look at the commercial origins of America\u2019s gun culture. A taste: Having started with customers who needed guns but didn\u2019t especially love them, the industry now focused on those who loved guns but didn\u2019t especially need them. In the late 1800s, gun companies were innovators in advertising, among the first merchandisers to make extensive use of chromolithography, an early technique for producing multicolored print. Their calendars and other promotional materials were works of art, depicting exciting scenes in which gunmen faced off with bandits or beasts. ***\n\nIf there was any question about whether Dan Cathy was planning to support confidante Jim Pace in the Third Congressional District, think again.\n\nThe Chick-fil-A CEO and his wife co-hosted a reception supporting Pace at Glendalough Manor in Tyrone Thursday. The price per ticket? $250. Also on the host committee were state Reps. David Knight, R-Griffin, and Brian Strickland, R-McDonough.\n\nPace, of course, spearheaded the group of investors that helped Cathy bring Pinewood Studios to metro Atlanta. He\u2019s now running in the crowded primary to succeed the retiring Lynn Westmoreland in the conservative Third District.\n\nPace lost the first quarter fundraising battle in that race to dentist and former West Point mayor Drew Ferguson, but he had the most money in the bank out of all the competitors at the end of March. His $330,000 cash on hand was mostly due to money he put into his own campaign.\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of early fundraising, former U.S. Rep. Paul Broun reported fairly anemic numbers compared to his main opponent in the 9th District congressional primary, incumbent Doug Collins.\n\nBroun\u2019s campaign reported a little more than $65,000 in receipts through March 31, according to federal campaign finance filings. That\u2019s less than one-tenth of what Collins, R-Gainesville, saw in contributions during that same period.\n\nCollins\u2019 campaign attracted big money from political action committees, including those of top House Republicans Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy. We wrote all about the built-in fundraising advantages incumbents have last week and you can read that piece here.\n\nBroun, meanwhile, got most of his money from individual donors, including maximum donations from the CEOs of two oil companies, Whitaker Oil in Marbleton and Middleton Oil in Houston. His campaign kicked off April with more than $43,000 in the bank, again about a tenth of what Collins has on hand.\n\n\u201cIn just three weeks after announcing, I raised the money needed to the lay the foundation for my campaign. And, unlike Doug Collins, I did so without being bankrolled by establishment politicians like Paul Ryan,\u201d Broun said in a statement.\n\n***\n\nThe chair of the First District GOP has a bit of a counterpoint to the theatrics that unfolded two weekends ago in Georgia, when the first state delegates to the Republican National Convention were chosen.
