She\u2019s a living history of scandal, lies and spin,\u201d the video says, echoing a similar theme that has been unleashed by its House counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nWhile much of the focus of the campaign so far this year has been on how unfavorably voters view Trump, their opinion of Clinton isn\u2019t much better. In a number of states where Democrats are making plays to beat incumbent Republicans \u2013 including presidential battleground states Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2013 Clinton\u2019s popularity is below 30 percent, according to Morning Consult surveys.\n\nSome Democrats will privately admit concerns about Clinton\u2019s unpopularity, but most scoff at the notion that Clinton\u2019s challenges are comparable to Trump\u2019s. While Clinton has been under attack for years and been locked in a grueling primary with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), no one has spent much television money attacking Trump \u2014 yet.\n\nWhile her support is higher in states such as Florida and North Carolina, only about two in 10 voters have a favorable view of her in some of the more challenging states for Democrats, including Arizona and Missouri, where two of the Senate Democrats\u2019 star recruits are challenging Sen. John McCain and Sen. Roy Blunt.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blunt\u2019s campaign released a new video of its own, boosted by a small digital advertising buy, highlighting Kander\u2019s support for Clinton and her support for Obamacare, which remains unpopular in the Show-Me State.\n\nSadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said she is skeptical of the Republican effort.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans are desperate to do anything that will change the conversation from Donald Trump, and what choice do they have with a standard-bearer who regularly disparages women, immigrants and Hispanics,\u201d she said. \u201cEven Republican Senate leaders have acknowledged that Trump will be an albatross for their candidates.\u201d\n\nIn Kentucky, where only a quarter of voters have a favorable view of Clinton, the campaign has deployed someone on her behalf with a higher favorability from voters: former President Bill Clinton. When she was in the Bluegrass State over the weekend, speaking with voters in the Cincinnati suburbs Sunday, Clinton said the former president would be \u201cin charge of the economy\u201d if she was president. \u201cBecause, you know, he knows how to do it. Especially in places like coal country and inner-cities and other parts of our country that have really been left out,\u201d she said. The Clintons made around a dozen trips to Kentucky in May ahead of its presidential primary, but nearly half of them were taken by her husband, not the candidate herself. Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant who has served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director, said it is \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d whether the former secretary of State\u2019s own unpopularity will matter in a big way against Trump, who is also unpopular.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense for both sides to be prosecuting the arguments that they are, but November is still a very long way away,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "After months of attacks by Democrats aimed at down-ballot Republicans over Donald Trump's uncomfortable and controversial rise through the party's ranks, the GOP is attempting to reverse the playbook.", "title": "Republicans Try to Flip the Script on Down-Ballot Democrats", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1620, "identifier": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/052116-Hillary-Do-Over-1.jpg", "height": 1080}, "updated_time": "2016-05-21T13:13:25-04:00", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/2016/05/20/clinton-popularity-ballot/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After months of attacks by Democrats aimed at down-ballot Republicans over Donald Trump's uncomfortable and controversial rise through the party's ranks, the GOP is attempting to reverse the playbook.", "title": "Republicans Try to Flip the Script on Down-Ballot Democrats", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/052116-Hillary-Do-Over-1.jpg", "creator": "@eyokley", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Campaigns", "published_time": "2016-05-20T09:35:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T13:13:25-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MissouriEli"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After months of attacks by Democrats aimed at down-ballot Republicans over Donald Trump\u2019s uncomfortable and controversial rise through the party\u2019s ranks, the GOP is attempting to reverse the playbook.\nWhile much of the focus of the campaign so far this year has been on how unfavorably voters view Trump, their opinion of Clinton isn\u2019t much better.\nSome Democrats will privately admit concerns about Clinton\u2019s unpopularity, but most scoff at the notion that Clinton\u2019s challenges are comparable to Trump\u2019s.\nIn a number of states where Democrats are making plays to beat incumbent Republicans \u2013 including presidential battleground states Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2013 Clinton\u2019s popularity is below 30 percent, according to Morning Consult surveys.\n\u201cCan they really support Hillary Clinton?"}
