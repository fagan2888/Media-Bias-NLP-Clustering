A call to mediocrity, rather than to arms.\n\nErnst is the Iowa populist who bragged in election ads about castrating hogs as a young farm girl. By virtue of that, she said, she can be relied upon to \u201ccut pork\u201d once elected.\n\nIn victory, she happily announced she intends to \u201cmake them squeal\u201d when she arrives in the Capitol - \u201cthem\u201d being all the other politicians and public servants in Washington.\n\nThey are, you see, not professional or dedicated but an idle bunch of elitist wastrels who love taking folks\u2019 hard-earned money and throwing it away on foolishness. They can be overcome, though, Ernst promised, \u201cbecause this is the greatest nation in the history of mankind.\u201d\n\nLoud cheers. Of the thousands of others who\u2019ve promised the same thing, Ernst will be first to succeed.\n\nOf course, she didn\u2019t detail what pork she intends to cut.\n\nThe Iowa way\n\nErnst was light on policy throughout the campaign, instead preaching the \u201cIowa way\u201d and promising to take a \u201cgood hard look at entitlement programs.\u201d\n\nPresumably, though, the Iowa way (service, self-sufficiency, thrift) doesn\u2019t include eliminating the billions in agricultural subsidies \u2013 government handouts \u2013 that farmers in this nation of rugged individualists enjoy so much.\n\nRepublicans stormed to power in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, extended their majority in the House of Representatives and put a series of Democratic-leaning states under control of Republican governors in a midterm election that was a clear repudiation of President Barack Obama.

The Iowa way, Ernst explained in a triumph of circumlocution, \u201cmeans keeping America strong in the world, because the world is a safer place when America is the strongest nation in it.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa way also means preserving social security and Medicare, massive entitlement programs that happen to be massively popular and that threaten to mushroom out of control unless benefits are cut or taxes are raised to pay for them.\n\nTogether, in fact, defence, medicare/medicaid and social security account for most mandatory government spending.\n\nOh, and Ernst also wants to abolish the IRS.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter. Because elections no longer have anything whatever to do with fact and everything to do with peddling homilies that reinforce existing biases and ignorance.\n\nAfter touching lightly Tuesday night on a few of the nation\u2019s problems, Ernst launched into a story about how her mother taught her values \u201cnot with a lecture or a book\" \u2014 bookishness now having become an elitist thing \u2014 \"but with plastic bread bags.\u201d\n\nShe only had one pair of good shoes growing up, apparently, and on rainy days her mother protected them with bread bags.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t embarrassed. Because every day when it rained and I got on the school bus, there were rows and rows and rows of other kids just like me with plastic bread bags tied to their feet.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell (left), pictured with his wife, former United States Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, is about to become the Senate Majority leader - easily the most powerful Republican in America. (John Sommers/Reuters)\n\nNow, I went to school with military brats, some of them from large families in which a corporal or a private was the sole earner, people who seemed to eat nothing but macaroni \u2014 and still, they arrived at school in those cheap gum-rubber galoshes that cost about a dollar a pair. We all did. I suspect Ernst\u2019s hog farmer dad could afford a pair, too.\n\nBut the bread-bag story is the sort of up-by-the-bootstraps trope every politician here needs to carry around nowadays.\n\nThe subtext is that formal education, as opposed to good old common sense, is elitist, and that growing up on a fixed or low income (except for welfare or unemployment insurance) somehow confers a deep wisdom unavailable to the more affluent.\n\nSo treasured is that notion in modern America that during the last presidential election, even Ann Romney, wife of the ultimate one-per-center, had to come up with a story about their struggles as a young couple. They ate off an ironing board, or something.\n\nErnst wound up her victory speech describing \u201can America where no matter who your parents are or what neighbourhood you grew up in, you have the chance to succeed. An America where it doesn\u2019t matter who you know, all that matters is how hard you work ...\u201d\n\nAn imaginary place, in other words.\n\nPolitical pandering\n\nIt\u2019s actually unfair to single out Ernst. She\u2019s just pandering, and who can blame her? In U.S. politics, the people are the boss, and the boss is consulted every two years and the boss can be a dunce.\n\nThe boss sometimes fires good employees on a whim, often prefers nasty to smart and can evince little interest in bothersome facts. The boss loves uncomplicated aphorisms designed to free him/her from the civic burden of considering complex solutions.\n\nI just spent a few days in Kentucky speaking to the boss. It\u2019s impossible to do that and not feel sorry for the people campaigning.\n\nWith the exception of one voter (and he was rich and educated), most people wanted to talk about how much they despise politicians, who never do anything for them.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. midterm elections, the issue is whether Obama, his congressional Democrats and the newly robust Republican majorities will be able to break the legislative gridlock that has gripped the U.S. capital in recent years. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nKentuckians tend to despise Obamacare, the president\u2019s signature health care law, and they\u2019ll tell you so.\n\nThen they\u2019ll allow that Kynect, the state\u2019s online insurance exchange, is a pretty darned good thing. It\u2019s provided insurance to the previously uninsured in that have-not state, and made coverage affordable for those struggling along on minimum wage.\n\nKynect, of course, is Obamacare. Just don\u2019t call it that.\n\nAlso, Obama clearly hates coal miners, and wants to take people\u2019s guns away (gun ownership has risen sharply on Obama\u2019s watch).\n\nOf course, Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat vying for Kentucky\u2019s Senate seat, tailored her message accordingly, running hard against Obama. All she managed to do was irritate her party. She lost.\n\nFor my money, the fellow who did win in Kentucky is the sort of person you want in high office. Mitch McConnell is about to become the Senate Majority leader, easily the most powerful Republican in America.\n\nIn his victory speech, he kept the pandering to a minimum and talked about trying to work with Democrats to maybe get a few things done in Washington.\n\nThat may seem a bit rich coming from a leader who\u2019s made it his mission to obstruct Barack Obama, but McConnell has had the guts to stand up to the messianic, loopy, far-right flank of his party, the people who want to wreck and starve government rather than actually govern.\n\nIf Joni Ernst is as smart as McConnell, she\u2019ll set aside the castration shears and wade into serious policy issues. Sucking up to the boss is easy, but it\u2019s no path to greatness.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2014/11/06", "description": "Republican Joni Ernst, an adept at hacking testicles off hogs, is on her way to Washington with castration accoutrements in hand, writes Neil Macdonald", "application-name": "www.cbc.ca", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/republicans-may-have-trouble-making-washington-s-hogs-squeal-neil-macdonald-1.2824576", "image": "http://i.cbc.ca/1.2824670.1415206603!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/usa-elections-iowa.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republican Joni Ernst, an adept at hacking testicles off hogs, is on her way to Washington with castration accoutrements in hand, writes Neil Macdonald", "title": "Mrs. Castrator goes to Washington, round up the hogs: Neil Macdonald"}, "vf": {"section": "2.633", "unique_id": "1.2824576"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.cbc.ca/1.2824670.1415206603!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_460/usa-elections-iowa.jpg"}, "site": "@cbcnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "keywords": "Medicaid, Health issues, General news, Ann Romney, Congress, Mitch McConnell, Health, Government and politics, United States Senate, Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky, Crime, White House, Laws, United States, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Neil Macdonald, Medicare, U.S. Democratic Party, Campaigns, Washington(US), Internal Revenue Service, Iowa, Presidential elections, Government spending, Senate, Joni Ernst, U.S. Republican Party, Agricultural subsidies, Elections", "fb": {"app_id": 578347858989863}, "msApplication-PackageFamilyName": "CanadianBroadcastingCorpo.CBC_pw8q9bvavk68p", "msApplication-ID": "App", "original-headline": "republicans-may-have-trouble-making-washingtons-hogs-squeal-neil-macdonald"}, "article_summary": "Ernst is the Iowa populist who bragged in election ads about castrating hogs as a young farm girl.\nJoni Ernst, an adept at hacking testicles off hogs, is on her way to Washington, castration accoutrements in hand.\nMitch McConnell is about to become the Senate Majority leader, easily the most powerful Republican in America.\nIn U.S. politics, the people are the boss, and the boss is consulted every two years and the boss can be a dunce.\nThey can be overcome, though, Ernst promised, \u201cbecause this is the greatest nation in the history of mankind.\u201dLoud cheers."}
