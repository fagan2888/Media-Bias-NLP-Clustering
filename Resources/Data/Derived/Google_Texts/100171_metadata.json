It is named for St. Pope John Paul II\u2019s 1995 encyclical \u201cThe Gospel of Life\u201d and the honor carries a $10,000 prize.\n\nThe medal was presented to Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, by Carter Snead, a professor in the Notre Dame School of Law and director of the Center for Ethics and Culture. In his comments before the presentation, Snead praised the Knights for their \u201cheroic and tireless efforts\u201d in responding to St. Pope John Paul\u2019s call to affirm a culture of life and to protect the most vulnerable members of society.\n\nSnead cited some of the contributions of the Knights, including tens of millions of dollars and volunteer hours donated to worthy causes and ongoing support for various pro-life initiatives.\n\nCarl Anderson, Supreme Knight since 2000, accepted the award on behalf of the Knights of Columbus and announced that the $10,000 prize was being donated to the Notre Dame Charles E. Rice Fellowship Fund, named for the late law professor Anderson described as a good friend and \u201ctireless advocate for life.\u201d\n\nAnderson spoke about the challenges to a culture of life in the United States, and cited President Barack Obama\u2019s speech at the 2009 Notre Dame graduation. In that speech, the president said that a way to find common ground on the abortion issue was \u201cto honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion and draft a sensible conscience clause\u201d for the Health and Human Services mandate implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called \u201cObamacare\u201d).\n\n\u201cSix years later, that goal has still not been achieved,\u201d Anderson said, going on to innumerate the various revisions to the mandate requiring employers to provide insurance for contraceptives and drugs that can be abortifacient.\n\n\u201cThe history of the HHS mandate shows an administration grudgingly walking back its proposal only by the smallest steps and only when ultimately forced to do so by judicial action,\u201d Anderson said, \u201cand in the end, not really walking it back at all.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has been \u201cstubbornly intransigent,\u201d even after discussions with Catholic bishops, cardinals and the Vatican Secretary of State, he continued.\n\n\u201cDuring a time when the search for common ground and consensus received heightened rhetoric in Washington, the (Affordable Care) Act itself has become an example of the way in which Washington is becoming less democratic and less capable of consensus,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nThe message of the HHS mandate is that \u201cCatholic institutions remain free to fashion their own identity as long as that identity conforms to the dictates of government,\u201d he explained. And this adds to concern over the potential for government control of the U.S. economy through \u201cHHS mandate-style regulation that goes far beyond what we may have imagined a few years ago.\u201d\n\nAnderson said the HHS mandate \u201crests upon the myth that women\u2019s social and economic equality\u201d depend upon reproductive services \u201cimposed, if necessary, by government.\u201d In reality, he continued, \u201cthe mandate is not necessary to protect women\u2019s rights\u201d and is merely \u201ccover\u201d to \u201cfurther secure the emancipation of men from the responsibilities of fatherhood.\u201d\n\nThe Knights\u2019 leader concluded by calling for \u201cbold action,\u201d saying, \u201cIt is time for Catholics to take up a new evangelization of American freedom,\u201d for Catholic institutions must be allowed to fulfill their mission of treating each human person with dignity.\n\nThe free exercise of religion must be preserved, he stressed, for \u201cthe autonomy of our religious institutions is not extrinsic to the missionary nature of Christianity; rather it is essential to it.\u201d\n\nBishop Kevin C. Rhoades of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend celebrated a special 5 p.m. Mass in Sacred Heart Basilica before the award dinner. In his homily, he noted that it was appropriate to celebrate the Evangelium Vitae Mass during the season of Easter, for the season is about life and the victory of the Risen Christ over death.\n\nThe readings for the Fourth Sunday of Easter \u201care a proclamation of life,\u201d he observed, and he focused on the Gospel of the Good Shepherd, who not only defends His sheep, but is willing to lay down His life for them.\n\n\u201cIn the world today, there are wolves who seek to devour the sheep,\u201d the bishop continued. \u201cThere are those who sow hatred, malice, doubt and confusion. They destroy human life. They attack it in the womb. In the name of a false mercy, they attack it at its end. All this happens here in our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cAnd then in the world, there are the wolves who seek to devour the sheep simply because they profess the name of Jesus or because they are of another religion.\u201d\n\nBishop Rhoades said that \u201cthe culture of death seems to be expanding every year,\u201d and St. Pope John Paul II, \u201cever the good shepherd,\u201d addressed this fact by urging the building of a new culture of life.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus, he continued, heeded that call, and their leader, Carl Anderson, \u201chas been a good shepherd in leading the Knights in service of the Gospel of Life.\u201d Further, he said, the Knights have been \u201cexemplary\u201d in heeding St. Pope John Paul\u2019s call to support and promote human life through the service of charity.\n\n\u201cThey bear witness to the sanctity of life through volunteer works of charity, education, advocacy, and prayer\u201d and \u201care untiring in their service of the Gospel of Life. They are loyal sons of the Church, ever ready to support the Church and our bishops in working to build a new culture of life.\u201d\n\nBishop Rhoades reminded the congregation that every Christian also is called to be a good shepherd by practicing the Works of Mercy and by evangelizing those who do not belong to the sheepfold of the Church.\n\n\u201cThe Gospel of Life is for the whole of human society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Church is convinced, and the Knights of Columbus hold this firm conviction, that a new culture of life, a new culture of love and solidarity, is for the true good of the whole of human society.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs St. John Paul II wrote: \u2018Only respect for life can be the foundation and guarantee of the most precious and essential goods of society, such as democracy and peace,\u2019\u201d Bishop Rhoades concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today's Catholic is a Catholic news service dedicated to presenting important news, articles and information to the parishioners of the Fort Wayne / South Bend diocese.", "generator": "WordPress 3.4.1", "robots": "all,follow,index", "revisit-after": "20 days", "owner": "The Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne & South Bend, Indiana", "distribution": "global", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 The Diocese of Fort Wayne - South Bend - http://www.diocesefwsb.org", "verify-v1": "JIDbvuWpt15+kQvSbGUcL9X5BYs/P4cOPukDTkPxxro="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb18c\"", "article_summary": "By Ann CareyNOTRE DAME \u2014 The Knights of Columbus became the fifth recipients of the annual University of Notre Dame Evangelium Vitae Medal at a banquet on the university campus Sunday evening, April 26.\nThey destroy human life.\nThe medal was presented to Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, by Carter Snead, a professor in the Notre Dame School of Law and director of the Center for Ethics and Culture.\nThe medal has been awarded annually since 2011 by the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture to honor individuals or organizations for outstanding work affirming and defending the sanctity of all human life.\nIt is named for St. Pope John Paul II\u2019s 1995 encyclical \u201cThe Gospel of Life\u201d and the honor carries a $10,000 prize."}
