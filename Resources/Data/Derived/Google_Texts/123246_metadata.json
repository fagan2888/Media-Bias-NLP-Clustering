The agency says pigs have expanded from 17 to 39 states in the past three decades, causing damage to property, livestock, crops and natural habitats.\n\nLast month, Reuters reported that the USDA is even seeking to buy thermal imaging night vision equipment to help hunt pigs at night.\n\nAccording to hog expert Billy Higginbotham, a professor at Texas A&M, the wild pig is the most prolific large mammal on the planet. And while there\u2019s no wild pig census, the best \u201cguesstimates\u201d place overall U.S. wild pig population at between 4 million and 8 million.\n\nProfessional hunter Darrell Corbyn, who isn\u2019t bidding on the job but works for developments and ranches in Texas, said he\u2019s had death threats from people who don\u2019t quite understand the nature of his work.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, they breed at too fast a rate and nothing kills them off and so they reproduce at levels the habitat can\u2019t sustain,\u201d said Mr. Corbyn, who runs a business about 90 miles northwest of San Antonio with his father called Hogstoppers.\n\n\u201cA hog will eat absolutely anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey clean out everything edible on the land, and that starves out the rest of the animals.\u201d\n\nMr. Corbyn said the near-weekly death threats he used to get \u2014 mostly from England, oddly \u2014 all but stopped once he posted an answer to the question he said he gets all the time: Is killing wild hogs really necessary?\n\nIn his online explanation, he wrote that wild hogs are alien species and that they kill young livestock, fawns and other animals.\n\n\u201cIf you insist on leaving the wild hogs alone, then wouldn\u2019t you be killing cute little fawns and all of those other animals by proxy?\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn their announcement back in March, USDA officials didn\u2019t mention anything about killing wild hogs. But even in the dry language of a federal contract solicitation, it\u2019s clear that \u201cdispatching\u201d can only mean one thing.\n\n\u201cShould a dispatched pig be dispatched outside of normal business hours \u2026\u201d the solicitation advises contractors, \u201ctake a digital picture with file location of deceased pig at location of dispatch.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The feds are offering big money to anyone who can hunt and kill wild pigs on federal lands in South Carolina \u2014 the latest move in the government's battle against an invasive species causing an estimated $1.5 billion in damage to farmland and property each year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The feds are offering big money to anyone who can hunt and kill wild pigs on federal lands in South Carolina \u2014 the latest move in the government\u2019s battle against an invasive species causing an estimated $1.5 billion in damage to farmland and property each year.", "title": "\u2018Pork\u2019 spending may curb invasive wild hogs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/15/pork-spending-may-curb-invasive-wild-hogs/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/15/wildpigs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/15/wildpigs.jpg", "description": "The feds are offering big money to anyone who can hunt and kill wild pigs on federal lands in South Carolina \u2014 the latest move in the government's battle against an invasive species causing an estimat", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Pork\u2019 spending may curb invasive wild hogs"}, "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, US Department Of Agriculture, Darrell Corbyn"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28d4\"", "article_summary": "And while there\u2019s no wild pig census, the best \u201cguesstimates\u201d place overall U.S. wild pig population at between 4 million and 8 million.\nIn their announcement back in March, USDA officials didn\u2019t mention anything about killing wild hogs.\nIn his online explanation, he wrote that wild hogs are alien species and that they kill young livestock, fawns and other animals.\nBut even in the dry language of a federal contract solicitation, it\u2019s clear that \u201cdispatching\u201d can only mean one thing.\nThe job comes with some very specific directives for the \u201ctrapping and dispatching\u201d of wild pigs."}
