Can a jargon-filled consent form, written by lawyers and medical researchers, really help?\n\nThese are the communications challenges that bioethicists faced when they began exploring the ethical implications of the new world of comparative-effectiveness research, in which patients are randomly prescribed treatment options in a doctor\u2019s office. This study, led by David Magnus, PhD, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, and bioethicists from the Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute and University of Washington, will result in policy guidelines for conducting ethical research within medical practices. While their final recommendations won\u2019t be out until later this fall, the group has just released three short videos that can be used by investigators to help explain key research concepts to patient volunteers.\n\nEvaluating treatment effectiveness\n\n\u201cThis project was launched in the aftermath of a controversial research consent form used in a study that compared two oxygen-delivery levels for extremely premature babies,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cWhile many of us argued that the research was done in an appropriate fashion, there were critics who disagreed. Even though these at-risk infants were randomly assigned to one of two standard treatment options, some felt that the clinical risks of standard practices should be seen as research risks. Researchers, the public and the bioethics community were deeply divided on whether the consent form adequately warned parents about participation risks. To avoid these ambiguities in the future, we decided to launch a study to explore better ways to explain these risks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/09/videos-explain-concepts-of-clinical-research.html", "image": "http://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm-news/images/2014/09/ethics-video.jpg", "site_name": "News Center", "description": "Bioethicists are releasing videos and policy guidelines that aim to promote more ethical comparative-effectiveness research within medical practices.", "title": "Videos explain concepts of clinical research"}, "description": "Bioethicists are releasing videos and policy guidelines that aim to promote more ethical comparative-effectiveness research within medical practices.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Even though these at-risk infants were randomly assigned to one of two standard treatment options, some felt that the clinical risks of standard practices should be seen as research risks.\nWhile their final recommendations won\u2019t be out until later this fall, the group has just released three short videos that can be used by investigators to help explain key research concepts to patient volunteers.\nCan a jargon-filled consent form, written by lawyers and medical researchers, really help?\nEvaluating treatment effectiveness\u201cThis project was launched in the aftermath of a controversial research consent form used in a study that compared two oxygen-delivery levels for extremely premature babies,\u201d Magnus said.\nResearchers, the public and the bioethics community were deeply divided on whether the consent form adequately warned parents about participation risks."}
