CANNES, France (AP) — A year ago, writer-director Rick Famuyiwa was struggling to find financing for his film after studios in Hollywood passed on it. Now, he’s sitting in a restaurant at Cannes riding the sensation of “Dope,” his comic Los Angeles coming-of-age tale that sparked a bidding war this year at the Sundance Film Festival.

“It’s pretty freaking awesome,” Famuyiwa says, tipping back his white fedora. “Here we are less than a year later. It’s been crazy from Sundance to here. I haven’t quite gotten any perspective on it yet, but I’m enjoying the moment.”

“Dope” premiered Friday in the Cannes Film Festival’s Directors’ Fortnight section with most of its young cast enthusiastically in tow. It’s a large group, including star newcomer Shameik Moore, Zoe Kravitz, ASAP Rocky, Tony Revolori and others. While many indies that make it to Cannes arrive with a small retinue, “Dope” is here in full force — and some cast members even paid their own way to come.

“Dope” is a buoyant, stereotype-busting high-school movie about a geek (Moore) in Inglewood, California, who’s aiming to get into Harvard but is thrust into a rollicking adventure when drug dealers looking for a hiding place stuff his backpack full of Ecstasy.

The close bond between the cast comes partly out of the unlikeliness of their journey. “Dope” was made last summer in a rapid 24-day shoot around Los Angeles.

“We were making something we all believe in,” says Famuyiwa.

But at first, it was difficult to find backers who also believed in it.
