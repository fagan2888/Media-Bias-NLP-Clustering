Kurtz professor of entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of \u201cWhite House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You.\u201d\n\nOne of the better ideas to surface during the early financial reform discussions was to create some form of national institute of finance, an independent body that could support outstanding research and help develop a broader understanding of lurking risks. In the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, largely through the efforts of Senators Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island (who introduced specific legislation),and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, this became the Office of Financial Research.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nUnfortunately, while the office had well-intentioned parents, it was also cursed at birth by a modern Carabosse (the bad fairy who curses Sleeping Beauty). Timothy Geithner, then Treasury secretary, strongly opposed the creation of an independent body focused on diagnosis and assessment of systemic risks. Not being able to talk the Senate out of taking some action in this direction, Mr. Geithner fell back on a standard bureaucratic trick \u2013 he took the Office of Financial Research into the Treasury and set about ensuring that it would never be particularly effective.\n\nFour years down the road, it looks as though Mr. Geithner largely got his way. It would take a sweeping change and perhaps new leadership for the vision of Senators Reed and Warner to become something close to reality.\n\nThere are many excuses offered for the Office of Financial Research\u2019s lackluster results. It is still hiring (as reflected in a recent report to Congress), its mandate overlaps those of other agencies (the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission have proved hard to work with), and the analytical problems are daunting.\n\n\n\nAll this may be true, but it does not fully explain why the office\u2019s reports make, at best, for such uninteresting reading. And based on the testimony Wednesday by its director, Richard Berner, to the economic policy subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, its briefings to Congress are unlikely to prove any more informative.\n\nIn the view of the subcommittee\u2019s chairman, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, a clear lesson from the financial crisis is \u201cthat we need to do a much better job of identifying and addressing systemic risk before it\u2019s too late.\u201d But the hearing did not provide any discernible improvement along those lines.\n\nMr. Geithner\u2019s perspective on financial system surveillance seems to have been shaped largely by his time as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, although his previous experience at the International Monetary Fund and Treasury may have played a role.\n\nIn this approach, officials largely defend existing practices of the financial sector and provide generous support when important firms need assistance. The board of the New York Fed, for example, has long represented the financial elite of that city. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, was a member of that board in early 2008 \u2013 and declined to resign, even though the Fed helped his company buy Bear Stearns. Quite why the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors did not suggest or force his resignation, to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest, remains a puzzle.\n\nThe Office of Financial Research could have been set up to be more independent of Treasury \u2013 and this was part of the original intent. It has an independent budget, but appears to operate very much under Treasury\u2019s wing.\n\nCompare this with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is also nominally within Treasury but which has been much more independent \u2013 and, under its current director, Thomas J. Curry, much more effective.\n\nThe Office of Financial Research is not a complete loss. For example, among its research papers is some sound work by Rick Bookstaber and others. (Mr. Bookstaber\u2019s book on the financial crisis, \u201cA Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds and the Perils of Financial Innovation,\u201d written before he joined the office, deserves to be widely read.)\n\nBut the office\u2019s data page provides details on just one initiative, and I don\u2019t find much more of substance in its agenda (a sampling of which is provided by their news and events page as well as elsewhere on its website). The 2013 annual report was not impressive; it read like some of the less informative systemic risk assessments that we saw prior to 2007.\n\nAnd the office\u2019s most high-profile product was its report on asset management, about which Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets had this to say in a blistering comment letter:\n\nIt appears to confirm some of the worst suspicions that O.F.R. is influenced by and biased toward the too big-to-fail sell-side banks that dominate Wall Street. After all, rather than focusing on the known systemic risks that they pose, which materialized just five years ago and which inflicted widespread economic wreckage across the country, O.F.R. chooses to take aim at the asset management buy-side of the financial industry, which, by comparison, presents much lower risk and played no role or virtually no role in the most recent financial crash.\n\nIt is all very disappointing, particularly given that the office\u2019s annual budget is running at a remarkable $86 million (see Page 119 of the 2013 report).\n\nThere is much more that the Office of Financial Research could do, including \u2013 just as one example \u2013 Eric A. Posner and E. Glen Weyl\u2019s idea of establishing a form of Food and Drug Administration for complex financial products. It is currently far too easy to create financial products that have toxic systemic side effects. We used to allow such unregulated innovation for pharmaceutical products but learned the very hard way that this is not in the social interest.\n\nOver all, the Office of Financial Research is very disappointing. Mr. Berner can and should turn this important agency around.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140130000158, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Dimon, James;Geithner, Timothy F;Reed, Jack;Warner, Mark R", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "_featured", "published_time": 1391058118, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-30T05:01:58-05:00"}, "keywords": "Dimon James,Geithner Timothy F,Reed Jack,Warner Mark R,Banking and Financial Institutions,Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010),Federal Reserve System,Office of Financial Research (United States Treasury),Treasury Department,Today's Economist,Uncategorized,_featured", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/The Disappointing Office of Financial Research ( 20140130 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Simon Johnson", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Simon Johnson", "byl": "Simon Johnson", "twitter": {"description": "The Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research seems to have little gusto for taking on the biggest banks and the dangers they pose, an economist writes.", "title": "The Disappointing Office of Financial Research", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/the-disappointing-office-of-financial-research/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002679012, "description": "The Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research seems to have little gusto for taking on the biggest banks and the dangers they pose, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 30, 2014", "org": "Federal Reserve System;Office of Financial Research (United States Treasury);Treasury Department", "utime": 20140130050158, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140130, "pdate": 20140130, "des": "Banking and Financial Institutions;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "The Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research seems to have little gusto for taking on the biggest banks and the dangers they pose, an economist writes.", "title": "The Disappointing Office of Financial Research", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/the-disappointing-office-of-financial-research/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/the-disappointing-office-of-financial-research/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Disappointing Office of Financial Research", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 30, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1d9\"", "article_summary": "Over all, the Office of Financial Research is very disappointing.\nThe Office of Financial Research is not a complete loss.\nThe Office of Financial Research could have been set up to be more independent of Treasury \u2013 and this was part of the original intent.\nThere is much more that the Office of Financial Research could do, including \u2013 just as one example \u2013 Eric A.
