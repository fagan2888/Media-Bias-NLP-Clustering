They will buy out shareholders and take the company private, which will immediately eliminate one of Molex\u2019s biggest expenses: $150 million paid annually as a dividend to shareholders.\n\n\u201cAs a public company Molex had a lot of pressure to pay out a big dividend,\u201d Steve Feilmeir, Koch\u2019s chief financial officer, told Forbes. \u201cWe believe we can grow the business with our focus on capturing more opportunities as opposed to being limited by whatever capital is left over after the dividend.\u201d\n\nKoch will pay Molex shareholders $38.50 per share.\n\nBased in Illinois, Molex was founded in 1938 as a company that produced a coal-based plastic called Molex, according to Forbes. The company eventually moved away from making plastic products and into electrical sensors and eventually high-speed data connections.\n\nNow with 38,000 employees, the company makes about 19% of its revenue from the automotive industry \u2013 including the sensors used in crash-avoidance systems \u2013 and 21% from mobile devices.\n\nFrederick and John Krehbiel, the grandsons of the company founder, said selling the 75-year-old company came only after careful consideration of the deal.\n\n\u201cOur board of directors and our family believe that this transaction, which follows a diligent and thorough review process by the board, provides outstanding benefits for all our stakeholders,\u201d Fred Krehbiel said in a statement. \u201cThe transaction is expected to provide substantial opportunities for our worldwide employees, many of whom have spent much of their working lives at Molex and are responsible for the company\u2019s long-term success.\u201d\n\nThe two brothers leave the deal with about $2 billion in cash for themselves and family trusts, according to Forbes.\n\nThe deal is the second-biggest ever for Koch. The largest is the 2005 purchase of Georgia-Pacific for $21 billion, according to the New York Times.\n\nKoch is expected to bring its Market-Based Management system to Molex. In the past, some executives with purchased companies have had difficulty making the transition to the Koch method of management.\n\nMolex will remain a independent subsidiary of Koch, according to Feilmeir.\n\nGet Free Updates!
