A photograph of President Obama holding a small, white poodle with only three legs has unleashed a score of snickering from Russia, with top Kremlin aides allegedly pointing out the contrast with President Putin’s own recently snapped photo — of him stroking a snow leopard.

A twitter account in the name of Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted out photos of the two world leaders — the first, of Mr. Putin, dressed in rugged outdoor wear, seated on the ground against a chain link fence, stroking a snow leopard that was half in his lap, The Hill reported. And the second?

It was a photograph of Mr. Obama, in full business suit, standing and holding a small white puppy — a poodle — pressed tightly against his chest.

The tweet in the name of Mr. Rogozin also contained the message: “We have different values and allies.”

Mr. Putin’s photo hails from Sochi National Park, during the president’s visit to endangered Persian leopards. The picture of Mr. Obama was reportedly snapped during his run for the Senate, The Hill reported.
