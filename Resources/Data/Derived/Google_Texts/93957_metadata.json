(Dina Ismailova)\n\nChelsea Clinton, Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, spoke at her mother\u2019s campaign headquarters in West Chester to rally support and recruit canvassers on Monday, April 25.\n\nWest Chester Mayor Carolyn Comitta presented Chelsea Clinton with a key to the city prior to her speech.\n\n\u201cI think of this as a key to the future,\u201d said Comitta, \u201cand the Clinton family is a key to our future.\u201d\n\nComitta, the first female mayor of West Chester, endorsed the Clinton campaign.\n\n\u201cWe need elected officials who can work with everyone to make a better world for our children,\u201d Comitta said.\n\nChair of the Chester County Democratic Committee Brian McGinnis also attended the event. Both were personally thanked and recognized by Chelsea Clinton.\n\nAround 50 people were into the meeting room at Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters on West Gay Street to hear the former \u2013 and possibly future \u2013 president\u2019s daughter speak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to hear a young advocate speak,\u201d said Michael Niemeyer of East Goshen. \u201cLike her parents, she is eloquent in that respect.\u201d\n\nThe Trump rally drew most of the campus\u2019s attention, but dedicated Hillary Clinton supporters still showed to hear Chelsea Clinton and show their support through phonebanks and door-to-door canvassing.\n\n\u201c(Hillary Clinton) is one of the only candidates that has a clear, precise plan,\u201d said Owen Moore, a senior criminal justice major. \u201cShe\u2019s not offering promises. She\u2019s not running a demagogue campaign.\u201d\n\nWhile some attendees were solid in their support of Clinton, others, like Tom Vee of West Chester, were still hesitant.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see the Clinton family in person. I hear a lot about them in the media, and I want to peg them down for myself,\u201d Vee said.\n\nChelsea Clinton began her speech by declaring, \u201cThis is the most important presidential election of my life.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton voted for her mother earlier this week in New York.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I could care more about politics until I became a mother,\u201d she said.\n\nChelsea Clinton, who is expecting her second child, commented that she was \u201cquite visibly pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worry that everything I care most about is at risk\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe need to build upon the progress made by Obama.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton spoke highly of the Affordable Care Act and recalled her mother\u2019s advocacy for the program in the early nineties.\n\n\u201cI remember in \u201893 and \u201894, when my mom fought for universal healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard my mom say, \u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019 We have to continue to fight for progress, for our children.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Clinton advocated strongly in favor of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which assists in providing coverage to children and mothers.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, we had more pregnant women with access to prenatal care, able to give birth in safe environments than ever before in American history,\u201d said Chelsea Clinton.\n\nChelsea Clinton promoted her mother\u2019s bipartisan successes, saying, \u201cWe need a fighter, but we also need a problem solver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in an increasingly dangerous world,\u201d said Chelsea Clinton. \u201cI hope my children feel about me someday as I do about my mother.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton spoke for around 30 minutes and afterwards answered questions from the crowd, which included questions about mental health issues and clarification on Affordable Care Act reform.\n\nOn mental health issues, Chelsea Clinton said, \u201cNot only should we invest in mental health services, we need to invest in research. We don\u2019t know enough about how each person can best live up to their potential.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton also addressed issues on mental health care for veterans, who have been long neglected in terms of mental health services.\n\n\u201cWe should give our veterans vouchers to receive treatment in the private sector, not sit around and wait,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said.\n\nChelsea Clinton said her mother supported enfranchising pharmacists into the healthcare system, and challenged pharmaceutical providers that overprice drugs.\n\n\u201cWe need to expand the statute so the government has the authority to launch investigations when drug companies aren\u2019t just funding research, or covering costs, but exploiting people at their most vulnerable,\u201d said Chelsea Clinton.\n\nSome attendees were high school students, voting for their first time in the primary on Tuesday, April 26.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset that most people my age don\u2019t care about who our next president is going to be,\u201d said a local high school student and Hillary Clinton supporter.\n\nChelsea Clinton attributed the problem to a lack of early civic education.\n\n\u201cOnly 12 states currently require civics courses,\u201d said Chelsea Clinton. \u201cMy mom was an early supporter of universal voter registration at 18. If we sent draft cards to every man when they turned 18, we can send voter registration to everyone.\u201d\n\nAt the speech\u2019s conclusion, many attendees set out to canvass both in person and over the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for all you have done and will do to support my mom,\u201d said Chelsea Clinton.\n\nMoore considers Hillary Clinton to be \u201cthe most experienced and prepared for the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wish more college students would realize that instead of just \u2018feeling the Bern\u2019 because it\u2019s popular,\u201d said Moore.\n\nDoug Myers is a is a fourth-year student majoring in liberal studies with minors in philosophy and journalism.
