The wisdom of this is hard to dispute when you look at the sums (see the chart above and the details explained below). The reality is that most under-30s are struggling to pay their rent.\n\nOthers who can afford to save are put off by the perceived complexity: \u201cWhat do I invest in? How do I invest in it?\u201d I, for one, would like to hand my 21-year-old self a savings plan. The relevance extends to any first-time investor. Even if you\u2019re a novice at 31 or 41, this is what I would suggest... (and please post your own savings plans in reader comments)\n\nThere is a bewildering array of funds to invest in \u2013 most of them managed by average and overpaid mangers, will fall behind the market. To avoid this disappointment, you can buy a \u201ctracker\u201d fund, which aims to replicate an index such as the FTSE 100.\n\nYour best bet is to go for a global tracker, so you can get some benefit from other parts of the world if Britain\u2019s fortunes falter. One of the cheapest options is Fidelity\u2019s Index World fund , which charges 0.3pc a year, or \u00a330 on a \u00a310,000 Isa fund.\n\nThe Vanguard LifeStrategy100pc Equity fund is slightly cheaper at \u00a324 a year but also charges a one-off 0.1pc, or \u00a310 for every \u00a310,000 of money you put in. These are essentially ready-built, faff-free portfolios. There are lots of other weird and wonderful funds you can dabble in once you have some core money in trackers, and in later life you may want to pick your own shares. For now, trackers keep it simple.\n\nISA Investing made simple from Telegraph Investor >>\n\n2. Pick the cheapest Isa seller\n\nWhen I was 21 there were plenty of stockbrokers but few options for holding your different investments in one place. Today the range of \u201cinvestment shops\u201d is huge. Here, you can open an account and each year use your \u00a315,000 Isa allowance, buying shares or funds, be it in lump sums or \u201cdrip feeding\u201d at say \u00a3100 a month.\n\nThis is where you buy that tracker fund. You already face a 0.2pc to 0.3pc charge taken out of the fund so you want to pay as little as possible to the middleman.\n\nIn terms of these costs, Isa shops broadly fall into two groups \u2013 those that charge a percentage fee (good if you have smaller amounts) and those that charge a flat fee (good for larger sums).\n\nA wise strategy for the novice investor is to start with an Isa shop with a low percentage fee, ideally less than 0.3pc. These include Charles Stanley Direct or Cavendish Online (both 0.25pc). Then, once your savings have reached a reasonable size \u2013 around \u00a330,000 \u2013 move them to a rival that charges a low flat fee such as Alliance Trust Savings (\u00a375 a year) or Interactive Investor (\u00a380 a year).\n\nAn option if you don\u2019t want to move is to consider Trustnet Direct at the start; it charges 0.25pc but with a \u00a3200 cap. Or the no-frills iWeb service charges \u00a325 to set up an account and \u00a35 to buy and sell funds but no other fees.\n\n3. Maximise a company pension\n\nYour employer should offer some sort of \u201cmatching\u201d. You want to take full advantage, even before getting an Isa. Commonly, you put in 5pc, your company puts in 5pc as its default rate. But if you raise your amount to 6pc, they might put in 6pc. It\u2019s money for nothing. Call your HR department and ask them to explain how you can get the company to make the maximum contribution at the least cost to you. When you move jobs, move your money to your own private pension . . .\n\n4. Get a Sipp\n\nSelf-invested personal pensions are offered by most of the investment shops and attract similar tax breaks to company pensions. Once you\u2019ve optimised your works pension and are paying a bit into Isas, think about a Sipp to mop up those old pensions. It doesn\u2019t mean lots of complicated decisions if you just follow all of the above advice \u2013 start with a simple, low-cost fund and worry about the fancy stuff later down the line.\n\nWhy you urgently need a savings plan\n\nEarnings will peak when you\u2019re 35\n\nThe age at which pay peaks is getting earlier \u2013 and this has huge implications for the way you save. Three charts published here, using data from the Office for National Statistics, suggest a shift is under way.\n\nRather than looking at overall earnings, this data drills into the situation of people at a particular age. It follows those who were 21 in 1975, 1985 and 1995 and charts what they went on to earn throughout their careers, also factoring in inflation.\n\nThe conclusion? The peak earning age has moved from 53 (for those born in 1958) to 46 (for those born in 1968).\n\nFor those born in 1978, the Thatcher generation, the pattern is obviously yet to be concluded but the figures open the possibility that the peak may already have occurred \u2013 possibly at age 35.\n\nThe crunch of the last few years, when overall wages have grown at a slower pace than inflation, may have effectively robbed that generation, the tail-end of \u201cGeneration X\u201d, of their peak earnings.\n\nPossibly they\u2019ll have a second wind and challenge that 35-year-old peak \u2013 of \u00a314.50 an hour or \u00a329,500 annually \u2013 if the economy and wages improve in the coming years.\n\nOne bright spot for this wave of workers is that overall they have had higher salaries than those born in the Fifties or the Sixties, measuring in today\u2019s money.\n\nAs ever with statistics, these conclusions are not foolproof (there are many ways to carve up the numbers), but the suggested trend may resonate with many in the workplace, especially in London\u2019s booming jobs market, where employees in dynamic industries often fear they must make hay while their skills remain relevant and in demand.\n\nHow to alter your saving plans\n\nIf you are aged less than 30 today and wondering if your salary will rise much further, you\u2019d be wise to alter your savings plan. What savings plan, today\u2019s twentysomethings may cry.\n\nPutting aside the numerous financial challenges faced by younger Britons \u2013 the comparable battle to buy property, as the data (above) shows \u2013 it\u2019s crucial that plans are made for long-term savings given that state pension could be woefully inadequate for today\u2019s younger generation.\n\nAnd despite efforts to increase the take-up of pensions through auto-enrolment, through which workers are all put into a pension plan and must ask to opt out, a gulf between what needs to be saved and what has been saved already exists.\n\nEven in the auto-enrolment scheme the contributions are pitifully low.\n\nThe bottom line is that you must act yourself. \u201cThe Government is not going to help you do this, or your company,\u201d said John Blowers, head of Trustnet Direct, the investment shop. \u201cYou have to do it yourself and you have to start as young as possible.\u201d\n\nA flatlining in wages earlier in life matters much to your retirement plans, especially when you consider that pension statements that project your retirement income assume that your wages will keep rising.\n\nEven over a modest period, this effect can have noticeable consequences for your pension. If you save \u00a3100 a month for 20 years, with 6pc investment growth factored in, you would end up with \u00a346,791.\n\nBut factor in modest rises of 3pc in the contributions, because your salary increases each year, and the figure grows to \u00a359,403.\n\nThat\u2019s a very noticeable \u00a312,600 difference. But the bigger point is that saving early has the most dramatic effect on your final pot.\n\n\u00a3207,000 bonus for saving early on\n\nSave \u00a3100 a month from 40 to 65 and you will end up with \u00a369,300, with the assumption of the same 6pc annual growth after charges.\n\nBut start at age 30 and you would accumulate \u00a3142,500. Start at 21 and the figure is \u00a3276,000. The effects of compound interest, where gains are added to last year\u2019s gains, miraculously grow your money faster than seems imaginable.\n\nFinding that money as a twentysomething may not feel achievable, but there are ways and means.

Achieving that would require a savings pot of around \u00a3760,000.\n\nWhat savings advice would you give yourself?
