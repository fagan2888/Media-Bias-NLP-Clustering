Renner, SD

Nikki Venjohn gets into a helicopter at Strawbale Winery with her boyfriend today. She thinks it's just a normal flight, but she's in for a surprise.

While the couple got a bird's-eye view of some of Sioux Falls sights, Venjohn's boyfriend, Steve Hennigs, had big plans.

"I've always been around aviation and I work on airplanes over in Clark and I just wanted something airplane related," Hennigs said.

He knew people over at the Vanguard Air Squadron and he asked them to create hearts in the sky with their planes. While the couple was up in the air, he popped the question.

When they landed, Venjohn had a ring on her finger. It was a familiar ride, with a great twist.

"We actually came here last year for technically our first date on Valentine's Day and he surprised me with all this last year so coming back here and seeing it all again was kind of fun," Venjohn said.

The two met in Clark through mutual friends.

"They kind of brought us together," Hennigs said. "They did a good job, cheers to them."

The couple is still coming back to Earth after an unforgettable flight. While he set the bar high for himself, Hennigs says he's already preparing for future anniversaries.

"I'm pretty confident I'll come up with something," Hennigs said.
