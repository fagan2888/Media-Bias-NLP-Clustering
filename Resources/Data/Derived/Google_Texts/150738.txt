Two brothers survived two massive avalanches while skiing in Colorado's backcountry even though both feared the other was dead.

KUSA-TV reports that Alex and Brian Holmes were skiing near Telluride, from Trout Lake to Ophir, on Wednesday.

The San Miguel County Sheriff's Office says that Brian started to descend near Waterfall Canyon when he triggered an avalanche, which he saw sweep his brother out of sight.

When Alex Holmes tried to ski down, he triggered a second slide and tried to return to Trout Lake for help, believing Brian was dead.

The sheriff's office says Brian was mostly buried in snow. He escaped and started an hour-long search for Alex, who had contacted search and rescue personnel.
