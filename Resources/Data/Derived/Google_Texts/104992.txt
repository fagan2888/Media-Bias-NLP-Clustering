Nuritsa Grigoryan

On February 18, 2014, Nuritsa Grigoryan was convicted on charges of healthcare fraud conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to misbrand pharmaceutical drugs, false statements to the Federal Government, and conspiracy to use other persons' identification documents in furtherance of fraud. Grigoryan, along with co-conspirators Dr. Kenneth Johnson and Artak Ovsepian, were found guilty for their roles in a $20 million healthcare fraud scheme involving fraudulent prescriptions for expensive antipsychotic drugs. Grigoryan was scheduled to be sentenced in June 2014. She was released after trial and ordered to wear an ankle monitor. Investigators believe that Grigoryan removed her ankle monitor. Grigoryan may be residing in a hidden location in the greater Los Angeles area or may have fled to Armenia after recently obtaining travel documents from the Armenian Consulate. Ovsepian is currently in custody and awaiting sentencing while Johnson is being monitored before being sentenced.
