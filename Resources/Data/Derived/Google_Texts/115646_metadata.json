Jay Nixon and St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, Watkins said he suspects the hospital coordinated a scheme \"to steal newborns of color for marketing in private adoption transactions.\"\n\nST. LOUIS \u2014 Eighteen black women who were told decades ago that their babies had died soon after birth at a St. Louis hospital now wonder if the infants were taken away by hospital officials to be raised by other families.\n\nThe suspicions arose from the story of Zella Jackson Price, who was 26 in 1965 when she gave birth at Homer G. Phillips Hospital in St. Louis. Hours later, she was told that her daughter had died, but she never saw a body or a death certificate.\n\nNo one is sure who was responsible, but Price\u2019s daughter ended up in foster care, only to resurface almost 50 years later. Melanie Gilmore, who now lives in Eugene, Oregon, has said that her foster parents always told her she was given up by her birth mother.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nPrice\u2019s attorney, Albert Watkins, is asking city and state officials to investigate. In a letter to Gov. Jay Nixon and St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, Watkins said he suspects the hospital coordinated a scheme \u201cto steal newborns of color for marketing in private adoption transactions.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s story spread in recent weeks after Gilmore\u2019s children tracked down her birth mother as part of a plan to mark their mother\u2019s 50th birthday. The search led them to the now 76-year-old Price, who lives in suburban St. Louis.\n\nIn March, an online video caused a sensation when it showed the moment that Gilmore, who is deaf, learned through lip reading and sign language that her birth mother had been found.\n\nThe two women reunited in April. DNA confirmed that they are mother and daughter.\n\n\u201cShe looked like me,\u201d said Price, a gospel singer who has five other children. \u201cShe was so excited and full of joy. It was just beautiful. I\u2019ll never forget that,\u201d she said of the reunion.\n\nAfter the reunion, Watkins started getting calls from other women who wondered if their babies, whom they were told had died, might have instead been taken from them.\n\nTheir stories, he said, are strikingly similar: Most of the births were in the mid-1950s to mid-1960s at Homer G. Phillips. All of the mothers were black and poor, mostly ages 15 to 20.\n\nIn each case, a nurse \u2014 not a doctor \u2014 told the mother that her child had died, a breach of normal protocol. No death certificates were issued, and none of the mothers were allowed to see their deceased infants.\n\n\u201cThese are moms,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThey are mothers at the end of their lives seeking answers to a lifelong hole in their heart.\u201d\n\nHe plans to file a lawsuit seeking birth and death records. None of the women are seeking money, he said.\n\nWatkins has no idea who, or how many people, may have been responsible if babies were being taken, though he believes they were stolen and put up for adoption in an era when there were few adoption agencies catering to black couples.\n\nHomer G. Phillips Hospital opened in 1937 as a blacks-only hospital at a time when St. Louis was segregated. Even after desegregation in the mid-1950s, the hospital served predominantly African-American patients.\n\nThe hospital closed in 1979. Messages seeking comment from officials at the St. Louis Health Department were not returned.\n\nPrice gave birth to a baby girl born two months\u2019 premature on Nov. 25, 1965. The baby weighed just over 2 pounds but Price was able to hold the crying child after birth.\n\nA nurse took the baby away and came back an hour later. The little girl was struggling to live, Price was told. She might not make it.\n\nShortly thereafter, the nurse came back. The baby, she said, was dead.\n\nPrice recovered in the hospital for two more days, in a ward surrounded by happy mothers.\n\n\u201cIt was depressing to see when they rolled the babies in and they were taking them to their mothers, but I didn\u2019t have my baby,\u201d she recalled.\n\nGussie Parker, 82, of St. Louis, heard Price\u2019s story and was shocked by the similarities with her own life. Parker gave birth to a premature girl on Nov. 5, 1953.\n\nInitially, she said, the child seemed fine. A short time later, a nurse told her that her daughter had died.\n\n\u201cI never did see the baby or get a death certificate,\u201d said Parker, whose daughter, Diane, works for The Associated Press in New York. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young and someone comes and tells you that your baby\u2019s dead, in those days you accepted it.\u201d\n\nOtha Mae Brand, 63, of St. Louis, was 15 when she gave birth to a girl in the spring of 1967. The child was two months\u2019 premature and was hospitalized for 10 days while Brand was sent home.\n\nShe got a call from a nurse who informed her of her daughter\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI had no reason not to believe them,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI got that phone call and that was the last I heard.\u201d\n\nNow, she wonders.\n\n\u201cI told my children, \u2018It\u2019s a possibility your sister may be living,'\u201d she said.\n\nRetired physician Mary Tillman was an intern and did a residency at Homer G. Phillips in the 1960s. Calls to her home on Friday were unanswered, but she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the hospital had protocols and record-keeping to track mothers and daughters. She never had any suspicions of wrongdoing, but said it should have been doctors, not nurses, who broke the news of death to mothers.\n\nPrice, who has five other children, said she\u2019s saddened by the lost years that she could have spent with her daughter.\n\n\u201cFor me not to be able to love on this child like I did with the others, I\u2019m going through a lot of emotions,\u201d said Price. \u201cBut I\u2019m so blessed to know that she is alive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a letter to Gov.
