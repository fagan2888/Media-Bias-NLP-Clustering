This season\u2019s flu bug hasn\u2019t infected nearly as many as last year\u2019s, but it has sickened more people than the average over the past five years.\n\nThe surge caused Banner Health, the region\u2019s largest hospital system, to implement new restrictions on visitors. People with flulike symptoms such as fever, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea are asked to not visit Banner hospitals.\n\nThe restriction also applies to children younger than 13. Siblings who do not exhibit flulike symptoms are allowed to visit a newborn, but they must be screened first.\n\nThis season, younger and middle-age adults are facing more severe cases that require a hospital stay, public-health experts said. Six out of 10 people who have been hospitalized for the flu nationwide this season were ages 18 to 64, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.\n\nOne potential culprit: The flu subtype that is infecting most people is H1N1, the same virus that triggered the swine-flu pandemic in 2009. This virus has circulated since 2009, but it hasn\u2019t become the dominant strain until this season.\n\nThe flu vaccine protects against H1N1, and public-health experts urge people who have not yet been vaccinated to do so. It typically takes up to two weeks to build resistance following a vaccination.\n\nDr. Lisa Villarroel, who oversees the Arizona Department of Health Services unit that tracks flu trends, said the higher infection rate among younger adults is a matter of concern because members of that group tend to skip vaccination.\n\nSo far this season, 41 percent of Arizona flu cases have occurred among those ages 19 to 49.\n\n\u201cThat happens to be the population that does not get their flu shots that often,\u201d Villarroel said.\n\nCDC data show that just 27 percent of Arizona adults 18 to 64 were vaccinated during the 2012-13 flu season. Only Florida had a lower rate among all states, according to Trust for America\u2019s Health, a non-profit that advocates disease prevention.\n\nArizona\u2019s children and seniors had higher vaccination rates last flu season, bringing the state\u2019s overall vaccination rate to 38 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see that number much higher,\u201d Villarroel said.\n\nA flu shot is recommended for everyone over 6 months. It\u2019s particularly important for children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with chronic health conditions who are at risk for severe complications from the flu. Common underlying health risks include asthma, diabetes, heart problems, kidney disease, obesity and HIV.\n\nFlu shots are widely available at doctors offices and pharmacies, and insurance plans are required to cover them as a free preventive service under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nVillarroel said flu trends suggest that the number of cases in this state is climbing. Arizona labs confirmed 569 cases over the past week to bring the 2013-14 season total to 1,580 cases. That number likely represents only people whose doctor ordered a test. Many flu patients don\u2019t seek medical care, and not all doctors order tests for people with flulike symptoms.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s confirmed flu cases and \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d measures show more flu-related activity in neighboring New Mexico and California.\n\n\u201cI would expect our numbers would continue to increase over the next couple of weeks,\u201d Villarroel said, adding that it\u2019s difficult to project flu trends.\n\nHospitals and doctors in metro Phoenix said they have not yet been inundated with people who have flulike symptoms, but they nevertheless are preparing for more patients and sick visitors over the next couple of weeks.\n\nJoan Ivaska, Banner Health\u2019s senior director of infection prevention, said that Banner does not normally restrict child visitors but that the hospital group decided to do so this year because the H1N1 strain has been more prevalent among younger groups.\n\n\u201cWe felt it would be in the best interest of our patients to restrict children visitors, similar to what we recommended in 2009,\u201d Ivaska said. \u201cChildren carry higher viral loads.\u201d\n\nJohn C. Lincoln, with two hospitals in Phoenix, expects to put up signs in lobbies and common areas next week urging visitors to consider delaying visits if they have flulike symptoms.\n\nJim Dearing, medical director for John C. Lincoln\u2019s physician network, said this year\u2019s flu season is starting to pick up pace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely gaining momentum right now,\u201d Dearing said. \u201c(But) most of the (patients) have not been severely ill.\u201d\n\nPhoenix Children\u2019s Hospital this week reported an uptick in parents seeking care for children at clinics, but the hospital\u2019s emergency room has been less busy compared with past years. The CDC said the flu has killed 20 children nationwide, but none has died of the flu in Arizona.\n\nArizona does not report flu-related deaths among adults, but the state does track \u201cpneumonia and influenza\u201d reported on death certificates. So far, there have been 76 such deaths this year, far fewer than the 215 deaths reported at this point last flu season.\n\nReach the reporter at ken.alltucker@arizonarepublic.com.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Ken Alltucker", "description": "Arizona hospitals take steps to slow flu surge,The flu has surged across Arizona, prompting some hospitals to restrict visits by infected people to prevent its spread to vulnerable people.", "pubdate": "Tue Jan 21, 2014 12:52 AM", "creditline": "The Republic | azcentral.com", "headline": "Arizona hospitals take steps to slow flu surge", "section": "News", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2t3s", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "title": "Arizona hospitals take steps to slow flu surge"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Arizona hospitals take steps to slow flu surge, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"description": "The flu has surged across Arizona, prompting some hospitals to restrict visits by infected people to prevent its spread to vulnerable people.", "title": "Arizona hospitals take steps to slow flu surge", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/news/arizona/articles/20140118arizona-hospitals-flu-spread.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "account_id": 13115682}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a24\"", "article_summary": "So far this season, 41 percent of Arizona flu cases have occurred among those ages 19 to 49.\nThe CDC said the flu has killed 20 children nationwide, but none has died of the flu in Arizona.\nCDC data show that just 27 percent of Arizona adults 18 to 64 were vaccinated during the 2012-13 flu season.\nThe CDC\u2019s confirmed flu cases and \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d measures show more flu-related activity in neighboring New Mexico and California.\nSo far, there have been 76 such deaths this year, far fewer than the 215 deaths reported at this point last flu season."}
