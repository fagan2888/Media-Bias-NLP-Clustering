He asked the Capobiancos to allow him to be a part of her life and to see and speak to her on a regular basis.\n\n\"I know that the Capobiancos love Veronica very much and will provide her with a good home. It is my greatest hope that we can work together on a solution that is best for Veronica,\" he said.\n\nBrown's attorneys also asked the South Carolina couple for mercy, and to do everything in their power to make sure a criminal charge of custodial interference against Brown in South Carolina is dismissed.\n\n\"It is something that is within your control, and we ask that you listen to your heart and get rid of those proceedings,\" said Cherokee Nation Assistant Attorney General Chrissi Nimmo.\n\nNimmo said the best thing for Veronica is for litigation to end and for healing to begin.\n\nBrown had this message for his daughter: \"I miss you more than words can express, you'll always be my little girl, my little princess and I will always love you until the day I die.\"\n\nBrown and his attorneys are also asking for the Capobiancos to keep a commitment to keeping Veronica connected to her Cherokee culture.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Dusten Brown announced Thursday morning he's dropping his legal fight to win custody of his biological daughter, the girl known as Baby Veronica.", "author": "Craig Day", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/23657724/biological-father-of-baby-veronica-dusten-brown-drops-legal-fight", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23657724_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dusten Brown announced Thursday morning he's dropping his legal fight to win custody of his biological daughter, the girl known as Baby Veronica.", "title": "Biological Father Of 'Baby Veronica,' Dusten Brown, Drops Legal Fight"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23657724_SA.jpg", "description": "Dusten Brown announced Thursday morning he's dropping his legal fight to win custody of his biological daughter, the girl known as Baby Veronica.", "card": "summary", "title": "Biological Father Of 'Baby Veronica,' Dusten Brown, Drops Legal Fight"}, "wnreadableurl": "biological-father-of-baby-veronica-dusten-brown-drops-legal-fight", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2013/10/10", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS10", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd189b\"", "article_summary": "It was an emotional end to a custody battle between little Veronica's biological dad and her adoptive parents in South Carolina.\n\"I know that the Capobiancos love Veronica very much and will provide her with a good home.\nBrown's attorneys also asked the South Carolina couple for mercy, and to do everything in their power to make sure a criminal charge of custodial interference against Brown in South Carolina is dismissed.\nBrown said it's no longer fair for Veronica to be caught in the middle of a custody fight.\nDusten Brown and the Cherokee Nation are dropping all ongoing litigation and asked Veronica's adoptive parents for mercy in allowing Brown to see the 4-year-old little girl."}
