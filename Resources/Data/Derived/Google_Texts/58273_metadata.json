It\u2019s the law widely known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation decided to see what Obamacare has meant for Michigan and the results of their survey are out today.\n\nIf Marianne Udow-Phillips, director of the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation, had to grade the ACA, it would earn \u201ccertainly no lower than a B.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has done so much to expand coverage for so many people in our state and really across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still an incredibly controversial law and there are a lot of states that have not benefited the way Michigan has, which is why I can\u2019t quite get it to that A mark. But it\u2019s certainly doing a really good job in Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe survey shows that the ACA has decreased the number of uninsured people in the state of Michigan. In 2012, around 14% of people surveyed reported being uninsured. The survey conducted last fall revealed that that number decreased by half. Only 7% reported being uninsured.\n\nFurthermore, there was a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in the number of people who cited cost as the reason they did not pursue medical care when it was needed. Around a fourth of the people who listed this as an issue in 2012 did not list it as an issue last fall.\n\nHowever, this law is complicated, Udow-Phillips said. While it has generally been a success \u2013 when the entire population is looked at \u2013 some individuals are left unhappy.\n\n\u201cThey might not be getting coverage that they like as well as what they had before,\u201d Udow-Phillips said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is unfortunately all about. There are averagings that occur under a law like this, so younger people might be paying more, older people are paying less. And overall, people are getting more coverage, but some of them may not have wanted that coverage.\u201d\n\nThe ACA provides what Udow-Phillips calls an \u201cexpansive set of services,\u201d some of which not all people need or want.\n\n\u201cIt is a very complicated law; not everybody is a winner in this law,\u201d she said. \u201cMore people seem to be doing better than losing however.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Law", "description": "Five years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law.
