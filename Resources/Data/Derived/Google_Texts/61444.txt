The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa is suing its own doctor, saying he is claiming ownership of surgical equipment the hospital helped create, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

Segundo J. Gonzalez, a surgical oncology fellow, worked with Yanhui Guo, a professor at St. Thomas University in Miami, to develop “GoogleGlass for Surgeons,” which uses 3-D ultrasound technology to help surgeons better see patients' tumors during operations, the Times reported.

The hospital and Gonzalez filed a patent application together, but made him sign an agreement that anything he created while working at Moffitt would belong to the hospital, according to the Times.
