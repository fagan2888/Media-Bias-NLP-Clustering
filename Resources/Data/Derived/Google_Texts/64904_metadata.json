With the help of cutting-edge technology, scientists have revolutionized mobility for about 200,000 people in the U.S. living with a spinal injury, with \u201cReWalk,\u201d the first FDA-approved motorized exoskeleton device. The wearable robotic legs will be exclusively available in the U.S. market for those whose lower body is paralyzed from a spinal cord injury.\n\nThe product, manufactured by Argo Medical Technologies of Marlborough, Mass., was developed by founder Dr. Amit Goffer in 2001 after he was left paralyzed in an accident with an all-terrain vehicle in 1997, according to the company\u2019s statement. It was through his personal experience in using mobility devices that Goffer developed the ReWalk. It has been available in Europe since 2012.\n\n\u201cInnovative devices such as ReWalk go a long way towards helping individuals with spinal cord injuries gain some mobility,\u201d said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation, at the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a FDA statement. \u201cAlong with physical therapy, training and assistance from a caregiver, these individuals may be able to use these devices to walk again in their homes and in their communities.\u201d\n\nReWalk costs $69,500 and consists of a fitted, metal brace that supports the legs and part of the upper body; small motors that supply movement at the hips, knees, and ankles; a tilt senor, and a backpack that contains the computer and power supply. The device can be operated with a wireless remote control on the wrist. If necessary, crutches help the user with additional stability. Although it weighs 46 pounds, the user will only feel 5 pounds, which comes from carrying the backpack.\n\nTraumatic injury to the spinal cord can result in neurological impairments in any body system that is controlled by the affected nerves: musculoskeletal, respiratory, urinary, or gastrointestinal. Spinal cord injury patients cannot send signals below the level of the injury, which leaves them paralyzed. However, with an incomplete injury, the patient does have some movement and sensation below the injury, according to MedlinePlus.\n\nCandidates for the device have spinal cord injuries at levels T7 \u2014 the seventh thoracic vertebra \u2014 to L5 \u2014 the fifth lumbar vertebra. A rehabilitation version of the ReWalk is approved for people with injuries at levels T4 \u2014 the fourth thoracic vertebra \u2014 to T6 \u2014 the sixth thoracic vertebra. Patients and their caregivers are required to undergo training developed by the manufacturer to learn and demonstrate proper use of the device.\n\nThe FDA reviewed testing done to assess ReWalk\u2019s durability, its hardware, software, and battery systems, and other safety systems, to help minimize risk of injury in the event the device loses balance or power. Marine Capt. Derek Herrera, a paraplegic trained on the device, is said to be one of the first Americans to own one, USA Today reported. \"I see this as a milestone for people in my same situation,'' Herrera said in a statement from the company. \u201cIt will be incredible for me to regain independence, to use the system to walk and stand on my own.'\u201d\n\nThe FDA\u2019s marketing clearance for the device was granted after rigorous investigations that involved multiple clinical studies that show the safety and effectiveness of the technology. Not every spinal cord injury patient will be able to use the device. Those with a history of severe neurological injuries other than spinal cord injury, or other medical issues such as infection, or heart or lung conditions, the FDA said.\n\nThe manufacturing company will use a registry of patients to collect data on the side effects. Known risks associated with the device include pressure sores, bruising or abrasions, and associated injuries, and diastolic hypertension during use.\n\n\u201cThe person walks the system, the system does not walk them. The users are in control \u2014 when they want to sit, they sit, when then want to stand and walk, they do so,\u201d Goffer said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rewalk, paraplegic, paralyzed, spinal cord injury, robotic legs, exoskeleton, stand, sit, walk, fda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA has cleared the first robotic legs, \"ReWalk,\" to assist spinal cord injury patients regain their independence with the ability to stand, sit, and walk.", "title": "FDA Approves First Robotic Legs To Help Paralyzed Walk [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approves-rewalk-exoskeleton-help-paraplegics-stand-sit-and-walk-290298", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/paralyzed-woman-uses-rewalk-move.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA has cleared the first robotic legs, \"ReWalk,\" to assist spinal cord injury patients regain their independence with the ability to stand, sit, and walk.", "title": "FDA Approves First Robotic Legs To Help Paralyzed Walk [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approves-rewalk-exoskeleton-help-paraplegics-stand-sit-and-walk-290298", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/paralyzed-woman-uses-rewalk-move.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/paralyzed-woman-uses-rewalk-move.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-06-27T12:35:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T12:35:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA has cleared the first robotic legs, \"ReWalk,\" to assist spinal cord injury patients regain their independence with the ability to stand, sit, and walk."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbb3\"", "article_summary": "The wearable robotic legs will be exclusively available in the U.S. market for those whose lower body is paralyzed from a spinal cord injury.\nSpinal cord injury patients cannot send signals below the level of the injury, which leaves them paralyzed.\nCandidates for the device have spinal cord injuries at levels T7 \u2014 the seventh thoracic vertebra \u2014 to L5 \u2014 the fifth lumbar vertebra.\nWith the help of cutting-edge technology, scientists have revolutionized mobility for about 200,000 people in the U.S. living with a spinal injury, with \u201cReWalk,\u201d the first FDA-approved motorized exoskeleton device.\nNot every spinal cord injury patient will be able to use the device."}
