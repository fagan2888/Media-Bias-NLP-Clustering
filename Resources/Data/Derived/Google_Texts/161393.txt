In his latest column for the New York Times, Paul Krugman argues that Obamacare ultimately will work — and points to the California example as proof.

After conceding the rollout of Obamacare to have been “an epic disaster,” Krugman insists that the question is not so much about whether Obamacare’s start has been auspicious, but whether the disastrous unveiling is indicative of structural problems with the law, or if they were merely the consequence of bad management.

Looking to California, an extremely large state with a functional exchange market in which applications are surging, Krugman decides the answer is that bad management — not poor design — explains Obamacare’s early travails. “What we have in California, then, is a proof of concept,” Krugman writes. “Yes, Obamacare is workable — in fact, done right, it works just fine.”
