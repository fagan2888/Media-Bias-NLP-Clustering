I will get in Evander\u2019s face with compliments and good humor. I want to keep him very happy and very friendly. [...] Will you actually wear trunks in the ring? I was affectionately known as Bird Legs during high school. I\u2019m afraid the bird legs will be unveiled one more time. But I\u2019m very pleased that Under Armour has agreed to sponsor the bout. They have graciously sent me their apparel items, which I will avail myself of. So you will be sufficiently covered. It will be a modest performance. It will be a modest performance in more ways than one. Yes, I would expect. We will come in tuxedos. Then I will change. My son has procured a red silk robe complete with hood. And I\u2019ll have red silk shorts.\n\nLike I said before, good on Romney for (likely) making a fool out of himself for a good cause.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Punches for a good cause. .05/27/2016 9:12:24AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Punches for a good cause.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Fight Night: Mitt Romney to Box Evander Holyfield for Charity Tonight", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/05/15/fight-night-mitt-romney-to-box-evander-holyfield-for-charity-tonight-n1999639", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/135/f8ad4f33-4ab8-4d8a-882b-26257d81ffc5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Punches for a good cause.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Fight Night: Mitt Romney to Box Evander Holyfield for Charity Tonight", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2015/05/15/fight-night-mitt-romney-to-box-evander-holyfield-for-charity-tonight-n1999639", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/135/f8ad4f33-4ab8-4d8a-882b-26257d81ffc5.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Fight Night: Mitt Romney to Box Evander Holyfield for Charity Tonight, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "I first wrote about this when the fight was announced nearly two months ago, but today's the day: Mitt Romney will box Evander Holyfield tonight in Utah to raise money for CharityVision.\nLike I said before, good on Romney for (likely) making a fool out of himself for a good cause.\nIt will be a modest performance in more ways than one.\nAnd I\u2019ll have red silk shorts.\nMy son has procured a red silk robe complete with hood."}
