For an annual $2,000 fee, a patient can call Zwelling on her cellphone, drop into her Los Alamitos office anytime, or, for an additional cost, request a house visit. There are no insurance cards. Patients don\u2019t wait long to see her, and Zwelling\u2019s staff avoids drowning in hours of paperwork hoping for government reimbursements.\n\n\u201cI had to do this to be able to do my job,\u201d said Zwelling who has been an internist since 1987. \u201cI get to practice the way I think I can practice best. It\u2019s capitalism at its best.\u201d\n\nIn a post-Affordable Care Act enrollment landscape, some say a steady trickle of primary care physicians will abandon insurance companies and government regulations for the simplicity of charging patients directly. And more patients who have insurance may decide to also pay an additional fee on their own, because they want more one-on-one time.\n\nFor physicians, it\u2019s not about money, but fulfillment, said Bill Ross, executive director for the newly formed American College of Private Physicians. The group\u2019s goal is to educate the public and legislators about concierge medicine and to help physicians make the transition, Ross said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been accelerating in the last two years, primarily as a result of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a major trend, but there is an undercurrent.\u201d\n\nA study conducted by Medscape found that 48 percent of all American physicians felt they were fairly compensated in 2013, a decrease from 51 percent in 2012.\n\nThe same study found that 6 percent of those surveyed had started a cash only or concierge medicine practice in 2013, up slightly from 4 percent in 2012.\n\n\u201cWhen this first started, it was seen as elitist,\u201d Ross said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not that at all. Many of the patients starting to do this are blue collar. While (physicians) do have an upfront fee, it\u2019s a reasonable fee.\u201d\n\nBut not all physicians are in the position to forgo insurance completely, said Wayne Lipton, founder and CEO of Concierge Choice Physicians, a firm that helps doctors transition into variations of the concierge medicine model.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has assisted physicians in Beverly Hills, Burbank, and Torrance among other areas in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe cash-only model is very interesting right now,\u201d Lipton said. \u201cDoctors are fed up with government regulations and insurance.\u201d\n\nBut the trend toward cash-only, if it were to continue, might lead to some impacts across the country, Lipton said. During the recent recession, for example, patients couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily good for the entire country to go toward cash-only,\u201d he added.\n\nThe firm encourages hybrid practices, those that include doctors open to patients who want to pay cash only or those who have insurance. It\u2019s what Lipton calls a \u201ckinder, gentler approach,\u201d because it doesn\u2019t leave out people who can\u2019t afford care.\n\nBoth Ross and Lipton agree that the number of cash-only physicians are small in number. Patrick Johnston, president of the California Association of Health Plans, said concierge medicine will likely remain a niche market, especially in California, which is dominated by powerful health care systems.\n\n\u201cThe overall pattern is Californians rely on a health plan to cover most of the costs of medical care, and most physicians don\u2019t want to have a list of prices and bill the patients directly,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cIt remains a small option that is fine, but doesn\u2019t change the landscape for health plans.\u201d\n\nJohnston said he believes patients who choose concierge medicine are used to specialized services, or have a greater average income.\n\n\u201cThey are likely to be busy people who have trouble scheduling regular appointments,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nPatient Karen Gibbs disagrees, saying she chose the cash-only model with Zwelling because she likes the extra care. Gibbs, 69, said she planned ahead for her health care needs, and does carry insurance for medications.\n\nA Long Beach resident who has worked in the health care quality industry, Gibbs said she believes her cancer would not have been found had she visited a physician in the traditional model of care.\n\n\u201cI was diagnosed with cancer two and half years ago,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cIt would never would have been caught because I was asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nGibbs said Zwelling had specialists lined up and ready to help her.\n\n\u201cChoice is an important thing to me,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cI pay and for that, I get a physician who I trust, who I can call 24/7, and who takes care of me. It should be patient choice. It shouldn\u2019t be waiting in line.\u201d\n\nZwelling said she went into primary care because she wanted to help everyone.\n\nAt least once a week, she receives patients who have been told by doctors at other health care systems that there were no treatment options available for them.\n\n\u201cI get these patients who are told to go home and die,\u201d Zwelling said. \u201cI\u2019m not denigrating my colleagues, but if you only have five minutes with a patient you don\u2019t have time to find treatments.\u201d\n\nAnd many physicians are discouraged by that, she added, which is why she has helped some set up their own concierge practices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve encouraged those who want to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve offered to help them. Most of them feel trapped by the system. It\u2019s really quite sad. They are not happy doctors. I encourage them to get the government out of the room.\u201d\n\nZwelling also said she\u2019s working on legislation that would make it mandatory for hospitals to post costs. For example, she can get a chest X-ray for a patient for $35 while an insurance company would charge $330.\n\n\u201cThe dishonesty in the system is just huge,\u201d she said. \u201cI think government is important to protect our borders and fix potholes. Government has a role, but they shouldn\u2019t be delegating people\u2019s lives. I favor people getting care, and I want lower cost and greater access.\u201d\n\nShe also said people have become duped into believing that the traditional medical model in place now is the best.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done is minimize the expectations of the population,\u201d she said. \u201cThey expect less from their physicians. We cannot be lowering the bar. We have to be raising the bar.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As an internist, Dr. Marcy Zwelling\u2019s aim is to treat the sick and maintain the healthy.That\u2019s why she got rid of the pain of health insurance.
