Not by the theory, which is standard dorm-room navel-gazing, but by the strategy behind it. This is a brilliant bit of global-warming propaganda by a progressive site aimed at low-information casual news consumers, the sort of people who may know little about climate change but know a lot about \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d It\u2019s the same idea at base as Obama sitting down for a \u201cFunny or Die\u201d interview with Zach Galifianakis in the thick of enrollment season for ObamaCare: If you want to win over an audience of apolitical twentysomethings, you need to hit \u2019em where they live. That means pop culture and it means video. Come for the GoT, stay for the curiosity-piquing warnings about the dire threat from rising sea levels. In a way, it\u2019s Vox at its Vox-iest, leveraging something ostensibly politically neutral \u2014 like, say, the label \u201cexploratory journalism\u201d \u2014 to steer neutral readers towards a left-wing agenda. You may not like them, but they ain\u2019t stupid.\n\nAs for the theory, I\u2019ll leave it to those who watch the show to dissect it in the comments. Seems straightforward enough, though \u2014 the zombies are climate change, mercilessly advancing on a collection of nations consumed by their own petty squabbles, with some leaders refusing to admit that the zombies even exist. Only by collective action can they turn the tide. (Any Vox analysis of any television show will end with that same lesson.) The thing is, that\u2019s also basically the plot of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d There are no outright zombie-deniers in TWD, but that\u2019s because it takes place at a different stage of the zombie onslaught than GoT, after civilization\u2019s been overrun rather than before. Even so, in every episode there\u2019s some moment where the characters let their guard down by assuming the zombies are much further away than they really are \u2014 an evergreen progressive complaint about short-sightedness towards global warming \u2014 and they end up paying for it. Whaddaya know, that\u2019s two highly popular shows about the left\u2019s pet issue, or so lefties might tell you.\n\nThen again, both shows could also be allegories for income inequality, with the zombies representing the dehumanized working class and Rick\u2019s gang, or the lords of Westeros, representing the one-percenters whose civilization will be overrun. Or maybe both shows are allegories for the state of the Democratic Party, too confident in its hold on power and dangerously riven by conflicting interests while the horde of cannibal Republican voters descends. That\u2019s the thing about the zombie genre \u2014 zombies can represent almost anything, a fact exploited by George Romero in his own versatile uses of symbolism (zombies as a satire on consumerism in \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d and as a commentary on exploitation of the lower class in \u201cLand of the Dead\u201d). They\u2019re the Moby Dick of modern American culture. Which makes me wonder how many more \u201cGame of Thrones is like ________\u201d clickbait videos Vox might have in the chute, waiting to go. I\u2019d be up for a \u201cGame of Thrones is like amnesty\u201d hot take. Starring Jeff Sessions as Tyrion Lannister, maybe?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Theories.", "title": "The hottest take: What if \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is really an allegory for climate change?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/06/04/the-hottest-take-what-if-game-of-thrones-is-really-an-allegory-for-climate-change/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T18:41:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T17:12:29+00:00"}, "keywords": "climate change, game of thrones, vox, zack beauchamp,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10de\"", "article_summary": "The hottest take: What if \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is really an allegory for climate change?\nI\u2019d be up for a \u201cGame of Thrones is like amnesty\u201d hot take.\nWhaddaya know, that\u2019s two highly popular shows about the left\u2019s pet issue, or so lefties might tell you.\nWhich makes me wonder how many more \u201cGame of Thrones is like ________\u201d clickbait videos Vox might have in the chute, waiting to go.\nSeems straightforward enough, though \u2014 the zombies are climate change, mercilessly advancing on a collection of nations consumed by their own petty squabbles, with some leaders refusing to admit that the zombies even exist."}
