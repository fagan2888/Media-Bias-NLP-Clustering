Her schedule means that the Cedar Rapids resident needs someone to watch her four-year-old son during the day.\n\nIn the past, when she was working, that meant sending her son to a private child care center.\n\n\u0093My whole paycheck of my job went to his day care,\u0094 Fisher recalled.\n\nHer situation isn\u0092t unique. According to the Iowa Data Center, for 2011, 74.3 percent of the state\u0092s parents were in the labor force. A July 2013 fact sheet from Iowa Child Care Resource and Referral, a state government program dedicated to maintaining quality child care options and making them available to families, shows that 78 percent of Linn County families have all parents working and children under age 6.\n\n\u0093The majority of Iowa children spend time outside their home during the day,\u0094 said Amy Bruner, child care programs manager for the Hawkeye Area Community Action Program, which serves people living in poverty in six counties including Linn.\n\n\u0093The majority of Iowa children are in some kind of care outside the home. It\u0092s in our best interest to offer high-quality environments.\u0094\n\nThose \u0093high-quality environments\u0094 aren\u0092t cheap to provide. Shawn Hauskins, owner and co-director of Kids Kampus Learning Center in Cedar Rapids, said the child care center goes through 40 to 45 gallons of milk each week.\n\n\u0093It blows your mind,\u0094 she said.\n\nAll that milk factors into the $4,000 each month Hauskins estimated the center spends on groceries for the 131 children, ranging in age from infants to 12 years old, who attend Kids Kampus. The private center also must allocate dollars for building repairs, utility and other facility expenditures, as well as new toys, books and equipment for the children.\n\n\u0093The average center lives paycheck to paycheck. They live week to week just like people do at home,\u0094 Hauskins said. \u0093If you\u0092re a good quality day care putting money into the business, there is no leftover.\u0094\n\nHauskins\u0092s biggest expense, however, can\u0092t be purchased in a store.\n\n\u0093Payroll in this building takes basically a whole week\u0092s tuition, what we get for a whole week in tuition,\u0094 she said. \u0093And our people aren\u0092t high paid. I wish I could do more.\u0094\n\nKids Kampus\u0092s rates, which Hauskins said are dictated by the center\u0092s expenses, range from $210 a week for an infant to $101 weekly for children ages 6 through 12. She estimated that the average hourly pay for a staff member was $10.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s the most important job for the least amount of pay,\u0094 she said, noting that stability is important for children in child care. \u0093You don\u0092t want turnover. As a director, turnover is hard because it\u0092s retraining, it\u0092s a nonstop circle if you\u0092re constantly retaining people .\n\n\"We have a lot of long-term staff, but if you can\u0092t treat your people right, and that\u0092s not just with pay, that\u0092s with benefits, the way you run your business, ... they\u0092re going to leave, and if you don\u0092t pay them enough they\u0092re going to leave.\u0094\n\nExpenses and expenditures\n\nThe July 2013 fact sheet from Iowa Child Care Resource and Referral also shows that Linn County families have a median income of $72,255. If one of those families has an infant in child care, they will average spending 9 percent of their pre-tax income on placing that child in an in-home child care registered with the Iowa Department of Human Services.\n\nThat portion increases to 13 percent if the child is in a licensed center. Infant care \u0096 which, in Linn County, averages a weekly tuition of $129.91 for a registered in-home provider and $178.98 for a licensed center \u0096 is the most expensive form of day care, with rates decreasing as children get older.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that from 2007-11, 9.9 percent of people in Linn County lived below the poverty level. The 2013 federal poverty level for a family of four is an annual income of $23,550.\n\nFamilies whose annual income is 145 percent of the federal poverty level or less are eligible for Child Care Assistance. Information from the Iowa Department of Human Services says that 13,955 families received Child Care Assistance in August 2013.\n\nRegistered centers\u0092 current reimbursement rate, which reflects a 6 percent increase from 2012, is $16.78 for a half-day of infant care, $13.53 for a half-day of preschool-aged care and $12.18 for a half-day of care for a school-aged child.\n\nSheila Hansen, director of Every Child Counts, would like to see that number increase. She and her colleagues at the self-described \u0093advocacy network,\u0094 which is part of the state\u0092s Child and Family Policy Center, are planning to request that legislators increase child care assistance access to families who are making 185 percent of the federal poverty level or lower by the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nShe also would like to see a rise in the state\u0092s reimbursement rate to centers who care for children through assistance. Both of those changes would mean significant funding commitments from the state, which already allocates $130 million each year for child care assistance.\n\n\u0093There\u0092s just this huge disconnect between what people can afford and what child care costs,\u0094 Hansen said when asked why child care is so pricey. \u0093Most of the time, people who are having young children are young themselves. They\u0092re early in their careers, they don\u0092t have a lot of money.\n\n\"It\u0092s a significant part of your income and you can\u0092t afford it. But you have to remember that the child care providers have to make a living too.\u0094\n\nAlternatives and solutions\n\nFor parents such as Kelsey Fisher, there\u0092s another option \u0097 the Linn County Child Development Center, which provides care for 60 children ages 3 through 5.\n\n\u0093It is nice to have now that I\u0092m not working,\u0094 Fisher said of the center. \u0093I wouldn\u0092t be able to afford child care because I\u0092m in school.\u0094\n\nCenter Director Chris Carman estimated that 80 percent of the youth attending the center are funded through Child Care Assistance or another outside source at no cost to their families. The remaining 20 percent are parents who pay the full $130 weekly rate per child or a reduced rate based on income.\n\n\u0093It really is almost all going to classroom staff salaries,\u0094 he said of tuition. \u0093That\u0092s where it takes some level of outside support to address the other operational costs . We use other funding to par for food and keep the lights on.\u0094\n\nThe center participates in a number of programs and partnerships \u0096 such as Head Start, the Shared Visions Preschool Program and the Statewide Voluntary Preschool program \u0096 and receives additional monetary support through those sources.\n\nHauskins said the only solution to make child care more affordable for families is for the federal government to approach it the same as it did health care. In essence, it would be the Affordable Child Care Act.\n\nFor her, being a child care provider isn\u0092t about the bottom line.\n\n\u0093If you\u0092re going to do everything that\u0092s best for the kids, you\u0092re not going to make any money,\u0094 she said. \u0093It\u0092s definitely not a moneymaking business.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | This is second of two stories on child care in the Corridor.Kelsey Fisher is studying full time to be an X-ray technician.
