Walker. He was 28.\n\nWalker was among 16 million soldiers and civilians who lost their lives in World War I.\n\nLater this week, the world will mark 100 years since the assassination of an Austrian prince in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo dragged the great powers of the time into a conflict they called \u201cthe war to end all wars.\u201d\n\nMemories of WWI are fading \u2014 British sailor Claude Choules, who died in 2011 at age 110, is believed to have been the last surviving combat veteran.\n\nBut in cemeteries and memorial sites around the world, there\u2019s no letup in the global operation to honor the fallen.\n\nDuring a time of tight spending, the governments of Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,South Africa and India increased the budget of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission by almost 4 percent last year to $99 million.\n\nThat enables the CWGC to maintain graves and memorials to 1.7 million combatants from the former British Empire who died in the two world wars.\n\n\u201cWe are here to help people understand what happened, what the sacrifice of those soldiers meant,\u201d says Nelly Poignonnec, a Frenchwoman who serves as communications supervisor for the CWGC.\n\n\u201cWe have a duty to commemorate them in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nThe Brits aren\u2019t alone.\n\nGermany\u2018s War Graves Commission has a $55 million budget, raised mainly by public donations to maintain memorials to soldiers who fell in both world wars. For France, a special service of the Defense Ministry cares for 1.3 million war graves.\n\nThe US Battle Monument\u2019s Commission employs 50 people overseas to tend the graves of 124,908 American war dead, including 30,000 from WWI. Nearly half lie in the Meuse-Argonne American cemetery, a 2.5 hour drive southeast of here.\n\nEvery year, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission engraves thousands of new headstones.\n\nA handful will mark new graves for bodies that are still occasionally uncovered by farmers plowing their fields around here. The vast majority will replace stones eroded by decades of exposure to the elements.\n\nPvt. Walker\u2019s is one of 22,000 to be cut this year in the workshop the CWGC runs in this northern French town set amid rolling farmland where some of the war\u2019s bloodiest battles were fought.\n\nQuarries in southern England producing the original Portland stone used for the graves in France and Flanders can no longer keep up with demand, so alternatives are shipped in to Beaurains from Italy, Bulgaria and farther afield.\n\nAfter they are engraved \u2014 either using computer-guided machines or by hand by the commission\u2019s team of trained craftsmen \u2014 the memorial tablets are sent out around the world.\n\nHeadstone production manager Alan Jarvis points to a stack of stones destined for shipment to the Gaza Strip, where more than 4,400 Commonwealth casualties are buried. The previous week, he says, a consignment was sent to Benghazi, Libya, last resting place for 1,214 British Commonwealth soldiers from WWII.\n\nThe CWGC employs 1,300 people tending 23,000 sites in 153 countries.\n\nThe scale of its operation to care for cemetery gardens and maintain the memorials gives an indication of the worldwide scope of the Great War\u2019s carnage.\n\nThere are 15 members of Lincolnshire Yeomanry laid to rest in Algeria after their transport ship was torpedoed by a U-boat in 1915. Maala cemetery in Yemen contains the graves of 142 servicemen killed in WWI defending the city of Aden against the Turks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the vast graveyards of northern France and southern Belgium that reveal the industrial scale of the WWI\u2019s slaughter, and its impact in shaping today\u2019s world.\n\nA short drive from Beaurains, a ridge of highland known as the Lorette Spur is topped with a stout white church surrounded by the graves of 45,000 French soldiers \u2014 the country\u2019s largest military necropolis.\n\nDown the hill in Neuville-Saint-Vaast stands a forest of gray crosses marking the tree-shaded resting place of 44,833 German soldiers. It\u2019s especially poignant given Germany\u2019s post-WWI history that 129 tablets engraved with the Star of David are mixed among the crosses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 100 years after \"the war to end all wars,\" there\u2019s no letup in the global operation to honor the fallen", "title": "World War I still etched into European psyche", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nearly 100 years after \"the war to end all wars,\" there\u2019s no letup in the global operation to honor the fallen", "title": "World War I still etched into European psyche", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/30/european_countries_are_stepping_up_efforts_to_commemorate_world_war_i_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Vickers_IWW.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly 100 years after \"the war to end all wars,\" there\u2019s no letup in the global operation to honor the fallen", "title": "World War I still etched into European psyche", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/Vickers_IWW.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Ames", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GlobalPost, World War I, wwi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc68f\"", "article_summary": "Walker was among 16 million soldiers and civilians who lost their lives in World War I.\nEvery year, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission engraves thousands of new headstones.\nThe previous week, he says, a consignment was sent to Benghazi, Libya, last resting place for 1,214 British Commonwealth soldiers from WWII.\nFor France, a special service of the Defense Ministry cares for 1.3 million war graves.\nGermany\u2018s War Graves Commission has a $55 million budget, raised mainly by public donations to maintain memorials to soldiers who fell in both world wars."}
