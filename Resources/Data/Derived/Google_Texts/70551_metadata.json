Paul LePage for earmarking $7.8 million in state funds to counter federal cuts in reimbursement rates for independent primary care doctors treating MaineCare patients.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in the governor\u2019s $6.3 billion budget proposal, the full potential impact of which won\u2019t be adequately sussed out for weeks. But making sure primary care physicians have the right financial incentives to see MaineCare patients is important, and it\u2019s important LePage is making it a priority.\n\nAdditional Images Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nUnder the plan, $2.9 million will keep MaineCare doctor reimbursement rates, temporarily increased using federal dollars under the Affordable Care Act, at current levels. Another $4.9 million will buttress reimbursements for doctors in the transformative \u201chealth homes\u201d initiative, which is aimed at managing care for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nAccess to primary care is an issue in Maine, and by supporting it in the budget, the governor is supporting efforts to better patient health and lower overall health care costs.\n\nTHUMBS UP, tentatively, to comments made by LePage earlier this week recognizing Maine\u2019s potential to become the \u201cbread basket of New England.\u201d\n\nThe comments echoes those made by LePage\u2019s opponent in the last election, Democrat Mike Michaud.\n\nMaine has more working farms than any other state in New England, and its small farms particularly are growing at a good rate. Harnessing the potential of those small producers is a key factor for the future of the Maine economy. To do that, the farms need better mechanisms for reaching large markets.\n\nSmall businesses are popping up in Maine and elsewhere to fill that need, but the state could do more to facilitate the distribution of local produce, poultry, meat and seafood.\n\nLePage vetoed a bill last session that would have helped create food hubs, which aggregate, store, promote and deliver food from many small producers. He also vetoed a bill that would have helped get more Maine food into local schools.\n\nIn both cases, he cited what he saw as flaws in the legislation. In both cases, he should have worked with lawmakers to correct those flaws, not thrown out the ideas altogether.\n\nLet\u2019s hope LePage\u2019s comments this week signal a willingness to revisit those proposals so that the emerging local food industry in Maine can prosper.\n\nTHUMBS DOWN to a recently published study making the case that sea levels are rising much faster than in the past, particularly along the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWhatever one\u2019s position on climate change, rising, warming oceans must be confronted, and their ecological and economic impacts planned for and dealt with. Maine is vulnerable to increased erosion, rising coastline insurance rates, and more severe storm damage.\n\nSome coastal communities have already begin to discuss strategies for mitigating the problems that come from rising sea levels. A comprehensive statewide plan is needed to assess where Maine is most vulnerable, paving the way for action that protects the state\u2019s valuable coastline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Primary care, Maine farms and rising sea levels make the news this week.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Primary care, Maine farms and rising sea levels make the news this week.", "title": "OUR OPINION: Thumbs up, thumbs down - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/359148_3edit_ThumbsUpDown.jpg", "height": 885}, "updated_time": "2015-01-15T16:50:13-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/01/16/our-opinion-thumbs-up-thumbs-down-54/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/359148_3edit_ThumbsUpDown.jpg", "description": "Primary care, Maine farms and rising sea levels make the news this week.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "OUR OPINION: Thumbs up, thumbs down - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "ouropinion", "published_time": "2015-01-16T04:10:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T16:50:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9c1\"", "article_summary": "But making sure primary care physicians have the right financial incentives to see MaineCare patients is important, and it\u2019s important LePage is making it a priority.\nHe also vetoed a bill that would have helped get more Maine food into local schools.\nPaul LePage for earmarking $7.8 million in state funds to counter federal cuts in reimbursement rates for independent primary care doctors treating MaineCare patients.\nAccess to primary care is an issue in Maine, and by supporting it in the budget, the governor is supporting efforts to better patient health and lower overall health care costs.\nHarnessing the potential of those small producers is a key factor for the future of the Maine economy."}
