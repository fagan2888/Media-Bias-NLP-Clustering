Two Minneapolis small-business owners watch their taxes and health insurance costs steadily rise, and wonder if staying in Minnesota makes sense. A Buffalo special education teacher hopes state government continues to make public school funding a spending priority.\n\nOn Tuesday, Americans head to the polls for what pundits call an \u201coff-year\u201d election. With no presidential race as the common point of entry, this year\u2019s political cycle is defined by dozens of gubernatorial and congressional races from coast to coast, including hard-fought contests for governor and U.S. senator in Minnesota.\n\nThe outcome of all those races will set the political climate ahead of a wide-open presidential race in 2016. While Republicans hope to capitalize this year on the growing unpopularity of President Obama, Democrats are trying to reactivate a 2012 coalition that brought in women, young and nonwhite voters to catapult the party to victory.\n\nLocally, the contest between Gov. Mark Dayton and Republican Jeff Johnson, along with a handful of competitive state House races, will determine whether the DFL extends its two-year grip on state government or Minnesota returns to divided government.\n\nDespite the stakes, and the millions spent by both parties, it\u2019s likely that far fewer voters will weigh in. Participation in elections historically drops in nonpresidential years; in Minnesota, which leads the nation in voter turnout, just 55 percent of those eligible voted in 2010 compared to 76 percent in 2012.\n\nAmid an improving economy, the absence of a single galvanizing issue and the usual flood of contradictory campaign ads, the political attention of Minnesotans has been fragmented. On a Tuesday in late October, two weeks before Election Day, the Star Tribune interviewed a dozen people about politics and policies, the governor\u2019s race and other election issues.\n\nHanna Fritz, 23, Hastings: \u201cWhatever my dad wants.\u201d\n\nVoters were chosen randomly and had only two things in common: They were close to Hwy. 55, which cuts diagonally from southeast to northwest through cities, suburbs, town and country; and they were willing to share their political opinions. These are a few of them.\n\nHastings\n\nAt 5th Avenue Color Company in this small river city\u2019s downtown, Hanna Fritz, a 23-year-old stylist with a small nose ring and a blonde streak through her auburn hair, repeatedly apologized for not knowing more about politics.\n\nFritz was not able to name either Dayton or Johnson. Recently moved from her parents\u2019 house, and still on their health insurance plan, Fritz said she\u2019d \u201cprobably\u201d vote this year.\n\n\u201cWhatever my dad wants,\u201d she added. Fritz voted Mitt Romney for president in 2012, and said her whole family votes Republican.\n\nBut Fritz recently came to a new political opinion that surprised her a little, as she found herself going against the family grain.\n\n\u201cAbortion \u2014 I always thought I would be against it, like, absolutely not,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cBut now, reaching the age I am, and if something were to happen where I was not ready, or rape or whatever, I definitely think it\u2019s a choice you should be able to make.\u201d\n\nSouth Minneapolis\n\nFirst cousins John Bean and Matthew Bean co-own Flair Fountains, headquartered in a small building just north of where Hwy. 55 becomes Hiawatha Avenue. John is bald and stocky, Matthew lanky, long-haired and bearded. But they share the same political concerns.\n\n\u201cWhatever makes the most sense for our business is pretty much what drives us,\u201d said Matthew Bean, who lives in Woodbury.\n\nThis year, they both plan to vote against Dayton. \u201cFor me, on the fiscal side, he\u2019s a little too liberal with the money,\u201d said John Bean, a Minneapolis resident. The Beans said their property tax bills are rising, their insurance premiums shot up by more than 50 percent this year, and they feel overburdened by the many small fees and regulations that accompany business ownership.\n\nFlair Fountains employs 10 people, and designs and builds fountains for cities, parks, campuses and corporations around the country. The Beans said about 75 percent of their business comes from outside Minnesota, which raises the kinds of conversation that have driven this year\u2019s gubernatorial race, as Johnson argued that DFL control of the Capitol has been hard on small-business owners.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got South Dakota saying, \u2018Come on over here and basically do business for free,\u2019 \u201d John Bean said. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you a vacant building and it\u2019s yours as long as you stay in there 10 years. So that\u2019s awfully inviting, and it\u2019s never off the table.\u201d\n\nNorth Minneapolis\n\nA few years out of the Navy, Brandon Smith is back in the city where he grew up, and starting at Minneapolis Community and Technical College in January on the GI Bill.\n\nMeanwhile, the friendly, energetic 28-year-old is working full-time as a third-shift machine operator at Am\u00adport Foods, earning $15.95 an hour, with on-the-job training opportunities.\n\nMike Keepers, 40, Cashton, Wis.: \u201cWith these politicians, they never take into consideration us, the working people. \u2026 And there\u2019s a lot of guys out here like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo shortage of work in Minnesota, man,\u201d Smith said as he headed into Sumner Community Library, along Olson Hwy., to use the Internet. \u201cI know that has a lot to do with politics. I\u2019m all about keeping the job. Dayton\u2019s been in there, and I\u2019m like this: If it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\n\nPlymouth\n\nThis is Jeff Johnson\u2019s home turf: He lives here, represents the area on the Hennepin County Board, and did the same when he served in the Legislature.\n\nBut a quick conversation with Anne Diedrick, a 39-year-old stay-at-home mom loading groceries into the back of her SUV in a Cub Foods parking lot, illustrated what has been one of Johnson\u2019s chief challenges this year: low name recognition.\n\n\u201cUm, let me think. Don\u2019t tell me who it is,\u201d Diedrick, who lives in nearby Maple Grove, said when asked if she knows Dayton\u2019s Republican challenger. She finally gave up after being told his first name is Jeff: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDiedrick said she leans Democratic but tends to be more conservative about government spending. She said she is not very political but was certain she voted for Dayton in 2010, and is likely to do so again this year.\n\n\u201cI would not say I\u2019m very well-informed,\u201d she said, as she hoisted pumpkins from her shopping cart into her vehicle.\n\nRockford Township\n\nShannon Bye, 48, Buffalo: \u201cOur numbers for unemployment have gone decidedly down. \u2026 Families struggle to do what they need to do, and that trickles down to the kids.\u201d\n\nFor 42 years, Lee Waldon has run Waldon Woods Antiques, just off a Wright County stretch of the highway. It\u2019s been nearly that long since he supported a Democrat.\n\n\u201cThe last great liberal I liked was Hubert Humphrey,\u201d said Waldon, who would only say he\u2019s \u201cover 62.\u201d\n\nWaldon said President Jimmy Carter turned him off Democrats, and he\u2019s been disappointed with Dayton. But Johnson hasn\u2019t won his vote yet, either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel a comfort level yet, and I don\u2019t feel like voting for him just because he\u2019s a Republican,\u201d Waldon said. Looking to 2016, Waldon foresaw circumstances that could pull him back into the Democratic fold. \u201cI can\u2019t say what will happen when and if Hillary [Clinton] runs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Hillary did a good job as secretary of state.\u201d\n\nBuffalo\n\nA 48-year-old special education teacher at Buffalo Middle School, Shannon Bye has a face etched with the kind of worry lines that betray 22 years in a stressful job.\n\nBye said Dayton has come through on the two issues that affect her own life on a daily basis: boosting education funding and promoting employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cI see that our numbers for unemployment have gone decidedly down,\u201d Bye said. \u201cI think that reflects well for everyone, because when the numbers are high, you see stressors in the classroom. Families struggle to do what they need to do, and that trickles down to the kids.\u201d\n\nAnne Diedrick, 39, Plymouth: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know \u2026 I would not say I\u2019m very well-informed.\u201d\n\nStill, Bye wouldn\u2019t reveal her vote. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a personal choice,\u201d she said.\n\nMaple Lake\n\nAfter a frustrating year of helping health insurance customers navigate the complexities of the federal Affordable Care Act, Anna Pribyl and her colleagues at Lake Central Insurance changed course in this depopulated downtown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taking on any new MNsure clients this year,\u201d Pribyl, 32, said of the users of Minnesota\u2019s trouble-plagued health insurance exchange. \u201cHalf the time, we\u2019d spend two or three hours on the phone to MNsure just waiting for somebody to answer the phone.\u201d\n\nMany of those customers, she said, qualified for Medical Assistance in the end. That meant no percentage for their broker. \u201cYou\u2019re spending two, three, four hours with somebody to have absolutely nothing come back your way,\u201d Pribyl said.\n\nPribyl voted for Dayton four years ago, but frustration with MNsure has driven her away from the governor. Still, she has little familiarity with Johnson, and expressed deep frustration at politics in general.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand October and November,\u201d Pribyl said. \u201cEverything is just tearing each other apart. If they would get on TV and truly debate and say something true about themselves, that would be great.\u201d\n\nKimball\n\nLee Waldon, over 62, Rockford Township: \u201cI don\u2019t feel a comfort level yet, and I don\u2019t feel like voting for [Johnson] just because he\u2019s a Republican.\u201d\n\nAt Arnold\u2019s of Kimball, a farm implement dealer along Hwy. 55, no one wanted to talk politics on the record. After a series of backroom conversations, general manager Eric Donnay reluctantly emerged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get a lot of [manure] for this,\u201d Donnay said, using slightly more off-color language than that.\n\nFarmers love to talk politics, Donnay said, and right now they\u2019re worried. Despite the recent federal farm bill\u2019s passage, a dysfunctional Congress has left many unsettled about the nation\u2019s long-term agricultural policy. And despite a few years of a mostly healthy ag economy, Donnay sees warning signs.\n\n\u201cThree-dollar corn, whereas the last few years it\u2019s been seven dollars a bushel,\u201d Donnay said. \u201cThis year in central Minnesota we had a very wet spring, poor planting conditions, which results in poor yield. That\u2019s what farmers are concerned about.\u201d\n\nDonnay called himself an independent voter. \u201cI vote between the party lines,\u201d he said. Pronouncing himself \u201cmostly satisfied\u201d with Dayton while knowing \u201calmost zero\u201d about Johnson, he planned to follow his own election-year custom.\n\n\u201cA week beforehand, I\u2019ll read up on where Jeff Johnson is on the main issues, and I\u2019ll see where Dayton is,\u201d Donnay said. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll decide.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Jobs, education and taxes top personal reasons for choices made about this fragmented, nonpresidential election year.", "title": "From Hwy. 55, a view of governor's race, campaign stakes", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/from-along-hwy-55-a-view-of-governor-s-race-campaign-stakes/281189251/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14148758687201.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14148758687201.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Jobs, education and taxes top personal reasons for choices made about this fragmented, nonpresidential election year.", "title": "From Hwy. 55, a view of governor's race, campaign stakes", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/from-along-hwy-55-a-view-of-governor-s-race-campaign-stakes/281189251/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14148758687201.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14148758687201.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Jobs, education and taxes top personal reasons for choices made about this fragmented, nonpresidential election year."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1fa\"", "article_summary": "Recently moved from her parents\u2019 house, and still on their health insurance plan, Fritz said she\u2019d \u201cprobably\u201d vote this year.\nDespite the stakes, and the millions spent by both parties, it\u2019s likely that far fewer voters will weigh in.\nThe outcome of all those races will set the political climate ahead of a wide-open presidential race in 2016.\n55, which cuts diagonally from southeast to northwest through cities, suburbs, town and country; and they were willing to share their political opinions.\nHanna Fritz, 23, Hastings: \u201cWhatever my dad wants.\u201dVoters were chosen randomly and had only two things in common: They were close to Hwy."}
