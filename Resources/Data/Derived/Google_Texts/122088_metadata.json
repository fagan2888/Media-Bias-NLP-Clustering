A number of conservatives and center-right columnists are busily trying to figure out why this is happening to their beloved party, and so far they\u2019ve come up with one highly satisfying explanation: It\u2019s all Barack Obama\u2019s fault. The latest addition to this hot-take menagerie comes courtesy of National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar, who spies the stirrings of the Trump phenomenon in a tightly contested Senate race from eight years ago.\n\n\u201cLooking for a culprit to blame for all the polarization, gridlock, and bad feelings in Washington?\u201d he writes. \u201cPoint to Sen. Al Franken. No, that\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Actually, it is a joke. A really bad and determinedly stupid joke that Kraushaar punishes the reader with until they realize 800 words later that the punch line is they\u2019ve wasted fleeting and irrecoverable moments of their lives reading it.\n\nThe conceit behind Kraushaar\u2019s column is that Franken\u2019s narrow 2008 Senate victory in Minnesota provided Barack Obama with a 60-vote supermajority, which enabled him to pass the Affordable Care Act without Republican support, which then became the rallying cry for the Tea Party wave, which crashed into Washington and turned everyone crazy, and after a few more (unexplained) steps: presto magic, Donald Trump. If Franken hadn\u2019t won, writes Kraushaar, then Obama would have been forced to win the vote of at least one Republican senator to pass healthcare reform, which would have made things better somehow:\n\nWithout a Democratic supermajority, Obama would have been forced to negotiate with Republicans (or, at least, former Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine) and settle for the incremental health care legislation that his then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel recommended. The GOP would still have been opposed to any Democratic health care reforms, but the antipathy would have been muted because a few Republicans would have supported the legislation. Instead of provoking a pitched partisan showdown that culminated with then-House Minority Leader John Boehner exclaiming that the Congress had \u201cshatter[ed] the bonds of trust\u201d with the American people, Obama could have tempered the wrath of the Republican opposition.\n\nThis is ahistorical wishful thinking presented as self-evident truth. Last year, Norm Ornstein wrote a useful corrective to the commonly accepted \u201creality\u201d that the Affordable Care Act was \u201crammed through Congress\u201d without compromise or input from Republicans. Democrats and the White House made repeated and insistent overtures to Republicans in the Senate looking for a way to bring the GOP into the healthcare negotiations. They made some headway \u2013 with Olympia Snowe especially \u2013 before the Senate Republican leadership cracked down and precluded the notion of Republican involvement in the healthcare legislation.\n\nBut let\u2019s stipulate that one or two moderate Republican senators had broken ranks and sided with the Democrats \u2013 is it really reasonable to assume that the Tea Party fury would have \u201ctempered\u201d? It seems just as likely that the fury would have been augmented by a sense of betrayal, and those heretical Republicans would have been targeted by conservatives and faced enthusiastic primary challenges from the right. The idea seems to be that a sufficiently moderate piece of healthcare legislation would have left Republican voters upset but not angry, which overlooks the fact that the ACA is itself an act of policy moderation that was met with a buzzsaw of incoherent rage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Journal's tendentious explanation for the rise of Trumpism faults Democrats for being Democrats", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "National Journal's tendentious explanation for the rise of Trumpism faults Democrats for being Democrats", "title": "Al Franken did not cause Donald Trump: Yet another lousy explanation for why the GOP is self-destructing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/09/al_franken_did_not_cause_donald_trump_yet_another_lousy_explanation_for_why_the_gop_is_self_destructing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_franken.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Journal's tendentious explanation for the rise of Trumpism faults Democrats for being Democrats", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_franken.jpg", "title": "Al Franken did not cause Donald Trump: Yet another lousy explanation for why the GOP is self-destructing", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Al Franken did not cause Donald Trump: Yet another lousy explanation for why the GOP is self-destructing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, congressional republicans, Donald Trump, Eric Cantor, Josh Kraushaar, Mitch McConnell, national journal, Obamacare, Republicans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They made some headway \u2013 with Olympia Snowe especially \u2013 before the Senate Republican leadership cracked down and precluded the notion of Republican involvement in the healthcare legislation.\nLast year, Norm Ornstein wrote a useful corrective to the commonly accepted \u201creality\u201d that the Affordable Care Act was \u201crammed through Congress\u201d without compromise or input from Republicans.\n\u201cLooking for a culprit to blame for all the polarization, gridlock, and bad feelings in Washington?\u201d he writes.\nDemocrats and the White House made repeated and insistent overtures to Republicans in the Senate looking for a way to bring the GOP into the healthcare negotiations.\nThe latest addition to this hot-take menagerie comes courtesy of National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar, who spies the stirrings of the Trump phenomenon in a tightly contested Senate race from eight years ago."}
