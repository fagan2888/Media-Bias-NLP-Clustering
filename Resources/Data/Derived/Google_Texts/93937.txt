3D printed Left Shark

The dancing sharks that stole some of the spotlight during Katy Perry's Super Bowl halftime show have taken a bite out of an artist's bid to sell small figurines of them.

After the stumbling and uncoordinated sharks became an overnight Internet sensation, Fernando Sosa joined in on the Web frenzy and worked up a design of a 3-inch shark made with a 3D printer.

His handiwork hit Shapeways.com on Tuesday and by Wednesday, the Orlando-based artist had sold 10-15 sharks at $24.99 each.

Shapeways officials notified Sosa on Wednesday of a cease-and-desist letter from Perry's Los Angeles-based attorneys who demanded the shark's removal.

Sosa says he has created figurines of U.S and world leaders and never heard from lawyers.

Perry's lawyer didn't immediately respond to messages.
