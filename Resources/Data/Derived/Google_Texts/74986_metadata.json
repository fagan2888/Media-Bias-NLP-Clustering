I lost a lot of sponsorships. I had people threaten me.\u201d\n\nHe still maintains his criticism of Obama, telling Couric: \u201cMy black president is Nelson Mandela. Africa has always had black presidents so, my scale, being a black president isn\u2019t anything new. It\u2019s new to America, yes, but I\u2019m a global citizen, I look around the world. So my bar is someone who really fought for peace. Not someone who\u2019s continuing wars around the world.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he regrets the comments, Fiasco flatly said: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nFiasco, born Wasalu Muhammad Jaco, is perhaps best known for his debut album Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Food & Liquor which solidified his reputation for mixing accessible hip-hop production with provocative lyrics about Islam, terrorism, racism, and poverty. His outspoken nature led to controversy when he told CBS that Obama is the \u201cbiggest terrorist\u201d for perpetuating U.S. foreign policies that radicalize and create more terrorists abroad.\n\nWhile he has been a vocal critic of the current president, Fiasco told Couric he also points the finger at Obama\u2019s predecessor: \u201cWe don\u2019t mind pointing a finger at [George W. Bush],\u201d he said, \u201cbut when we get [Obama] who, unfortunately, has to carry on some of those same policies, but he\u2019s a great guy, it becomes a weird place for people to kind of critique.\u201d\n\nWatch below, via Yahoo News:\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Appearing on the latest episode of Yahoo News' Katie Couric World 3.0, rapper Lupe Fiasco spoke out about the fallout from his controversial 2011 comments", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/lupe_fiasco-300x1961.jpg", "title": "Rapper Lupe Fiasco: \u2018I Lost a Lot of Friends\u2019 After Calling Obama \u2018Terrorist\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "Appearing on the latest episode of Yahoo News' Katie Couric World 3.0, rapper Lupe Fiasco spoke out about the fallout from his controversial 2011 comments calling President Barack Obama a \"terrorist.\"", "creator": "@andrewkirell", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/lupe_fiasco-300x1961.jpg", "title": "Rapper Lupe Fiasco: 'I Lost a Lot of Friends' After Calling Obama 'Terrorist'", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "tv", "date": "2014-06-11T17:23:57+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5b8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI lost a lot of friends\u2026 Board members of my foundation [Lupe Fiasco Foundation] stepped down.\nAppearing on the latest episode of Yahoo News\u2019 Katie Couric World 3.0, rapper Lupe Fiasco spoke out about the fallout from his controversial 2011 comments calling President Barack Obama a \u201cterrorist.\u201d\u201cI was immediately blackballed,\u201d Fiasco told Couric.\nI had people threaten me.\u201dHe still maintains his criticism of Obama, telling Couric: \u201cMy black president is Nelson Mandela.\nAfrica has always had black presidents so, my scale, being a black president isn\u2019t anything new.\nHis outspoken nature led to controversy when he told CBS that Obama is the \u201cbiggest terrorist\u201d for perpetuating U.S. foreign policies that radicalize and create more terrorists abroad."}
