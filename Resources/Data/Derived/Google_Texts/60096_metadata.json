A doctor and three nurse practitioners there see about 500 patients each month, said Michele Beehler, the company\u2019s human resources manager. About 2,000 people work at Schweitzer in Pullman.\n\nIn Lewiston, where Schweitzer has about 250 employees, the clinic will be smaller, with two patient rooms compared to the Pullman clinic\u2019s seven. As in Pullman, primary care services will be provided to employees and their families free of charge, Beehler said.\n\n\u201cBecause we are self-insured, we don\u2019t bill, because we\u2019d only be billing ourselves,\u201d she said.\n\nEmployer-provided on-site clinics are an increasingly popular way to reduce absenteeism and cut health costs. A study by the human resources consulting company Towers Watson found that nearly 40 percent of large U.S. employers with onsite health clinics planned to add more in the next two years. Most employers in the study said the clinics had increased productivity and reduced health care costs. The Towers Watson 2015 Employer-Sponsored Health Care Centers Survey said most of the clinics offered a similar range of primary care services.\n\nThe Boise-based Micron Technology Inc. has 12 clinics worldwide, including one in Boise that is operated by a company called Premise Health, said spokesman Dan Francisco. St. Luke\u2019s Health System has employee clinics in several locations, including Boise, Meridian, McCall, Mountain Home, the Wood River Valley, and Jerome, said spokesman Tim Marsano.\n\nSchweitzer became self-insured in 2012 to save money on overhead, and then wasted little time in setting up a clinic. Its clinic operation is different from those of Micron in that Schweitzer is running the clinic itself, and didn\u2019t hire a third-party provider to operate it.\n\n\u201cSEL is essentially a company of entrepreneurs and inventors,\u201d said Kate Wilhite, a Schweitzer spokeswoman. \u201cWhen we need something done, we enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to do it ourselves.\u201d\n\nBeehler had experience hiring health professionals from working at a small rural hospital in Pomeroy, Wash. And the company\u2019s first hire was a nurse practitioner who had worked for the Walgreen\u2019s pharmacy chain, setting up clinics.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why the vast majority of people go with a vendor or third-party administrator,\u201d Beehler said. \u201cThe hardest part is the hiring.\u201d\n\nFor now, the benefit of free primary health services has served as a recruiting tool, at least for some prospective workers, Beehler said.\n\nSchweitzer initially opened its Pullman clinic in one room in a manufacturing facility, and then expanded it as patient visits grew. The company eventually built a structure for the health clinic, the company child care, and a fitness facility.\n\nThere are some potential problems. One is that some workers have privacy concerns. Beehler said there is no interaction between providers and company managers.\n\n\u201cWe work just like any other clinic; we have to abide by HIPAA standards and we have a HIPAA privacy officer,\u201d she said. \u201cOur providers have a completely separate system that they work on, that no one at SEL has access to.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s also not worried that free care will lead to overuse. Following the accountable care model set forth in the Affordable Care Act, the Schweitzer clinic incentivizes providers to give higher quality care, not to prescribe more tests and procedures, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have longer appointments, and providers spend more time with our patients, because they don\u2019t want them to come back two or three times, because that\u2019s going to take them away from their jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nBeehler said one of the biggest challenges that on-site care managers face is knowing how to provide health care under COBRA when an employee leaves the company. It is not clear if Schweitzer is obligated to continue providing care when an employee leaves.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that is not very well defined that has constantly been a struggle,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Lewiston clinic is expected to open in the first quarter of next year. Schweitzer is also opening an office in Boise in mid-October. Beehler said the company has no plans yet for providing primary care services there, but might consider telemedicine.\n\nSchweitzer has 52 field offices in the United States and another 48 around the world. There are no plans to set up health clinics at other offices, she said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress", "author": "Anne Wallace Allen", "og": {"site_name": "Idaho Business Review", "description": "Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories plans to open a medical clinic for employees at its Lewiston plant, modeled after a successful clinic the company operat", "title": "Schweitzer to open company-run health clinic in Lewiston", "url": "http://idahobusinessreview.com/2015/09/23/schweitzer-to-open-company-run-health-clinic-in-lewiston/", "image": "http://idahobusinessreview.com/files/2015/09/Schweitzer-clinic-cropped-600x319.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Schweitzer to open company-run health clinic in LewistonIdaho Business Review", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "pdIfxBOwt8N_Zpc5UZ3AIrXpeYa5v0h0Jnr8IiS1W-A", "y_key": "877cbb0bd73c44cd", "thumbnail": "http://idahobusinessreview.com/files/2015/09/Schweitzer-clinic-cropped-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce445\"", "article_summary": "In Lewiston, where Schweitzer has about 250 employees, the clinic will be smaller, with two patient rooms compared to the Pullman clinic\u2019s seven.\nSchweitzer Engineering Laboratories plans to open a medical clinic for employees at its Lewiston plant, modeled after a successful clinic the company operates at its Pullman, Wash. headquarters.\nSchweitzer opened its Pullman clinic in early 2013 and moved it to a new, larger location in March.\nThe company eventually built a structure for the health clinic, the company child care, and a fitness facility.\nSchweitzer initially opened its Pullman clinic in one room in a manufacturing facility, and then expanded it as patient visits grew."}
