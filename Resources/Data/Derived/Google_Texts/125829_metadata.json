Yet 37-year-old Tom Cotton of Arkansas has already made his mark on the international stage.\n\nHe authored the letter warning Iranian leaders that any potential deal they reach in talks on curbing their nuclear program might well be undone by the successor to President Barack Obama. And Cotton convinced 46 other Republican senators - but no Democrats - to sign it.\n\nThe letter comes just weeks before an end of March deadline to reach an interim deal in the talks.\n\nThomas \u201cTom\u201d Cotton, Junior U.S. Senator, R-AK Age 37, youngest member of the Senate\n\nFormerly U.S. House of Representatives, Arkansas, 4th District, 2013-2015\n\nGraduated magna cum laude from Harvard, Harvard Law School (2002)\n\nServed as captain in the U.S. Army; tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\nAuthored letter to Iran leaders, organized supporting signatures of 47 Republican Senators\n\nTom Cotton\u2019s biography would be a great asset for any politician. Raised on his parent\u2019s cattle farm in Arkansas, he graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Cotton joined the Army and served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2012, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Only two years later, he ran for the Senate and defeated Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor by a wide margin.\n\nCotton campaigned against abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act health care reform, often called \u201cObamacare.\u201d But he also appealed to fellow veterans, advocating an interventionist U.S. foreign policy based on military strength as he traveled around Arkansas in a bus decorated with military camouflage and a large boot print on the front.\n\nCotton has been in the Senate for only 65 days. He has not yet delivered his first speech, but he made waves last month at a hearing on attempts by the Obama administration to close down the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nDuring the hearing, Cotton grilled an Obama administration official. He said \"the only problem with Guantanamo Bay is there are too many empty beds and cells there right now.\"\n\n\"We should be sending more terrorists there for further interrogation to keep this country safe,\" he added. \"As far as I'm concerned, every last one of them can rot in hell. But as long as they can't do that, they can rot in Guantanamo Bay.\"\n\nA local Arkansas paper reported that Cotton and several of his fellow freshman senators toured the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Friday.\n\n\n\nReaction to Cotton's letter\n\nAmong Democrats and many observers, the letter to Iranian leaders triggered outrage. Democratic senators lined up to say it undermines President Obama at a critical time when his administration is trying to negotiate a deal with Tehran to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\nPresident Obama said he is embarrassed for the senators. Secretary of State John Kerry said he was in utter disbelief, adding that the letter breaks with 200 years of precedence in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nA headline in the New York Daily News blasted Cotton and the others who signed the letter as \u201ctraitors.\u201d\n\nRepublicans reaction has been mainly positive, but not entirely. Seven Republican senators did not sign the letter, including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker.\n\nCorker said he is trying to win support for bipartisan legislation which would let the Senate weigh in on an Iran nuclear deal; and the letter is \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\nSome analysts say the letter could backfire, turning the nuclear talks into a partisan political issue, and driving away some Democrats who might have joined with Republicans on Corker's legislation.\n\n\n\nTom Cotton for president?\n\nIt is not clear whether the letter will have an impact on the Iran nuclear talks in Switzerland, but it has certainly won Cotton the admiration of many of his fellow Republican senators and boosted his stature nationwide as a voice for an interventionist foreign policy.\n\nRepublican Senate Whip John Cornyn of Texas said Cotton\u2019s background makes him a great new member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Other Republican senators lined up to praise Cotton\u2019s leadership and courage.\n\nEven before the letter was released, an Arkansas Republican state senator introduced a bill in the Little Rock, Arkansas, legislature that would allow Tom Cotton to seek re-election for his Senate seat, and to run for president or vice president of the United States at the same time \u2014 in 2020.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Middle East, USA, nuclear, Iran, cotton, Tom Cotton, senator tom cotton", "Author": "Cindy Saine", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Tom Cotton, 37, earned praise from many colleagues, but drew ire from Democrats, many abroad, with claim nuclear deal could be undone post-Obama", "title": "Youngest US Senator in Global Spotlight After Iran Letter", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/youngest-us-senator-in-global-spotlight-after-iran-letter/2679272.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/864c2b24-9778-48ba-8530-30ad04e4292d_tv_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/864c2b24-9778-48ba-8530-30ad04e4292d_tv_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Youngest US Senator in Global Spotlight After Iran Letter", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
