They have since been released.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani expressed his frustration over the arrests: \"Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviors caused by joy,\" he tweeted.\n\nGiving Iran a run for its money - at least as far as unhappiness is concerned - are these other countries:\n\nIraq Iran Egypt Greece Syria Sierra Leone Cyprus Northern Cyprus Cambodia Lebanon\n\nHere's how Gallup came up with the numbers.\n\nGallup measured negative emotions in 138 countries in 2013 by asking people whether they experienced a lot of anger, stress, sadness, physical pain and worry the previous day. Gallup compiles the \"yes\" results into a Negative Experience Index score for each country. The higher the score, the more pervasive negative emotions are in a country.\n\nIn another Gallup study ranking positive emotions, Paraguay ranks first in positive experiences, and Syria was the least likely country worldwide to report positive experiences. Iran came in 93 rd out of 138 countries surveyed. When asked in 2013 whether or not Iranians would recommend their city or area to live, 48 percent said they would not, according to the survey research organization.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The Unhappiest Country in the World Is\u2026", "description": "The Unhappiest Country in the World Is\u2026", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/06/iraq-iran-top-worlds-unhappiest-countries-list/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "A new Gallup survey into which countries reported the most negative emotions.", "title": "The Unhappiest Country in the World Is\u2026"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "ABC's This Week, Gallup, Hassan Rouhani, Iran, Iraq, Paraguay, syria, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0848\"", "article_summary": "A new study released this week by Gallup cited Iran as the country with the highest negative emotions - a close second behind Iraq.\nGallup measured negative emotions in 138 countries in 2013 by asking people whether they experienced a lot of anger, stress, sadness, physical pain and worry the previous day.\nIn another Gallup study ranking positive emotions, Paraguay ranks first in positive experiences, and Syria was the least likely country worldwide to report positive experiences.\nThe higher the score, the more pervasive negative emotions are in a country.\n(Vahid Salemi/AP Photo)Do you live in one of the world's unhappiest places?"}
