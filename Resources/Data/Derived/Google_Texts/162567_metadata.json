One attendee waved a lightsaber, made popular by Star Wars, during a presentation.\n\nSustained enthusiasm for Tesla\u2019s business model, reinforced by a recent rebound in the company\u2019s stock price, comes even as gasoline prices remain around $2 per gallon in the U.S. Most auto makers have seen cheap fuel prices boost demand for SUVs and pickup trucks, which consume more gasoline.\n\nIn a speech, Musk referred to the smaller electric car as the capstone of a \u201csecret master plan\u201d that was crafted years ago to popularize electric cars.\n\nDuring a test drive for attendees, Tesla Vice President Doug Field said the Model 3 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make attractive electric vehicles more widely available.\n\nTo date, Tesla has sold about 100,000 vehicles \u2014 mostly Model S electric sedans with price tags that rival high-end German cars. The Model 3, which has been promised for several years, aims to hit the heart of the \u201cmass market,\u201d Musk said.\n\nHe said the car will cost $35,000 and the company aims to have initial copies on roads sometime in 2017. He said the car will be capable of achieving more than 215 miles on a charge, will receive top safety ratings, and will sprint from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than six seconds.\n\nThe Model 3 represents Musk\u2019s steepest challenge. Selling about 50,000 vehicles in 2015, Tesla expects the addition of a cheaper offering to propel annual sales to 500,000 by 2020.\n\nTesla\u2019s new car will hit the market as its bigger rivals begin to launch cars that could more directly compete. General Motors Co. aims to launch an electric small car later this year, capable of 200 miles on a charge, and Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi brand is planning an electric sport utility.\n\nMusk lacks the financial firepower of international auto giants, and thanked owners of the pricey Tesla Roadster, Model S sedan and Model X SUV for paving the way for the Model 3.\n\nRival auto makers have often criticized Musk for having too narrow a market \u2014 Teslas often cost far more than $100,000. But the entrepreneur said on Friday that the only way for the relatively small company to achieve the scale, funding and expertise necessary for a more affordable car was to start at the top-end of the market.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe S and the X are what pay for (Model 3) development \u2026 it was only possible to do that before going through the prior steps.\u201d\n\nAnalysts and investors see a successful Model 3 launch as a potential way to stanch a long string of financial losses and reverse cash outflows. Product hiccups, substantial increases in head count, the construction of a Nevada battery plant and billions of dollars in research and development costs have dented the bottom line.\n\nMusk realizes things haven\u2019t always gone as planned, but said he wants to hit targets.\n\n\u201cI do feel fairly confident it will be next year,\u201d Musk said. The company has struggled to launch vehicles on time under his watch.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Preorders for Tesla Model 3 hit 198,000", "title": "Preorders for Tesla Model 3 hit 198,000", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/01/preorders-for-tesla-model-3-hit-198000-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160401__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160402_Z00_BZ02TESLAp1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160401__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160402_Z00_BZ02TESLAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-01T19:30:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:23:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Autos"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Demand for Tesla Motors\u2019 lower-priced electric car surprised even the company\u2019s CEO Friday as 198,000 people plunked down $1,000 deposits.\nTo date, Tesla has sold about 100,000 vehicles \u2014 mostly Model S electric sedans with price tags that rival high-end German cars.\nMusk lacks the financial firepower of international auto giants, and thanked owners of the pricey Tesla Roadster, Model S sedan and Model X SUV for paving the way for the Model 3.\nThe company has struggled to launch vehicles on time under his watch.\nDuring a test drive for attendees, Tesla Vice President Doug Field said the Model 3 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make attractive electric vehicles more widely available."}
