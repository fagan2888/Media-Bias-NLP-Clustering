The U.S. was plainly taken by surprise over the weekend when it was announced that Russia had signed an intelligence sharing agreement with Iraq, Iran, and Syria with the aim of coordinating the fight against the terror group ISIS in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the past month, Russia has established new and incontrovertible facts on the ground in the Middle East by injecting soldiers and heavy weapons into Syria, and closely aligning itself with Assad\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nFor its part, the White House has long demanded that any solution to the ongoing civil war in Syria include the removal of Assad as president. On Monday, Obama said the dictator\u2019s attacks on his own people, including the indiscriminate use of \u201cbarrel bombs\u201d in civilian areas, are \u201can assault on all our humanity.\u201d He also doubled down in his insistence that Assad must go.\n\nRelated: As Russian Weapons Stream in, How Far Will Putin Go in Syria?\n\nPutin, however, feels differently. In an interview released over the weekend, he described the U.S. effort to aid rebels fighting Assad as against the law.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to the principles of modern international law and the United Nations Charter,\u201d Putin said.\n\nIn a development that looks problematic for the Obama administration, at least one of the United States\u2019 traditional allies now appears to agree with the Russian strongman. Australia, which has been participating in the U.S.-led air operation against ISIS, appears to have broken with the Obama administration on the Assad question.\n\nOver the weekend, Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop met with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and afterward told reporters that the Australian government was not making the removal of Assad a requirement of reaching a conclusion in Syria.\n\nReal: Now We Know What Putin Is Up to in Syria\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a political outcome in Damascus - all options should remain on the table,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, disagreement over a single foreign policy issue is hardly evidence of a breakdown in relations, but the news about Australia, coming as it does on the heels of the news that the Iraqi government, which is still largely propped up by the U.S., secretly negotiated an information sharing agreement with Russia, demonstrates that the ground is still moving under Obama\u2019s feet in the Middle East, and that finding a balance might be more difficult than anyone realized.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a forceful speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday morning, President Obama pointedly criticized Russia, and by implication Russian President Vladimir Putin, for its support of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
