On this week's podcast we hear from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) about his bill to pursue police demilitarization, discuss the Confederate flag and the aftermath of the Emanuel AME church shooting in Charleston, debrief on the Supreme Court Obamacare ruling and find out why the state of Florida actually banished one of its residents.\n\nListen to this week's \"So, That Happened\" podcast below:\n\n* * *\n\nSome highlights from this week:\n\n\u201cWhat did Scalia want? Does he not realize that if they had upheld this decision, it would have brought every legal troll in the world out with their magnifying glasses looking for tiny little grammatical mistakes in laws to get them overturned.\u201d \u2014 Jason Linkins, on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissatisfaction with the Obamacare ruling\n\n\"If Senate Democrats had wanted to kill it, they could have. Instead, they decided to let it go through without getting anything in return.\u201d \u2014 Zach Carter, on the Senate\u2019s approval of Obama\u2019s controversial trade agenda\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s a culture that enables or says it's okay for law enforcement officers to shoot to kill blacks, be they male or female, Hispanics \u2026 to use excessive force. Yes, I do think it\u2019s a cultural issue within certain departments. Certain departments have a documented history of using excessive force.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Hank Johnson, on the perceived culture in some police departments\n\n\u201cYes, I do think Confederate flags should come down off of statehouses, but ultimately, I personally wouldn\u2019t care that much if they stayed if I saw some type of political shift away from racism.\u201d \u2014 Julia Craven, on the implications of Confederate flags being taken down in Southern states\n\n* * *\n\nThis podcast was produced and edited by Ibrahim Balkhy and engineered by Brad Shannon, with assistance from Christine Conetta and Adriana Usero.\n\nTo listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.
