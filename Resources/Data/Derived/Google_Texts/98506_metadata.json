The unnamed man, a PhD-holding scientist, told HONY\u2019s Brandon Stanton that his wife, daughter, brother, and four other members of his family were killed when a Syrian government missile ripped through a housing development he himself had built for them.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI was overseeing a project outside the city when the missile hit my house. Nobody was around to help, so my son had to carry the pieces of his mother and sister out of the house,\u201d the refugee told HONY. \u201cHe was fourteen at the time. He was so smart. He was the top of his class. He\u2019s not the same. Right after it happened, he\u2019d write \u2018mom\u2019 in his notebook over and over. He\u2019d cry all night long.\u201d\n\nThe man said he took his remaining son and daughter and fled to Istanbul.\n\n\u201cWe survived but we\u2019re dead psychologically,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything ended for us that day. That was our destiny. That was our share in life.\u201d\n\nThe Scientist said he recently found out he would be sent to live in Troy, Michigan, where he is hoping doctors can cure him of stomach cancer and that he still believes he \u201chas a chance to make a difference in the world.\u201d He said he would like to patent several ideas for inventions, including a device that could predict earthquakes and a plane that could fly for 48 hours without fuel.\n\nThe man\u2019s story caught the attention of President Obama, who commented on the HONY post:\n\nAs a husband and a father, I cannot even begin to imagine the loss you\u2019ve endured. You and your family are an inspiration. I know that the great people of Michigan will embrace you with the compassion and support you deserve. Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we\u2019re proud that you\u2019ll pursue your dreams here. Welcome to your new home. You\u2019re part of what makes America great.\u201d\n\nThe post also caught the attention of actor Edward Norton, who set up a crowdfunding campaign for the man on his website CrowdRise.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t welcome people like this into our communities and empower his dream of making an impact with his life, then we\u2019re not the country we tell ourselves we are,\u201d Norton wrote in a letter accompanying the campaign. \u201cLet\u2019s reject the \u2018anti-human\u2019 voices that tell us to fear refugees and show this man and his family what Americans are really made of. Let\u2019s show that a country built by the energy and dreams of immigrants still believes in brave people who come here with hope for better life.\n\nAt the time of publication, the campaign had raised more than $381,000 from 13,236 individual donors. A spokesman for Norton told the New York Daily News that the actor had contributed $1,000 to the campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands of people, including Edward Norton, have contributed more than $300,000 in support of a Syrian refugee known as \"The Scientist.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Thousands of people, including Edward Norton, have contributed more than $300,000 in support of a Syrian refugee known as \"The Scientist.\"", "title": "Edward Norton Helps Raise over $300K for Michigan-Bound Syrian Refugee \u2018The Scientist' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/edward-norton-excellence-award-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/12/13/edward-norton-helps-raise-300k-michigan-bound-syrian-refugee-scientist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thousands of people, including Edward Norton, have contributed more than $300,000 in support of a Syrian refugee known as \"The Scientist.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/edward-norton-excellence-award-AP.jpg", "title": "Edward Norton Helps Raise over $300K for Michigan-Bound Syrian Refugee \u2018The Scientist' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CrowdRise, Edward Norton, HONY, Humans of New York, President Obama, Syrian refugees, The Scientist,Big Hollywood, Middle East, Obama,norton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "The Scientist", "published_time": "2015-12-13T20:55:47-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,Obama,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Nobody was around to help, so my son had to carry the pieces of his mother and sister out of the house,\u201d the refugee told HONY.\nA spokesman for Norton told the New York Daily News that the actor had contributed $1,000 to the campaign.\nThe Michigan-bound refugee recounted his story in a series of posts on the HONY Facebook page.\nYou\u2019re part of what makes America great.\u201dThe post also caught the attention of actor Edward Norton, who set up a crowdfunding campaign for the man on his website CrowdRise.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI was overseeing a project outside the city when the missile hit my house."}
