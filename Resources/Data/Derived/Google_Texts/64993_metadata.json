The radical UN \u201cSustainable Development Goals,\u201d which would put virtually every realm of human activity in the crosshairs, include, among other controversial provisions, proposed global \u201ctargets\u201d for reducing premature deaths from various causes. To meet those targets, the experts said, government-run healthcare systems such as the U.K. \u201cNational Health Service\u201d (NHS) are likely to focus more resources on easier-to-save younger people \u2014 at the expense of the elderly whose deaths would not be counted as \u201cpremature.\u201d Some critics are even saying the plan heralds the advent of \u201cdeath panels.\u201d\n\nOfficially dubbed the UN \u201cPost-2015 Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d the plot being pushed by the UN and its member regimes represents a brazen attack on liberty, self-government, markets, national sovereignty, and more \u2014 all under the guise of \u201csolving\u201d all of the world\u2019s real and imagined problems. The death targets are merely one tiny component that includes everything from \u201ceducation\u201d and values to food and health. The specific \u201cSustainable Development Goals,\u201d set to replace the \u201cMillennium Development Goals\u201d established in 2000, are still being hammered out by UN bureaucrats and UN member regimes. Everything from \u201cending poverty\u201d and \u201cending hunger\u201d to \u201cachieving gender equality\u201d and \u201creducing income equality within and between countries\u201d over 15 years is on the agenda. Imagine the coercive powers and the massive amount of resources required to even attempt such scheming.\n\nNow, at least one component of the agenda \u2014 the age discrimination in healthcare \u2014 is coming under heavy criticism in the United Kingdom. In the open letter published by the prominent medical journal The Lancet and widely reported in the British press, the international coalition of experts lambasted the sought-after UN goal and demanded that it be scrapped or revised. Blasting the ideas as \u201cagist\u201d \u2014 discrimination against individuals based on their age \u2014 the signatories argued that the concept of \u201cpremature mortality\u201d has the potential to \u201cundermine the cherished, fundamental principle of health as a universal right for all.\u201d The letter specifically criticizes a previous article on the subject that it says is based on \u201cethical principles\u201d that \u201care deeply troubling\u201d \u2014 namely, \u201cthat people aged 70 years and above do not matter.\u201d\n\nThe signatories also argue that agist discrimination is already strong in areas such as cancer treatment even in high-income countries, and the situation is worse still in poorer nations. In the U.K., as The New American and many other sources have been documenting for years, the government-run healthcare monopoly known as NHS is already infamous for killing off the elderly and denying necessary care to patients. Last year, the U.K. Royal College of Surgeons, stating what was already well known, declared that elderly patients were being denied crucial treatment and operations due to such discrimination, according to British media reports. A few years before that, a British doctor warned that the socialist-style NHS was euthanizing as many as 130,000 patients each year through a controversial end-of-life \u201ccare\u201d method called the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP).\n\nAccording to the letter in The Lancet, even if it is not the intent of those promoting the premature death targets, the inclusion of such goals in the UN \u201cSustainable Development Goals,\u201d set to be adopted in September, \u201cwill inevitably reinforce the ageist bias that pervades many aspects of health-care decision making.\u201d \u201cA chronologically exclusive premature mortality target sends out a strong signal that years lived beyond a given age, such as 60 years or 70 years, are intrinsically less valuable than those of a younger person,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThis misconception builds on a flawed tradition in health-care priority setting, which includes an explicit bias against older people (as opposed to people of so-called economically and socially productive ages).\u201d\n\nThe experts on aging who signed the letter \u2014 associated with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Institute for Ageing and Health at Newcastle University, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, Age UK, and HelpAge \u2014 were led by Peter Lloyd-Sherlock. Speaking to the U.K. Telegraph, the professor of social policy and international development at the University of East Anglia said: \u201cThis premature mortality target is highly unethical, since it unjustifiably discriminates against older people.\u201d He also noted that there is already age discrimination in cancer care and surgery, but that the UN targets would give the agism the \u201cstamp of approval.\u201d However, the targets are \u201cnot quite set in stone yet, so we have a final opportunity to impress upon the UN the need to alter this explicitly ageist health target.\u201d If that does not happen, he warned ominously, \u201cpeople aged 70 and over will become second-class citizens as far as health policy is concerned.\u201d\n\nLost amid the whole debate over the UN death targets and agism in healthcare, though, are several crucial overarching questions that must be addressed and are more important even than the discrimination debate. First of all, why is the UN \u2014 widely and properly ridiculed as the \u201cdictators club\u201d for its autocratic membership roster \u2014 setting \u201ctargets\u201d and making 15-year \u201cagendas\u201d that will influence or even dictate national policy to begin with? Are the British and their elected representatives incapable of governing themselves without UN \u201ctargets\u201d to guide their decisions? As the British struggle to free themselves from the European Union super-state, why is it accepted as inevitable that the UN\u2019s \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d will guide U.K. policy on healthcare or anything else? Allowing Third World dictators to tell the once proud British people how to run their affairs should be seen as a disgrace \u2014 and it should be firmly rejected.\n\nSecond of all, why is the government involved in healthcare to begin with? Are citizens incapable of making their own medical decisions and looking after their own health without the nanny state? Considering the atrocious track record of the socialist-style NHS regime, it is way past time for the United Kingdom to abolish socialized medicine and allow the free market to work its magic. Allowing government to ration and control medical care \u2014 whether based on UN death targets or the whims of homegrown politicians and bureaucrats \u2014 has been shown conclusively to be a disaster, not to mention immoral. From euthanizing the elderly and urging them to sign \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d directives, to being consistently unable to meet the needs of patients, it is time for the NHS and similar socialized medicine regimes to be tossed on the ash heap of failed ideas with devastating and deadly consequences.\n\nFinally, with the ongoing disaster that is the deeply unpopular \u201cObamaCare,\u201d are Americans traveling down the same dark road as the British? Absolutely. As the outlandish and impossibly expensive \u201cAffordable Care\u201d system implodes in on itself, and costs continue to spiral out of control thanks to government intervention, calls are growing for a full-blown socialized system to take its place. Even without a so-called \u201csingle payer system,\u201d though, ObamaCare represents a de facto nationalization of healthcare in America. And with the tacit support from the GOP majority in Congress, which continues to fund ObamaCare despite deceitful promises to voters and harsh rhetoric, Americans can look forward to a nightmarish healthcare future of rationing, discrimination against the elderly, no more privacy, and more \u2014 at least if nothing changes.\n\nTo solve many of the most urgent healthcare problems would be relatively simple \u2014 dismantle socialized medical systems, withdraw from the UN, and return to the eternal principles of liberty, responsibility, and national independence. However, for that to happen, the British and American publics must get educated, organized, and active, all in the face of a massive propaganda campaign by the UN. The alternative to stopping it \u2014 UN death targets, death panels, government rationing, \u201csustainable\u201d tyranny, and more \u2014 must be crushed for the benefit of all.\n\nAlex Newman, a foreign correspondent for The New American, is normally based in Europe.
