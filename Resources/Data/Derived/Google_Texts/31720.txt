An early-February poll showed him more or less tied with former state treasurer Shane Osborn, but a poll from late February has Sasse trailing by eleven points, 35–24, with 30 percent undecided.

A group called Legacy Foundation Action Fund recently announced it’s spending $300,000 in behalf of Sasse’s campaign, running ads by famed GOP ad maker Larry McCarthy touting his conservative bona fides.
