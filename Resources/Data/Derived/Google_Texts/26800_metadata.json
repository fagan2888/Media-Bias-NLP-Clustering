But later this year, residents who shop for their own insurance will have a choice of two new companies \u2014 one launched by young tech entrepreneurs and the other a non-profit cooperative.\n\nVIOREL FLORESCU /STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Mario Schlosser, co-CEO of Oscar Insurance, in front of a board with the goals for the month of October in the company's office.\n\nThe two upstarts are Oscar Insurance, the brainchild of Joshua Kushner, scion of the Kushner real estate fortune, and Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey, conceived by the Freelancers Union, an association of independent workers, and funded with loans from the federal government. If they succeed, they may just goad the traditional behemoths of insurance into a different way of doing business. And by increasing the competition for people who buy their own coverage, they may already be helping to hold down premiums.\n\nMitsu Yasukawa/ Staff Photographer James A. Martin, CEO of Health Republic Insurance of New Jersey, at his office in Newark.\n\n\u201cThese innovative new entrants are shaking things up for the entire industry,\u201d said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PriceWaterhouseCoopers\u2019 Health Research Institute, which recently released a report asking, \u201cWho will be the [health care] industry\u2019s next Amazon.com?\u201d\n\nWith millions of new paying customers buying insurance nationwide, thanks to Obamacare, the market is wide open and attractive to both traditional and new insurance carriers. More than half a million people in New Jersey who didn\u2019t have insurance obtained it over the last year, according to a recent survey, receiving coverage through the new federal marketplace, the individual market, their jobs or Medicaid.\n\nOscar and Health Republic are among five companies that will offer insurance in New Jersey starting Nov. 15 through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s HealthCare.gov, the shopping site through which 162,000 residents here bought coverage for 2014. The others are Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state\u2019s largest insurer; AmeriHealth of New Jersey, and UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s largest insurer. United jumps into New Jersey and two dozen other states with Obamacare plans for the first time this year, but already insures more than 1.6 million people here through Medicare, Medicaid and employer-sponsored plans.\n\nSo far, the start-ups have barely made a dent in the New Jersey market.\n\nHealth Republic suffered with the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov website a year ago and enrolled just 4,000 New Jersey residents its first year. Oscar, which starts selling in the state in five weeks, has about 17,000 members in New York City and surrounding counties.\n\nTheir biggest impact, however, may lie in the way they disrupt business as usual. \u201cThe new players typically are more nimble. They are more consumer-friendly,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cThat is serving as a wake-up call to the entire industry.\u201d They are forcing insurers, who long have dealt with human-resources directors or other big purchasers, to focus on individual customers.\n\nEach will do that somewhat differently: Oscar appeals to digital natives with its smartphone apps and integration of \u201ctele-health\u201d into all its plans. Health Republic differentiates itself through its non-profit philosophy of membership control.\n\nSubway ads\n\nOscar brought humor to the staid world of health insurance when it debuted its New York City subway ads last year. \u201cGet a bright, articulate doctor to call you back without having to join a dating site,\u201d read one. \u201cHealth insurance that won\u2019t make your head explode,\u201d read another. \u201cAnd if it does, you\u2019re covered.\u201d\n\nThat message will be coming soon to the Hoboken and Secaucus train stations and the insides of some NJ Transit buses and railcars. Oscar is licensed to sell policies in the state\u2019s nine northernmost counties, including Bergen and Passaic. The company\u2019s goal is to sell to about 10 percent of the people who buy during the three-month open-enrollment period.\n\nFounded by three friends who graduated from Harvard Business School, Oscar is named after the 29-year-old Kushner\u2019s great-grandfather. (Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, a New Jersey native, is known for his real estate empire).\n\nMario Schlosser, 36, a co-CEO, is a computer scientist who founded a Latin American social-gaming company with Joshua Kushner and worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. Kevin Nazemi, 33, also a co-CEO, is a veteran of Microsoft\u2019s customer relations management division.\n\nThe company is built around its technology platforms, which are designed to make health insurance easy for individual consumers to buy and use. Ninety percent of its members have created personal logins to use the insurer\u2019s website, said Schlosser. And 90 percent of those completed a health assessment and agreed to have their health history imported into the insurer\u2019s data bank, he said \u2014 part of an Oscar promotion in which patients receive $10 for answering 10 questions about their health and preferences.\n\nThe company focuses on the retail experience \u2014 on the one hand, employing customer service staff at their headquarters in New York City\u2019s Puck Building to answer callers\u2019 questions about health insurance and, on the other hand, streamlining its website so people need spend only 15 minutes to buy insurance.\n\n\u201cI think the advantage we have is that we\u2019re fully focused on the individual market,\u201d Schlosser said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what we do best \u2014 no small groups.\u201d All of their marketing is tailored to people who are making their own decisions about which coverage to buy \u2014 not to benefits specialists or small-business owners. They aim their pitch at people who work for themselves, web-using freelancers such as Uber drivers and the errand runners of TaskRabbit.\n\nOscar also features doctor callbacks (guaranteed within an hour, usually within 10 minutes, said Schlosser) from board-certified doctors licensed in the state where the policy is sold. Notes from the doctor\u2019s call appear on a private, Facebook-like timeline for each member that includes details of each interaction with the insurer and the health system.\n\nIf medication is prescribed, the site links to drug information. It also guides the prescribing doctor to in-network pharmacies mapped out like a restaurant app around the member\u2019s location. For parents with small children, the ability to get a pediatrician on the phone in the middle of the night is welcome, Schlosser said, from firsthand experience, and he believes it will end up reducing insurance costs by cutting down on unnecessary ER or doctor visits.\n\nMembers in New Jersey will be able to use the network of nearly all of the state\u2019s acute-care hospitals and 24,000 physicians managed by QualCare, a Piscataway-based company that was founded in 1991 by some of the state\u2019s hospitals to insure their own employees. The hospitals will be grouped into different tiers, with a higher level of coverage for selected \u201ctier one\u201d hospitals. Details of those selections are not yet final, a spokeswoman said.\n\nA few insurance brokers interviewed said they were unfamiliar with Oscar, and not sure of the need for it, particularly because the QualCare network is also used by Health Republic.\n\n\u201cI think they will attract the younger crowd,\u201d said Jeffrey Ingalls, a partner at Stratford Financial Group, a benefits consulting firm, \u201cthe people who would rather text than call. If you\u2019re 55 and in cancer treatment, is it right for you?\u201d\n\nPoonam Alaigh, a former New Jersey commissioner of health, is a medical director and consultant to Oscar for clinical management in New Jersey. She said the company aims \u201cto demystify health insurance using technology. \u2026 They\u2019ve brought together all the key elements of what we need to do to bring change in health insurance and the health-care delivery system.\u201d\n\nThe company received its New Jersey license on Aug. 18, and has capital reserves in New Jersey of $3.5 million, a spokes\u00adwoman said. Oscar has received investments of $155 million from Kushner\u2019s firm, Thrive Capital, and various other venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures and the Founders Fund.\n\nNon-profit experiment\n\nHealth Republic, in contrast, received its start-up funds from the federal government.\n\nTucked into the massive federal health-reform law was a provision that aimed to create non-profit competitors to the big for-profit companies that dominated the insurance industry. In Western states, co-ops provide electricity and water services. The Affordable Care Act essentially funded an experiment to see if the same principles would work in health care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s historic,\u201d said Dr. Ed Anselm, Health Republic\u2019s medical director. \u201cWe change the dynamic. Recognizing we do everything health plans do, people want to join us to be part of the process of changing health care.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, these new non-profit plans enrolled 400,000 people for 2014, and were the biggest sellers on the exchanges in New York and Maine. In the coming year, they\u2019ll offer coverage in 26 states.\n\nHealth Republic \u2014 which operates plans in New Jersey, New York and Oregon \u2014 was the idea of the Freelancers Union, an association of 246,000 independent workers nationwide who develop solutions to common concerns such as health insurance and retirement security, and its founder, MacArthur Fellow Sara Horowitz. The New Jersey plan received $13 million in start-up loans and $94 million in solvency loans, repayable over a 20-year period starting in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only true not-for-profit [insurance] company in the state,\u201d said James A. Martin, its chief executive officer, in an interview at its Newark office.\n\nWhat that means in practice is that the law requires surpluses to be returned to members. In the future, Martin said, a board dominated by members of the cooperative will decide how to spend the company\u2019s operating surplus. \u201cWe can either return some of that premium to members,\u201d he said. \u201cOr we can expand our offerings. Should we cover some of the non-traditional aspects of medicine that are very popular with people?\u201d he added, joking that he\u2019d like to issue Fitbits to every member. \u201cThey will vote on how to do this.\u201d\n\nThe first consumer board member will be elected from Health Republic\u2019s membership this year, and within three years, five of the nine board members will be consumers, he said.\n\nFirst, however, the company needs enough customers to generate a surplus.\n\nSo far, they\u2019ve had a tough road. For a start-up with no name recognition, the technical problems with HealthCare.gov were challenging. The marketing the company could do was limited by the terms of its federal loan. In addition, company executives said they were surprised to see their prices undercut by competitors whose premiums were based on coverage through a narrow network of hospitals and doctors. All of Health Republic\u2019s customers had access to all of the hospitals and doctors in QualCare\u2019s network, which encompassed nearly every hospital in the state, said Cynthia Jay, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer. And that attracted patients who expected to take advantage of the full network\u2019s health services.\n\nThis year, the company plans to offer new types of plans \u2014 some with enhanced coverage for using selected providers \u2014 and also move aggressively into the small business market.\n\nIn response to member feedback, the company has added \u201cwrap-around coverage,\u201d to enable patients to see doctors in neighboring states, and eliminated the need for a referral from a primary-care doctor before seeing a specialist. All members will get a 24/7 telemedicine benefit, allowing them to call a board-certified in-state doctor with medical questions. A check with the state Insurance Department showed that no member complaints have been filed against them.\n\nThose adjustments, said Jay, illustrate the co-op philosophy. \u201cOne of the things we pride ourselves on is customer service and listening. We get back to people quite quickly. We hear what they\u2019re saying.\u201d She adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a huge humanistic element to health care. There\u2019s a doctor-patient relationship that you can\u2019t discard through mobile apps.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s health law has created millions of new customers for the insurance industry, giving \u201copportunities for traditional players to grow and for new entrants to come in and get a piece of the action,\u201d said Connolly, of PriceWaterhouseCoopers.\n\nOver the next four months, the competition will play out in face-to-face marketing, such as Horizon\u2019s walk-in center in Moorestown and its mobile enrollment van; in mass transit campaigns; billboards; print ads, and digital marketing.\n\nLongtime players point to their track records and brand identity: \u201cOur focus is on the needs of our more than 3.7 million members, not our competitors,\u201d Horizon spokesman Thomas Vincz said. \u201cWe have the largest network of patient-centered doctor practices in the state.\u201d\n\nWhether the new start-ups survive in a business based on risk remains to be seen. The changes they bring \u2014 in marketing, customer service and data transparency \u2014 also are just beginning to unfold.\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "For decades, the world of health insurance in New Jersey has been dominated by huge companies with billions of dollars in assets and millions of customers.
