SEATTLE — A truck stolen from a Montana firefighter and his wife during their visit to Seattle for a fundraiser to fight cancer has been found and now Seattle police are asking for help identifying the suspect.

Shawn Ellinghouse and his wife Kirsty drove to Seattle from Seeley Lake, MT to participate in the 24th Annual Scott Firefighter Stairclimb on March 8th, an event where firefighters climb the Columbia Center stairs to raise money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

The couple stayed at a hotel in the 200 block of Aurora Avenue. Their 2007 Toyota Tundra was stolen on March 8th at 11:31 pm from the secured hotel parking garage.

At 12:54 am, the suspect wearing an argyle sweater used Kirsty’s credit card at a 7-Eleven on Queen Anne Ave N. At 2:13 am, he’s seen wearing a Denver Broncos jacket at a 7-Eleven on Nickerson Street. That jacket belongs to Kirsty.

The couple’s truck was found on March 12 parked at 1320 Mercer Street. Detectives say it also got two parking tickets at 500 N. Pontius St.

“All of our firefighter gear was in the truck, but they took my wife’s computer, wallet and other electronics. They also smoked in the truck and I believe it has some damage on the back panel,” said Ellinghouse.

He is working with the insurance company now to get it returned and repaired.

Crime Stoppers of Puget Sound is offering a cash reward of up to $1,000 for information leading to the suspect’s arrest.
