It\u2019s a report with something to outrage just about everyone.\n\nFor example, the whole thing is, like occupational licensing schemes everywhere, an anti-competitive scam designed by poorly qualified incumbents to block competition. As the Post notes...\n\nThe problem for personal trainers is that no standards currently exist. Instead, dozens of competing descriptions have been written by gym owners, for-profit training companies and self-proclaimed fitness experts. There are even competing organizations that certify competing tests.\n\nWait, you mean that different trainers and fitness organizations might, like, do things differently?\n\nObviously this is a serious problem that has to be solved, and only \u201can obscure group of D.C. regulators\u201d with eyebrow-raising professional ties can do it:\n\nGrappling with all of that, an obscure group of D.C. regulators \u2014 the Board of Physical Therapy \u2014 is preparing to release rules that could send a shock wave through the American fitness industry. Fearing the outcome, some of the loudest voices in the field have decided to go on the offensive. They are calling the process into question and urging city lawmakers to pull back or even halt the effort with threats of drawn-out legal battles. Some exercise specialists who work most closely with medical groups say the D.C. physical therapy board has an inherent conflict of interest and is trying to restrict professionals with whom their own industry is in direct competition. They point to draft language that could be construed as cutting out personal trainers from potentially billable future work.\n\nOnce again, wait: You really mean that professional groups granted regulatory power over their rivals might use licensing requirements in self-interested ways? Who could possibly have imagined that this would happen?\n\nRules have already been considered that would either block new entrants to the physical fitness market or saddle them with enormous expenses. Crossfit, which I have never tried, but which lots of people seem to enjoy quite a bit, seems to be a particular target. One D.C. Crossfit entrepreneur, a former legal worker, tells the Post that he would not have been able to open his facilities under one requirement that has already been floated:\n\nOne early proposal that the D.C. board discussed but appears to have moved away from would have required personal trainers to have as much as a four-year degree. Killion said that if such a rule were adopted, he almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have abandoned a career in law. \u201cI would have never been able to start my business, and we wouldn\u2019t have people who have lost 100 pounds if that were the case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe requirements aren\u2019t just anti-competitive and anti-business, they are also, as Killion\u2019s previous quote hints, potentially anti-health.\n\nNot only would they make it more expensive and onerous to operate fitness facilities, and thus make it likely that there would be fewer of them and that fewer people would be members, they also have the potential to reshape the sorts of classes and services that gyms offer, and, in addition, to impose one-size-fits-all fitness requirements that don\u2019t reflect individual preferences or physical responsiveness:\n\n\u201cThis will affect everyone because \u2018fitness\u2019 is a nebulous term. That\u2019s why we have so many pathways to achieve it . . . we all respond differently to exercise and we all have different factors in our lives that come into play in trying to attain it,\u201d said Phillip Godfrey, a medical exercise specialist in the District who has tracked the D.C. law for months and has become convinced the final product will be problematic for his livelihood. \u201cThe term \u2018personal fitness trainer\u2019 is not true for everyone in the industry,\u201d Godfrey continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a known title, but there are kinesiologists, corrective specialists . . . literally hundreds of titles and sub-specialties. Setting one pathway, one test, one methodology to train individuals \u2014 that can be problematic. It may work for some and not others.\u201d\n\nThis entire lovely mess is, of course, thanks to the expansive and unknowable glories of Obamacare:\n\nThe credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 for the newfound urgency can be traced in part to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. A variety of workplace wellness programs and preventive health-care initiatives called for in the law could soon translate into rivers of billable hours for those with credentials to keep American waistlines in check.\n\nDoes anyone really think that any meaningful, mass improvements in health and fitness will come of this? Based on the long history of poor government health interventions and dietary recommendations, which have similarly attempted (and in many cases still attempt) to impose dubiously sourced, centrally devised, often provably wrong eating guidelines on aspects of personal health that are inherently individual in nature, the answer to that question at least should be a resounding no.\n\nHowever, I will say this for Obamacare's effect on my personal physical fitness: It manages to get my heart rate up just thinking about it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "For a rage-inducing glimpse at the bureaucratic horrorshow that inevitably results when municipal governments attempt to lead the nation on health regulations", "title": "D.C.\u2019s Attempt to License Personal Trainers Is Anti-Business, Anti-Competition, and (Probably) Anti-Health.
