WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Winds from an extremely powerful cyclone that blew through the Pacific’s Vanuatu archipelago were beginning to subside Saturday, revealing widespread destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths as relief workers rushed to assess the damage.

Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer who is in Port Vila, said the capital’s streets were littered with roofs blown from homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. She said she’s hearing reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.

She said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.

“It’s still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down,” she said. “The damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands. I can’t even imagine what it’s like in those vulnerable communities.”

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by Cyclone Pam wasn’t yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.

“We hope the loss of life will be minimal,” he said during a World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan. The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.

The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants: “I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu.”

“I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy,” he said. “I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster.”

Morrison said the winds seemed to peak between midnight and 1 a.m. Saturday. She said she was in a fully boarded-up cyclone-proof house but still spent a frightening night as a tree and a tin roof from a nearby home hit her house.
