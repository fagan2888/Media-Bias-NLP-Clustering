But running as a Republican would also be problematic.\n\nPutting aside the possibility of being branded as a turncoat who handed control of the Senate over to Democrats at a crucial time in the George W. Bush presidency, Webb has an even bigger problem with GOP voters: He voted for Obamacare, though he later said he regretted it.\n\nHe could be a credible independent candidate, though. Remember: This is a guy who walked away from the Senate after a single term because he didn't want to be a lifelong politician.\n\nA Naval Academy graduate and Vietnam combat veteran, Webb's most recent party switch in 2006 was motivated in a large part by his opposition to the Bush administration's conduct of the Iraq war. But as a senator, he was also one of the most vocal critics of President Obama's decision to go to war in Libya without consulting Congress. Polls indicate that the national mood is shifting more in the direction of his views.\n\nWebb also pushed hard in the Senate for federal sentencing reform, especially in drug cases -- a cause that many Republican politicians have embraced, most notably Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a potential 2016 candidate.\n\nAnd his economic populism and disdain for politics-as-usual could resonate with people who feel left out of the system right now, both in the Tea Party and also among the Occupy Wall Street crowd.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's lots of chatter over the fact that Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-Democrat Jim Webb indicated Monday he's considering running for president in 2016.\nMy wife and I are just thinking about what to do next.
