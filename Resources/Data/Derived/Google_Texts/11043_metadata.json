Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against the GOP plan because it spends too much, while Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida led the ranks of big spenders.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure. The GOP plan for fiscal 2016 is much better than President Obama\u2019s. Saying he\u2019s had enough of \u201cmindless austerity,\u201d Mr. Obama blew past the caps on domestic and defense spending he had agreed to in the Budget Control Act of 2011. His plan is packed full of new giveaways, such as free community college.\n\nIn contrast, the Republican plan manages to stay under the domestic spending cap \u2014 an achievement in Washington\u2019s spendaholic culture. When it came to defense spending, though, many Republicans fell back on familiar inside-the-Beltway budget tricks.\n\nThe nonpartisan National Defense Panel reported to Congress that new threats \u2014 Russian aggression, the collapse of the Iraqi army, and the rise of the Islamic State \u2014 require more front-line military spending. Mr. Obama has decimated front-line capacity and spent funds instead for more civilian staff at the Pentagon. The Pentagon\u2019s civilian workforce is up to a staggering 744,000, while military personnel have been cut and weapons systems canceled.\n\nRepublican lawmakers all agree more spending on battle readiness is needed. But they disagree over how to deal with the defense spending cap. One obvious remedy is to redirect funds from civilian desk jobs to combat personnel and weapons. Another is to cut domestic spending by however much defense spending exceeds the cap.\n\nSadly, the Republican majority opted for neither, and instead resorted to an accounting gimmick, adding new spending to an Overseas Contingency Fund that is exempt from the cap.\n\nOutraged, Republican Rep. Mike Mulvaney of South Carolina laments that in the House, \u201cFiscal hawks make up a minority of the party right now,\u201d and he wonders whether \u201cdeficits and debt still matter.\u201d\n\nDitto for the Senate. Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama calls spending caps \u201cone of the best things that\u2019s happened to the finances of this country.\u201d But Mr. Graham dismisses them as \u201cdumb.\u201d He says \u201cthis is a war within the Republican Party.\u201d Sadly, big spenders are winning.\n\nMr. Paul offered a proposal to offset the defense hikes with cuts to domestic spending, but it was defeated 96-4. That\u2019s a discouraging sign that voters are not going to get what they were promised last November: a serious effort to control costs and address the soaring debt.\n\nIf you run a business or a family budget and you\u2019re forced to spend unexpectedly in one area, you cut elsewhere. Congress could have started by cutting the 100 most unnecessary government projects, saving $25 billion a year, according to former Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s \u201cWastebook.\u201d\n\nAmong them is a grant to Columbia University to invent interactive games that spur climate change activism, and a grant to the Colorado Symphony Orchestra to host a marijuana music festival called \u201cthe High Note Series. \u201d Better to cut these than to hand out pink slips to soldiers.\n\nAnother discouraging sign is the deal House Speaker John Boehner made with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently on the so-called \u201cdoc fix.\u201d Congress was up against a deadline to prevent pay cuts to doctors treating Medicare patients. To woo Democrats, Mr. Boehner agreed to a two-year extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and a $7.2 billion grant to Community Health Centers that serve largely illegal immigrants. This package of entitlement goodies costs $214 billion, and a whopping two-thirds is unpaid for. No one in Congress lifted a finger to find cuts in other programs to offset these new costs. Instead, the billions will be piled on the nation\u2019s debt.\n\nMr. Boehner and Mrs. Pelosi congratulated themselves on their bipartisanship. \u201cThis is what we can accomplish when we focus on finding common ground,\u201d Mr. Boehner proudly announced. Common ground for Washington politicians, but not for John Q. Taxpayer and his grandkids. They\u2019ll be paying forever.\n\n\u2022 Betsy McCaughey is author of \u201cBeating Obamacare 2014\u201d (Regnery, 2014) and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Analysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican majority's budget plan \u2014 enacted in a blitz of votes before lawmakers rushed home for spring break \u2014 tells us which Republican presidential hopefuls are serious about halting the nation's soaring debt.
