Well, the Internet, of course.\n\nHere are 10 of the most outrageous, unique and \u2018Are you serious?\u2019 questions asked on Yahoo Answers. Let\u2019s see if we can answer a few, shall we?\n\n1. Do I look Native American?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell. Your avatar is too small.\n\n2. Which is more politically correct: Native American, or American Indian?\n\nHow about: \u201cThe-millions-and-millions-of-people-who-were-here-before-everyone-else-and-got-robbed-by-land-and-gold-horny-settlers\u201d? I know it\u2019s long, but it\u2019s more accurate than the former, don\u2019t you think? Yeppers.\n\n3. Jewish Holocaust and Native American Genocide?\n\nSimilarity: Both were brutal. Difference: The U.S. recognizes one, but not the other.\n\n4. Why do white people hate Native Americans?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say all of them do, user who goes by the screen name Butterfly, but to those who, in fact, do hate Native Americans I would say it\u2019s because we\u2019re awesome, sexy, smart, resilient, talented and pretty good at making out.\n\n5. What is Native American Day?\n\nIt\u2019s the day when you\u2019re really fat on turkey and stuffing and wait in long lines in the cold to purchase things that\u2019ll be out of date in a week or rendered useless after the warranty expires \u2013 otherwise known as \u201cBlack Friday.\u201d Seriously. Black Friday is also Native American Heritage Day. Thanks, Bush.\n\n6. Native American men????\n\nI think Wab Kinew is married \u2026 or is he engaged? I don\u2019t know. Is Thosh Collins single? And dear Chaske Spencer, if you ever bump into my mother, I swear, man, just hightail it the other direction. She\u2019s handsy. \u2026 Oh, and yes, the question: You can find fine Native men at libraries, coffee shops and pow wows, among a bevy of other haunts. Happy hunting.\n\n7. Why do so many Americans claim to be part Native American?\n\nI would say we answered this one in question No. 4.\n\n8. If Native American ancestors came from Asia, why aren\u2019t we part Asian?\n\nWAIT \u2026 WE\u2019RE NOT?????? (*rolls his eyes.)\n\n9. Were Native Americans barbarians?\n\nI would vehemently argue that it was the Spanish and the British who were the barbarians in this case, and so would the readily available evidence. If you would like to read about their savagery, I would suggest Howard Zinn\u2019s \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas\u2019 \u201cA Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies\u201d and James W. Loewen\u2019s \u201cLies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong.\u201d Happy reading.\n\n10. Why are there no famous Native American actors?\n\nOh, there are. It\u2019s like Bollywood. Bollywood has its celebrities and so does Indian country.\n\nStill, once today\u2019s conglomerate studio heads recognize Native American actors as contemporary thespians ready for the world stage, and not merely figurines capable of only playing the limited role of the noble savage or angry drunk, then you\u2019ll see our indigenous actors in lead, box office roles.\n\nThe short answer: Because \u2013 Johnny Depp.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Weird and Wild \u2018Yahoo Answers\u2019 About Natives", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/18/weird-and-wild-yahoo-answers-about-natives-153157", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/yahoo_answers.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Weird and Wild \u2018Yahoo Answers\u2019 About Natives"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-18T08:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/18/weird-and-wild-yahoo-answers-about-natives-153157", "dc": {"title": "Weird and Wild \u2018Yahoo Answers\u2019 About Natives"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Weird and Wild \u2018Yahoo Answers\u2019 About Natives"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3d8\"", "article_summary": "Which is more politically correct: Native American, or American Indian?\nDo I look Native American?\nNative American men????\nWhere do you go to ask questions about Native Americans if you don\u2019t have a Native American chum readily available to satiate your curiosity?\nIf Native American ancestors came from Asia, why aren\u2019t we part Asian?"}
