Actress Natalie Portman will play Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a film called “On the Basis of Sex,” Deadline Hollywood reported late Friday.

The film, expected to begin production by the end of 2015, will center on Ginsburg’s career pushing for equal rights for women in America.

The scrip was written by Daniel Stiepleman and Marielle Heller is currently in talks to direct the film.

Ginsburg, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, has been a champion of women’s rights since the start of her career, so much so that she has won herself the nickname “Notorious R.B.G.” among young fans.

Portman, a Harvard University graduate, has made quite the name for herself with her Oscar-winning role in “Black Swan” and other star performances in films like “Garden State” and “V for Vendetta.”
