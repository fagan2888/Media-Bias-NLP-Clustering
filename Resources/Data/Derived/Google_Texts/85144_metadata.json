The state has made progress since 2006, when the premature birth rate was at 12.9 percent.\n\nA fetus needs 39 weeks in the womb in order for vital organs, including the brain and lungs, to be fully developed, the report said.\n\nNew Jersey received only a middling grade because more pregnant women lack health coverage: 18.5 percent last year compared to 16.9 percent this year. And 7.9 percent of babies were delivered before 39 weeks via Cesarean section without medical necessity, up from 7.7 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s increase in our pre-term birth rate is disappointing,\u201d said Gerson Weiss, professor emeritus at the Rutgers-Nj Medical School\u2019s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \u201cWe expect this to be a brief setback in our long term progress toward preventing premature birth and giving more babies a healthy start in life. The programs and partnership we have put in place provide the necessary framework for the future of newborn health, and we expect to see better rates in the coming years.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey improved in one area, however. Fewer expectant moms smoked, going from a 16.5 percent rate to a 14.4 percent smoking rate. Lighting up increases the chances of premature birth, according to the report.\n\nThe national pre-term birth rate was 11.4 percent last year, the lowest in 17 years, according to the report.\n\nHealth Commissioner Mary E. O\u2019Dowd said in a statement that reducing premature births has been a priority of her administration.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s commitment to preventing premature birth is demonstrated by the investment of $14 million in grants to community health providers for access to prenatal care, smoking cessation, education about the risks of preterm and early term delivery and to persuade hospitals to closely monitor practices that lead to early term birth,\u201d O\u2019Dowd said.\n\nOne of those programs, the Mom\u2019s Quit Connection, \"links pregnant women and new mothers in New Jersey who want to quit smoking with Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialists to help them decrease the number of cigarettes they smoke with the goal of becoming smoke free.\u201d\n\nNext year, when all of the families who have signed up for Medicaid and FamilyCare are accounted for under the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the rate of uninsured women will plummet, she said.\n\nThe national pre-term birth rate was 11.4 percent last year, the lowest in 17 years, according to the report.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Susan K.
