Samsung Electronic’s latest attack ad takes aim at Apple’s new big screen smartphone iPhone 6 Plus by taking a swipe at itself.

The company’s latest TV ad for the new Samsung Note 4, which debuted this weekend, features a narrator reading aloud negative reviews that the product received three years ago. Like the iPhone 6 Plus, the Note 4 is referred to by some as a “phablet” or a combination of phone and tablet, because of its big size.

“You look like you are talking into a piece of toast,” the narrator says as he reads from the Wall Street Journal. Other comments include a line from Mashable that said “The Note is an unwieldy beast.”

The punchline: “Now it’s not being dismissed by competitors, its being imitated,” the narrator chimes. The ad also features some tweets from consumers that are criticizing Apple for releasing the larger phone after Samsung.
