Unlike the hospital's security personnel, members of the department will have power of arrest on hospital grounds and within the community. Hospital leaders hope it will improve safety to eliminate the step of having to wait for local police to arrive to make arrests. Moreover, it will free up the local police to attend to matters elsewhere in the community, Superintendent of Police and Emergency Management Mike Struble said.\n\nAlso in Indiana, Parkview Hospital swore in 19 new officers last September after eight weeks of training with the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy; the hospital eventually foresees nearly two dozen officers patrolling the entire system, according to WANE.\n\nSimilarly, Memorial Hospital of South Bend formed its own police department last August after a 2013 law made Indiana the 29th state to legalize hospitals forming their own police units, according to Fox 28. Its formation was prompted not by specific events but by the opportunity the new law represented, according to Chief of Police Daniel Rutledge.\n\nIndiana is not the only state where hospitals have taken this step; Adena Regional Medical Center in Ohio created a police department last November, according to the Chillicothe Gazette. The department will prioritize any criminal activity that takes place on hospital grounds, while the security team focuses on operational issues such as safety or rule violations, Chief Robert Coburn, a former police officer and sheriff's deputy, told the Gazette.\n\nIn addition to several high-profile violent incidents in hospitals last year, this year has already seen several incidents unfold, including a standoff in Texas' Tomball Regional Hospital, according to ABC13, and a man in Camden County, New Jersey, who shot his ex-girlfriend before turning the gun on himself outside the hospital emergency room to which they were taken, according to NBC News.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Times article\n\n- read the WANE article\n\n- check out the Fox28 article\n\n- here's the Gazette article\n\n- read the ABC13 article\n\n- here's the NBC article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInd. hospital to start its own police department\n\nFed up with violent incidents, hospitals seek to balance security with patient care\n\nHospital shootings: What to do when disaster strikes\n\nNurse stabbings raise questions on hospital violence\n\nAre hospitals responsible for preventing workplace violence?\n\nViolence against healthcare workers leads to increased focus on safety\n\nViolence against hospital nurses prompts call for education, planning\n\nHow one hospital is taking a stand against employee violence\n\nNurses, emergency department workers often targets of violence", "article_metadata": {"description": "The growing problem of violence in hospitals has led some organizations to form their own police departments.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The growing problem of violence in hospitals has led some organizations to form their own police departments.", "title": "Amid more violence, some hospitals form police departments", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/amid-more-violence-some-hospitals-form-police-departments/2015-01-13", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "hospital police departments,Hospital Security,hospital violence,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "The growing problem of violence in hospitals has led some organizations to form their own police departments.\nUnlike the hospital's security personnel, members of the department will have power of arrest on hospital grounds and within the community.\nhospital to start its own police departmentFed up with violent incidents, hospitals seek to balance security with patient careHospital shootings: What to do when disaster strikesNurse stabbings raise questions on hospital violenceAre hospitals responsible for preventing workplace violence?\nIts formation was prompted not by specific events but by the opportunity the new law represented, according to Chief of Police Daniel Rutledge.\nViolence against healthcare workers leads to increased focus on safetyViolence against hospital nurses prompts call for education, planningHow one hospital is taking a stand against employee violenceNurses, emergency department workers often targets of violence"}
