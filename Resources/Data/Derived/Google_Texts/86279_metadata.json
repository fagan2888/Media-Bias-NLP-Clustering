Everywhere rapacious bankers, money lenders, plutocrats and health company executives are conspiring to enrich themselves off the labors, and dreams, of regular Americans.\n\nWhen they held their Dec. 19 presidential debate, the three Democrats seemed as if they were gearing up for a revolution \u2014 as if they had forget their party has held the White House for the past seven years. According to the Democrats, Obama\u2019s time in the White House has done little to reshuffle the economic deck to benefit Americans.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nVermont Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, who leads Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, said in his opening statement that he was running for President because,\n\nour economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent. I\u2019m running for president because I\u2019m going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.\n\nClinton, discussing the challenges facing the next President noted that, \u201cif we don\u2019t get the American economy moving and growing, we\u2019re not going to recognize our country and we\u2019re not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.\u201d\n\nThe most difficult challenge for the candidates, though, is recognizing that their party has been in the White House for seven years.\n\nThe Great Recession officially ended in early 2009, just months after President Obama took office. The economic \u201crecovery\u201d under Obama, however, has been the weakest in modern times. Annual growth has barely kept pace with increases in population and inflation. The number of Americans not in the labor force is at the highest levels in almost 40 years.\n\nThe percentage of income going to the top 5 percent has increased during the Obama presidency, after falling during George Bush\u2019s tenure. The share of the national income going to the Middle Class is lower now than when Bush left office.\n\nWhile Sanders, Clinton and O\u2019Malley all blasted large banks on Wall Street during the debate, it was the decision of Obama\u2019s Justice Department not to press criminal charges on those responsible for the financial crash. Obama\u2019s SEC has also failed to pursue aggressive oversight of Wall Street\u2019s largest banks.\n\nEven though President Obama only enjoyed two years with his party in control of both houses of Congress, Republicans haven\u2019t rolled back any of Obama\u2019s policies. The GOP even acquiesced on raising taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers and has funded all of the Obama Administration\u2019s priorities.\n\nEven as ObamaCare struggles with innumerable challenges, these are arising from the functioning of the law, rather than Republican repeal of defunding actions. Hillary Clinton, during the debate, decried \u201cglitches\u201d in the law, as premiums and deductibles rise higher than expected, but these are arising as the law works as envisioned.\n\nObamaCare was developed, promoted and implemented in close cooperation with pharmaceutical and health insurance companies. The drug companies spent tens of millions of dollars in advertising promoting the law. Obama gave health insurance companies a government-enforced mandate for all Americans to buy their products.\n\nFor their own political futures, the candidates on stage during the debate were correct to focus on economic issues. Democrats, far more than Republicans, list the economy as their top issue in the election. The biggest issue for Republicans is national security. For Democrats, though, national security is almost just the 3rd most important issue, only barely edging out eduction.\n\nFor his entire Presidency, Obama has argued that the economy is improving and getting much stronger. His fiscal policy has poured trillions into boosting the economy. The Fed\u2019s monetary policy has pumped multiple trillions into the financial markets to grow the economy.\n\nYet, the economy is still the top issue for Democrats, even in the face of new terrorist attacks on American soil. To listen to the Democrat candidates on Saturday, one would think that the economy has become steadily weaker and more unequal over the last several years.\n\nWhile that is definitely true, it does exactly make for a ringing endorsement of Barack Obama nor his policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats Rail Against Democratic Obama's Record", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Democrats Rail Against Democratic Obama's Record", "title": "Democrats Rail Against Democratic Obama's Record", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-502025626-DEM-DEBATE.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/20/democrats-rail-democratic-obamas-record/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats Rail Against Democratic Obama's Record", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-502025626-DEM-DEBATE.jpg", "title": "Democrats Rail Against Democratic Obama's Record", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Martin O'Malley", "published_time": "2015-12-20T18:03:36-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "According to the Democrats, Obama\u2019s time in the White House has done little to reshuffle the economic deck to benefit Americans.\nThe Great Recession officially ended in early 2009, just months after President Obama took office.\nYet, the economy is still the top issue for Democrats, even in the face of new terrorist attacks on American soil.\nEven though President Obama only enjoyed two years with his party in control of both houses of Congress, Republicans haven\u2019t rolled back any of Obama\u2019s policies.\nI\u2019m running for president because I\u2019m going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires."}
