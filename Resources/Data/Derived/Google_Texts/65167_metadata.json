Coburn and asked him questions covering his friendship with President Obama, to practicing medicine, and Medicare reform.\n\nCoburn, an OB/GYN by trade, said that he recently filled in at a friend\u2019s practice, but he would never go back into medicine:\n\n\u201cI would never go back and practice medicine the way it is today, never. I\u2019d have to be a concierge doctor. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d play the game they\u2019re having to play. It\u2019s just so much work that doesn\u2019t help a patient.\u201d\n\nHe was also very critical of the Affordable Care Act, saying \u201cit is the most screwed-up system in the world\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable to the country as a whole, unless [people] have a subsidy. Healthcare doesn\u2019t have to be screwed up the way it is. Healthcare was doing really well until the government got involved.\u201d\n\nCoburn didn\u2019t pull any punches when commenting about career politicians, whom he said are more interested in elections than the \u201cbiggest issues,\u201d which is why he says Washington won\u2019t reform Medicare:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally tied to people who are in Congress for a career. If they truly were patriots, they would have fixed Medicare already. Common sense would say, if you\u2019re up here and this is the biggest problem, why don\u2019t you fix the biggest problem? They\u2019re more interested in elections than they are in fixing the health of the country. That\u2019s the disgusting part of Washington, that\u2019s part of the reason I left.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Coburn joined the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research as part of their \u201cProject FDA,\u201d which aims to reform the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCoburn has no additional plans to re-enter the political arena, nor has he issued a 2016 presidential endorcement yet. His biggest worry is new, unfunded tax liability:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried about who the president is going to be 20 months from now, but we\u2019re not worried about the $6 trillion unfunded liability.\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s talking truthfully to the country about the significance of our problems.\u201d\n\nCoburn says that what he enjoys most about no longer being in Congress is finally having his time to himself.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"Nobody's talking truthfully to the country about the significance of our problems.\"", "published_at": "2015-04-21T08:51:00+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"Nobody's talking truthfully to the country about the significance of our problems.\"", "title": "Former Senator Tom Coburn Says Career Politicians Are a Big Reason He Left DC, Calls It 'Disgusting'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coburn1.jpg", "height": 428}, "updated_time": "2015-04-21T10:19:31-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/04/301282-former-senator-tom-coburn-says-career-politicians-reason-left-washington-disgusting/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"Nobody's talking truthfully to the country about the significance of our problems.\"", "creator": "@chrisenloe", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coburn1.jpg", "title": "Former Senator Tom Coburn Says Career Politicians Are a Big Reason He Left DC, Calls It 'Disgusting'", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Enloe", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-21T08:51:00-04:00", "wp-categories": "14087 482 1471", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/04/301282-former-senator-tom-coburn-says-career-politicians-reason-left-washington-disgusting/", "wp-category-slugs": "health, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-04-21T08:51:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-21T10:19:31-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chrisdenloe"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/coburn1.jpg", "post_id": 301282, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebcf\"", "article_summary": "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In a recent interview with The Washington Examiner, former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, who spent 16 years in Congress, said one of the reasons he left Washington is career politicians.\nCoburn has no additional plans to re-enter the political arena, nor has he issued a 2016 presidential endorcement yet.\nThat\u2019s the disgusting part of Washington, that\u2019s part of the reason I left.\u201dAfter leaving Congress, Coburn joined the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research as part of their \u201cProject FDA,\u201d which aims to reform the Food and Drug Administration.\nCommon sense would say, if you\u2019re up here and this is the biggest problem, why don\u2019t you fix the biggest problem?\nThe Examiner\u2019s Healthcare reporter, Paige Cunningham, sat down with Sen.
