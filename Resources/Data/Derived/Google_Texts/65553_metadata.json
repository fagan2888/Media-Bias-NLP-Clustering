She sang the pop hit \u201cMaigo no Kokoro.\u201d\n\nBackground: The KWLA World Language Showcase and Competition is a day-long event designed to showcase students\u2019 communicative and intercultural competencies that are aligned with state, national and international standards.\n\nOther Japanese language division winners from Eastern High School:\n\nJohn Ballard \u2013 2nd place \u2013 film \u201cThe Horse from Shanghai\"\n\nEmma Garness \u2013 3rd place \u2013 painting \u201cYoshitsune\u201d\n\nWhy she wanted to enter: Tanisha has been studying Japanese for two years, and she is very interested in traveling to Japan. She said she doesn\u2019t consider herself a singer, and she\u2019d thought at first she might enter a piece of artwork, but she really liked the song, which is the theme for a show she\u2019d seen online. She said the title of the song translates to \u201cMy Lost Heart.\u201d\n\nThe day of the competition: She said there were judges for about 10 different languages, and that she was first interviewed in Japanese by her judge and then she performed her song for him. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t understand the question, you could say so, in Japanese, and you were graded on that,\u201d she said, adding that she was nervous at the beginning of her performance but that half way through she started feeling better and said it was fun.\n\nAfter the performances there were different activities provided for the contestants, and she said her favorite parts were learning about a Chinese musical instrument and participating in a French dialogue.\n\nWhy she likes Japanese: She said she plans to continue studying Japanese and hopes to study other related languages such as Korean and Chinese. Her interest in languages began when her mother suggested she might pursue a career as a translator. She said she is interested in Japanese culture as well, explaining that she likes the level of respect found in the culture, citing examples such as their practice of removing their shoes in the house, bowing when they meet people of more experience and how they speak respectfully to each other.\n\nTanisha\u2019s home life: Tanisha divides her time living with her mother Terea Scruggs who lives in Hurstbourne, and her father Jeffrey Boston, who lives in Douglass Hills. She has an older sister, a younger sister, a younger brother, and twin baby sisters.\n\nTeacher Quote: Teacher Elena Kamenetzky thinks that Tanisha is extraordinary because \u201cshe has not only the motivation but the courage to really push her own boundaries. It takes a lot of courage to compete in a state language competition as a first-year Japanese student, let alone to sing in a second language in front of total strangers!\u201d\n\n\n\nFuture plans: Tanisha plans to attend college and possibly study abroad. \u201cAfter high school, I want to travel all over the world and see places I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nShe enjoys: reading, writing, listening to music\n\nMEET THE ACHIEVER\n\nAchiever: Tanisha Boston\n\nAge: 15\n\nGrade: 10\n\nSchool: Eastern High School\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1R5JMlf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "She said she plans to continue studying Japanese and hopes to study other related languages such as Korean and Chinese.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "She said she plans to continue studying Japanese and hopes to study other related languages such as Korean and Chinese.", "title": "Eastern student takes Japanese language honors", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/01/03/eastern-student-takes-japanese-language-honors/77977454/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She said she plans to continue studying Japanese and hopes to study other related languages such as Korean and Chinese.", "title": "Eastern student takes Japanese language honors", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0ba69580faa6a9c40306f3ec8bf83593bed84285/c=0-280-720-1000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Eastern student takes Japanese language honors", "author": "Elaine Rooker Jack", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dae9b31b37e13444caa446258e80f57ed8c45526/c=0-160-720-1120/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d6d3d719c6905709e94147690e77a05ac4f09b44/c=0-280-720-1000/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e3715a802aab1cef0aee023f6397740e860e7a8/c=0-369-720-910/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cbdf785a33d7770fea4418b94266cace61375e36/c=0-437-720-844&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-03T16:46:52.393000-05:00", "shorthed": "Eastern student takes Japanese language honors", "articleid": 77977454, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e91448d3274c04c801d21978876004e3341fdd08/c=0-437-720-844/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cfb8a96049a514190f8564a956d36a6101c1ecb/c=2-0-719-1280/local/-/media/2015/12/29/Louisville/Louisville/635869950050367211-PHOTO-20151018-173520.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Tanisha Boston (Photo: Provided)Achievement: Tanisha Boston won first place at the Japanese language division of the 2015 Kentucky World Language Association State Showcase at Centre College in April.\nIt takes a lot of courage to compete in a state language competition as a first-year Japanese student, let alone to sing in a second language in front of total strangers!\u201dFuture plans: Tanisha plans to attend college and possibly study abroad.\nOther Japanese language division winners from Eastern High School:John Ballard \u2013 2nd place \u2013 film \u201cThe Horse from Shanghai\"Emma Garness \u2013 3rd place \u2013 painting \u201cYoshitsune\u201dWhy she wanted to enter: Tanisha has been studying Japanese for two years, and she is very interested in traveling to Japan.\nWhy she likes Japanese: She said she plans to continue studying Japanese and hopes to study other related languages such as Korean and Chinese.\nShe sang the pop hit \u201cMaigo no Kokoro.\u201dBackground: The KWLA World Language Showcase and Competition is a day-long event designed to showcase students\u2019 communicative and intercultural competencies that are aligned with state, national and international standards."}
