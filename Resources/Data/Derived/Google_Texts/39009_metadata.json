He showed me what keystrokes to use to see how my money would grow in a hypothetical situation, one where I was able to fully fund my IRA (which back then had a $2,000-a-year annual contribution limit) annually from that age forward. He then showed me how to \u201cstress test\u201d it. We ran the calculations for various different potential rates of return.\n\nWhen I saw what a huge difference something as seemingly small as an incremental 1% or 2% increase in returns could make, I was hooked! Suppose I had started contributing $2,000 a year to my IRA at age 18 from summer jobs, and kept that up until age 65. Over those 47 years, I would have seen my nest egg rise in nominal dollars to $356,000 at a 5% return, $482,000 at a 6% return, and $658,000 at a 7% return.\n\nMy first reaction was to think: \u201cWow, if you can find an investment with just a consistently one- to two-percentage-point higher return, look at the enormous difference it will make.\u201d This is the kind of thinking that often leads \u201cactive\u201d oriented investors to pursue either growth, value or momentum strategies. I was no different.\n\nFor the first 20 years of my investing life, I was focused on the elusive search for alpha\u2013that magical point where you are earning an incremental return above and beyond that commensurate with the level of risk you are taking.\n\nIn my 40s, I\u2019ve done a complete, 180-degree turn and am now committed to squeezing out that extra percentage point or two by employing an investment philosophy defined by its tax-efficiency (due to low portfolio turnover), low cost (due to the use of index-like funds and ETFs) and, most importantly, its roots in a written investment policy statement (IPS). A written IPS helps keep the natural human emotions of fear and greed from causing a knee-jerk reaction to market movements that could further eat away at hard-earned returns.\n\nMy first lesson about compounding and the impact that seemingly small differences in annual returns can make over time was very powerful. Once I shifted that insight from focusing on things I couldn\u2019t control (chasing increasingly elusive alpha) to the intersection of the things that I can and the things that matter (like keeping fees and taxes low, and my actions pre-defined in a written IPS) I moved from mere knowledge to truly useful implementation of that wisdom.\n\nManisha Thakor (@ManishaThakor) is director of wealth strategies for women at Buckingham and The BAM Alliance, a community of independent registered investment advisers.\n\nRead the latest Big Issues in Personal Finance Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "When I was quite young, somewhere around age 11, my dad sat me down with his HP 12C calculator.", "title": "How My Investing Philosophy Changed in My 40s", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/03/05/how-my-investing-philosophy-changed-in-my-40s/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HG287_calcul_P_20150305072311.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "How My Investing Philosophy Changed in My 40s", "description": "When I was quite young, somewhere around age 11, my dad sat me down with his HP 12C calculator.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "When I was quite young, somewhere around age 11, my dad sat me down with his HP 12C calculator.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-05T12:26:33-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/03/05/how-my-investing-philosophy-changed-in-my-40s/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-5229", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "When I was quite young, somewhere around age 11, my dad sat me down with his HP 12C calculator.", "title": "How My Investing Philosophy Changed in My 40s", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/03/05/how-my-investing-philosophy-changed-in-my-40s/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HG287_calcul_P_20150305072311.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-5229", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-05T14:18:55-05:00"}, "article_summary": "A written IPS helps keep the natural human emotions of fear and greed from causing a knee-jerk reaction to market movements that could further eat away at hard-earned returns.\nManisha Thakor (@ManishaThakor) is director of wealth strategies for women at Buckingham and The BAM Alliance, a community of independent registered investment advisers.\nMy first lesson about compounding and the impact that seemingly small differences in annual returns can make over time was very powerful.\nSuppose I had started contributing $2,000 a year to my IRA at age 18 from summer jobs, and kept that up until age 65.\nWhen I saw what a huge difference something as seemingly small as an incremental 1% or 2% increase in returns could make, I was hooked!"}
