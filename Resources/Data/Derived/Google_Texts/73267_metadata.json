Very few, however, know exactly how much of the cost their health insurance is supposed to cover.\n\nMany birth-control methods, especially emergency measures, are expensive out-of-pocket. Morning-after pills can cost up to $90. IUDs can cost between $500 to $900.\n\nWith the advent of Obamacare, obtaining and paying for birth control has become even more bewildering. The conversation this year isn\u2019t just about \u201cyes or no\u201d to birth control, but an exact taxonomy of which types are acceptable. In its Hobby Lobby decision, the US supreme court ruled that \u201cclosely-held\u201d for-profit companies can claim a religious exemption to avoid including all forms of contraception in their employees\u2019 health plans. Pills? Okay. IUD? Not allowed.\n\n\n\nThe Hobby Lobby decision was controversial; the court\u2019s female justices, led by Ruth Bader Ginsberg, rejected it. The Affordable Care Act mandates \u2013 at least we all thought it did \u2013 that insurers must provide access to all forms of contraception without charging a co-payment. Yet women are still working out the financial implications of birth control. The Obama administration issued guidelines in response to the supreme court ruling, detailing how religious exemptions would work and seeking feedback at the same time.\n\nThe Guardian provides this explainer and guide to some of the most important questions. We welcome contributions from readers in the comments.\n\n\n\nWho does the supreme court ruling on Hobby Lobby affect?\n\nAs of now, it certainly affects women employed by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood \u2013 the two companies that brought and won the case. Both said they objected to covering at least four specific methods of birth control \u2013 Plan B and Ella, both of which are pills and emergency contraceptives, and \u201ccertain\u201d intrauterine devices, or IUDs. These were singled out because they are believed to prevent the \u201cimplantation of a human embryo after its fertilization,\u201d which is morally outside the beliefs of the companies\u2019 founders. Scientists dispute whether that\u2019s how an IUD really works, however.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby decision also affects women employed by for-profit companies. These companies are demanding and, in some cases, getting a preliminary injunction \u2013 basically, a stay \u2013 allowing them to opt out of covering contraception until the case is fully resolved. A full list of these companies is available here.\n\nThe ruling could affect many more women enrolled in employee health plans because nearly 100 cases, involving for-profit and nonprofit companies and similar to the one brought by Hobby Lobby, are pending in federal courts across the country.\n\n\n\nSome of those companies, such as Michigan-based Autocam and Eden Foods, and Ohio-based Freshway Foods are objecting to all preventive advice, including counseling and education on birth control.\n\n\u201cNow that is what I call a loophole,\u201d said Judy Waxman, vice-president for Health and Reproductive Rights at The National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cAt least for the moment [these companies] can just opt out.\u201d\n\nCoverage could vary from excluding certain contraceptives to all of them, depending on the company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Hobby Lobby decision also affects women employed by for-profit companies.

Under the Affordable Care Act, health plans in the marketplace and those offered by employers must cover all forms of contraception without charging a co-payment or deductible. The trick here is in the word \u201cforms\u201d: it covers each birth control method but not every product.\n\nOnly religious institutions \u2013 such as churches, synagogues, mosques \u2013 are technically exempt from this rule. If their employees require birth control, those women must seek coverage outside of their employee plan.\n\nNonprofits, such as Catholic universities or religiously affiliated charities, are only exempt from paying claims for contraceptive services. Instead, they seek an \u201caccommodation\u201d \u2013 they fill out a Labor Department form, which makes the insurance company or a third party administrator responsible for paying their employees\u2019 claims for birth-control coverage.\n\nIn fact, the supreme court\u2019s majority opinion in the Hobby Lobby case refers to the \u201caccommodation\u201d as an alternative option for providing contraceptive coverage without co-payments.\n\nThe Obama administration said in a statement that their primary goal was to ensure that, despite religious exemptions, women can access contraceptive coverage under the ACA without co-payments. The new rules seek to offer the \u201caccommodation\u201d to \u201cclosely held\u201d for-profit companies like Hobby Lobby so the insurers or a third-party can bear the cost of coverage.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that accommodation solve the problem?\n\nNot exactly.\n\n\n\nFor one, it\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of corporations are eligible for this \u201caccommodation\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what happens if a nonprofit objects to the accommodation\u201d said Kara Loewentheil, director of Public Rights/ Private Conscience Project, a think-tank that studies religious exemptions from federal and state laws.\n\nThe latest guidelines suggest it is for closely held companies, which are not publicly traded on a stock exchange like NYSE or Nasdaq, and whose ownership will be \u201cconcentrated among a certain number of owners.\u201d This is a proposal, however, and the administration is soliciting comments, which would help decide the appropriate number of owners or percentage of ownership.\n\nThe supreme court interpreted the term \u201cclosely held\u201d to mean family-owned companies, though Justice Ginsburg objected in her dissent that means \u201cits logic extends to corporations of any size, public or private.\u201d\n\n\n\nSecond, the accommodation itself is under threat. Around 50 of the 100 cases pending in courts involve nonprofits that are challenging the accommodation.\n\n\n\nWheaton College, a Christian college in Illinois, argued to the supreme court that it is exempted from having to file an \u201caccommodation\u201d with the insurance company. The supreme court issued a temporary order agreeing with Wheaton.\n\n\n\nWheaton\u2019s argument: they don\u2019t want to give permission for birth control in any form. The exemption form, which allows them to authorize a third party to pay for their employees\u2019 birth control, is still infringing on their religious beliefs by requiring them to sign on to employee requests for coverage, even if the college isn\u2019t paying. The college now has to notify the government, which, in turn, will authorize the insurance company. The only difference is the college administration will not actually sign the form.\n\nThe administration has already conceded this option in the latest rules. Nonprofits who don\u2019t even want to touch the issue of birth control can notify the Department of Health and Human Services, which then will inform the insurer or third-party administrator.\n\n\n\nStill, many of these cases are still pending, and legal experts think that several of them will object even to this \u201cfix.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because they may consider notifying the government to be no different from filing a form with the insurer. They are still enabling coverage for contraception, which would still be a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on their religious beliefs.\n\nThe trouble with the Hobby Lobby decision, Loewentheil said, is that it doesn\u2019t say exactly up to what point these companies can exercise their religious freedom.\n\n\n\nSo, although the majority opinion mentions the accommodation as an option, the temporary order granted to Wheaton College allowed the accommodation to be challenged.\n\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear if these companies, whether for-profit or nonprofit, would be allowed to opt out anyway \u2013 or only if they have triggered an alternative process.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the logic of the opinion to put the line anywhere at all,\u201d said Loewentheil. \u201cBut an exemption that leaves a woman without coverage is completely at odds with the intent of the ACA.\u201d\n\nThat is, it would defeat the crux of the ACA\u2019s contraceptives mandate \u2013 to enable women to access birth control through their insurance plan at no additional cost.\n\nPlan B was singled out in the Hobby Lobby case because it is believed to prevent the \u2018implantation of a human embryo after its fertilization,\u2019 by the company.

None of this applies to you if you are enrolled in an employee plan offered by religious institutions that are completely exempt (like churches, synagogues, or mosques).\n\nAccording to the ACA, all health plans in the marketplace must provide the \u201cfull range\u201d of contraceptive services, ensuring that each method (barrier, hormonal, implanted devices) includes an option without co-payments.\n\n\n\nSo insurance companies typically distribute the drugs and devices across different tiers (or what they call formularies) based on cost. The cheapest tier would include generic drugs without co-payments and the most expensive tier would have specialty or brand-name drugs.\n\nIf you directly purchased your plan in the marketplace, you should not be charged a co-payment for generic contraceptives. You should also not be charged a co-payment for a contraceptive if its generic equivalent is unavailable. For instance, there are three brand-name IUDs on the market and no generic versions. According to the ACA, your health plan should not exclude this method or ask you to share the cost. The same applies if your doctor says a generic drug or device is \u201cmedically inappropriate\u201d for you. You are then eligible for the brand-name version without co-payment.\n\n\u201cThe doctor calls our pharmacy service center, where we enter an override into the customer\u2019s record so the customer can receive the brand contraceptive at no cost,\u201d said Mark Slitt, Cigna\u2019s public relations manager. He added that health plans under the ACA are \u201crequired\u201d to provide the brand-name versions in such a situation.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not always how it works, however. As NPR has reported, it\u2019s common for insurers to require co-pays even for birth control that should be covered. Be prepared to argue your case at considerable cost and time.\n\n\n\nWhat if I am being charged a co-payment despite being eligible for one of the above?\n\nFirst, make sure you\u2019re not enrolled in a \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plan \u2013 one that was already around by March 23, 2010.\n\nThese plans are not required to cover preventive services (such as contraception) without co-payments.\n\n\n\nNext, make sure your doctor is in your plan\u2019s network. Some plans don\u2019t cover services provided by \u201cout-of-network\u201d doctors.\n\nIf you still believe you\u2019re being charged a co-payment in violation of the ACA, you can contact your state Department of Insurance or Department of Labor, depending on the plan. You can also get in touch with The National Women\u2019s Law Center or use their guide.\n\nAnd you\u2019re not alone. Although out-of-pockets payments among privately insured women dropped between late 2013 and mid-2104, according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, women continue to be charged co-payments in violation of the ACA.\n\n\n\nThe number of women using birth control pills without a co-payment jumped from 15% to 40%. Among vaginal ring users, it nearly doubled. But, the study pointed out, the numbers hardly changed among women who used injectables or IUDs. Although there are no generic versions of IUDs, women are still being charged co-payments for the brand-name versions.\n\nPart of the problem is awareness. \u201cWe are finding like everything else in this law, it\u2019s taking a lot of time for the information to get through,\u201d said Waxman.\n\nBut women\u2019s groups say insurance companies are also to blame.\n\n\n\n\u201cInsurers require women to use the cheapest method first and have that not work for her before approving a more expensive method,\u201d said Susan Levy, executive director at the Boulder Valley Women\u2019s Health Center in Colorado.\n\nMany of the center\u2019s clients are women who are low-income but don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. Oral contraceptives, such as pills, are relatively cheap but, Levy said, they are not the best option for her patients: \u201cThey work odd shifts. They have tons of reasons why taking a pill every day is hard.\u201d While long-term methods like IUDs are more suitable, they are also more expensive. In the meantime, Levy said, low-income women are being exposed to an \u201cunintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s glass half-full, glass half empty,\u201d said Pearson. \u201cWe would like [HHS] to do more. Possibly communicate directly to the insurers that the administration knows they have been trying to slide around the simple interpretation of the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Hobby Lobby case created bewilderment around birth control, used by 99% of American women of childbearing age.
