But BlueCross BlueShield\u2019s overall business ended 2015 in better shape financially than the year before.\n\nBlueCross, like a lot of other big insurance companies, is figuring out how to muddle through while a small part of its business bleeds a large amount of money.\n\nLess than 10 percent of its customers buy insurance on the Obamacare exchange or directly from BlueCross. But losses related to that more than doubled last year to $282 million.\n\n\"While our Affordable Care Act or ACA business lost more than last year,\" Chief Financial Officer Gerald Petkau said, \"BlueCross and BlueShield of North Carolina ended 2015 with an improved net income of half a million dollars, largely due to better results in other lines of business and investment income.\"\n\nMost people get insurance through their employer, and that part of BlueCross\u2019 business grew slightly last year. BlueCross also offers Medicare Advantage plans (essentially private insurance on the government\u2019s dime) and that business improved considerably.\n\nGeorgetown University researcher Sabrina Corlette says nationwide, the employer and government parts of the business tend to be the most reliable for insurance companies.\n\n\"Where there\u2019s this lack of stability and uncertainty is in the Obamacare markets,\" she says. \"But that\u2019s not unexpected. A new market is going to take some time to settle down and stabilize.\"\n\nThat\u2019ll happen when companies get closer to a sweet spot with premiums, where they\u2019re high enough to cover the cost of people\u2019s care, but low enough to attract customers.\n\nPetkau, BlueCross\u2019 CFO, says the company raised average premiums 33 percent on the exchange this year.\n\n\"We\u2019re optimistic that that\u2019ll help us turn this around,\" he said. \"But really there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. We\u2019ve just started the year. So we really have little clarity about what 2016 will look like.\"\n\nPetkau emphasized that BlueCross is doing everything it can to stay on the Obamacare exchange. But he says the company will reassess late this summer whether that still makes business sense.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "North Carolina\u2019s dominant insurance company had even deeper losses on the Obamacare exchange last year.
