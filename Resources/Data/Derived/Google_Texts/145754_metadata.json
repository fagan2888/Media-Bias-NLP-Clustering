Erlichman wedding, which included Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand among the invitees.\n\nNeither made it; Dion had a commitment in France and Streisand was a late dropout. \u201cSomething about flying,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nDeMartino is the daughter of Anna DeMartino, Dion\u2019s personal manager, and Erlichman is the son of Streisand\u2019s longtime manager, Martin Erlichman. Their reception was held on the stage at Reynolds Hall at The Smith Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe stars of the Bellagio wedding were groom Pankaj Malani, 31, and bride Avnie Patel, 29, a physician\u2019s assistant.\n\nOne of the most iconic Las Vegas photos was taken in the 1950s when Frank Sinatra, dressed in an Arabian costume, christened the Dunes by riding a camel on what is now the site of the Bellagio.\n\nThe logistics for the Bellagio wedding were as staggering as the cost:\n\n\u25a0 According to Cooper, a charter jet flew about 200 of the 600 guests into town from Houston, where it all started, Cooper said. Six buses and two limos delivered the charter flight guests to the Bellagio.\n\n\u25a0 The tab for the floral arrangements alone for the poolside wedding ceremony came to about $150,000.\n\n\u25a0 The 47-year-old elephant named Tai cost $10,000 to rent and was transported from Have Trunk Will Travel, based in Perris, Calif. Well-known for its appearances in numerous films, it is known as \u201cHollywood\u2019s biggest star.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Friday\u2019s party at Boulevard Pool at The Cosmopolitan cost about $500,000, according to Cooper. Guests also celebrated at Hyde Bellagio, which overlooks the dancing fountains, and in Marquee nightclub\u2019s library room. Brunches were held at the Bellagio\u2019s Jasmine and Prime restaurants. All of the above were buyouts.\n\n\u25a0 A 10-tier cake created by Bellagio pastry chef Jean-Philippe Maury required two weeks to construct. It was in the shape of a temple.\n\n\u25a0 The groom had to take out a lot of insurance due to the potential risks involving the elephant. Engineers had to conduct a study to see if the Bellagio driveway could support the weight of the elephant.\n\nSIGHTINGS\n\nJackie and Tito Jackson, backstage with Meatloaf after taking in his Rocktellz &Cocktails show at Planet Hollywood Resort on Saturday.
