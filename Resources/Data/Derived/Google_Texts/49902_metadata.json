Sadly, during this time of seeming abundance, child hunger is actually at its worst.\n\nLow-income children who rely on school breakfast and lunch programs for nourishment during the school year are often left without enough to eat. In New Jersey, 453,125 children received free or reduced school lunch meals in 2014, yet only 18.3 percent \u2015 53,096 children\u2015were able to access a summer feeding site on a typical summer day.\n\nResearch has found that children consume up to 50 percent of their total daily calories at school during the school year. Many low-income families struggle to fill that gap when school is out, which is why summer is the hungriest time of the year for low-income food insecure children.\n\nThe Mercer Street Friends Food Bank is doing our part to combat summer hunger. We sponsor four summer feeding programs in Trenton and Hamilton through the federally funded Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) \u2015 summer feeding as it is commonly called. SFSP reimburses qualified organizations, such as the Mercer Street Friends Food Bank, for providing nutritious meals and snacks during summer break when low-income children lose access to free and reduced-price school meals. The meals are served at sites such as summer programs, summer school, parks and recreation centers, summer camps, and youth centers. The sites are located in low-income areas or serve primarily low-income children. The vast majority of sites offer learning, enrichment, and/or recreational activities in addition to nutritious meals.\n\nAs a SFSP sponsor, Mercer Street Friends contracts with a New Jersey Department of Agriculture approved food service vendor to prepare and deliver meals to the sites. The Food Bank designs the menu, ensuring that the meals are nutritious and offer some variety.\n\nMercer Street Friends and other charities are doing our part to try to close the summer hunger gap by operating summer feeding programs in our community. But there is no way we will be able to reach the 81.7 percent of kids not being served without greater flexibility in how we reach kids in the summer. We need to continue strong national standards and accountability while providing new program models that local communities can tailor to best meet their circumstances.\n\nProgram regulations say the only way we can feed children is if they consume a meal on site, but our community could protect far more children from hunger if local nonprofits were allowed greater flexibility and different options for getting food to kids. Instead of requiring that children travel to a site each day to eat a meal, what if families received a grocery card to purchase the food they need in the summer so they can prepare meals at home, or what if the food bank sent kids home with several days' worth of meals once a week? These tested and proven program options would strengthen and complement the existing model and allow us to reach more kids who cannot access a summer meal site.\n\nCongress has a unique opportunity to give communities more summer feeding options when they rewrite child nutrition programs this year.\n\nAmong the bills under consideration is \"The Summer Meals Act of 2015\" (S613/H.R. 1278), introduced by Senators Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Representatives Don Young (R-AK) and Rick Larsen (D-WA).\n\nIf passed, the legislation would:\n\nIncrease the number of sites and children able to receive meals by lowering the area eligibility threshold. Currently, a site can participate in the Summer Food Service Program if 50 percent or more of children in the area quality for free or reduced school meals. The bill would lower the area eligibility threshold to 40%, enabling many more community organizations to run summer feeding and reach more hungry children.\n\nStreamline the paperwork and allow schools and other organizations to be cross-eligible for both summer meals and afterschool meals and snacks. This reduces the administrative burden for programs that feed low-income children year-round.\n\nAllow sites to serve two meals and a snack or a third meal and close meal gaps for children of working parents who are in programs or summer school all day.\n\nMercer Street Friends hopes you will join us in making the summer hunger gap a top priority for our congressional delegation. We encourage you to contact your US Senator and Member of Congress and urge them to vote in support of The Summer Meals Act of 2015.\n\nPhyllis Stoolmacher is the Acting Director of the Mercer Street Friends Food Bank.\n\nFollow The Times of Trenton on Twitter @TimesofTrenton.
