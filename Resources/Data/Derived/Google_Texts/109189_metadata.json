Loren Hart.\n\nThe ice bucket challenge, which raises money for ALS awareness, has swept across the country in recent weeks on social media. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have all been flooded with videos of famous faces and thousands of people dumping ice cold buckets of water on themselves for a good cause, then nominating others to do the same.\n\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d Hart continued. \u201cFirefighters generally like to help people and it felt good to represent the city and to help in this worthwhile cause.\u201d\n\nPete Frates, a former Boston College baseball star who has ALS, helped inspire the ice bucket challenge with his wife, Julie, and fellow ALS patient, Pat Quinn.\n\nIf you don\u2019t complete the challenge within 24 hours, you\u2019re supposed to donate $100 to your choice of ALS charities.\n\nThe ALS Association has raised close to a whopping $4 million in donations compared to the $1.12 million it raised during the same time period last year, according to the organization\u2019s website.\n\nMichael Strahan challenged his GMA family to complete the challenge. And as part of the challenge\u2019s guidelines, it had to be completed within 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Jersey City\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted out yesterday that Firefighter Anthony DelFino was one of the locals to participate in the segment.\n\nOthers from the Jersey City Fire Department participating in the challenge were Battalion Chief Steven McGill, as well as firefighters Buddy Hayes, Greg Petillo, Frank Manzo, Gregg Allan, Andrew Delfino, Jason Grecco and Kevin Nally.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "bayonne,jersey-city", "title": "Jersey City's  Bravest participate in Ice Bucket Challenge on 'GMA' for  ALS awareness", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jersey City\\u0027s  Bravest participate in Ice Bucket Challenge on \\u0027GMA\\u0027 for  ALS awareness\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/jersey_citys_bravest_on_gma_fo.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/jcfd-gmajpg-d0a17285cda3107a.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13658491\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-16T07:00:44Z\", \"author\": \"The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@hudson-county\",\"bayonne\",\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/15632195-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The Jersey City Fire Department was on hand yesterday morning in Central Park when the Good Morning America team took on the ALS ice bucket challenge. \nWith huge smiles on their faces, the Jersey City firefighters assisted in dumping the buckets on some of the ABC anchors and news correspondents&#8217; heads, including Sara Haines, Ginger Zee, Lara Spencer, Tory Johnson and David Muir.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, August 16, 2014,  6:03 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/jcfd-gmajpg-d0a17285cda3107a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njojjournal\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1834731\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Jersey City Fire Department was on hand yesterday morning in Central Park when the Good Morning America team took on the ALS ice bucket challenge. \nWith huge smiles on their faces, the Jersey City firefighters assisted in dumping the buckets on some of the ABC anchors and news correspondents&#8217; heads, including Sara Haines, Ginger Zee, Lara Spencer, Tory Johnson and David Muir.", "title": "Jersey City's  Bravest participate in Ice Bucket Challenge on 'GMA' for  ALS awareness", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/jersey_citys_bravest_on_gma_fo.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 16, 2014, 10:24 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The Jersey City Fire Department was on hand yesterday morning in Central Park when the Good Morning America team took on the ALS ice bucket challenge.
