No one expects them to publish a full budget or lengthy white papers with detailed legislative plans. But even by the loose standards of presidential campaigns, Donald Trump is setting a new low for vacuous rhetoric.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters are drawn to him in part because they think he tells it like it is, unlike other politicians. But on the budget, as with trade and immigration, he is telling voters what they want to hear, even though it is not true, just as most conventional politicians have been doing for decades.\n\nTrump wants to come across as a deficit and debt hawk. He has said repeatedly that the nation\u2019s governmental debt is an indication of the incompetence of current and previous elected leaders. He rails against the budget deal struck between outgoing House speaker John Boehner and President Obama because it increased appropriations spending on defense and domestic programs in 2016. He hasn\u2019t exactly promised a balanced budget, but he has said federal debt is a major problem he would address as president.\n\nTrump\u2019s other statements and positions, however, make it clear that he\u2019s not inclined to implement a genuine conservative budget but is more likely to fall into the kind of procrastination and excuse-making that has led to today\u2019s massive deficits and debt. What Trump implicitly promises is a closing of the gap between federal revenue and spending without any pain for ordinary voters. He claims that better management, led by him, is all it will take. It is the worst kind of wishful thinking and deception.\n\nOn entitlements, Trump is essentially in agreement with most Democrats. He says he won\u2019t make any changes to Social Security or Medicare benefits. In previous years, he also said Medicaid shouldn\u2019t be cut. He says he now favors converting Medicaid into a block grant to the states, although he has not promised that this switch would reduce federal costs.\n\nIt is not possible to address the nation\u2019s fiscal challenges while protecting, now and in the future, entitlement spending \u2014 unless you are willing to impose massive tax hikes, such as those President Obama proposes.\n\nIn 1970, combined federal spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid was 3.7 percent of GDP. Today, spending on these programs, plus the new subsidies for insurance under Obamacare, accounts for more than 10 percent of GDP. And spending on these programs will reach 14.2 percent of GDP by 2040 unless they are changed to reduce their costs.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s answer to the growing problem of entitlement spending is simple: more revenue. Over the past fifty years, federal revenue has averaged 17.7 percent of GDP. Tax hikes implemented during the Obama years would already push revenue up to 19.4 percent of GDP by 2040. But the president and his supporters want to raise taxes even more to cover the rising costs of entitlement programs.\n\nTrump says he disagrees. He has proposed a tax cut of at least $10 trillion over the coming decade. But he has often said that he has no problem raising taxes on hedge-fund managers and other well-to-do Americans who he believes can and should pay more. Faced with massive deficits, and with a commitment not to touch entitlements, it is a safe bet than a President Trump would find raising taxes to solve the problem a very tempting proposition. And a lot of Democrats in Congress would concur.\n\nTrump is for repealing Obamacare. But repeal of Obamacare would actually increase federal deficits unless the spending cuts in Medicare are left in place. And repeal will not be possible without a credible replacement plan, especially since Trump promises he will \u201ctake care of everyone.\u201d (So far, Trump\u2019s health-care proposals are little more than meaningless talking points.) A real replacement plan would cost less than Obamacare, but the savings would not be sufficient to close the large deficits projected for the coming years and decades.\n\nTrump has also said he will find savings elsewhere in the budget. When pressed to be more specific, his answer is always the same: elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse. This is the most tired, canned answer in the book. Every politician who wants to pretend he\u2019s serious about cutting spending without actually cutting spending resorts to denunciations of unspecified waste in the budget. The only surprise is that Trump hasn\u2019t yet said he will also cut congressional pay and foreign aid.\n\nPreviously, Trump said he would find $300 billion in annual savings by negotiating down the prices Medicare pays for prescription drugs. This is, itself, problematic, given that such spending only amounts to $80 billion per year. But Trump seems now to have dropped the idea from his health-care plan, instead proposing to allow the importation of drugs at prices set by nationalized health systems. The latter proposal would probably reduce federal spending, but only by very small amounts.\n\nThe picture that emerges from Trump\u2019s various statements on budgetary matters is not encouraging. Voters have heard him promise repeatedly that he would cut taxes and make no changes whatsoever to entitlement programs. This is certainly one reason he is popular with some voters. When pressed on how he would reconcile these commitments with large and growing deficits, he promises to target drug companies, rich people, and unspecified wasteful spending.\n\nIn other words, he gives answers that sound pretty much like what President Obama would say in response to the same questions.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "On many policy matters, Trump gives answers that sound much like what President Obama would say in response to the same questions.", "title": "The Trump plan: Big tax hikes or big deficits - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/trump_plan_big_tax_hikes_big_deficits_obamacare_health_care_2016_gop_032516_500x293.jpg", "url": "https://www.aei.org/publication/the-trump-plan-big-tax-hikes-or-big-deficits/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential candidates are given a lot of running room by voters and most journalists when it comes to policy pronouncements.
