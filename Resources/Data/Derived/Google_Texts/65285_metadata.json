All of us created somewhat of a sisterhood; we even have our own group text.\u201d\n\nMiss Greenville Daja Dial, who was competing for her fifth straight year, was ultimately crowned Miss South Carolina 2015.\n\n\u201cI would have probably chosen everyone,\u201d Ruiz said of her personal winner. \u201cAll of the girls were so talented.\u201d\n\nShe said the most nerve-wracking part of the pageant process last week was \u201ctalent practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of performing in front of all of the other girls scared me more than actually performing in front of the entire state of South Carolina,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nBefore the state pageant started, Ruiz said she was most nervous about the interview portion of the competition. With the Supreme Court announcing several decisions last week in relation to the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage, and Gov Nikki Haley calling on state lawmakers to remove the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, Ruiz said she was hoping to get some of those controversial questions.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I enter these pageants is so that my voice can be heard,\u201d she said. \u201cI already had my opinion formed about those controversial topics. I wish I could remember what they asked. It\u2019s so hurried and you\u2019re nervous. I do remember them asking me about my platform, which is urban sprawl.\u201d\n\nRuiz said she doesn\u2019t know if she will compete in another preliminary pageant for the Miss South Carolina system this year.\n\n\u201cBut you will definitely be seeing more of my face!\u201d she said. \u201cMy plan for the rest of the summer is just to take a small break to just get my mind right for freshman year of college (Central Carolina).\u201d\n\nShe said she is grateful to Clarendon County for its support.\n\n\u201cNo one knows how much it truly means to know that so many people are on your side,\u201d she said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Manning Live", "description": "Miss Clarendon 2015 Ariana Ruiz didn\u2019t make the finals for Miss South Carolina, but she did win the media award from the state pageant.
