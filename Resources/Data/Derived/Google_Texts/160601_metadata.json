But HSA contributions are allowed for employees enrolled in limited-purpose FSAs to pay only dental, vision and preventive care expenses.\n\nUnder the recent guidance, the IRS said employees can carry over $500 from their general-purpose FSA and keep their ability to contribute to an HSA. It provided three ways that can happen:\n\n\u2022 An employee with a general-purpose FSA can carry over unused balances to the next plan year to a limited-purpose FSA.\n\n\u2022 Employers can design general-purpose FSAs so unused balances automatically carry over to a limited-purpose FSA the next year.\n\n\u2022 And employers can allow employees to decline or waive a carry-over from their general-purpose FSA, allowing employees to contribute to an HSA the next year.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\n\u201cThis is very useful guidance,\u201d said Janet LeTourneau, director of compliance services at FSA and HSA administrator WageWorks Inc. in San Mateo, Calif.\n\n\u201cThe guidance is about as clear as it gets,\u201d said A. Scott Sims, a senior vice president with Aon Hewitt in Washington.\n\nThe guidance comes as some employers have switched from grace-period to carry-over FSAs.\n\n\u201cEmployers are embracing carry-over FSAs,\u201d said Ms. LeTourneau, noting that without the \u201cdreaded\u201d use-it-or-lose-it requirement, employee usage has increased.\n\nThat can benefit employers, since FSA contributions are made with pretax dollars, reducing the amount of employees' salary subject to FICA tax, which is paid equally by employers and employees. Employers typically have used the resulting FICA tax savings to help pay the overhead associated with offering FSAs.\n\nBut others aren't so sure that employers will convert their grace-period FSAs to carry-over FSAs. One reason is that employees who know they face large health care-related expenses early in the next plan year could be worse off, since they would have at most $3,000 to use with a carry-over FSA vs. $5,000 with a grace-period FSA.\n\n\u201cThose employees would be disadvantaged,\u201d said Jay Savan, a partner at Mercer L.L.C. in Atlanta.\n\nWith a carry-over FSA, \u201cuse-it-or-lose it is eliminated, but at a price,\u201d said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants L.L.C. in Secaucus, N.J.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\nIn addition, pending IRS clarification, the carry-over approach could saddle employers with additional administrative expenses. That is because even if employees stop contributing to their FSAs, the balance would be carried over year after year.\n\nAs a result, employers and administrators would have to track small amounts of money for extended periods of time, said Amy Bergner, managing director of human resource solutions at PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. in Washington.\n\nAt least one big employer has decided to keep its current FSA offering.\n\n\u201cWe are sticking with a grace-period FSA,\u201d said Gregg Nevola, vice president of total rewards at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. \u201cWe want to offer employees maximum flexibility in how they can use their FSAs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the future of all FSAs \u2014 regardless of their design \u2014 is growing murkier due to the growth of HSA-linked high-deductible health plans, where HSA balances can be rolled over indefinitely.\n\nIn addition, the health care reform law's so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d plan tax puts the future of FSAs in doubt.\n\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a 40% excise tax will be imposed on health insurance premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage effective in 2018. That calculation must include employees' FSA contributions.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\n\u201cYou will see reduced employer interest in FSAs as the Cadillac tax nears,\u201d said Mercer's Mr. Savan.\n\nAs employers attempt to stay below the Cadillac tax limit, \u201cFSAs could be the first to go,\u201d said Andy Anderson, a partner specializing in employee benefits at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius L.L.P. in Chicago.\n\nChanges also could be in the offing, experts say, in the way employers offer HSAs. Employers could redesign their HSAs so employees would make after-tax contributions to the HSA. Employees still would receive a tax deduction for the contribution, but it would be excluded in calculating premium costs for excise tax purposes, Ms. Bergner said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Internal Revenue Service guidance resolves how to integrate health savings accounts with carry-over flexible spending accounts, but employer interest in carry-over FSAs appears limited.The guidance, while welcomed by experts, comes as the future of FSAs in general is cloudy due to the health care...", "title": "Flexible spending accounts' future uncertain as health care rules evolve - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20140413/NEWS03/304139979", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20140413/NEWS03/304139979/AR/0/flexible-spending-account-annual-carryover.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Internal Revenue Service guidance resolves how to integrate health savings accounts with carry-over flexible spending accounts, but employer interest in carry-over FSAs appears limited.The guidance, while welcomed by experts, comes as the future of FSAs in general is cloudy due to the health care...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Flexible spending accounts' future uncertain as health care rules evolve - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "Internal Revenue Service guidance resolves how to integrate health savings accounts with carry-over flexible spending accounts, but employer interest in carry-over FSAs appears limited.\nIn addition, the health care reform law's so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d plan tax puts the future of FSAs in doubt.\nWith a carry-over FSA, \u201cuse-it-or-lose it is eliminated, but at a price,\u201d said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants L.L.C.\n\u201cEmployers are embracing carry-over FSAs,\u201d said Ms. LeTourneau, noting that without the \u201cdreaded\u201d use-it-or-lose-it requirement, employee usage has increased.\nBut others aren't so sure that employers will convert their grace-period FSAs to carry-over FSAs."}
