Cynthia Jackson recalled, people from across religious lines gathered at a North Hills church to speak out after a spate of cross burnings in the area.\n\n\u201cIt was saying, \u2019We will not have that in our community,\u2019\u201d said Rev. Jackson, a Presbyterian minister from Richland. So when she heard of menacing online comments directed against a Richland mosque, she joined an interfaith coalition to deliver the same message.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of all of us to speak up and make sure everybody is safe,\u201d she said Friday at the Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh in Richland.\n\nShe and several members of NORTH (Neighboring Organizations Responding Together for Hope) gathered at the relatively new mosque after its weekly Friday afternoon prayer service to talk about their ongoing efforts at cooperation.\n\nThe action comes as Muslim organizations locally and nationally are reporting numerous cases of bias and mosque vandalism following the deadly attacks in Paris and San Bernardino perpetrated by terrorists claiming the mantle of Islam \u2014 even as Muslim leaders have repeatedly denounced such attacks as un-Islamic.\n\nLocal Muslim leaders are calling the shooting of a Muslim cab driver in Pittsburgh a hate crime, although police are still investigating that aspect of it.\n\nCalls by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to ban Muslim immigrants, and by several political leaders to refuse entry to Syrian Muslim refugees, have further stoked religious tension.\n\nThe threats to the Muslim Association actually began in the summer, when it sponsored a booth at a Richland community event and received an email from a man telling Muslims to get out of \u201cmy country\u201d in boxes, preferably dead.\n\nWhen members of the interfaith group heard of a similar message arriving in early November, they stepped up their support. On Sunday, when the mosque holds religious education, some members of the coalition stood vigil outside, hoping to help create a sense of security there.\n\nTheresa Orlando of Shaler said she told the members, \u201cWe\u2019ll be your security.\u201d\n\nThe mosque, which has occupied a plain one-story building for the past year and a half, drew about 100 people to the prayer service Friday, and it typically draws more than 80 to classes on Sunday. It has become a hub for the small but growing numbers of Muslims in the North Hills, many of them professionals and their families.\n\nMosque members said they appreciated the support \u2014 and also weren\u2019t surprised, saying the township and the vast majority of their neighbors have welcomed them.\n\n\u201cThis is who we are as Americans,\u201d said Aleem Gangjee of Hampton.\n\nSeveral mosque members agreed, adding that local Muslims has often been involved in under-the-radar volunteering such as providing Thanksgiving turkeys to needy families and other activities, and by supporting other beleaugered minorities.\n\nMr. Kokan said mosque officials are working with local police on security issues.\n\nHe said \u201cwe need to be vigilant\u201d about threats and hate speech.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the next generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is now.\u201d\n\nMosque member Nadia Khawaja of Pine cited a recent Pew Research Center survey showing that anti-Muslim sentiment is highest among people who don\u2019t know Muslims personally. Once they do, she said, they realize they have much in common.\n\nMr. Gangjee added that the mosque also works to educate its young people before they can be enticed by incitement propaganda by groups such as the so-called Islamic State.\n\nFor such groups, \u201chuman life is of no consequence,\u201d he said, which is \u201ctotally against Islam.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe convey to youth that human life is sacred and needs to be protected at all costs,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Smith: petersmith@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1416; Twitter @PG_PeterSmith.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several members of a group called NORTH gathered Friday at a mosque in Richland to talk about ongoing cooperative efforts.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Decades ago, the Rev.
