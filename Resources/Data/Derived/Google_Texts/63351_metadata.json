But when a pacemaker's battery dies, the whole apparatus wastefully has to be replaced.\n\nLucien Monfils/Wikimedia The human heart is the ultimate timepiece. And yet it's not always the most reliable one. So an estimated one million people per year get back-up systems, pacemakers, implanted to restore the heart's rhythm when it falters. If you don\u2019t have a pacemaker, it\u2019s likely you know someone who does. The procedure is common but invasive. Doctors make an incision in the patient\u2019s chest, and guide a wire through the vein and into the heart. The device at the other end of the wire is secured under a flap of skin created from the incision. It's common for patients to spend a night in the hospital after getting a pacemaker implantation, which is overwhelmingly considered safe. There are very few deaths attributable to pacemaker implantation. \"If you're cynical, you say it's because the companies then couldn't sell a new pacemaker every 5 to 12 years.\" Most of the patients who get pacemakers are older than 60, but since pacemakers usually don't last much longer than a decade, plenty of people find they outlive their devices and have to get new ones implanted. Why should they have to?\n\nWe have rechargeable batteries for all kinds of devices these days\u2014smartphones, laptops, flashlights, drills, vacuum cleaners, portable speakers, etcetera, etcetera\u2014so why not find a way to recharge the device that's arguably the most essential one a person can have? \"The answer to that question is that we used to have them,\" said Hugh Calkins, a professor of medicine and director of the Arrhythmia Service at Johns Hopkins Hospital. \"There were rechargeable pacemakers back in the '70s, and they got rid of them. If you're cynical, you say it's because the companies then couldn't sell a new pacemaker every 5 to 12 years.\" But it's not that simple, Calkins says. More on that in a minute. First, a look at the device itself. There are a few different kinds of pacemakers but here's the basic gist: A pacemaker consists of battery-powered computerized generator that's usually about the size of a matchbook and is connected to the heart with wires. The wires are tipped with sensors that monitor the heart's electrical activity, transferring data back to the generator. If that data reflects an abnormal heart rhythm, the generator sends electrical pulses through the wires to get your heart lub-dubbing properly again. The team that carried out the first successful implantation in the U.S. developed a plutonium-powered pacemaker that would last for 30 years. But nuclear-powered pacemakers were impractical. The whole thing is implanted in your chest: Wires are attached to the heart, but the generator is implanted just below the surface of the skin, usually pretty high up on one side of your chest. Pacemakers have come a long way since their early development about a century ago. Cardiologists in the 1930s designed portable hand-crank generators that were hooked up to current-interrupting devices that would deliver electric current to the heart via\u2014brace yourself for this\u2014a really long needle, according to a 2010 paper about the history of the device. But it would be decades before surgeons in the United States successfully implanted a pacemaker in a human patient.\n\nThat happened June 6, 1960, in Buffalo, New York. The patient, a 77-year-old man, lived for another year and a half as a result of the device. (A patient in Sweden had a pacemaker implanted in 1958, but the device failed after three hours. That patient subsequently had to have 21 separate pacemaker implantations.) In the early days, pacemakers were bigger\u2014about the size of a pack of cigarettes in 1960\u2014and the procedure was riskier. Even as implantation became more common, the devices also had a shorter lifespan, lasting only about a year or two. Reliable batteries were such an issue in the early days that scientists obsessed over ways to make them last longer, including working to develop rechargeable pacemaker batteries. The same team that carried out the first successful implantation in the United States developed a plutonium-powered pacemaker that would last for 30 years. But nuclear-powered pacemakers were impractical. Plutonium is toxic, and disposal of nuclear devices would have been a huge issue. Often when researchers worked on making rechargeable pacemakers in the 1970s, they did so with children in mind. Although the vast majority of pacemaker recipients are older than 60, there is a small population of much younger patients outfitted with pacemakers. In 1965, scientists developed a rechargeable pacemaker that could last up to three months without being charged, according to a paper in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery from that year. Even today, a baby born with congenital heart disease might need a pacemaker early on, and would have to get a new one implanted again and again over the course of his life. In 1993, there were 121,000 pacemaker implantations in the United States. Last year, about 320,000 people got pacemakers. These days, pacemakers last anywhere from about five to 12 years using lithium-iodine cell batteries. Implanting the device is often considered a routine procedure for the growing population of patients who get them. In 1993, there were just over 121,000 pacemaker implantations in the United States, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Last year, about 320,000 people got pacemakers, according to device-maker Medtronic\u2014that's an increase of more than 60 percent over two decades.\n\nMore people getting pacemakers translates to more business for companies like Medtronic, which says it makes half of the world's pacemakers. But Calkins, the doctor at Hopkins, says requiring new pacemakers every 10 years isn't about protecting financial interests through planned obsolescence. The thing is: A decade is a really long time in medical years. \"And the reality is, every time your pacemaker runs out, you don't just replace the battery,\" Calkins told me. \"You replace the whole pacemaker. You may say, 'This seems fairly wasteful. Why don't we just put in a new Duracell battery?' But there are always advances in pacemakers. The technology keeps getting better. They are smaller, they last longer, they have more of an ability to communicate with programmers.\" In other words, pacemakers may seem outdated battery-wise, but they're actually heading in the same direction as most wearable gadgets: Data-driven and responsive to the behaviors of the person who is wearing\u2014or in this case implanted with\u2014the device. Some pacemakers already have responsive capabilities. They can be set to recognize when a person's working out\u2014so they'll automatically keep her heart beating at, say, 155 beats per minute while she jogs. \"Pacemakers are just sort of a safety net, if you will,\" Calkins said. \"[They set the rate] below which your heartrate can't go any slower, in case our own body's pacemaker's is starting to get sluggish.\" Related Story The Man Who Would Teach Machines to Think Activity-specific heart-rate programming is standard with today's pacemakers. But Mike Hess, device president of research and development for the pacemaker division at Medtronic, says the pacemaker of the future will be even more sophisticated. Scientists are looking for more useful applications for the huge trove of data that pacemakers collect about people implanted with them. The idea is to figure out how that data\u2014coupled with data from other monitors and devices\u2014might contribute to more comprehensive understanding of a person's health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The device that lives in millions of people&#39;s chests and keeps their hearts on beat has come a long, fascinating way since the 1930s.
