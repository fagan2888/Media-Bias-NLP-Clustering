Not the economy? Not Obamacare? Not the Supreme Court? Not terrorism? Taxes? Immigration?\u201d But reactionary forces have a weird way of rearing their hideous heads, promulgating the oddest, seemingly strangest notions and muscling their way into the spotlight.\n\nThis preoccupation with gender and toilets may seem uniquely 21st century in its theater-of-the-absurd way, but the North Carolina law\u2014and statutes like it\u2014meant to restrict restroom access to certain groups of oppressed people is hardly new. A bit of historical digging turns up a sad, illuminating history: In the fight for civil rights, segregationists warned of the dangers of blacks and whites sharing the same facilities, arguing that integration would bring with it toilet seats and towels acting as disease vectors\u2014or, to put it plainly, that white people would catch syphilis from African-Americans. Hiding in plain sight behind this propaganda was the conviction that black men would lurk in stalls to molest white women, the specter of interracial relations being at the heart of the Ku Klux Klan philosophy for a century.\n\nSo persistent was this horrid canard that when Little Rock Central High School was forcibly integrated in 1954, one white student purportedly stated that \u201cMany of the girls won\u2019t use the restrooms at Central, simply because the \u2018N*****\u2019 girls use them.\u201d The 1964 Civil Rights Act finally made separate-but-equal accommodations illegal, stating unequivocally that: \u201cAll persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.\u201d\n\nBut that law was alas not the final salvo in the toilet wars. In the 1970s fight to enact the Equal Rights Amendment, Phyllis Schlafly, head of the right-wing Stop ERA lobby, included in her platform the threat that passage of the ERA would result in mixed-sex bathrooms. (At least Schafly wasn\u2019t recommending going back to the bad old days of the 19th century, when public facilities were erected for men only, and little ladies were considered too dainty to ever do anything as nasty as relieving themselves in public. This meant you had to either use something called a bordalou\u2014a chamber pot shaped like a gravy boat\u2014or duck into an alley, employing your long skirts as a shield.)\n\nThe ERA never passed, and the struggle for full equality goes on. But this doesn\u2019t mean that justice and righteousness won\u2019t eventually win out! After all, who could have imagined, even a very few years ago, the attorney general of the United States speaking out so strongly for transgender rights? But there was Loretta Lynch last Monday, declaring: \u201c. . . No matter how isolated or scared you may feel today, the Department of Justice and the entire Obama administration wants you to know that we see you; we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. Please know that history is on your side . . . It may not be easy\u2014but we\u2019ll get there together.\u201d\n\n(Thanks to Gillian Frank, whose post on the blog Notches: (Re)Marks on the History of Sexuality, provided some of the material above.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "toilet laws, north carolina toilet laws, both gender toilets, gendered bathrooms, north carolina bathroom, bathroom laws", "author": "Lynn Yaeger", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "description": "The North Carolina law\u2014and statutes like it\u2014meant to restrict restroom access to certain groups of oppressed people is hardly new.", "title": "The Sad, Illuminating History of Toilet Laws", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1240, "identifier": "http://media.vogue.com/r/pass/2016/05/16/bathroom-laws-met-gala-2016-cass-bird.jpg", "height": 822}, "url": "http://www.vogue.com/13436802/history-of-toilet-laws-north-carolina/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Vogue", "description": "The North Carolina law\u2014and statutes like it\u2014meant to restrict restroom access to certain groups of oppressed people is hardly new.", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "image": {"src": "http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/16/bathroom-laws-met-gala-2016-cass-bird.jpg"}, "title": "The Sad, Illuminating History of Toilet Laws", "site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=http://www.vogue.com/13436802/history-of-toilet-laws-north-carolina/, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "template": "article", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vogue"}, "keywords": "Culture, toilet laws, north carolina toilet laws, both gender toilets, gendered bathrooms, north carolina bathroom, bathroom laws, mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Culture", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Sad, Illuminating History of Toilet Laws\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.vogue.com\\/13436802\\/history-of-toilet-laws-north-carolina\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/media.vogue.com\\/r\\/c_1,h_560,w_560\\/2016\\/05\\/16\\/bathroom-laws-met-gala-2016-cass-bird-560x560-1463415997.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"13436802\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-05-16T16:21:22Z\",\"section\":\"Culture\",\"authors\":[\"Lynn Yaeger\"],\"tags\":[]}", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width", "description": "The North Carolina law\u2014and statutes like it\u2014meant to restrict restroom access to certain groups of oppressed people is hardly new."}, "article_summary": "After all, who could have imagined, even a very few years ago, the attorney general of the United States speaking out so strongly for transgender rights?\nIf anyone had told you a few months ago that the subject of restrooms and transgender rights would actually become an issue in the upcoming election, you would have scoffed and said: \u201cWhat?\nIt may not be easy\u2014but we\u2019ll get there together.\u201d(Thanks to Gillian Frank, whose post on the blog Notches: (Re)Marks on the History of Sexuality, provided some of the material above.)\nPlease know that history is on your side .\nImmigration?\u201d But reactionary forces have a weird way of rearing their hideous heads, promulgating the oddest, seemingly strangest notions and muscling their way into the spotlight."}
