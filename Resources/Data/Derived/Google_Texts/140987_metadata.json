Ted Gaines, who has run his family insurance business for 30 years, believes Jones has put too many regulations on the industry, keeping companies from operating in California.\n\n\u201cWe have to make the insurance market more competitive,\u201d said the 56-year-old Roseville resident. The insurance commissioner \u201chas to be a neutral party, someone who has a stick, but who also has the carrot. (Jones) has been all stick.\u201d\n\nGaines was more blunt in a written interview with the Western Insurance Agents Association earlier this year.\n\nJones\u2019 \u201cpower-grabbing support for rate control over health insurance would choke off the supply of medical care,\u201d Gaines told the group.\n\nOpposes health law\n\nGaines is a critic of the Affordable Care Act and has sued Covered California, the state\u2019s new health insurance exchange, for its efforts to implement President Obama\u2019s signature legislationand what he says are excessive costs and a lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think (insurance) should be a mandate,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cPeople should be allowed to decide on their own\u201d how much health insurance they need and what it should cover.\n\nGaines also opposes apair of November ballot measures, Proposition 45, which would allow the insurance commissioner to regulate health insurance rates, and Proposition 46, which would raise the cap for noneconomic damages in malpractice suits and force some doctors to submit to random drug testing.\n\nProp. 45 backer\n\nJones has endorsed both measures and is one of the main backers of Prop. 45.\n\nThat measure \u201cputs the regulation of the health insurance industry in the hands of one person,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cIt grants too much power to a politician.\u201d\n\nJones, a former assemblyman who began his career as a legal aid attorney, said Gaines\u2019 objections show the candidates\u2019 contrasting approaches to the insurance commissioner\u2019s job.\n\n\u201cI come from consumer advocacy and he comes from the insurance industry,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe believes most if not all regulations should be done away with.\u201d\n\nProp. 45 is needed to stem the surge of double-digit rate increases California consumers have suffered over the past decade, Jones said. It would simply give the commissioner the same rate regulation power over health insurance that he already has over auto, property and casualty insurance, he added.\n\n\u201cWhy is car insurance and home insurance more important than health insurance?\u201d Jones asked.\n\nCheck the ads\n\nJones also dismissed Gaines\u2019 charge that insurance companies are shying away from California.\n\n\u201cIf you watch late-night TV, you\u2019ll see the lizard, the lady in white, the guy at the insurance college and lots of smaller companies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Jones insists he doesn\u2019t have an adversarial relationship with the insurance industry, he said health insurers have been charging excessive rates and that some have recently reduced premiumsfor purely political reasons.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that (the insurance companies) pushed prices back to prevent an outcry at the polls in November,\u201d he said.\n\nThe battle over the two insurance-related initiatives could be Gaines\u2019 best hope for a November upset. He finished second to Jones in the June primary, 53 percent to 41 percent, and as of June 30, the cutoff date for the most recent state campaign finance reports, he had about $50,000 in his campaign account, compared with Jones\u2019 almost $2 million.\n\nHuge war chest\n\nBut the insurance industry, doctors, hospitals and others have raised nearly $100 million to defeat the two insurance-related initiatives, and a Field Poll this month showed voter sentiment turning against the measures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly an uphill struggle,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cBut this is a year when you will see a lot of money spent on insurance issues and ... there will be a lot of people in opposition to Jones\u2019 position.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates don\u2019t disagree on everything. Both want to battle insurance fraud, agree that the insurance industry affects every person and business in California and that keeping that industry healthy is important for the state\u2019s future.\n\n2 approaches\n\nHow to get there, though, is the question.\n\nGaines sees his intimate knowledge of the insurance industry as a potential game-changer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helpful to have someone with experience in the industry in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider myself the ultimate consumer advocate because I\u2019ve had to address the needs of my clients.\u201d\n\nFor Jones, his lack of ties to the insurance industry is a plus for California.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who\u2019s independent,\u201d he said, \u201cwho\u2019s not a captive of the industry.\u201d\n\nJohn Wildermuth is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
