Really, not being able to get a handle on my own mental health concerns, and not really having a home. I felt discarded,\" Jones said. \"It was a true battle between myself, and discovering that self love, and that love of community that led me to today.\"\n\nAfter landing back on his feet, Jones teamed up with filmmaker Trent Soto to spread awareness of the Mayor's Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness by walking more than 200 miles from Pensacola to Tallahassee.\n\nTheir pit-stop Saturday included a visit to the Good Samaritan Veterans Network of Northwest Florida.\n\nAfter working at the Panama City Rescue Mission, network president Billy Fox said he saw veterans go down the same path Jones had once encountered.\n\n\"1 in 3 of the men at the mission were military veterans, and most of them were post-9/11,\" Fox said. \"They're young guys like Tim, who's going out and telling the story, and they are not like a regular homeless person. They were in good shape when they went into the military. Now they're broken, and they need some special attention.\"\n\nBut after finding his step, Jones says he and Soto want to give veterans hope by going the distance to help them get back on the right track.\n\n\"I didn't think I would be here today to even talk about this initiative,\" Jones said. \"This is not about one person or two people. This is about 5,100 just in the state of Florida that are homeless. And the fact that they have a voice.\"\n\nJones said they hope to reach Tallahassee as early as Monday.\n\nAs for Fox, he said the Good Samaritan Veterans Network of Northwest Florida accepts both monetary and other donations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Florida, about 5,000 veterans are homeless.
