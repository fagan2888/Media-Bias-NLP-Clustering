But it fails to direct relevant committees to implement most of these cuts.\n\nInstead, the \"reconciliation\" procedural instructions are focused exclusively on repealing Obamacare, the five-year-old Affordable Care Act. The document directs the two Senate committees and three House committees with jurisdiction over the law to find savings of at least $1 billion each.\n\nRepeal or replacement of Obamacare has long been a goal for Republicans, and budget procedural tools allow them to pass such legislation with only a simple majority in the Senate, rather than a nearly impossible 60-vote threshold.\n\nWhile Obama has vowed to veto any attempt to dismantle Obamacare, he may be forced to compromise with Republicans if a Supreme Court ruling in June strikes down the health insurance subsidy structure at the heart of the law.\n\nRepublicans were already claiming that they \"balanced the budget\" despite criticism it is loaded with accounting \"gimmicks.\"\n\nWhile it calls for repeal of Obamacare, the budget assumes that nearly $1 trillion in tax revenue from the law over 10 years would remain in place. It also nominally maintains the \"sequester\" caps on military and domestic agency spending but supplements defense funds by adding nearly $40 billion to an off-budget war operations account.\n\n\"There is no question this budget is far from perfect, but it is some progress since it has been a long time since the Congress has completed this basic part of governing,\u201d Corker said in a statement announcing his signature.\n\nAs reported by Reuters last week, the compromise budget excludes language incorporating Representative Paul Ryan's longstanding proposals to convert the Medicare health program for seniors to a system of subsidies for largely private health insurance [ID:nL2N0X725D].\n\n\"It sounds good. They said if we liked the first one, which I voted for, we'll like this one,\" Republican Representative John Fleming said after a closed meeting of House Republicans.\n\n(Reporting By David Lawder; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Lawder", "Author": "David Lawder", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans unveiled the first joint House-Senate budget plan in six years on Wednesday, aiming to boost defense spending, eliminate deficits by 2024 and ease a repeal of  President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law.", "title": "Republican budget seeks to boost defense spending, ease repeal of Obamacare", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150429&t=2&i=1044408308&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB3S0UN", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
