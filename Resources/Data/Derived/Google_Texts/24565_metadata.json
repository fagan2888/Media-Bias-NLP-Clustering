Sales were down 4 percent, and the profit margin fell by 40 basis points to 16.3 percent last year.\n\nLower prices in its health care-system business, including imaging equipment such as X-ray and magnetic resonance machines, were a key reason, according to its annual report.\n\nGovernment funding pressures, uncertainty related to Obamacare, market saturation, and pricing pressures all hindered sales growth, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Karen Ubelhart said.\n\n\u201cMargins were hurt by all of the above and cost pressures which GE was slow to respond to,\u201d she said via email.\n\nTo offset the decline in equipment sales, GE Healthcare is turning to data analysis services and its life sciences business, which sells products and services for drug research and bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\nThe company\u2019s digital business will enjoy the fastest growth as GE Healthcare seeks to integrate its installed equipment with software packages. Flannery expects at least 30 percent to 50 percent growth from GE Health Cloud, launched last year to develop the company\u2019s ability to operate its traditional imaging business in a cloud-computing environment.\n\n\u201cWe are really trying to move from being just a technology provider to being a partner with our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe software margins are very high, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Ubelhart said. While that segment of the business is too small to help the $18 billion GE Healthcare unit much now, \u201cgrowing at more than 20 percent, it could be meaningful in five years,\u201d Ubelhart said in an email.\n\nGE Healthcare also expects to sell more pre-made biopharmaceutical factories like the one the company just built in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It was shipped from Germany in September in 62 containers and assembled in eight days.\n\nA project like that will probably yield about $100 million in revenue over its lifetime and will generate further revenue as the company supplies consumable products for its operations, according to Flannery. He expects several more such projects in the next year or two at a minimum.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for this in China,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cWe have a very strong pipeline of interest.\u201d\n\nTo win market share in developing countries, the company has been developing products with more basic functions and lower prices.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.journalgazette.net/business/GE-Healthcare-boss-done-with-deals-13085940", "image": "http://journalgazette.net/assets/12985843/13112674.jpg", "description": "John Flannery built a reputation as a prolific rainmaker in his previous role as head of business development at General Electric Co., logg ...", "title": "GE Healthcare boss done with deals | Business | Journal Gazette"}, "google-site-verification": "AbTqmghA2tCfdbuL0B2fOMXCOi7JkbHReQTb0TYk_b0", "description": "The Journal Gazette, as Fort Wayne and northeast Indianas largest newsgathering operation, is your best source of local news, sports, business, dining and entertainment information as well as comprehensive auto, home, jobs and classified ads.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "__sync_contentCategory": "Free"}, "article_summary": "The company\u2019s digital business will enjoy the fastest growth as GE Healthcare seeks to integrate its installed equipment with software packages.\nGE Healthcare also expects to sell more pre-made biopharmaceutical factories like the one the company just built in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\nTo offset the decline in equipment sales, GE Healthcare is turning to data analysis services and its life sciences business, which sells products and services for drug research and bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing.\nThe company offers a wide range of products and services, including ventilators, software and tools to support drug manufacturing.\nWhile that segment of the business is too small to help the $18 billion GE Healthcare unit much now, \u201cgrowing at more than 20 percent, it could be meaningful in five years,\u201d Ubelhart said in an email."}
