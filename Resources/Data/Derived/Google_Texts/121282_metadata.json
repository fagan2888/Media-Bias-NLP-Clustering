NGMC officials said they spent an estimated $40 million with vendors and contractors in the regional service area, with more than 60 such businesses based Hall County.\n\n\u201cAn increase in complementary clinical and retail business is a natural progression from the opening of the hospital, and we expect more as the hospital grows,\u201d said Anthony Williamson, president of NGMC Braselton. \u201cLocal economic impact is something we have anticipated all along as we have planned for the opening of (the hospital).\u201d\n\nThe proposed mixed-use project does face an immediate hurdle to approval, however.\n\nHall County Planning Director Srikanth Yamala said while his staff is not recommending any changes to the residential component, the commercial proposal doesn\u2019t quite fit a \u201cplanned residential development\u201d re-zoning status because it\u2019s likely that a larger portion of customers for the retail center will not live on site.\n\nAccording to county staff reports, \u201cThis does not satisfy the intent of the commercial uses permitted within a PRD.\u201d\n\nYamala said he is recommending a smaller re-zoning designation, such as highway-business or office-institutional, for the commercial component.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/110040/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A proposed residential and commercial project along Friendship Road in South Hall could establish a trend for developers looking to piggyback on the opening this spring of Northeast Georgia Medical Center Braselton.", "title": "Mixed-use proposal follows opening of new hospital"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Mixed-use proposal follows opening of new hospital"}, "article_summary": "The Hall County Planning Commission will consider the proposal Monday.\nHe said the new hospital was the catalyst for the proposed development.\nThe residential component includes 139 assisted living and independent living units on close to six acres.\nThe economic benefit in Hall County has already been felt from the hospital\u2019s opening.\nThe commercial component includes up to 10,000 square feet of retail and office space on about three acres."}
