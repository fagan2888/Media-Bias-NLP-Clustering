Coming up tonight at 9, Piers Morgan opens his New York studio to entertainment icon and fellow countryman Barry Gibb, as the former Bee Gees star joins the program for a face to face, primetime interview.

The sole surviving member of the famed pop music group, the 67-year-old shares his feelings on outliving each of his male siblings, all of whom were his junior:

"I did mope around for a few months, good few months. And the whole family did. Nobody really knew how to deal with it all, because it's the loss of three brothers," says Gibb, referencing fellow Bee Gee's and twin brothers Maurice Gibb and Robin Gibb, who died in 2003 and 2012 respectively, as well as Andy Gibb, a solo performer who passed away unexpectedly in 1988.

"He was only 30 years old," explains Barry Gibb, speaking of Andy, whose death followed years of alcohol and drug use. "So it was all of that. And then we had to go through that valley, you know, the whole family. Even now, my mother is still, um, uh, one way or the other, she goes up and she goes down."

The Gibb matriarch is still alive, well into her 10th decade, as is the oldest sibling, a sister, named Leslie.

"[She] lives in Australia and, uh, I think, the last count, [had] eight children. So she's keeping it all going in her way," notes Wednesday's guest, before offering a final sobering thought on the topic.

"Leslie, me and mum. And, uh, we have the memories now. We have the memories."
